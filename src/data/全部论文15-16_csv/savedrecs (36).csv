The aim of this paper is to evaluate effects of subsidies from programme Development, which was focused on rising small and medium company competitiveness. Method Benchmark and method Per se were created for this purpose. Analyses confirm that subsidies are drawn by companies with above average rate of competitiveness. On the other hand, competitiveness of these subsidised companies (measured by eight financial indicators) was ostensibly decreasing after drawing the subsidy. The cause for this fact can be found in Czech accounting legislation which creates a dilemma for company managers. Research results show that managers of subsidized companies have probably chosen conservative strategy the above average EBIT (created thanks to the subsidy) hold in liquid assets and use it for necessary future reinvestment but formally worsen profitability ratios.","Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Sedlácek, M (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",milan.sedlacek@mail.muni.cz,"Sedláček, Milan/AAF-1097-2020",,,,,,28,2,2,1,15,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Beside conducting a survey to identify preferred management types, structured interviews were carried out together with secondary data analysis in order to explore potential problem sources in U-I relations.

The sector serves as the major employer of labour, source of income for smallholder farmers, non-oil foreign exchange earner, and food security. Therefore, the integration of agriculture with other sectors of the economy in the country in the present era of agribusiness is necessary. This contribution assesses some determinants of crop production in Nigeria, using OLS regression and Granger causality approaches. The OLS suggest that fertilizer consumption, cultivated land, loans and producer price index have a relationship with crop productivity in Nigeria. In the same fashion, the estimated results from the Granger causality/Block exogeneity Wald test based on a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model provides a bidirectional relationship running from fertilizer consumption to crop production. A unidirectional causality is confirmed between cultivated land and crop productivity in Nigeria. The results also signify a unidirectional causality between the farm gate price and agricultural fertilizer applications. The Nigerian government should create an enabling environment and provide or guaranteeing affordable loans to producers, continue to subsidize fertilizer and ensure that it is distributed to farmers at the right time. Farm expansion should be encouraged for full utilization of the abundant agricultural area for maximum and sustainable production, food security and market in the present era of agribusiness.","[Verter, Nahanga] Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Verter, N (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xverter@mendelu.cz,"Verter, Nahanga/E-4845-2018","Verter, Nahanga/0000-0002-5889-134X",,,,,18,0,0,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,510,518,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600059,0

Inter-city traffic, especially between the major metropolitan areas in North-west Europe has benefitted greatly from the investment in this network. This paper explores two issues: the impact on the intermediate areas between these major metropolitan areas and the creation of potential cross-border inter-regional services. The evidence shows how both levels of service and potential economic impacts have been much less pronounced in these intermediate areas. Such areas have been affected both by a failure to see greatly improved direct access to major cities other than within their own countries and a lack of new cross-border inter-regional services. The paper argues that the creation of the high-speed rail TEN-T has not met the primary objectives of reducing regional disparities in accessibility or reducing the effect of national borders on regional integration. To achieve this requires not just infrastructure provision but an appropriate regulatory framework for service provision and accompanying measures at the local level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The most important one was the diagnosis of creeping crises and their prevention, while the other was the direct and effective intervention in crises, when these could not be prevented. Over the years, the objectives of the institutions changed and their operation does not correspond to the formation of modern reality. In recent years, a debate has commenced regarding the effectiveness of the institutions and their role.

We find a positive relation between volatility and trading frequency and a negative relation between volatility and trade size. Consistent with the prediction of the search-based theory, the relations are much stronger for illiquid and risky bonds. Furthermore, both liquidity and credit risk become more important in times of stress and their effects are reinforcing. Results strongly suggest that search frictions and credit risk are important factors driving the relation between volatility and trading activity in the corporate bond market. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To this end, recent work has focused on mapping regions without access to places like supermarkets, often terming them 'food deserts'. Until recently, this work has not considered residents' mobility as facilitated by transportation systems, and even among those that do, few have considered alternative forms of transportation, like public transit, opting for automobile-oriented travel assumptions. This paper analyzes people's spatio-temporal constraints to accessing supermarkets, and focuses on the transit commuting population. Analysis of commute data from Cincinnati, Ohio shows there are a significant number of residents that have improved access to supermarkets when a grocery shopping trip is made on the way home from work, than if they were to depart from their home location. These results extend previous work showing relatively few automobile commuting residents have better access to supermarkets given their work locations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on the role of elasticity of substitution in production. Within the context of this paper, elasticity of substitution in production measures the degree of substitutability between capital and labour. By making use of a two-sector (low-tech and high-tech) general equilibrium model, this paper argues that differences in the degree of substitutability between capital and labour can also affect the size of factor inflow induced skilled-unskilled wage gap. Inflow of capital increases the skilled-unskilled wage gap as long as capital and labour can be relatively easily substituted in the low-tech sector. On the other hand, under the same scenario, inflow of either type of labour decreases the skilled-unskilled wage gap. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To better understand the challenge in distinguishing investors' beliefs from risk-adjusted discounting, we use Perron-Frobenius Theory to isolate a positive martingale component of the stochastic discount factor process. This component recovers a probability measure that absorbs long-term risk adjustments. When the martingale is not degenerate, surmising that this recovered probability captures investors' beliefs distorts inference about risk-return tradeoffs. Stochastic discount factors in many structural models of asset prices have empirically relevant martingale components.","[Borovicka, Jaroslav] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Borovicka, Jaroslav; Hansen, Lars Peter; Scheinkman, Jose A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hansen, Lars Peter] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Scheinkman, Jose A.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Scheinkman, Jose A.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; Columbia University; Princeton University,"Borovicka, J (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Borovicka, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,"New York University; Becker-Friedman Institute; National Science Foundation [0951576]; Columbia University; Princeton University; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0951576] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","New York University; Becker-Friedman Institute; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Columbia University; Princeton University(Princeton University); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Borovicka is with New York University and NBER, Hansen is with the University of Chicago and NBER, and Scheinkman is with Columbia University, Princeton University, and NBER.

The subsidies were awarded according to a ranking system that favored young, growing and productive firms with a strong cash flow, granting subsidies to the highest scoring firms until the depletion of funds. The nature of this allocation system creates a sharp cutoff in granting the subsidy according to the score, allowing us to estimate the causal impact of the subsidies using a regression discontinuity design. We find a positive effect on firm-level investment, employment, output and productivity for the firms that were granted the subsidy, but only for the small firms.

Such a demographic situation poses numerous macroeconomic and microeconomic challenges, with the former further amplified by Japan's high public debt level. This paper underscores the multiple criteria to consider in evaluating Japan's policies as it has approached this demographic tipping point. In examining Japan's macroeconomic policies as well as the specifics of its social insurance policy framework, it seeks to draw lessons relevant for countries confronting the prospect of an aged population, while recognizing the importance of viewing Japan's policies in the context of its unusual culture and history. The paper notes Japan's current initiatives to grapple with its recent years of anemic growth and with the fiscal and social challenges arising in an aged population. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile there has been significant growth in internet use and ownership of smartphones. Travel patterns are changing in tandem with adoption of digital age innovations. At a time when Britain is also poised to invest tens of billions of pounds in high speed rail, this paper examines how the experience of rail passengers has changed from 2004 to 2014. It draws upon questions concerning travel time use designed by its first two authors that have been included in the National Rail Passenger Survey waves conducted in Autumn 2004, 2010 and 2014, yielding over 80,000 survey responses in total. The data reveal an ongoing decline of paper-based materials accompanying travellers in the face of increasing adoption of digital alternatives. The latter can, for many, make their journey time experience better. However, the significant increase from 2004 to 2010 in the proportion of passengers considering their time use to have been very worthwhile has not continued on to 2014. This appears to be attributable (in part) to increased crowding and reduced passenger satisfaction associated with rising demand for rail travel. The paper sets out empirical insights, drawing them together in the form of a diagrammatic depiction of the interplay of factors involved in rail passenger experience. This depiction is then used to consider the implications for the future of rail travel. While mobile technologies appear to be placing more control of passenger experience in the hands of the passengers themselves, there remain important imperatives for the rail industry to support positive use of travel time.

J,"Olivari, J",,,,"Olivari, Jocelyn",,,Entrepreneurial traits and firm innovation,EURASIAN BUSINESS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Innovation; Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurial traits,SKILLS; PERSONALITY,"Entrepreneurial behavior is widely considered to be influenced by the interaction between skills and motivation. And because entrepreneurial behavior is viewed as a causal determinant of firm performance, given the context in which the venture is embedded, factors determining entrepreneurial behavior are expected to influence firm performance. The research questions explored in this paper are: Do entrepreneurial traits have a direct effect on firm innovation? and if so, Is there a specific entrepreneurial profile that makes firms more innovative? I use a representative survey of firms from Chile to examine whether owners' skills and motivations affect firm innovation. The survey collects information on both firm and owner characteristics, which allows us to put the entrepreneur back into the analysis of the determinants of firm innovation, a dimension that the related literature does not generally focus on. The survey also allows us to analyze the incidence of innovation in micro and small firms, which have been traditionally overlooked in the study of innovation, despite the fact that they represent the majority of firms in developing countries. The results from a probit model suggest that entrepreneurial traits are important in explaining firm innovation propensity, so any attempt to understand firm innovation should also take the characteristics of the entrepreneur into consideration. Furthermore, different entrepreneurial profiles are related to different firm innovation propensities, providing new evidence on the sources of firm heterogeneity. These results confirm the idea that not all entrepreneurs are the same and that some have particular traits that greatly affect the innovating performance of their ventures.","[Olivari, Jocelyn] UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Olivari, Jocelyn] Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Maastricht University; Inter-American Development Bank,"Olivari, J (通讯作者)，UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, Maastricht, Netherlands.;Olivari, J (通讯作者)，Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave, Washington, DC 20577 USA.",jolivari@iadb.org,,"Olivari, Jocelyn/0000-0001-7891-2833",,,,,34,16,19,3,41,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Evidence from privatization in a large emerging market,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; OWNERSHIP; PRODUCTIVITY; ENTERPRISES; IMPACT,"While privatization has long been a central pro-market strategy for promoting competitiveness, little is known about which aspects of this multilevel process impact firm performance. Agency theory predicts that privatization will improve firm performance due to changes in monitoring by shareholders, the incentives of management, and the political control of the government. Measuring how each of these three pathways impact firm performance separately is difficult, however, as most privatizations result in the transfer of both ownership and control to private investors, influencing several of these pathways at once. This article is able to circumvent this limitation by examining changes to firm performance from the minority privatization of Indonesian state-owned firms during whic\h firms experience only changes in monitoring, as majority state ownership and control remain the same. Difference-in-differences analyses suggest that changes to monitoring improve firm performance by 9-13%, controlling for cross-sectional, time-invariant, and time-varying firm characteristics, macroeconomic issues affecting all firms, selection issues, and considering several alternative hypotheses. Altogether, this article suggests that firm performance via privatization can improve through changes to monitoring alone, without implementing the costly organizational changes required by complete privatization or requiring that the state relinquish control of socially important firms.","[Poczter, Sharon] Cornell Univ, 310C Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Poczter, S (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 310C Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",sharon.poczter@cornell.edu,,,,,,,57,10,10,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

Urban policies aim to reduce commuting distances and improve commuting efficiency by supporting mixed land-use and job-housing balance. Many studies have addressed these issues by examining excess commuting at the aggregate level, and most aggregated measurements of excess commuting are based on home-to-work commuting flows between zones. However, residents' travel behaviour does not consist solely of rational attempts at minimizing commuting distances but is instead affected by commuting hours, the complexity of the commuting chain and the built environment. Thus, commuting efficiency must be studied at the individual or disaggregated levels. This paper examined individual commuting efficiency in suburban Beijing using a GPS-facilitated activity-travel survey and investigated the differences in commuting distance and route choice efficiency between morning and evening peaks. Notably, in so doing, we considered non-work stops, and also explored the impact of urban spatial factors in both residential and working areas on commuting efficiency using multilevel mixed effects generalized linear models. The findings suggest that there are significant differences in commuting distance and commuting efficiency between morning and evening peaks based on the nature of commutes. Residents working in city centres or with jobs near railway stations, with higher road network densities or with lower facility densities seem to be more adept at selecting optimal routes.

Despite the pervasive use of this terminology, empirical analyses are mostly based on a single country. The present paper contributes by investigating business owner survey data for the United States and 32 countries in Europe and Asia. We analyze the differences between business owners motivated by opportunity and necessity in terms of their (1) socioeconomic characteristics, (2) personality, and (3) perceptions of entrepreneurial support. Descriptive statistics reveal that the two groups of business owners have very different profiles along these three dimensions. Moreover, multinomial logit regressions indicate that the determinants of business ownership (versus paid employment) differ for opportunity and necessity business ownership. A specific result of the present study (covering all 33 countries) is that the probability of being an opportunity versus a necessity business owner is higher for male, younger, wealthier, proactive, and optimistic business owners. Furthermore, those who prefer being a business owner and those who have more favorable perceptions of financial start-up support are more likely to be an opportunity versus a necessity business owner.","[van der Zwan, Peter; Thurik, Roy; Hessels, Jolanda] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Verheul, Ingrid] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Thurik, Roy] Montpellier Business Sch, F-34185 Montpellier 4, France",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Montpellier Business School,"van der Zwan, P (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vanderzwan@ese.eur.nl,"Thurik, Roy/A-9386-2012","Thurik, Roy/0000-0002-0242-6908; Hessels, Jolanda/0000-0002-0865-3386; van der Zwan, Peter/0000-0003-2654-4367",,,,,86,198,226,8,62,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Unpredictability of product quality is a generic feature of cultural goods, including music, books and movies, so an infusion of new products holds the possibility of bringing not just low-appeal products but also new products that consumers find highly appealing. This paper explores the effects of reduced costs of production, promotion and distribution in the motion picture industry, asking four questions. First, we document substantial growth in the number of movies brought to market, particularly since the early 2000's. Second, we document growth in institutions by which consumers can discover new movies, many of which are produced outside of the major studios and not released in theaters. Third, we show that the new independent movies account for a growing share of commercially successful movies. Finally, we present evidence, based on both critical assessments and usage, that recent vintages are more appealing to consumers than earlier offerings. These findings on movies echo developments documented elsewhere for recorded music and books.","[Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Law, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jwaldfog@umn.edu,"Waldfogel, Joel/A-4916-2015","Waldfogel, Joel/0000-0002-8040-7227",,,,,19,19,25,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

Taking the stock price reaction to the tone of earnings press releases at earnings announcements into account, we argue that equity based incentives induce managers to inflate the tone. We further posit that the impact of tone on the abnormal stock returns at the earnings announcements depends on the magnitude of the equity-based incentives. Based on over 26,000 earnings press releases of S&P1500 firms between 2004Q4 and 2012Q4, we find that the tone of earnings press releases tends to be more positive when the managerial portfolio value is more closely tied to the firm's stock price.

These effects are stronger in countries with larger securities markets and more restrictive regulatory frameworks.

However, research thus far has focused mostly on tariff measures of import protection. We develop more comprehensive measures of trade policy that include the temporary trade barrier (TTB) policies of antidumping and safeguards; studies in other contexts have also shown how these policies can erode some of the trade liberalization gains that arise when examining tariffs alone. We examine the experiences of Argentina and Brazil during the formation of the MERCOSUR over 1990-2001, and we find that an exclusive focus on applied tariffs may lead to a mischaracterization of the relationship between preferential liberalization and liberalization toward non-member countries. First, any building block evidence that arises by focusing on tariffs during the period in which MERCOSUR was only a free trade area can disappear once we also include changes in import protection that arise through TTBs. Furthermore, there is also evidence of a stumbling block effect of preferential tariff liberalization for the period in which MERCOSUR became a customs union, and this result tends to strengthen upon inclusion of TTBs. Finally, we also provide a first empirical examination of whether market power motives can help explain the patterns of changes to import protection that are observed in these settings.","[Bown, Chad P.] Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bown, Chad P.] CEPR, London, England; [Tovar, Patricia] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Lima, Peru",Peterson Institute for International Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",cbown@piie.com,"Tovar, Patricia/AAH-9020-2019","Tovar, Patricia/0000-0002-2014-0081; Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,"Thanks to Antoni Estevadeordal, Caroline Freund, and Emanuel Ornelas for making available their tariff data, and to Alessandro Nicita, Marcelo Olarreaga and Peri Silva for making available their estimated trade elasticities.

The unique features of the method are that it provides closed-form estimators and that it employs a generalized CAPM, which accurately takes into account that private equity returns typically deviate from a normal distribution. The methodology is validated using numerical examples and is applied to a comprehensive sample of 12,565 portfolio company investments by private equity funds.

While extant research would suggest democratic governments are better constrained to protect property rights, we are agnostic about this mechanism with respect to IPR. We argue IPR-distinct from physical property by their lack of geographical boundaries-are stronger in states not because property owners have a democratic voice, but because they can exit the state as an alternative. We test this argument using a newly constructed network variable that measures the degree of linguistic compatibility between states based on languages of education. We contend that the cost of exit is lower when the language of the intellectual property owner is widely used globally; and vice versa. This linguistic network variable improves on traditional common-language measures in that it considers the same language can be spoken in more than just a pair of dyads and that the education sector is an important arena for disseminating languages that need not be official. We find that (1) democracy has a weak and usually non-significant effect but (2) high linguistic compatibility has a strong and robust effect. The results call attention to the conceptual heterogeneity of property rights and the limited theoretical linkage between regime type and these bundles of rights. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In a laboratory-based field experiment, we extended collateral-free small loans to 485 currently married women in rural Bangladesh and observed their repayment decisions over multiple loan cycles. In a post-experiment survey, we asked subjects about their experience of spousal violence. We find that women who experienced physical or sexual violence in the last 12 months are more likely to strategically default on their loans relative to those who did not experience such violence. We conducted several robustness tests, and the results suggest that the negative correlation between victimization and loan repayment rates is unlikely to be explained by selection into victimization, non-random underreporting of violence, or the subjects' attitude toward risk.

Such an authority was recently established within the European Monetary Union, where the resolution power for large banks was transferred to a Single Resolution Board. To address this issue, we consider the risk incentives of a multinational bank in the presence of different resolution frameworks and determine the welfare efficient structure which prevents banks from excessive risk-taking. We argue that a single resolution authority is not always welfare-efficient, because it is the heterogeneity of bank resolution power which induces multinational banks to behave prudently. In severe solvency crises, the multinational authority should have the resolution power, whereas in less severe crises national resolution authorities are more efficient in avoiding excessive risk-taking on the part of multinational banks.

We find that fiscal rules are effective in reducing structural primary deficits at all levels of government efficiency. However, the effect is smaller as government efficiency increases, indicating that fiscal rules and government efficiency are institutional substitutes in terms of promoting fiscal sustainability. We also find that balanced budget rules are the most effective form of fiscal rules. Multiple fiscal rules are found to enhance fiscal solvency. Other institutional features that enhance the effectiveness of fiscal rules are transparency of policies and commitment to implementation of fiscal programs. Supranational rules, however, do not affect the effectiveness of national fiscal rules in reducing the deficit bias. Our results are robust to alternative estimation methods and endogeneity assumptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bergman, U.

Our findings also hold for 1978-2013, during which these negotiation successes encouraged 26% to 57% more kidnappings.

Bonds matter: in equilibrium, investors structure their bond portfolio to hedge real exchange rate risks. Equity home bias arises when non-financial income risk is negatively correlated with equity returns, after controlling for bond returns. Our framework allows us to derive equilibrium bond and equity portfolios in terms of directly measurable hedge ratios. An empirical application to G-7 countries finds strong empirical support for the theory. We are able to account for a significant share of the equity home bias and obtain an aggregate currency exposure of bond portfolios comparable to the data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We call inequalities of 5 per cent or less between the most and least deprived socio-economic quintile groups 'slight', inequalities of 5-15 per cent 'moderate' and inequalities of more than 15 per cent 'substantial'. Overall public health care expenditure is substantially concentrated on poorer people. At any given age, poorer people are more likely to see their family doctor, have a public outpatient appointment, visit accident and emergency, and stay in hospital for publicly-funded inpatient treatment. After allowing for current self-assessed health and morbidity, there is slight pro-rich inequity in combined public and private medical specialist visits but not in family doctor visits. There are also slight pro-rich inequities in overall indicators of clinical process quality and patient experience from public health care, substantial pro-rich inequalities in bereaved people's experiences of health and social care for recently deceased relatives, and mostly slight but occasionally substantial pro-rich inequities in the use of preventive care (for example, dental check-ups, eye tests, screening and vaccination) and a few specific treatments (for example, hip and knee replacement). Studies of population health care outcomes (for example, avoidable emergency hospitalisation) find substantial pro-rich inequality after adjusting for age and sex only. These findings are all consistent with a broad economic framework that sees health care as just one input into the production of health over the life course, alongside many other socio-economically patterned inputs including environmental factors (for example, living and working conditions), consumption (for example, diet and smoking), self-care (for example, seeking medical information) and informal care (for example, support from family and friends).","[Cookson, Richard; Asaria, Miqdad] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Propper, Carol] Imperial Coll, Sch Business, London, England; [Propper, Carol] CMPO, Bristol, Avon, England; [Propper, Carol] CEPR, London, England; [Raine, Rosalind] UCL, London, England",University of York - UK; Imperial College London; University of Bristol; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; University College London,"Cookson, R (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England.",richard.cookson@york.ac.uk; c.propper@imperial.ac.uk; miqdad.asaria@york.ac.uk; r.raine@ucl.ac.uk,"Asaria, Miqdad/T-9980-2019; Cookson, Richard/AAO-3225-2021","Asaria, Miqdad/0000-0002-3538-4417; Raine, Rosalind/0000-0003-0904-749X; Cookson, Richard/0000-0003-0052-996X",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/J023108/1]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [SRF-2013-06-015]; ESRC [ES/J023108/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J023108/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [SRF-2013-06-015] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"OThe authors thank Antonio Rojas-Garcia for his help with the literature searching, Josie Dixon, Julian Le Grand and an anonymous referee for helpful comments, and Judith Payne for excellent copy-editing, though the authors take full responsibility for all remaining errors and omissions.

We first develop a simplified theoretical framework that allows us to examine election-cycle fiscal redistribution programs in the presence of a revolutionary threat from some groups of agents, i.e., when democracy is not the only game in town. According to our theoretical analysis, when democracy is not the only game in town, incumbents implement redistributive policies not only as a means of improving their reelection prospects, but also in order to signal that democracy works, thereby preventing a reversion to an autocratic status quo ante at a time of the current regime's extreme vulnerability. Subsequently, focusing on 65 developed and developing countries over the 1975-2010 period, we report robust empirical evidence of pre-electoral budgetary manipulation in new democracies. Consistent with our theory, this finding is driven by political instability that induces incumbents to redistribute income-through tax and spending policies-in a relatively broader coalition of voters with the aim of consolidating the vulnerable newly established democratic regime.","[Kammas, Pantelis] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, POB 1186, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Sarantides, Vassilis] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin Str, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Ioannina; University of Sheffield,"Sarantides, V (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin Str, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",kammas@cc.uoi.gr; v.sarantides@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Sarantides, Vassilis/0000-0001-9096-4505; Kammas, Pantelis/0000-0003-1337-416X",,,,,74,6,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2016,168.0,3-4,,,,,279,311,,10.1007/s11127-016-0363-2,0.0,,,33,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DZ9BP,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386168500006,0

The marginal distributions of the returns are specified using the Extreme Value Theory (EVT), putting a specific emphasis on extreme returns. The joint distribution is then built up using the pair-copulas theorem, based on the marginal distributions and the pair dependence structures. The model performance is assessed for three sets of assets, namely equity indices, exchange rates, and commodity prices. The empirical results support a better static and dynamic properties of the presented model compared to most common specifications used in practice. The proposed model and the alternative specifications are then carried out to perform stress testing exercises on hypothetical portfolios, where financial returns are considered as risk factors. The results show that the use of a wide range of risk models produce significantly different results, in terms of the corresponding stress scenario and in the corresponding impact on the portfolios. Hence, considering flexible and consistent specifications, as in the proposed model, allows ensuring a better credibility of the stress scenario and enhances the usefulness of the stress testing results.

Using a large sample of 24,217 firm-year observations for the period 2004-2012, we show that firms with long auditor tenure and in closer geographic proximity to auditors have lower incidence of ICW. Furthermore, we find that the positive association between auditor-client geographic distance and ICW is weaker for firms with longer auditor tenure.

As a result, in the last two decades, 39 of the world's 153 low and middle-income countries have adopted laws restricting the inflow of foreign aid to domestically operating nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Governments recognize that such laws harm their international reputations for supporting democracy and may invite donor punishment in terms of aid reductions. Yet, they perceive foreign aid to NGOs as supporting political opponents and threatening their grip on power. In the aftermath of competitive electoral victories, governments often take new legal steps to limit these groups' funding. We test this argument on an original dataset of laws detailing the regulation of foreign aid inflows to domestically operating NGOs in 153 low- and middle-income countries for the period 1993-2012. Using an event history approach, we find that foreign aid flows are associated with an increased risk of restrictive law adoption; a log unit increase in foreign aid raises the probability of adoption by 6.7%. This risk is exacerbated after the holding of competitive elections: the interaction of foreign aid and competitive elections increases the probability of adoption by 11%. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the value of Peruvian mining exports grew by 15 times; and since the early 2000s, one-half of fiscal revenues from mining have been devolved to local governments. Has this boom benefitted people in local communities? Using the district-level poverty map of 2007 (the latest available with accurate data on consumption, poverty, and inequality) together with district-level data on mining production and fiscal transfers to local governments, we present some evidence to answer this question. We find that mining districts have larger average consumption per capita and lower poverty rates than otherwise similar districts. These positive impacts, however, decrease drastically with administrative and geographic distance from mining centers. Moreover, consumption inequality within mining districts is higher than in comparable nonproducing districts. This dual effect of mining is accounted for by, first, the better educated immigrants required and attracted by mining activity and, second, the jobs that some community natives obtain in industries and services related to mining. The inequalizing impact of,mining, both across and within districts, may help explain the social discontent with mining in Peru, despite its enormous revenues. An area for future research highlighted in the paper regards the usefulness of fiscal transfers to local governments (the Mining Canon), a key component of the fiscal decentralization reform of 2002. We find neither a detrimental nor a beneficial effect from the Mining Canon in Peru.

Given the lacklustre internal demand and dampening global outlook, whether the government can generate faster growth in the remaining months will depend on the extent to which its programs champion productive spending. The government's response to stalling growth has focused on increasing infrastructure and social spending. In the face of budgetary constraints to financing such expenditures, initiatives to raise revenue and to improve targeting on social spending are taking place. On the revenue front, two initiatives are worth noting: the issuance of Law 11/2016 on Tax Amnesty and the amendment of Law 16/2009 on General Provisions and Tax Procedures. To improve the targeting of social spending, the National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2 K) launched an updated Unified Database, which contains information on 24 million of Indonesia's poorest households. Meanwhile, around 167 million Indonesians have registered for the National Health Insurance scheme. Yet any consolidation of social protection and insurance programs in Indonesia necessitates an understanding of long-run trends in population dynamics. In particular, understanding the trends and drivers of family change is pivotal to mapping key issues and challenges in President Joko Widodo's continued push towards welfare reform. We outline key features of contemporary family change in Indonesia: a modest decline in average household size, an uncertain trend in age at first marriage, fertility rates that hover just above replacement level, an increasing tendency for women to marry down' in education, more interethnic marriages, and an upturn in divorce since around 2006. We note the implications of family change on future trends in population and the workforce, and their associated longer-term challenges for current social protection initiatives.","[Qibthiyyah, Riatu] Univ Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia; [Utomo, Ariane J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of Indonesia; Australian National University,"Qibthiyyah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia.",,,"Utomo, Ariane/0000-0003-2314-9513; Qibthiyyah, Riatu/0000-0001-9442-8849",,,,,48,9,9,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

The hypothesis predicts a positive relationship between the hours worked and the transitory changes in wages. We tested the hypothesis using the data on the daily income and worked hours collected via the survey questionnaire among small entrepreneurs in North-Western Bosnia and Herzegovina. The estimated wage elasticities turned out to be positive and different from zero, according to which it appears that the hypothesis of negative wage elasticities was not backed up by the empirical evidence. Our findings imply that the intertemporal labour substitution hypothesis found evidence and that we can reject the daily targeting hypothesis. We also argue that Bosnian entrepreneurs tend to pursue profits across working days because their main motive for running a business is the accumulation of capital and wealth, so that they follow the pattern of intertemporal labour substitution. The findings can be explained by an unfavourable business climate in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a result of a long-lasting transition process the country is still undergoing.","[Sabic-Lipovaca, Ada] Univ Bihac, Bihac, Bosnia & Herceg; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge, England; [Bilan, Yuriy] Univ Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland",University of Cambridge; University of Szczecin,"Sabic-Lipovaca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bihac, Bihac, Bosnia & Herceg.",adasabic@gmail.com,"Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019; Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021","Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841;",,,,,32,11,11,0,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2016,18.0,43,,,,,634,653,,,,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DU5MP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382256100010,0

We find that core-periphery structures are cost efficient for banks, which is a characteristic that encourages the participation of banks in financial networks. On the downside, we also show that core-periphery structures are risk-taking inefficient, because they imply higher systemic risk levels in the financial system. In this way, regulators should be aware of the excessive risk inefficiency that arises in the financial system due to individual decisions made by banks in the network. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As uncertainty about future losses increases, the above reasoning implies that they would choose to increase their capital position. This paper tests this hypothesis in a dataset with U.S. Commercial Banks by exploiting a cross-sectional variation in uncertainty to explain the distribution of bank capital ratios. I find statistically significant and robust evidence in support of a self-insurance mechanism. A counterfactual experiment suggests that a decline in uncertainty to its lowest level generates an average reduction in bank capital ratios of up to 2 percentage points. Furthermore, uncertainty explains, on average, about half of banks regulatory capital buffers.

Although credit risk explains a major part (39%) of the certificates' overpricing, we find that issuer default risk does not have any influence on investors' product choices.

This paper presents a new approach which adopts the economic concept of the Lorenz Curve to compare link performance in terms of transit operations as well as weighted passenger volume of travel. The paper explores if, and how, these metrics can be re-interpreted to help with targeting improvements for on-road public transport and priority mitigations. The approach collates operational performance data, in this case link speed and also link public transport travel volume to plot the cumulative distribution of link speed/ridership performance as a curve. Two sets of test applications are presented; on a route level basis and secondly a network level analysis. The network level results present the most powerful results with the Lorenz Curve analysis able to quickly identify links that justify greater attention for preferential treatments since they have the worst 20th percentile of operational performance but the highest 40th percentile of relative link ridership. Mapping shows the problem links to be busy routes leading into the central city. Implications for wider application of these methods are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper contributes to the discussion by applying panel data regression models with fixed effects using OLS. Our dataset comprises annual production/harvested area data for sugar, ethanol and five other staple commodities ranging from 1981 to 2009 for 24 Brazilian states. Our results indicate that rising ethanol production exerts statistically significant positive impacts on sugarcane; negative impacts on rice, beans and soybeans acreage but no statistically significant effect on the areas for corn and manioc. The negative impacts on commodities' acreage have implications for the associated prices. Ceteris paribus, rising ethanol production puts some upward pressure on the prices for rice, beans and soybeans. However, the economic implication of these direct land use effects is attenuated due to the moderate scale of any effect.","[Seyffarth, Anelise Rahmeier] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Seyffarth, AR (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Ammerlander Heerstr 114-118, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany.",anelise.rahmeier.seyffarth@uni-oldenburg.de,,,,,,,48,5,5,1,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Two references, which measure the earnings situation of the firm, are considered - productivity and profits per worker. Wage and employment outcomes as well as the degree of wage rigidity depend on the size of the fairness reference relative to the outside option. A high fairness reference leads to wage pressure and real wage rigidity, whereas a low fairness reference leads to wage moderation and real wage flexibility. An increase in the weight on the fairness reference amplifies these deviations from the standard model.","[Strifler, Matthias] Univ Jyvaskyla, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Beissinger, Thomas] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; [Beissinger, Thomas] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Jyvaskyla; University Hohenheim; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Strifler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,,"Beissinger, Thomas/0000-0002-4126-1624",,,,,58,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

Therefore, the main objective of this work was to improve the understanding of the underlying processes that generate freight trips and through this understanding, to improve the modelling of FIG. To achieve this goal, the authors first had an extensive literature review to understand the reasons for the weaknesses of the current FTG modelling approaches. After identifying these weaknesses, some of them were brought to a focus in this work. One of the main weaknesses was the inadequacy of the classification system which was used to group commercial establishments in a set of standardized classes. Hence, firstly an experiment was conducted to create groups of logistical sites that had homogeneous FTG characteristics. It was observed that one of these segments had too many zero trips for a particular vehicle category, namely tractor trailers. Then, to solve this problem, a new 'conditional' modelling approach for FTG modelling of this group and this vehicle category was proposed and tested using the data obtained from Kocaeli City Logistics Master Plan. This new hypothesised conditional approach aimed to find the probability of the segment generating tractor-trailer trips using the binary logit model and the generated trips given that the sites produced tractor trailer trips using the regression technique. Afterwards, the models developed using the new approach were compared with the models obtained using only the common modelling approach of the regression analysis. The results indicated that creating homogeneous groups of logistical sites was possible and the new conditional modelling approach which was applied to one segment of the logistical sites for FTG of tractor-trailers, performed better than the regular regression modelling. Lastly, some recommendations for further improvement of this modelling approach were provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Primary low-income female caregivers (n = 432) of preschoolers ages 3-5 years were interviewed using the Family Economic Strain Scale. Caregiver and child heights and weights were measured. Significant differences were found in perceived economic strain between normal versus underweight, overweight, and obese caregivers. A moderating effect approaching significance was noted such that at low levels of reported economic strain, caregiver BMI classification had no effect on child BMI z-score for normal weight, overweight, or obese caregivers. This study is the first to demonstrate that reduced perception of economic strain may act to buffer the impact of maternal overweight/obesity on child weight status. Given this biologically strong relationship, the potential for any modifiable factor to be detected is encouraging. Further collaborative research between economists and family resiliency researchers is suggested.","[Hayes, Jenna T.; VanBrackle, Angela; Sigman-Grant, Madeleine] Univ Nevada, Reno Cooperat Extens, 8050 Paradise Rd,Suite 100, Las Vegas, NV 89123 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Sigman-Grant, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Reno Cooperat Extens, 8050 Paradise Rd,Suite 100, Las Vegas, NV 89123 USA.",sigman-grantm@unce.unr.edu,,,"Agriculture Food and Research Initiative, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2010-85215-20662]; NIFA [580942, 2010-85215-20662] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","Agriculture Food and Research Initiative, U.S. Department of Agriculture; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Teresa Byington, Dr. Nurgul Fitzgerald, Dr. Deana Hildebrand, Anne Lindsay, M.S., Dr. Amy Mobley, and Dr. Jenny Reichert for their contribution to this research as well as Dr. Jeanne Hilton for her consultation in the writing of this manuscript and Dr. Yaebin Kim for statistical consultation.

This paper analyzes preferences for water quality improvements in peri-urban Phnom Penh. The authors first analyze data from a discrete choice experiment in which respondents selected their preferred alternative from generic options varying in cost, taste acceptability, effectiveness against diarrhea and quantity of water treated. The choice patterns suggest that demand for water treatment is highly dependent on taste acceptability. The authors also use double-blinded taste tests to show that respondents are sensitive to one common taste in treated drinking water, that stemming from chlorine disinfection. While many compounds (natural and anthropogenic) may contribute to taste problems in drinking water, the lack of alignment between household preferences for taste and water safety may play a role in the low use of household water treatment methods in many settings.","[Jeuland, Marc; Orgill, Jennifer] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Water Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore; [Orgill, Jennifer] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Shaheed, Ameer] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Brown, Joe] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Duke University; Duke University; National University of Singapore; Duke University; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Jeuland, M; Orgill, J (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Box 90239, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Jeuland, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Water Policy, Singapore 117548, Singapore.;Orgill, J (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Shaheed, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England.;Brown, J (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",marc.jeuland@duke.edu; jennifer.orgill@duke.edu; ameer.a.shaheed@gmail.com; geoff@watershedasia.org; joe.brown@ce.gatech.edu,,"Meyer, Jennifer/0000-0003-2024-7935",Duke Global Health Institute through its strategic initiative in environmental health,Duke Global Health Institute through its strategic initiative in environmental health,"The Duke Global Health Institute provided financial support for this study, through its strategic initiative in environmental health.

This study examines the impact of market potential on the regional differences in Turkey by investigating wages in the manufacturing industry for 1987 and 2000. Evidence suggests that market potential is an important determinant of inequality in Turkey. In addition, public-private decomposition reshapes the dispersion of wages supportive of rising heterogeneity in the private manufacturing industry. This increases the explanatory power of market potential, which is observed to be high in western Turkey and diminishes toward eastern Turkey. Our findings highlight that during the postliberalization era of the 1980s, Turkey's regional inequality concern transformed into a structural problem which can be explained by provincial market potential. Moreover, our results underline that the modern geography framework, which has been tested for developed economies, is able to elucidate the regional differences in a developing country suffering from persistent imbalances.","[Karahasan, Burhan Can] Piri Reis Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Postane Mh 16, TR-34940 Istanbul, Turkey; [Karahasan, Burhan Can] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, European Inst, Res South Eastern Europe, London, England; [Dogruel, Fatma; Dogruel, Ali Suut] Marmara Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Piri Reis University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Marmara University,"Karahasan, BC (通讯作者)，Piri Reis Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Postane Mh 16, TR-34940 Istanbul, Turkey.",bckarahasan@pirireis.edu.tr,,,,,,,67,18,19,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

Three important questions are addressed: (i) how much are households willing to pay to use only renewable energy? (ii) does willingness-to-pay (WTP) vary significantly across household groups and countries? and (iii) what drives the decision to enter the (hypothetical) market for green energy and, given entry, what drives the level of WTP? The analysis here differs from previous studies on green energy in two ways: first, data and analyses are comparable across countries and second, a comprehensive attempt is made to understand 0 WTP, and to accommodate-using a censored quantile regression (CQR) framework-unobserved heterogeneity. The survey data indicate a low WTP, at 11-12 % of current electric bill. This study also addresses a key question: how important is income for understanding WTP, relative to more attitudinal determinants? The effect of income overall appears ambiguous, with Tobit-like models indicating that income is not significant while the CQR indicates that income exerts a significant effect near the center of the distribution of WTP. Across all frameworks used, a key determinant of WTP appears to be environmental attitudes, particularly membership in an environmental organization.","[Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Umea Univ, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran B.] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, POB 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Kristrom, Bengt] SLU Umea, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Kristrom, Bengt] SLU Umea, Dept Forest Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",Umea University; Umea University; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Krishnamurthy, CKB (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.;Krishnamurthy, CKB (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",chandra.kiran@econ.umu.se; Bengt.Kristrom@slu.se,,"Krishnamurthy, Chandra Kiran/0000-0002-9494-6467",,,,,52,13,14,3,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This moral viewpoint changes significantly when the default is strategic in nature. Defaulters are judged significantly less harshly by those who more so blame the lender for the current financial crisis, those who have previously strategically defaulted, and males. When asked to suggest a morally appropriate settlement offer to lenders to resolve the distressed debt, beyond the financial outcome and default intent remaining significant we further find that those who more so blame the lender, those who view their home as more of an investment rather than a consumption good, those who have previously strategically defaulted, those with lower income levels, and minorities suggest significantly lower settlement offers.

In our model economy, exuberant financial market sentiments of high output and high demand for capital increase the price of capital, which signals strong fundamentals of the economy to the real side and consequently leads to an actual boom in real output and employment. The model further derives implications for asymmetric nonlinear asset prices and for economic contagion and co-movement across countries. In the extension to the dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) setting, our model demonstrates that sentiment shocks can generate persistent output, employment, and business cycle fluctuations, and it offers some new implications for asset prices over business cycles.

The economic theory, highlighted in particular by the Solow-Swan model, was applied in the current paper, to determine the potential of real convergence. Moreover, the statistics for the period 2005-2014 facilitated the analysis of the growth and recession factors specific to economies of Central and Eastern Europe and placed Romania amongst the EU countries with emergent economies and potential of economic growth. The European Commission's reports regarding the macroeconomic imbalance procedure draw attention on the same indicators presented in the article to address proper recommendations and support corrective measures.

The friction leads to delays in firms' divestment decisions and thus slow recoveries from shocks, even when these shocks do not affect the economy's potential output. The impediments to reallocation increase with the dispersion in productivity and decrease with the interest rate, the frequency of sectoral shocks, and households' consumption smoothing motives. When households are risk averse, delaying reallocation serves as a hedge against future shocks, which can lead to persistent misallocation. Our model also provides a micro-foundation for convex adjustment costs and a link between the nature of these costs and the underlying economic environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To identify the causal effect of highways, I have relied on different fixed-effects specifications, instrumental variables and controls for geography, geology and history. Since highways also attract economic activity, leading to local density increases, which in turn could affect productivity through agglomeration benefits, I also present estimations that control for local employment densities. The results show that highways raise firm-level productivity directly and beyond the effect of density. Additional results show that highway benefits are unevenly distributed across sectors and space. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using a quantile regression approach for the period 1994-2015, our empirical results show that, after controlling for the effect of general stock market returns and interest rates, there is neither co-movement nor Granger causality between commodity futures prices and financial uncertainty as measured by the VIX or between commodity prices and policy uncertainty. However, we find evidence that financial stress had Granger causality effects in intermediate and upper commodity return quantiles, but no evidence of co-movement. We also show that the impact of the global financial crisis on commodity returns differed across quantiles, only having a negative impact in upper quantiles. Our results indicate that general stock market uncertainty conditions are not so crucial in determining commodity futures prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is necessary to re-examine the container network in this context and assist liner companies in decision-making. This paper assesses the potential of the NSR based on designing a multi-port multi-trip liner service by establishing a two-stage optimization model. Based on the estimated data of NSR shipping, ship routing schemes on both the NSR and conventional routes are proposed. It is determined that container service along the NSR is largely influenced by ice-breaking charge, seasonality, and cargo volume, which makes NSR more likely to act as a supplementary line of the liner network in the short or medium term.

Each year, over 100 million American consumers watch the Super Bowl. Its popularity is driving marketing forces such as TV commercials, corporate sponsorship, publicity, social media, entertainment and economic activities at the host cities. This research paper analyzes the impressions of XLVII Super Bowl Advertising among college students to determine what characteristics of the ads were significant what implications there may be for Super Bowl advertisers. Among other things, our probit model indicates that a commercial that is perceived to be sexier, other things being equal, has a 30 % higher chance of convincing the consumer to try it regardless of whether the consumer is a male or female. Furthermore, our results show that disappointing commercials have about a 24 % less chance of persuasion. Moreover, the likelihood of trying a product whose commercial was disappointing, not perceived to be sexy, cool, or funny is about 41 % less than a product whose commercial was perceived to be otherwise.","[Akcay, Okan; Dalgin, M.

This article offers an agent based approach as a corrective, drawing on actor-oriented sociology, actor-network theory and alternative theories of power. An agent based approach views development projects as socially constructed processes constituted by the interactions of policymakers, workers, beneficiaries, and their socio-material environments. Such an approach is able to provide a nuanced analysis of power in development projects and generate generalizations about the landscape of development NGOs, which is characterized by two types of tensions: the first deriving from the interactions of various lifeworlds at development interfaces; the second deriving from the conflicting organizational and development goals. The utility of an agent-based approach is then illustrated through a comparative, ethnographic analysis of two microcredit non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Guatemala. While both offer small loans and classes to women, the two NGOs operate according to divergent organizational values, structures, and developmental models. This comparative analysis reveals the interactional origins of organizational characteristics and developmental models across contrasting NGOs and shows that these in turn affect, but do not fully determine what happens on the ground. Even though policymakers exercise disproportionate power, the tensions inherent in both development NGOs ensure significant room for maneuver and negotiation on the part of workers and beneficiaries. Thus, the two NGOs' trajectories and outcomes are products of top-down values, structures and models and the creative, emergent interactions between actors involved at various levels of development.

As part of this process, the use of IPRs in agriculture has been increasing in the last decades. This paper studies the effect of intellectual property rights on agricultural trade, for the post TRIPS period (1995-2011), using a new yearly index of IPRs, for 60 developed and developing countries. We study the effect of stronger IPRs on total trade, bilateral trade, and trade margins using different econometric techniques. We found that the strengthening of IPRs has been having a negative and uneven effect on agricultural trade at different levels of disaggregation. The gravity estimation showed that both the IPRs of the importer and the exporter have negative effects on total bilateral trade and that the probability of creating new bilateral trade links increases with the importer's IPRs. Finally, we found that stronger IPRs have a negative effect on the intensive margin of trade and a positive impact on the extensive margin. Overall, the evidence shows that agricultural trade related to the developing world has been more negatively affected, which calls the attention to the idea that a common system can equally work for all countries.

Bank regulators have been keen to improve the internal control procedures of banks in order to obtain accurate estimates of loan loss exposures. GAO (1991, 1994) reports that loan-loss reserves are often determined based on historical loss rates even for large loans, rather than individual loan impairment assessments, and the reported loan loss reserves include substantial amounts of supplemental reserves that are not linked to the loan loss exposure. We expect and find that banks with material ICW have, on average, higher loan loss reserves and provisions in years of ICW than those without ICW. We also find that ICW banks with successful remedial actions no longer have higher levels of loan loss reserves or provisions in the next year, while banks that report material ICW in both the current and following year continue to have significantly higher amounts of loan loss reserves and provisions in the next year.

We refer to this phenomenon as beliefs-driven price association (BPA). By explicitly considering the phenomenon of BPA, we show that the price response to information releases can vary over time even if the risk-free interest rate and investor preferences are static and the earnings/cash flow generating process is stable. This observation suggests, for example, that price-to-earnings associations and price volatility can vary over time even if a stable pattern of economic fundamentals suggests otherwise. The possibility of BPA suggests that measures of the cost of capital, information content, and growth prospects inferred from observed market prices will be confounded. While we do not predict when periods of BPA will arise, we provide empirically testable predictions about how prices should behave during periods of BPA. In particular, we predict that, during sufficiently long periods of high (positive or negative) BPA, price volatility, price levels, and expected returns will be higher than would be implied by a fundamental valuation framework. Finally, while BPA in the pricing of one security does not cause BPA in the pricing of other securities, the price levels of those other securities will be affected if the securities with BPA are sufficiently large relative to the market as a whole.

Using indicators such as students' satisfaction, HEIs are creating strategies to ensure student retention by focusing on a student-centric education approach, but they can no longer analyze their operations as independent and separate. Based on the Krueger/Homp SOS concept, efficient performance in the market is possible only with the joint performance of all three process categories, and for HEIs, those include class-related activities, management, and supporting processes. The main purpose of the research was to examine the applicability of the proposed student satisfaction model in relation to the CRM strategy at HEIs in terms of identifying key student satisfaction components. Results aided us in developing a new perspective in evaluating the CRM strategy in the higher education sector and a better understanding of pedagogical basis for the shift toward student-oriented education. Practical implications highlight the importance of adapting the CRM strategy in the sector of higher education and creation of student-oriented environment by constantly adapting its processes in accordance with indicators of student satisfaction. Identification of factors constituting student satisfaction enables universities' management board and other departments to establish grounds for practices that would result in a more efficient organization and an increase in student satisfaction. Findings should also give strong incentives to management boards of education institutions to devote their efforts to CRM concept application at their institution.","[Hrnjic, Anes] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management & Org, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Hrnjic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Management & Org, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg.",anes.hrnjic@efsa.unsa.ba,,,,,,,71,9,19,0,30,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

We combine data on residential transactions during the 35-year period between 1974 and 2009 with data from the Landmarks Preservation Commission on the location of the city's historic districts and the timing of the designations. Consistent with theory, properties just outside the boundaries of districts increase in value after designation. Further, designation raises property values within historic districts, but only outside of Manhattan. As predicted, impacts are more positive in areas where the value of the option to build unrestricted is lower. Impacts also appear to be more positive in districts that are more aesthetically appealing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Pollution and capital taxes are imposed on producers in the polluted sector. The optimal policy combinations of capital taxes and pollution taxes for the host economy are examined. A zero capital tax is required for increasing mobility of capital to raise real GDP, while a larger than Pigovian pollution tax is needed for enhancing environmental amenities. The impacts on those two optimal tax rates are examined theoretically and numerically if foreign countries adopt higher environmental standards or if foreign countries impose tax credits on foreign investments.

We show that publicly subsidized renewable energy can attract criminal appetites and favor the formation of criminal associations between entrepreneurs and politicians able to influence the licensing process. The insights of a simple model of political influence by interest groups are tested empirically using Italian data for the years 1990-2007. Using a difference in difference approach we quantify the impact of a Green Certificate policy aimed at supporting renewables, and find robust evidence that criminal association activity increased more in windy provinces after the introduction of the generous policy regime. The magnitude of the effect is large: the construction of an average wind park is associated with an increase in criminal activity of 6 % in the treatment compared to the control group. Our findings show that in the presence of poor institutions, even well designed market-based policies can have an adverse impact. The analysis is relevant for countries that are generally characterized by heavy bureaucracies, weak institutions and by large renewable potential.","[Gennaioli, Caterina] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Gennaioli, Caterina] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Tavoni, Massimo] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Climate Change & Sustainable Dev Programme, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Tavoni, Massimo] Politecn Milan, Dept Management & Econ, I-20156 Milan, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Fondazione Mattei; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Gennaioli, C (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Gennaioli, C (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.gennaioli@lse.ac.uk; massimo.tavoni@feem.it,,"tavoni, massimo/0000-0001-5069-4707; Gennaioli, Caterina/0000-0002-4058-4675",European Community [282846]; UK Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish,European Community; UK Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful to Antoine Dechezlepretre, Roberta Distante, Vincenzo Galasso, Reyer Gerlagh, Humberto Llavador, Tommaso Nannicini, Gaia Narciso, Marcella Nicolini, Jesse Shapiro, Mirco Tonin, and audience at IMT, Lucca, LSE, Oxford, Stanford, the 1st workshop on organized crime at Cattolica University, the 9th EEM conference at EUI, Florence, the 19th EAERE conference in Prague and the Cesifo Summer Institute in Venice for very helpful comments.

Based on considerations from prospect theory, we hypothesize that individuals who generally and consistently set more aspiring reference points have a higher intention to form a new venture. Testing our hypothesis with entrepreneurs and managers, results show that entrepreneurs indeed set more aspiring reference points. Therefore, they might find themselves more often in a perceived loss situation which in turn increases their risk-taking behavior, following the predictions of prospect theory. In testing entrepreneurial intention of business graduate students, results are shown to be robust.

In 2011, the European Commission put forth a legislative proposal for a common system of financial transaction taxes in the European Union. The proposal did not gather unanimity among all Member States and eleven asked to go ahead under the so-called enhanced cooperation procedure. In parallel, countries such as France and Italy have introduced their own taxes, while others of the group of eleven already had an FTT in place (Belgium and Greece). Discussions between Member States on the final design of the financial transaction tax are progressing, but to date no final decision has been made.

Liquidity constraints and perceived insurer default both reduce the demand for insurance, possibly leading to nonparticipation. We also evaluate an alternative insurance design that allows agents to delay premium payment until the end of the insured period when income is realized and indemnities are paid. We show this alternative design increases insurance take-up by relaxing the liquidity constraint and ameliorating concerns about insurer default. We also investigate the value of delayed premium payment, and the importance of the associated problem of reneging if the insured event does not occur, under a range of conditions.","[Liu, Yanyan] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Myers, Robert J.] Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Michigan State University,"Liu, YY (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.;Myers, RJ (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",y.liu@cgiar.org; myersr@msu.edu,,,Innovation fund of IFPRI; Microinsurance Innovation Facility of International Labor Organization,Innovation fund of IFPRI; Microinsurance Innovation Facility of International Labor Organization,"Yanyan Liu is Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

This literature has tended to focus only on men or the comparison of women to men, while ignoring substantial heterogeneity in employment decisions among women. By investigating the impact of individual, household, and local economic and cultural characteristics on the labor market outcomes of different groups of women, we get a more comprehensive picture of their self-employment decision. Recognizing self-employment as one of multiple labor market choices, we use multinomial logit and two confidential, geocoded micro-level datasets to study women`s career choices in urban areas. We find that the effects of various push and pull factors differ between married and unmarried women. In particular, more progressive gender attitudes pull married women into self-employment, while household burdens associated with children push them into self-employment. For unmarried women, the local business climate and individual characteristics have the strongest influence. In both cases, the motivations for women are quite different than men.","[Patrick, Carlianne] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, POB 3992, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA; [Stephens, Heather] W Virginia Univ, Agr & Resource Econ, POB 6108, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Weinstein, Amanda] Univ Akron, Dept Econ, 290 Buchtel Commons, Akron, OH 44325 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; West Virginia University; University System of Ohio; University of Akron,"Weinstein, A (通讯作者)，Univ Akron, Dept Econ, 290 Buchtel Commons, Akron, OH 44325 USA.",cpatrick@gsu.edu; heather.stephens@mail.wvu.edu; aweinstein@uakron.edu,"Patrick, Carlianne/S-7410-2019","Patrick, Carlianne/0000-0001-5793-1955; Stephens, Heather/0000-0003-3472-216X","Coca-Cola Critical Difference for Women Graduate Studies Research Grant; Department of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at The Ohio State University","Coca-Cola Critical Difference for Women Graduate Studies Research Grant; Department of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at The Ohio State University","This research was supported in part by funding from the Coca-Cola Critical Difference for Women Graduate Studies Research Grant and the Department of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at The Ohio State University.",,67,93,110,4,116,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The menu of assets legally accepted as collateral was enlarged to include movable assets (e.g., machinery and equipment). Generalized difference-in-differences tests show that firms operating more movable assets borrowed more as a result. Those firms also invested more, hired more, and became more efficient and profitable following the changes in the contracting environment. The financial deepening we document triggered important reallocation effects: firms affected by the reforms increased their share of fixed assets and employment in the economy.

MNEs often justify transfer prices to tax authorities by benchmarking intercompany profit allocations against a range of book profit rates reported by economically comparable, independent firms that use similar accounting standards. Additional qualifying benchmark firms resulting from IFRS adoption could allow managers to support more tax-advantaged transfer prices. Using a database of European unconsolidated financial and ownership information over 2003-2012, I first document an increase in the arm's length range of book profits reported by potential IFRS benchmark firms following affiliate adoption of IFRS. I then estimate a statistically and economically significant 11.3 percent tax-motivated change in reported book pre-tax profits following affiliate IFRS adoption, relative to pre-adoption and non-adopter affiliate-years.

In the United States (U.S.), rural and small urban communities suffer from transport disadvantage due to a lack of transit and a low density of employment, education, recreation, and other opportunities. While the international literature has produced a number of methods and frameworks to assess transport disadvantage and its impacts, the U.S. has lagged behind in providing pertinent studies. The objective of this paper is to establish comprehensive measures that can support the identification, evaluation, and quantification of transport disadvantage in U.S. rural and small urban communities, considering both data availability and the unique characteristics of the U.S. The concept of transport disadvantage in this paper denotes the disadvantage of a specific population group or area that results from a difficulty accessing transportation and/or opportunities. To achieve this objective, this paper develops a spatial multi-perspective approach to account for the three essential elements of transport disadvantage: accessibility, mobility, and realized travel behavior. The developed approach provides an assessment of transport needs and need gaps that can be of benefit to small urban and rural communities and their planning practices, as well as to transport providers. The analysis in this paper suggests that from a policy perspective a combination of measures that account for all three essential elements of transport disadvantage should be considered, because the results of each measure complement those of the others. This paper illustrates the proposed approach using a case study of Indiana. The findings suggest that a great part of rural and small urban Indiana presents a low density of opportunities and that transport disadvantaged residents of such areas might experience the impacts of low transit supply as well. In addition, the findings suggest that residents of rural and small urban areas travel longer distances on their day-to-day activities. This paper attempts to advance the national research pertaining to transport disadvantage and provide a framework that can support planning and policy decisions at the community as well as at the state level.

It finds that the quality of policy increases, but at a diminishing rate, with the cumulative number of policy loans. Similar results hold for the cumulative number of conditions attached to policy loans, although quadratic specifications indicate that additional conditions may even reduce the quality of policy beyond some point. The paper measures the quality of economic policy using the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments of macro, debt, fiscal, and structural policies, and considers only policy loans targeted at improvements in those areas. Previous studies finding weaker effects of policy lending on macro stability have failed to distinguish loans primarily intended to improve economic policy from other loans targeted at improvements in sector policies or in public management. The paper also shows that investing in economic policy does not crowd out' policy improvements in other areas, such as public sector governance or human development. The results are robust to using alternative indicators of policy quality and correcting for endogeneity with system generalized methods of moments and cross-sectional two-stage least squares. The more positive results in the study relative to some previous studies are consistent with claims by the World Bank that it has learned from its mistakes with traditional adjustment lending.","[Smets, Lodewijk] Univ Antwerp, Inst Dev Policy & Management, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Smets, Lodewijk] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Fac Econ & Business, Leuven, Belgium; [Knack, Stephen] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Antwerp; KU Leuven; The World Bank,"Smets, L (通讯作者)，LICOS, Waaistr 6, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium.",lode.smets@kuleuven.be,,,Institute of Development Policy and Management (IOB); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO),Institute of Development Policy and Management (IOB); Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"We would like to thank Vincenzo Verardi, Adam Wagstaff, Peter Moll, Patricia Geli, the seminar participants at the 2013 LAGV conference, and one anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions.

Design/methodology/approach - Cluster analysis methodology with Ward's (1963) technique is used to create significant groups out of FDI source countries. Findings - The results show that foreign direct investors - labeled by their country of origin investing in Turkey are grouped into two main clusters. First main cluster of Turkey has three sub-clusters. Investors investing in Germany are also grouped into two main clusters. First main cluster of Germany has two sub-clusters. Of all seven clustering criteria, four of them were prominent in grouping, which are: having a high equity ownership in the investment, investing in companies with high market capitalization, investing in companies with high/low financial risk and high/low financial performance, and investing in young companies. Furthermore, investors from same origin behave differently in Turkey and Germany. They adjust their attitude toward risk when the host country changes. Lastly, source countries in the sample that have a minimum distance in between, are the ones sharing similar cultural values. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of the study are the small number of observation with complete and standard company data needed, especially in Turkey, and the compelled shortness of time period for the empirical analysis. Some suggestions were offered for future researches to contribute to the topic by using bigger samples; by making variations in country, time, or industry; by relating country factors to social/entrepreneurial factors; and by supporting the research with qualitative techniques. Originality/value - This paper constitutes a contribution to the empirical field research in Turkey, an emerging country with very limited firm-level financial and ownership data, compared to Germany, a developed country with relatively more data availability.","[Aydin, Nurhan; Kulali, Gulsah] Anadolu Univ, Dept Business Adm, Eskisehir, Turkey",Anadolu University,"Kulali, G (通讯作者)，Anadolu Univ, Dept Business Adm, Eskisehir, Turkey.",gulsahy@anadolu.edu.tr,,,Anadolu University Scientific Research Projects [1110E156],Anadolu University Scientific Research Projects(Anadolu University),"This study was developed out of PhD dissertation of the corresponding author, which was at the same time financially supported by Anadolu University Scientific Research Projects, Project No. 1110E156.",,92,1,1,2,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Therefore raising of this problem for the enterprises is quite relevant in scientific and practical aspects, if they want to achieve the real and beneficial implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy. The present article analyzes the factors, which determine reporting of information on social responsibility. Methodology/methods It is getting more and more relevant to integrate social, environmental and transparent performance principles into the activities in the current period of savage competition. The important factors of corporate success include not only material and financial resources, but also human resources and social attitude of the enterprise towards the market, society and environmental protection. The research was carried out using the systemic analysis of scientific literature, methods of comparison and generalization. Scientific aim to distinguish the factors, which affect reporting of social information. Findings It was determined that reporting of social responsibility depends on the particularity of activity of the economic sector, size of the enterprise, duration of the enterprise's existence, financial situation of the enterprise, its human resources, public relations and environmental protective activity. Conclusions The analysis of scientific literature revealed that CSR practice differs in each enterprise, but the reporting of social responsibility depends on the particularity of activity of the economic sector, size of the enterprise, duration of the enterprise's existence, financial situation of the enterprise, its human resources, public relations, environmental protective activity. It was determined that when the enterprises report social responsibility, they divide the information on social responsibility into 4 key parts of corporate social responsibility: human resources, provision and improvement of service, public activity, and environmental protection.","[Balaboniene, Ingrida; Mykolaitiene, Violeta; Vecerskiene, Giedre] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino Str 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Vecerskiene, G (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino Str 50, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",giedre.vecerskiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,9,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,417,423,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200052,0

We assume that, due to the existence of asymmetric information and moral hazard, the household faces an increasing cost of credit as its debt/equity ratio rises. A household exploiting a natural resource may fall into a poverty trap, but only if it is unable to afford the increasing borrowing costs implied by increasing debt to allow it to avoid such a trap, or if it discounts future utility so much that a balanced growth path cannot be financed at any level of long-run borrowing. In contrast, along an optimal balanced growth path, the household's asset wealth, purchased inputs, resource stock and consumption increase at the same constant rate. However, over the long run there may be carrying capacity limits that prevent the resource from improving further. The household may then direct its savings to accumulating financial assets, and eventually under certain conditions may become a net creditor with resource exploitation becoming a less and less important source of its income.","[Barbier, Edward B.; Hochard, Jacob P.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Lopez, Ramon E.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 3105 Symons Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lopez, Ramon E.] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",University of Wyoming; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Universidad de Chile,"Barbier, EB (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",ebarbier@uwyo.edu; rlopez@umd.edu; jhochard@uwyo.edu,,"Hochard, Jacob/0000-0002-9502-2602",,,,,48,13,14,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Proposed models differ in terms of both the dynamics of the conditional volatility process and the forecasting capabilities compared to a family of GARCH models. Gray (1996) RS-GARCH model allows regime dependent heteroscedasticity structure following the markov switching methodology of Hamilton (1989). The MS-GARCH-NN model family differ in the sense that, they allow regime switching between GARCH-NN processes. Single regime GARCH-NN models are developed by Donaldson and Kamstra (1996) and further extended by Bildirici and Ersin (2009). Further, the proposed models incorporate a variety of neural network architectures. MS-GARCH-MLP and MS-GARCH-Hybrid-MLP models by Bildirici and Ersin(2014) are augmented with fractional integration (FI) and asymmetric power GARCH variants. And they developed models are MS-FIGARCH-Hybrid-MLP, MS-APGARCH-Hybrid-MLP and MS-FIAPGARCH-Hybrid-MLP models. In this paper, these models were used to test volatility of gold return. Tests are evaluated with MAE, MSE and RMSE criteria and equal forecast accuracy is tested with modified Diebold-Mariano tests. An empirical application is provided for forecasting daily returns in gold market. The results suggest that the proposed approach performs well in modeling and forecasting volatility in daily returns of international gold market. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Using a hand-collected data set of 401(k) investment options, we find that plan sponsors are likely to choose actively managed growth funds, including aggressive growth funds and long-term growth funds. Furthermore, more than 50% of the mutual funds in our sample of 401(k) plans are selected from the top 10 fund families in terms of total net assets. On average, plan sponsors select funds that outperform the funds with the same investment objective and that have low expense ratios. The performance of mutual funds in 401(k) plans only persists in a short horizon.

We investigate the impact of corporate asset restructuring and find that target leverage after restructuring is reduced for downsizing firms and increased for upsizing firms. Changes in target leverage are stabilized by the second year after the restructuring event and are monotonic relative to the degree of restructuring. Decomposition analysis shows that corporate asset restructuring directly and significantly affects target debt ratios. Compared to control firms, downsizing firms adjust claims by repurchasing debt while upsizing firms issue debt securities. As expected, debt repurchases are associated with lower tax liabilities while debt issuance decisions correspond to lower growth proxies and are consistent with a higher adverse selection cost of issuing equity, positive leverage deficit, higher tax liabilities, and lower bankruptcy risk.

The objective of this paper is threefold. First, we seek to illustrate the divergences between countries using a Taylor gap between the ECB interest rate and that of a standard Taylor rule, calculated at several levels: the euro area, the core, the periphery, and some individual countries, representing those regions. Then, we show that a monetary policy that tries to correct financial imbalances using a Taylor rule extended to financial stability could amplify these divergences. Finally, we explain how the euro area could benefit from adopting a new policy mix that combine the unique monetary policy with a macroprudential policy, adjusted to the economic and financial situation of each Member State. This combination would promote financial stability but also the macroeconomic stability.","[Couppey-Soubeyran, Jezabel] Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, Labex Regulat Financiere Refi, Maison Sci Econ, Paris, France; [Dehmej, Salim] Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, Labex Regulat Financiere Refi, Paris, France",,"Couppey-Soubeyran, J (通讯作者)，106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",couppey@univ-paris1.fr; salim.dehmej@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,94,2,2,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

In 2015, the US accounted for 15% of Japan's total volume of imported cheese. If the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), is ratified by Congress, US and other major cheese exporters stand to benefit from duty free or reduced tariff rates. An import demand model is used in estimating Japan's demand for imported cheese. Estimates from this analysis are then used to project Japanese cheese imports in volume and value as a result of TPP. Findings suggest that the own-price elasticities for cheese from the EU-28, US, and the ROW are more sensitive to changes in prices than cheese from Australia. Given a 29.8% reduction in the tariff rate on Japan's fresh cheese imports, Japan is projected to import from the US, New Zealand, and Australia a total of 29.2 million kilograms more cheese. Cheese exporting companies can benefit from the research results that indicate potential export market share changes for competing countries, increases in overall Japanese cheese imports, and price sensitivity of individual country exports of cheese.","[Davis, Christopher G.] ERS, Econ Market & Trade Econ Div, USDA, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Davis, CG (通讯作者)，ERS, Econ Market & Trade Econ Div, USDA, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",chrisdavis@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The revenues derived from a combination of diversified agricultural production, carbon sequestration, nitrogen fixation, and avoided irrigation water use were analysed considering uncertainty associated with on-farm activities such as crop production and short-rotation forestry. At the per hectare scale variability in land-use revenues would necessitate substantial increases in carbon prices for afforestation to be as profitable as crop cultivation on marginal lands, assuming an abundant irrigation water supply. In contrast, at the farm scale the analysis results revealed that afforestation can be attractive financially even without carbon payments due to farm production constraints, variable land-use returns, and the benefits of land-use diversification. Increased carbon prices would promote carbon sequestration by motivating farmers to plant high biomass producing tree species, but would have an ecosystem service trade-off by reducing the appeal of nitrogen-fixing species that are essential for nitrogen self-sufficiency of afforestation efforts. Given the modest irrigation needs of afforestation efforts compared to the cultivation of annual crops, tree plantations could become a primary income source for farms during periods of drought. Irrigation water saved from replacing crops with trees on marginal farmland would enhance the cultivation of commercial crops on productive lands, thus increasing farm income.","[Djanibekov, Utkur] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Khamzina, Asia] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Walter Flex Str 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn; University of Bonn,"Djanibekov, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",u.djanibekov@ilr.uni-bonn.de; asia.khamzina@uni-bonn.de,,,Robert Bosch Foundation; ZEF/UNESCO program in the Khorezm Region of Uzbekistan; International Postgraduate Studies in Water Technologies (IPSWaT); Dr. Herman Eiselen Doctoral Program of the Foundation fiat panis,Robert Bosch Foundation; ZEF/UNESCO program in the Khorezm Region of Uzbekistan; International Postgraduate Studies in Water Technologies (IPSWaT); Dr. Herman Eiselen Doctoral Program of the Foundation fiat panis,"We appreciate the support of the Robert Bosch Foundation for enabling this study within the framework of the German-Uzbek Agroforestry project.

We focus on this research topic because it is obviously not very meaningful for researchers and managers if we consider the concept of value chain. The research is about to explain how the role of procurement has changed during the last two decades, whereby we provide a scientific basis and reveal perspectives for further studies. Methodology This scientific approach is twofold. First, we derive on the basis of statistical data the relevance of procurement for value creation. Second, the theoretical approach is providing a systematic overview on different steps of the evolution of procurement. The question of research is, whether there is a greater lever for value creation following the steps of evolution. Scientific aim The scientific aim of this article is to emphasize the leverage effect of procurement considering value creation for a company by integration. We explain the vertical and introduce the horizontal dimension of integration. Findings We observed changes in business operations on a large scale. Procurement is not any more just the ordering department. Procurement has changed into a value creator, by integrating the various internal activities and combining them uninterruptedly with the value creating activities of the suppliers. The value position is more driven by innovations coming from sourcing markets than by price reductions. Conclusions Procurement has the highest impact on cost position of a product. In conclusion, a company's value is strongly correlated with procurement. Therefore we postulate to consider procurement not any more as a secondary activity, but as a primary activity within the value chain of a company.","[Hofbauer, Guenter; Sangl, Anita] Tech Hsch Ingolstadt, Eplanade 10, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany; [Hofbauer, Guenter] Univ Appl Sci, Tech Hsch Ingolstadt, Business Sch, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany; [Sangl, Anita] Tech Hsch Ingolstadt, Business Sch, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany",,"Sangl, A (通讯作者)，Tech Hsch Ingolstadt, Eplanade 10, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany.;Sangl, A (通讯作者)，Tech Hsch Ingolstadt, Business Sch, D-85049 Ingolstadt, Germany.",guenter.hofbauer@thi.de; anita.sangl@thi.de,"Hofbauer, Gunther/B-2671-2010","Hofbauer, Gunther/0000-0003-0542-7989",,,,,16,0,0,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,550,556,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200068,0

These companies have different traditions of ethics, respect for society and the environment than European ones. Sustainability as a strategic concept usually is initiated by corporate headquarters - but given the restrictions of isolated hierarchies in emerging markets, one would not expect that to happen with southern multinationals. Recently regional headquarters (RHQ) have gained attention. Being responsible for a number of branches, RHQs can to a certain extent shape the strategic focus of the entire company. The objective of this conceptual paper is to examine if there are possibilities to boost sustainability from beyond, initiated by RHQs. Following suggestions by Hansen and Rapper (2009) and Bouquet and Birkinshaw (2008), we interpret managing as power games. We will examine three levels to promote sustainability despite lacking corporate headquarter (CHQ) support. First, we interpret strategizing as an innovation game. At this level, the odds of influencing the CHQ are low. RHQs will step in increasingly prominently when implementing strategies - we will coin this project games. At this level, the focus shifts from managerial strategies to micro -political tactics. Regional headquarters draw their power from performing managerial functions either by integrator or negotiator power or particularly through broker power. A third way to boost sustainability is by declaring them mere adaptation to local needs. This is in line with observations that sustainability could ultimately be implemented as pure operation below the CHQ's threshold of strategic perception.

This legislation therefore breaches the EU principle of free movement goods and services and compels non-German transport undertakings to align their employees' pay to German rather than their native country's economic conditions. Arguably, the very fact that it was possible for a member state to introduce a regulation such as the MiLoG law should be seen as a EU transport policy failure.","[Paprocki, Wojciech] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Transport, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Paprocki, W (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Transport, Warsaw, Poland.",wojciech.paprocki@sgh.waw.pl,"Paprocki, Wojciech/HMD-1693-2023",,,,,,19,0,0,0,11,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-26848-4; 978-3-319-26846-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,51,65,,10.1007/978-3-319-26848-4_6,0.0,,,15,Business; Economics; Transportation,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Transportation,BG0LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386325500006,0

However, even in a recessionary period, there will always be some firms growing faster than others. It is therefore imperative to understand the variables and processes that make some firms grow faster or more resilient to crisis than others. In this paper, we focus on firm size and its contributions to growth. We examine whether growth rates of manufacturing and service industries are independent of firm size during the period of economic crisis. Based on a large sample of surviving firms in the manufacturing and hospitality industries, the results of two-step dynamic panel suggest that turnover growth is positively associated with companies' size during the observed period of economic recession 2008-2013.

Competitiveness is seen as an essential emergent property of the high-tech industry and depends on many external and internal factors. Being aware of the combination of the most effective factors for competitiveness in certain economic conditions and the mechanism of their influence, one can make rational management decisions. An indispensable condition for the knowledge of the socio-economic reality and the most important factor for the effectiveness of the decisions in the field of competitiveness of high-tech enterprises is the assessment. The purpose of the study is the definition of the vector to ensure the competitive development of hightech industrial enterprises. To evaluate the level of competitiveness of high-tech industrial enterprises the author used the method based on Harrington desirability function. The degree of importance of the functional areas of competitiveness of high-tech enterprises was determined through the ranking method. The ranks were marked by contractors and managers of different levels of high-tech industrial enterprises of Central Federal District of Russia. The reliability of ratings of importance was confirmed through Pearson goodness-of-fit test, the use of which allowed claiming that the consistency in the opinion of the experts surveyed is not accidental and is 90%. The research produced the following results: we defined levels of functional components of the competitive superiority of high-tech enterprises, namely production and technological competitiveness; scientific and technological competitiveness; environmental competitiveness; human resources competitiveness; financial competitiveness; economic competitiveness; market competitiveness; management system competitiveness; social competitiveness; competitiveness of manufactured products, which are eventually integrated into the final evaluation of the quantitative level of competitiveness. It was revealed that the competitiveness primarily depends on the competitiveness of the enterprise management system and, secondly, on the scientific and technological and the production and technological competitiveness. The most important factor in the competitiveness of high-tech enterprises is the level and potential of innovative activities.","[Polzunova, Natalia] Vladimir State Univ, 79 Gorkogo St, Vladimir, Russia; [Starikova, Tatiana] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Vladimir Branch, 59a Gorkogo St, Vladimir, Russia",Vladimir State University; Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Polzunova, N (通讯作者)，Vladimir State Univ, 79 Gorkogo St, Vladimir, Russia.",natalya.polzunowa@yandex.ru; startv008@rambler.ru,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,533,547,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300044,0

Methodology/methods A theoretical analysis of qualitative secondary data from over 30 dedicated scientific articles on FVA and Historical Cost Accounting (HCA) was used. The relation of FVA to the Financial Crisis was analysed by the secondary data from 2006-2009 literature, FVA problems - secondary data from 2006-2012 literature, perspectives of FVA were analysed by qualitative data from 2012-2015 literature. Scientific aim FVA greatly influences investment choices and management decisions, but are there any FVA implications currently? Is it clearly advantageous and being used more than HCA? Is it going to be the only dominant accounting method in the nearest future? Findings The analysis of the dedicated literature shows that currently in several fields, such as net asset forecast accuracy, using FVA is more advantageous. The areas that need further research to determine the preferable method are stock price volatility and prediction of credit losses. For illiquid non-financial assets HCA is still superior. Conclusions It is impossible currently to rely solely on HCA or FVA, so a mix of HCA and FVA (or a mix of FVA and Amortized Cost) in the accounting, possibly with switching to some new models, is still going to be used for a while. The analysed problems and perspectives outline strong and weak spots for FVA usage. One of the main problems with FVA is information transparency, so a lot will depend on the further work of standards' setters for developing standards and regulations, which could address these problems effectively. As for limitations - a modern research is needed to understand possible effects of FVA during the periods of future booms and busts.","[Sapkauskiene, Alfreda] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino G 50-211, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Orlovskij, Sergej] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio G 73, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Sapkauskiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino G 50-211, LT-44249 Kaunas, Lithuania.",alfreda.sapkauskiene@ktu.edu,"Sapkauskiene, Alfreda/AAF-9934-2019","Sapkauskiene, Alfreda/0000-0002-0070-4097",,,,,34,0,0,0,5,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,472,478,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200059,0

Furthermore, the article analyzes empirical data on public works contracts in the field of construction and reconstruction of wastewater treatment plants in the Czech Republic. The probability distribution of bid prices submitted by individual firms is mainly examined on these data.

We investigate this conjecture by providing evidence on the relationship between ICT and energy demand. Using a cross-country cross-industry panel data set covering 13 years, 10 OECD countries, and 27 industries, our results show that ICT is associated with a significant reduction in total energy demand. This relationship differs with regard to different types of energy. ICT is negatively related to the demand for non-electric energy, but is not associated with a significant change in the demand for electric energy. Quantitatively, the effect of ICT on energy demand is greater than that on labor demand. The results survive several robustness checks which allow for various forms of heterogeneity and tackle the potential endogeneity of ICT capital.","[Schulte, Patrick; Rexhaeuser, Sascha] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, POB 103443, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany; [Welsch, Heinz] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Ammerlaender Heerstr, D-26129 Oldenburg, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg,"Schulte, P (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, POB 103443, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",schulte@zew.de; heinz.welsch@uni-oldenburg.de; rexhaeuser@zew.de,,,,,,,45,80,83,7,56,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Rural areas in both countries underwent relatively similar development and currently suffer by the changes in agriculture. The demographic data and statistics about NUTS 3 regions for period 2002-2014 were obtained from Eurostat database. We consider the predominantly rural regions as defined by the Eurostat. There are 6 those regions in the CR and 4 in SR. Firstly, a hierarchical cluster analysis was used to group the regions according to the number of live birth, deaths, net migration and total population change. Three groups emerged where Presovsky (alternated by Plzensky) outstand in separate group due to its high number of inhabitants and birth rates. First cluster had worse development conditions (number of deaths higher than live births, emigration higher than immigration, and hence negative total population change during the whole observed period) than the second cluster, where the population development was more positive. The affiliation of regions to particular group was changing during the period, but Jihocesky region stayed always in the first cluster. Secondly, cohort-component method was used to project the population development in five-year intervals from 2014 to 2029. The population projection shows that the population bases are downsizing due to generation ageing and increasing average age of economically productive persons in observed predominantly rural regions.","[Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Pechrova, Marie] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Modelling Impacts Agr Policy, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Simpach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.simpach@vse.cz; pechrova.marie@uzei.cz,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-4781,,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,371,379,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000048,0

Up to today, in Italy, there are 76 registered facilities of various dispersed accommodation. This paper clarifies and denominates these types of accommodation including accommodation networks and horizontal hotels (integrated and widespread hotels) and tackles the issue of their prevalence. Namely, widespread hotels and the less complex integrated hotels have almost not come to life beyond national borders. Such hotels are in line with sustainable development and are extremely interesting for today's consumers. The authors believe that the expansion of the concept of horizontal hotels lacks a strong international brand. An analysis of the dispersed accommodation according to spatial and pooling complexity dimensions is provided, where a gap on the offer side is identified. This paper deals with the current state and possibilities of development of horizontal hotels through pooling in international chains in order to popularize them.

Yet, the research on the subject in Eastern and Central Europe, including Poland, is scarce, and even so, the relations between managerial behaviours and internal communication can be affected by national culture. Polish employee relations with large Hofstede's power distance are quite different from American or British which are usually our benchmarks in research. Methodology/methods In this study, we used the theory and research from the Anglo-Saxon database to reconsider and build upon several aspects of managerial behaviour and its relations with positive internal communication in Polish companies. There were three stages in this study. First, we used a Delphi method to create a definition of positive internal communication and specify the issues to be studied in further stages. Next, we conducted a questionnaire survey in Polish companies, finally we carried out in-depth interviews in selected organisations. In analyses, we used descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for all the variables. We tested our hypotheses using Pearson correlation and regression analyses. Scientific aim The aim was to study the impact of top management behaviours on positive internal communication. Findings This study contributes to the literature on business communication and enhances researcher's understanding of the role that managerial behaviour can play in creating positive internal communication in Polish companies. We developed our definition of positive internal communication and operationalised its elements on the basis of literature review and our own research. Conclusions We demonstrated on our sample that in Polish environment it is top management behaviour that is more important for the creation of positive communication than the middle management behaviour. However, more comparative studies are needed.","[Winska, Joanna; Glinska-Newes, Aldona; Gorka, Joanna] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Winska, J (通讯作者)，Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Torun, Poland.",jwinska@umk.pl,"Górka, Joanna/X-5546-2018","Górka, Joanna/0000-0002-9959-5432",Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/00691],Polish National Science Centre,The project was funded by the Polish National Science Centre grant on the decision DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/00691,,37,0,0,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,165,172,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200019,0

A formula based on deviation degree for deriving attribute weights is presented, then the comprehensive weight is given combined with the subjective weight. According to the center of the trapezoidal fuzzy number, the order of all programs is given based on calculating the distance sum from the center of the attribute values of various programs to the optimal solution. The method can sufficiently utilize the normalized fuzzy evaluation information and meets the requirements of decision-maker, and can also be performed on the computer easily.

In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we undertake a two-step empirical analysis. First, we estimate how production and net imports change in response to energy prices using a 35-year panel of approximately 450 US manufacturing industries. Second, we use these estimated relationships to simulate the impacts of changes in energy prices resulting from a $15 per ton carbon price. We find that energy-intensive manufacturing industries are more likely to experience decreases in production and increases in net imports than less-intensive industries. Our best estimate is that competitiveness effects-measured by the increase in net imports-are as large as 0.8% for the most energy-intensive industries and represent no more than about one-sixth of the estimated decrease in production.","[Aldy, Joseph E.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Strateg & Int Studies, Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Aldy, Joseph E.] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pizer, William A.] Duke Univ, Ctr Global Dev, Natl Bur Econ Research, 190 Rubenstein Hall,302 Towerview Dr,Box 90311, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Harvard University; Centre for Strategic & International Studies; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; Duke University,"Pizer, WA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Ctr Global Dev, Natl Bur Econ Research, 190 Rubenstein Hall,302 Towerview Dr,Box 90311, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",Joseph_Aldy@hks.harvard.edu,,"pizer, william/0000-0003-1498-1148",,,,,22,91,97,11,34,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We find that common borders and a shared historical and political heritage result in a complex set of associations between aid and growth. Aid has a positive impact on growth in the recipient country. However, the impact of aid also spills over to affect other nations. Aid appears to create positive spillovers through improved total factor productivity and possibly currency appreciation. At the same time, aid depletes human capital through emigration and it particularly adversely affects democracy and governance quality in other transition economies. On balance, aid generates net adverse growth spillovers in transition economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Further, there is no significant relation between mean returns and the portion of transaction-price-based idiosyncratic volatility that is orthogonal to bid-ask spreads.

It is shown that the power of the two tests can differ substantially depending on the location of the explosive regime, and whether such a regime ends in collapse. Since this information is typically unknown to the practitioner, we propose a union of rejections strategy that combines inference from the two individual tests.

We use a tail-trimming indicator to dampen extremes negligibly, ensuring standard Gaussian inference, and a higher rate of convergence than without trimming when the variance is infinite. Trimming, however, causes bias in small samples and possibly asymptotically when the variance is infinite, so we exploit a rarely used remedy to estimate and utilize the tail mean that is removed by trimming. Since estimating the tail mean involves estimation of tail parameters and therefore an added arbitrary choice of the number of included extreme values, we present weak limit theory for an ES estimator that optimally selects the number of tail observations by making our estimator arbitrarily close to the untrimmed estimator, yet still asymptotically normal. Finally, we apply the new estimators to financial returns data.","[Hill, Jonathan B.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Hill, JB (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",,,,,,,,74,10,10,0,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

We also assess the potential of transfers that redistribute the surplus of cooperation to foster the stability of climate coalitions. In contrast to much of the existing analytical game theoretical literature, we find substantial scope for self-enforcing climate coalitions in most models that close much of the abatement and welfare gap between complete absence of cooperation and full cooperation.

Is it the definition of trend and/or the holding strategy that one uses in candlestick charting analysis? To answer this, we systematically consider three definitions of trend and four holding strategies. Applying candlestick trading strategies to the DJIA component data, we find that regardless of which definition of trend is used, eight three-day reversal patterns with a Caginalp-Laurent holding strategy are profitable when we set the transaction cost at 0.5% and after we account for data-snooping bias, while the patterns with a Marsha ll-Young-Rose holding strategy are not profitable. For sensitivity analysis, we also find that our results are not qualitatively changed on a lower transaction cost of 0.1%, or when we conduct the subsample analyses based on three equal periods and three distinct market conditions. When considering a more volatile market, evidence in favor of candlestick trading strategies is strengthened. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I build a simple model to show that shocks to the uncertainty of commodity export prices can elicit civil conflict in a small open economy. Econometric evidence from a cross-country panel data set documenting intrastate civil conflict and global food commodity prices from 1966-90 lends support to this hypothesis. The results suggest that policies which reduce the uncertainty of export prices faced by food commodity exporters can facilitate political stability in conflict-vulnerable countries.","[O'Trakoun, John] US Govt Accountabil Off, Washington, DC USA",,"O'Trakoun, J (通讯作者)，US Govt Accountabil Off GAO, Int Affairs & Trade Sect, 441 G St NW, Washington, DC 20548 USA.",otrakoun@bc.edu,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

In the absence of institutional constraints, the commitment problem of the political elites is intensified, because their human capital can turn out to be a double-edged sword raising their efficiency in predation as well as in production. In general, the more human capital the political elites have, the stronger the institutional concessions they are ready to offer to attarct investment. Provided that predation depends sufficiently on human capital, the political elites can credibly commit to respect property rights by specializing in fields that are relevant for the priavte sector. Brain drain can undermine the transition to stable property rights even when the political elites are well-educated. Comparative narratives from Malaysia and Zimbabwe are presented to motivate the theoretical discussion.","Econ Res Southern Africa, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa",,"Bedasso, BE (通讯作者)，Econ Res Southern Africa, PostNet Suite 109,Private Bag X1005, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa.",biniam.bedasso@econrsa.org,,,European Center for Development Policy Management (ECDPM),European Center for Development Policy Management (ECDPM),"This article constitutes a chapter of my doctoral dissertation written at Maastricht University.

This paper employs a social determinants of health perspective to shed light on the link between work and one dimension of stigma discrimination. It examines discrimination and depression with data from a comparative study of three front-line service jobs: sex work, serving food and alcohol, and barbering and hairstyling. Our findings show positive associations between depression and the most highly stigmatized occupation sex work and between discrimination and depression. Discrimination mediates part of the association between sex work and depression, and self-worth partially mediates the association between discrimination and depression. Equity policies that improve their social determinants will contribute to better mental health for sex industry workers. Additional strategies aimed at reducing the formidable discrimination linked to their work are also urgently needed.","[Benoit, Cecilia; Jansson, Mikael] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada; [McCarthy, Bill] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Victoria; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Benoit, C (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.",,"Jansson, Mikael/E-6092-2019; McCarthy, Bill/D-9248-2013; Benoit, Cecilia/JVO-6214-2024",,,,,,54,29,34,4,37,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

The paper contributes to the literature by investigating the third country effect and also by analyzing the impact of the current financial crisis on the relationship between exchange rate volatility and UK imports. This paper further expands the empirical literature on the subject by offering evidence based on the asymmetric autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method from the application of monthly data from January 1991 to December 2011. Results suggest that exchange rate volatility plays an important role in determination of trade and also reveal a significant effect of the recent financial crisis on UK imports. This finding remains consistent when we test for the third country volatility effect. We also find that there is a significant causal relationship between exchange rate volatility and UK imports. The third country effect is significant for all the countries investigated. These results have significant implications for the trade policy and international trade in minimizing the underlying risk factors and ensuring stable trade flows in different economic scenarios.

However, the tail indices, or maximally existing moments of the returns, can differ markedly across assets. To accommodate these stylized facts when modeling the joint distribution of asset returns, an asymmetric extension of the meta-elliptical t distribution is proposed. While the likelihood is tractable, for high dimensions it will be impractical to use for estimation. To address this, a fast, two-step estimation procedure is developed, based on a saddlepoint approximation to the noncentral Student's t distribution. The model is extended to support a CCC-(I)GARCH structure and demonstrated by modeling and forecasting the return series comprising the DJIA. The techniques of shrinkage, time-varying tail dependence, and weighted likelihood are employed to further enhance the forecasting performance of the model with no added computational burden.

This contractual relationship is complicated by environmental risk, e.g. climatic conditions, that are often observable for the landholder, only. It was tested whether environmental risk is detrimental to the establishment of a reciprocal payment-effort relationship in an experimental auction-market for a public good. In this market, auction winning sellers either reinvest their contract payment in a public good or behave opportunistically and exploit information rents. The data show that environmental risk increases opportunistic behaviour of some sellers and disturbs the formation of effective, reciprocal contract relationships between the contracting buyers and sellers. Buyers do no longer trust sellers, pay minimal payments and break up after negative shocks. Repeated interaction mitigates the influence of environmental risk by benefitting contract enforcement and increasing efficiency due to higher reinvestment shares of payments, although the effect is less strong than in a comparable environment without risk. These results suggest that in a variable environment competitive bidding might be a less suitable mechanism for allocating conservation funds.","[Vogt, Nora] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Vogt, N (通讯作者)，Acad Spatial Res & Planning, Leibniz Forum Spatial Sci, Hohenzollernstr 11, D-30161 Hannover, Germany.",vogt@arl-net.de,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The results demonstrate that remittance-receiving households invest more in bridging social capital by participating in organisations (donating time), but make fewer monetary contributions, compared to non-receiving households. Remittances have mixed effects on bonding social capital: receiving households give significantly less gifts to family members and friends, but are more likely to send internal remittances, compared to non-receivers.

We exploit tick-by-tick option quotes to compute a novel Corridor Volatility index which may serve as an observable proxy for short-term volatility.

Moreover, the return-volatility asymmetry is more pronounced than is generally recognized and is in force for both diffusive and jump innovations in volatility. Finally, the index performs admirably during turbulent market conditions, constituting a useful real-time gauge of market stress.","[Andersen, Torben G.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Bondarenko, Oleg] Univ Illinois, Dept Finance, Chicago, IL 60607 USA; [Gonzalez-Perez, Maria T.] CUNEF, Madrid, Spain",Northwestern University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; CUNEF Universidad,"Bondarenko, O (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Finance, 601 S Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",olegb@uic.edu,"Gonzalez-Perez, Maria T/AFZ-0879-2022","Gonzalez-Perez, Maria T/0000-0003-1053-7066","CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain (MEC Research Project) [ECO2012-32554]","CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain (MEC Research Project)","Elements of this work were previously included in the working paper entitled Coherent Model-Free Impled Volatility: A Corridor Fix for High-Frequency VIX.

We demonstrate this claim in a two-period market with persistent liquidity trading and risk-averse, privately informed, short-term investors and find that prices reflect average expectations about fundamentals and liquidity trading.

Based on Swedish micro-level longitudinal data, this study further distinguishes between Swedish MNEs and foreign MNEs as acquirers and disentangles their different acquisition effects on the growth of NTBFs. Based on a large sample of Swedish NTBFs entering from 1997 to 2002 and being followed until 2009, this paper uses fixed-effects model combined with inverse-probability-of-treatment weights to account for endogeneity of acquisition arising from both time-invariant and time-varying heterogeneity across firms. The findings show that acquisition by Swedish MNEs significantly improves the growth of NTBFs, but only when it comes to the growth in employees. In contrast, acquisition by both foreign MNEs and Swedish domestic enterprises is not found to have any significant effects on the growth in either employees or sales of NTBFs.","Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Xiao, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",jing.xiao@circle.lu.se,,,,,,,57,12,14,0,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This problem is mainly a numerical issue once the joint distribution of (X-1, X-2,...,X-d) is fully specified. Unfortunately, while the marginal distributions of the risks Xi are often known, their interaction (dependence) is usually either unknown or only partially known, implying that any risk assessment of the portfolio is subject to model uncertainty. Previous academic research has focused on the maximum and minimum possible values of a given risk measure of the portfolio when only the marginal distributions are known. This approach leads to wide bounds, as all information on the dependence is ignored. In this paper, we integrate, in a natural way, available information on the multivariate dependence. We make use of the Rearrangement Algorithm (RA) of Embrechts et al. (2013) to provide bounds for the risk measure at hand. We observe that incorporating the information of a well-fitted multivariate model may, or may not, lead to much tighter bounds, a feature that also depends on the risk measure used. In particular, the risk of underestimating the Value-at-Risk at a very high confidence level (as used in Basel II) is typically significant, even if one knows the multivariate distribution almost completely. Our results make it possible to determine which risk measures can benefit from adding dependence information (i.e., leading to narrower bounds when used to assess portfolio risk) and, hence, to identify those situations for which it would be meaningful to develop accurate multivariate models.

Of particular interest are the oft-neglected psychological and behavioral consequences of economic scarcity coupled with financial instability. The novel framework highlights the psychological costs of low and unstable incomes, and how these can transform small and momentary financial hurdles into long-lasting poverty traps. Financial instability, we suggest, not only has obvious economic ramifications for well-being, but it also creates the need for constant focus and attention, and can distract from the very opportunities otherwise designed to alleviate the effects of poverty. We describe a variety of public policy strategies that emerge from this perspective that are not readily apparent in conventional theories that permeate the design of social programs.

I argue that this risk aversion hurts equity holders when firms hold a larger amount of long-term debt. Addressing potential endogeneity problems associated with board size, I find an equity discount associated with larger boards in firms that have greater amounts of long-term debt. On the other hand, larger boards are associated with an equity premium when firms have a greater short-term debt-to-assets ratio. The equity discount associated with larger boards disappears in firms with no long-term debt. Further analysis also indicates that firms with larger boards enjoy a better credit rating and a lower realized cost of debt. Overall, analysis in this study suggests that the association between board size and equity value is a function of a firm's debt structure.","Univ Nevada, Coll Business, Finance, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Upadhyay, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Coll Business, Finance, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",aupadhyay@unr.edu,,,,,,,51,10,12,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Using data from a nationally representative survey, we establish that households diversifying toward HVCs are less likely to be poor, the biggest impact being for smallholders. Furthermore, using continuous treatment matching, we establish the relationship between degree of diversification (share of area dedicated to HVC) and poverty. Growers of HVCs need to allocate at least 50% area to HVCs to escape poverty.

The put option's value, net of closing costs, bounds HECM's value to borrowers below. Older homeowners' weak demand is commonly attributed to HECM's high costs, and the government prices insurance intending to avoid subsidy. However, simulations indicate put value has often exceeded closing costs, even ignoring other embedded options and using backward-looking expectations near the recent price-cycle peak. These results make weak demand more puzzling.","[Davidoff, Thomas] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Davidoff, T (通讯作者)，2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",thomas.davidoff@sauder.ubc.ca,,,,,,,58,26,29,2,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

However, there are also concerns about the potential costs of migration, including concerns about trafficking and human rights, a desire for remittances to be used more effectively, and concerns about a loss of externalities from skilled workers. As a result, there is increasing interest in policies that can enhance the development benefits of international migration and mitigate these potential costs. We provide a critical review of recent research on the effectiveness of these policies at three stages of the migration process: pre-departure, during migration, and directed towards possible return. The existing evidence base suggests some areas of policy success: bilateral migration agreements for countries whose workers have few other migration options, developing new savings and remittance products that allow migrants more control over how their money is used, and efforts to provide financial education to migrants and their families. Suggestive evidence, together with theory, offers support for a number of other policies, such as lowering the cost of remittances, reducing passport costs, offering dual citizenship, and removing exit barriers to migration. Research offers reasons to be cautious about some policies, including policies enforcing strong rights for migrants, such as high minimum wages. Nevertheless, we find the evidence base to be weak for many policies, with no reliable research on the impact of most return migration programs or whether countries should attempt to induce communal remitting through matching funds.

We focus on explicating size-based differences in CE and integrating them into new theoretical development. Through a search of the contemporary CE literature, we argue that there has been a tendency toward examining CE dimensions within the context of large public firms, even though they represent a relatively small proportion of the firms that engage in CE activities. Drawing on resource-based theorizing, we identify how size confers CE competitive advantages via slack resources and resource structuring processes, but disadvantages via bureaucratic structures and resource bundling. Aware of these weaknesses, we suggest that small firms are more likely to utilize CE for growth to overcome liabilities of smallness, while large firms are more likely to utilize CE for learning to overcome liabilities of inertia. We thereby provide greater specificity to CE research and stimulate new theoretical development with a forward-looking CE research agenda that incorporates the role of organizational size.","[Nason, Robert S.] Concordia Univ, John Molson Sch Business, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada; [McKelvie, Alexander; Lumpkin, G.

The elasticity of the inter-state out-migration rate with respect to per capita net state domestic agricultural product is -0.775, indicating that a decline in the value of agricultural output related to weather variations results in an increase in out-migration rate. The crop-wise analysis shows that a 1 per cent decline in rice (wheat) yield leads to a nearly 2 per cent (1 per cent) increase in the rate of out-migration from a state. The district-level analysis shows larger magnitudes of estimated change in in-migration rates to relative changes in crop yields.

In any corridor-ranking methodology, and especially in countries with high tourism attractiveness, tourism impacts on HSR should be considered as a variable. In addition to economic geography and destination choice models, the current literature on tourism demand is dominated by econometric models using a single-equation time-series based approach. However little research has been done so far on methodologies to rank HSR corridors taking into account the tourism variable. In 2014, a ranking methodology developed by Todorovich and Hagler was validated using the current Spanish HSR network. Twelve variables were used to create an index to assign scores to the city pairs, but tourism was not included as a variable. The findings showed the consistency of the model for ranking pairs mainly in the top O-D relations; however the tool failed to discriminate clearly between secondary groups of corridors. The aim of this paper is to assess empirically the positive effect of tourism on HSR and to enhance the abovementioned ranking tool with a tourism database. The new methodology is tested by application to 1176 city pairs in Spain, and the results clearly show that the implementation of a tourism variable helps discriminate between secondary groups of corridors and offers a more effective approach for determining the implications of tourism on HSR.

It is found that the cross-sectional expected stock returns are related to the sensitivities of returns to fluctuations in aggregate market liquidity. This research contributes to the literature in two ways: First, in addition to conventional portfolio sorting of liquidity beta quintiles, the threshold estimates of portfolio regimes are examined, that is, portfolios are sorted by estimated liquidity betas; the usefulness of threshold portfolio sorting is confirmed, which further confirms that liquidity risk is substantially priced. Second, among four liquidity measures, the Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) and Amihud measures outperform others in identifying the liquidity risk premium. Moreover, evidence from quantile regression provides robust confirmation of the results.

For this purpose, we construct a microfounded monetary model with a money market that provides insurance against liquidity shocks by offering short-term loans and by paying interest on money market deposits. We calibrate the model to U.S. data and find that the introduction of the sweep technology at the beginning of the 1990s, which improved access to money markets, can explain the behavior of money demand very well.

The question is still a timely issue if we refer to regulation issues and the recent proposals in the Solvency framework to take into account the fluctuations of the profitability in specifying the solvency capital requirement. In the literature, two approaches are traditionally adopted to investigate the underwriting cycle. The first one refers to an endogenous characterization of the cyclical properties from an AR(2) model. The second one claims that the cycle in the property-liability insurance has exogenous sources related to the financial markets and the general economy. In this article, we reconcile the two approaches by using a smooth transition regression model. This model shows that the AR(2) model is relevant in a first regime where the capacity constraint is binding. In contrast, the fluctuations in the combined ratio are positively influenced by the lagged stock market return in a second regime where the capacity is not constrained, as for the most recent period. Moreover, we find that the current capacity is related to the lagged inflation rate in the latter case. These results confirm the idea that the European rules regarding the solvency capital requirement for insurance companies should take into account the state of the economy and the financial markets.","[Bruneau, Catherine] Univ Paris 01, F-75013 Paris, France; [Bruneau, Catherine] MSE, CES, F-75013 Paris, France; [Sghaier, Nadia] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG LAB, F-75006 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; IPAG Business School,"Bruneau, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, 106-112 Ave Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",cbruneau475@gmail.com; nadia.sghaier@ipag.fr,"Nizar, Sghaier/AFY-1176-2022","Nizar, Sghaier/0000-0002-4591-7360",,,,,65,3,3,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Over this half-century, the initial heavy reliance on cash income support to poor families has eroded; increases in public support came largely in the form of in-kind (e.g., Food Stamps) and tax-related (e.g., the Earned Income Tax Credit) benefits. Work support and the supplementation of earnings substituted for direct support. These shifts eroded the safety net for the most disadvantaged in American society. Three poverty-related analytical developments are also described. The rise of the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM)taking account of noncash and tax-related benefitshas corrected some of the serious weaknesses of the official poverty measure (OPM). The SPM measure indicates that the poverty rate has declined over time, rather than being essentially flat as the OPM implies. We also present snapshots of the composition of the poor population in the United States using both the OPM and the SPM, showing progress in reducing poverty overall and among specific socioeconomic subgroups since the beginning of the War on Poverty. Finally, we document the expenditure levels of numerous antipoverty programs that have accompanied the several phases of poverty policy and describe the effect of these efforts on the level of poverty. Although the effectiveness of government antipoverty transfers is debated, our findings indicate that the growth of antipoverty policies has reduced the overall level of poverty, with substantial reductions among the elderly, disabled, and blacks. However, the poverty rates for children, especially those living in single-parent families, and families headed by a low-skill, low-education person, have increased. Rates of deep poverty (families living with less than one-half of the poverty line) for the nonelderly population have not decreased, reflecting both the increasing labor market difficulties faced by the low-skill population and the tilt of means-tested benefits away from the poorest of the poor.",,,,,,,Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,"The authors wish to thank their organizations for support of this work, especially the Institute for Research on Poverty (IRP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

We find that firm-level expected returns and expected profitability are time-varying but highly persistent and that forecasts of holding period returns strongly predict the cross section of future returns up to three years ahead. We show a highly significant predictive pooled regression slope for future quarterly returns of 0.86. The popular factor-based expected return models have either an insignificant or a significantly negative association with future returns. In supplemental analyses, we show that these forecasts are also informative of the time series variation in aggregate conditions. For a representative firm, the slope of the conditional expected return curve is more positive in good times, when expected short-run returns are relatively low, and the model-implied forecaster of aggregate returns exhibits modest predictive ability.

Even just for capital to grow faster than income, we need an additional requirement that saving of non-capital income is larger than consumption of capital income. Even if this is satisfied, the capital share may not increase as the rate of return may fall and non-capital incomes may increase with capital accumulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find that terrorism marginally increases the size of this coefficient, which may result from an increase in the precautionary saving motives. However, even a small increase in openness offsets this effect and significantly lowers the propensity to retain domestic savings for investment. This suggests that, given more channels, capital leaves domestic boundaries to land in safe places abroad. At least partly, the results explain the paradoxical finding in the literature that capital is more mobile in developing countries, even though they are less open. We also find that all types of terrorism reduce investment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the former, he showed how to link biological and economic factors in a consistent mathematical framework, virtually creating the field of mathematical bioeconomics single-handedly. In the latter, he was a major contributor of the introduction of state variable methods for modeling the behavior and life history of organisms. In this paper, we apply the methods of behavioral ecology to a problem in fisheries management and show that understanding fisher responses to quota decrements according to fishing area (so that the decrement in the quota of effort from fishing in a particular area is larger than the actual effort used there) may be as or more effective for seabird conservation than closing areas. To begin, we explain state variable methods in behavioral ecology, using insect parasitoids-Colin's choice of after dinner talk at the meeting in his honor-making connections between behavioral ecology and resource economics. We then turn to the pelagic longline fishery off eastern Australia and show how the same kinds of methods used in behavioral ecology can provide new insights about this fishery. We provide a model of sufficient detail to compare the current management practice (closures), no management, and spatial management with effort decrements that vary over space and show that the latter management strategy is both environmentally and economically more effective than closures or no management.","[Mangel, Marc; Arriaza, Juan Lopez] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Mangel, Marc; Arriaza, Juan Lopez] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Mangel, Marc] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, N-9020 Bergen, Norway; [Dowling, Natalie] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Castray Esplanade, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of Bergen; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Mangel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ctr Stock Assessment Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",msmangel@ucsc.edu; Natalie.Dowling@csiro.au; jlopez@soe.ucsc.edu,"Dowling, Natalie/D-9376-2014",,"Center for Stock Assessment Research; Fisheries Ecology Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries; University of California Santa Cruz; NSF through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities (CERF) Marine Biodiversity Hub; CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research Career Development Fund","Center for Stock Assessment Research; Fisheries Ecology Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries; University of California Santa Cruz(University of California System); NSF through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities (CERF) Marine Biodiversity Hub; CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research Career Development Fund","This work was partially supported by the Center for Stock Assessment Research, a partnership between the Fisheries Ecology Division, Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries and the University of California Santa Cruz, by a NSF predoctoral fellowship to Juan Lopez Arriaza, by funding through the Commonwealth Environmental Research Facilities (CERF) Marine Biodiversity Hub, and a CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research Career Development Fund awarded to Natalie Dowling.

Using a real-option model of investment, we show that PSD can mitigate the well-known underinvestment problem (Myers, 1977) because of its risk-compensating nature. We also show how to design the PSD so that the underinvestment incentive is completely eliminated, thus reducing the underinvestment agency cost to zero. Finally, we show how to identify the optimal leverage ratio with PSD financing. Because of the complexity of the model, the results are illustrated with numerical solutions. However, the results are quite robust, and are consistent over a wide range of parameter values. The main results are (i) the optimal performance-sensitivity level (i.e., that eliminates underinvestment) can be significantly larger than zero, which implies that PSD is superior to the traditional fixed-coupon debt and thus provides a rationale for the use of PSD; (ii) using PSD rather than fixed-coupon financing can increase shareholder wealth by economically significant amounts; and (iii) the optimal performance-sensitivity level is an increasing function of debt level and a decreasing function of earnings growth rate and investment cost, hence firms/projects with high debt level and low earnings growth rate and investment cost are more likely to benefit from using PSD rather than the traditional fixed-coupon debt.

The modern customer is mobile, permanently connected to the Internet, well-informed about international trends, mindful of the quality of products, but more price sensitive and less loyal to a brand. The shopping experience provided by retailers is a crucial factor in purchase decision, encompassing all these variables in a complex concept of exogenous variable. As retailers' efforts to provide excellence in shopping experience are focused on operating costs and thus on the profit margins, it is important to consider and identify which are the most relevant variables that form the perception of excellence for Romanian customers, so that retailers can innovate according to their expectations. The purpose of this article was to highlight the role of innovation in creating a positive experience for consumers buying clothes, shoes and accessories. The approach was based on the conduct of exploratory research. The research. represented by five original objectives and as many different working scenarios. resulted in the identification of thematic outlined exploratory opinions, exploiting a first investigation of its kind in Romania, less Pearson coefficients used in the analysis of ordinal variables or hierarchical, but quickly assessed using SPSS, version 21. As a pioneering research emphasis was on identifying potential associations and quantified correlations and less on rigorous delimitation of exogenous or endogenous quality in general, leaving room for future studies, sharper and with a higher degree of representation. Thus, we could highlight some useful aspects of the investigated retailers, by the dominant character of interested customers' opinions according to their volunteer responses. Consumers are accustomed to using the Internet to obtain information; they rarely express opinions on social sites about the purchased goods, and are willing to receive information about special offers of the stores on personal mobile devices since the entry into the stores. Customers would also welcome separate exposure areas in selling space, where they can find products in promotional campaigns. Therewith, we could outline a primary profile of the ideal salesperson on fashion products, less rigorous but relatively consistent.","[Vasiliu, Cristinel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Cercel, Mihai Ovidiu] Natl Sch Polit & Adm Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Vasiliu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristi_vasiliu@yahoo.com,"Vasiliu, Cristinel/B-5730-2012; Cercel, Mihai/AAH-7547-2021","Vasiliu, Cristinel/0000-0002-1084-2522;",,,,,28,4,5,0,54,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2015,17.0,39,,,,,583,599,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW8WK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365279900006,0

In addition to screening and monitoring borrowers, banks provide liquidity insurance with the supply of short-term deposits withdrawable on demand. The maturity mismatch creates the risk of a disorderly bank run which can be exacerbated by imperfect information about the value of bank assets. It is shown in a stylized Basel III framework that capital regulation should incorporate a liquidity risk component. Credit risk diversification and/or a reduced probability of loan default which lead to a reduction of Basel III regulatory capital will increase the probability of a bank run. The leverage ratio rule puts a floor on the Basel III risk-weighted capital ratio, allowing the limitation of such a risk. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that after the Cold War, donors increased their use of technical assistance in aid packages, improving their monitoring capacity and thus reducing autocrats' ability to use aid for patronage. To remain in power, autocrats responded by conceding political rights to their opponents-from legalizing opposition parties to staging elections.

National Accounts fail to measure the time people dedicate to non-remunerated production because there is no explicit economic compensation. However, non-remunerated production contributes indirectly to the economy, and it represents part of the real cost of taking care of others. The opportunity cost of dedication to non-remunerated production depends highly on the educational level and personal preferences. This article estimates the real contribution of men and women to the Costa Rican economy by calculating labor income and non-remunerated production by age and sex.

We assume that an acceptable travel time is defined through utilitarian processes that are related to cognitive and affective evaluations of travel that develop throughout a person's lifetime. We apply a mixed methods approach to explore our hypothesis, based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with a stratified, according to commuting mode, random sample of 20 individuals living in Berkeley, CA. Our results support the validity of the acceptable travel time concept and offer (a) initial evidence on its variation to the travel mode and sociodemographic characteristics and (b) insights into people's perceptions, attitudes, feelings and experiences about their travel.

Sprague was America's leading expert on financial crises when America was debating establishing the Federal Reserve. His History of Crises under the National Banking System is the most enduring intellectual legacy of the National Monetary Commission; a still frequently cited classic. Since the Commission recommended a central bank, and its recommendation after some modifications became the Federal Reserve System, it might be assumed that Sprague was a strong supporter of establishing a central bank. But he was not. Initially, Sprague favored far more limited reforms, a position that he did not abandon until the Federal Reserve became a fait accompli. Here I discuss the sources of Sprague's opposition to a central bank and the relationship of that opposition to his understanding of the history and structure of the American banking system at the turn of the nineteenth century.

Using the 2001 Southern California Household Travel Survey, we find that non-work travel patterns for men and women do not vary much by gender unless children are in the household. Households with children display a striking difference in chauffeuring trips and women bear most of the chauffeuring burden. Adjusting for sociodemographics, women in households with children take over 300% more chauffeuring trips than do men living alone. The difference in chauffeuring trips among females and males within the household, the within-household, female-male chauffeuring gap, is larger for households with employed males and smaller in households with employed females. The chauffeuring gap is smaller when the woman's earning power is larger compared to the man in the same household. The chauffeuring gap is larger for households that have higher amounts of single family residential land use in the quarter-mile area around their residence, and the chauffeuring gap is larger for households that live farther than a half mile from the nearest bus stop. The magnitude of the effect of those two land use variables on the chauffeuring gap is similar to the magnitude of variables that measure within-household differences in income-earning potential or female and male employment status, suggesting that more dense land use and better transit service can help reduce disproportionate chauffeuring burdens of women.

To date, most studies of the Federal Reserve's asset purchases have tried to measure the interest rate effects of the purchases, and several provide evidence that these purchases do have important effects on longer-term market interest rates. The theory of how asset purchases work, however, is less well developed. Some of the empirical studies point to preferred habitat models in which investors do not have the same objectives, and therefore prefer to hold different types and maturities of securities. To study this more closely, we exploit Flow of Funds data to assess the types of investors that are selling to the Federal Reserve and their portfolio adjustment after these sales, which could provide a view to the plausibility of preferred habitat models and the transmission of unconventional monetary policy across asset markets. We find that the Federal Reserve is ultimately buying from only a handful of investor types, primarily households (which includes hedge funds), with a different reaction to changes in Federal Reserve holdings of longer-term versus shorter-term assets. Although not evident for all investors, the key participants are shown to rebalance their portfolios toward more risky assets during this period. These results can be interpreted as supporting, at least in part, the preferred habit theory and the view that the monetary policy transmission is working across asset markets.

A spatial dynamic panel modeling analysis of the determinants of new manufacturing ventures created in subnational regions of South Korea confirms that, in addition to the importance of regional characteristics, both temporal and spatial dependences of start-up activities are simultaneously in force and play statistically significant roles. To address the joint endogeneity issue of temporal and spatial dependences, we employ the system GMM estimator, which leads to much improved explanation of inter-regional variations in firm creation activities.","[Hong, Eunsuk; Sun, Laixiang] Univ London, Dept Financial & Management Studies, SOAS, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Lee, In Hyeock] Loyola Univ, Quinlan Sch Business, Dept Management, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Sun, Laixiang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Harrison, Richard] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Loyola University Chicago; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Edinburgh,"Hong, E (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Financial & Management Studies, SOAS, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",e.hong@soas.ac.uk; ilee1@luc.edu; lsun123@umd.edu; R.Harrison@ed.ac.uk,"Lee, In Hyeock/Q-6260-2017; SUN, LAIXIANG/ABB-2622-2021","Lee, In Hyeock/0000-0002-1698-4521; SUN, LAIXIANG/0000-0002-7784-7942; Harrison, Richard/0000-0002-0154-0039",,,,,67,11,12,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Corruption causes a reduction in defence spending but an increase in non-defence spending. Primary education stimulates non-defence spending but reduces defence expenditure, secondary education causing the opposite effect. An under-developed country spends less than a developed country.

As the primary regulator in this area, state level regulatory changes are particularly significant. As shale gas production increases, some states are updating their regulations, while others maintain dated rules, put in place prior to hydraulic fracturing that may or may not address environmental issues specific to modern shale gas development or recent concerns about environmental impacts. Our research finds that state regulation is remarkably heterogeneous. Regulatory heterogeneity includes heterogeneity in the stringency of state regulations. Though heterogeneity in state regulation is not inherently good or bad, our limited data suggests that the heterogeneity is neither explained by differences in state conditions, nor does it necessarily reflect indicators of regulatory capture. The paper also compares the use of regulations to use of liability law, voluntary practices, and information provision. In addition, it identifies new activities being regulated and areas where additional regulation may be needed.","[Krupnick, Alan] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Richardson, Nathan] Univ S Carolina, Sch Law, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Gottlieb, Madeline] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Environm Policy & Behav, Davis, CA USA",Resources for the Future; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Krupnick, A (通讯作者)，Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",Krupnick@rff.org,,,,,,,19,4,5,1,20,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

To measure and isolate sentiment's effect, we employ survey-based indicators that proxy for the sentiment of three major agents in housing markets: home buyers (demand side), home builders (supply side), and lenders (credit suppliers). After orthogonalizing each sentiment measure against a broad set of fundamental variables, we find strong and consistent evidence that the changing sentiment of all three sets of market participants predicts house price appreciation in subsequent quarters, above and beyond the impact of changes in lagged price changes, fundamentals, and market liquidity. More specifically, a one-standard-deviation shock to market sentiment is associated with a 32-57 basis point increase in real house price appreciation over the next two quarters. These price effects are large relative to the average real price appreciation of 71 basis points per quarter observed over the full sample period. Moreover, housing market sentiment and its effect on real house prices is highly persistent. The results also reveal that the dynamic relation between sentiment and house prices can create feedback effects that contribute to the persistence typically observed in house price movements during boom and bust cycles.","[Ling, David C.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ooi, Joseph T.

Six policy scenarios explore two overarching issues: (I) the effects of a carbon tax under alternative assumptions about the use of the resulting revenue, and (2) the effects of alternative revenue sources to reduce the budget deficit. We examine a simple excise tax on the carbon content of fossil fuels in the U.S. energy sector starting immediately at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) and rising at 4 percent above inflation each year. We investigate policies that allow the revenue from the illustrative carbon tax to reduce the long-run federal budget deficit or the marginal tax rates on labor and capital income. We also compare imposing a carbon tax to increasing rates of other taxes to reduce the deficit by the same amount. We find that within 25 years of adopting the carbon tax, annual CO2 emissions are 20 percent lower than baseline levels. We find that using the revenue for a capital tax cut is significantly different than other revenue recycling policies. In that case, investment rises, employment and wages rise, and overall GDP is significantly above its baseline level through year 25. Thus, adopting a carbon tax and using the revenue to reduce capital taxes would achieve the dual goals of reducing CO2 emissions significantly and expanding employment and the economy.","[McKibbin, Warwick J.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [McKibbin, Warwick J.; Morris, Adele C.; Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA; [Cai, Yiyong] CSIRO, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia; [Cai, Yiyong] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Brookings Institution; Syracuse University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University,"McKibbin, WJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",warwick.mckibbin@anu.edu.au; amorris@brookings.edu; wilcoxen@maxwell.syr.edu; Yiyong.Cai@csiro.au,"Cai, Yiyong/F-3620-2015; McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021",U.S. Department of Energy Award [DE-PI0000005],U.S. Department of Energy Award(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge assistance from the U.S. Department of Energy Award DE-PI0000005.

However, not all types of infrastructure have a homogeneous impact on the entrepreneurial decision, so that a second hypothesis is developed suggesting that certain types of infrastructure which facilitate connectivity and linkages among people are more conducive to startup activity. The empirical results suggest that startup activity is positively linked to infrastructure in general, but that certain specific types of infrastructure, such as broadband are more conducive to infrastructure than are highways and railroads.

It begins with a labor market perspective and emphasizes the importance of agglomeration economies, both static and dynamic. It then argues that more productive jobs in cities do not exist in a void and underscores the importance of job and firm dynamics. In turn, these dynamics are shaped by the broader characteristics of urban systems. A number of conclusions are drawn. First, agglomeration effects are quantitatively important and pervasive. Second, the productive advantage of large cities is constantly eroded and must be sustained by new job creation and innovation. Third, this process of creative destruction in cities, which is fundamental for aggregate growth, is determined in part by the characteristics of urban systems and broader institutional features. We highlight important differences between developing countries and more advanced economies. A major challenge for developing countries is to reinforce the role of their urban systems as drivers of economic growth.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Duranton, G (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",duranton@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,143,71,78,1,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

This study examines the relationship between income, car ownership, and suburbanization across geographies and households in metropolitan Mexico City. Neither car-ownership trends by geography nor a mixed logit model of 43,000 households' joint car-ownership and residential-location decisions suggest that car ownership and suburbanization are moving hand-in-hand. Instead, wealthier households tend to live in central locations and own and drive cars, while poorer households tend to live further from the urban center and rely more heavily on transit. If a random household's income doubles, that household is around 44% more likely to get an additional car and 29% more likely to live in the urban center. Given the sticky nature of housing supply and the current model of peripheral housing production, aggregate responses to higher income are more difficult to predict, as they will almost certainly be offset by higher prices. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that higher income and car ownership do not tend to encourage a move to larger houses on larger suburban lots in Mexico City. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Over 25% of funds rely almost entirely on Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommendations, while other funds place little weight on them. Funds with higher benefits and lower costs of researching the items up for vote are less likely to rely on ISS. These actively voting funds are less likely to vote in a one-size-fits-all manner, and they earn higher alphas, consistent with benefits from this allocation of resources. For the underlying firms, the presence of actively voting funds mitigates the influence of ISS and helps sway shareholder votes toward value-maximizing outcomes.","[Iliev, Peter] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lowry, Michelle] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Drexel University,"Lowry, M (通讯作者)，Drexel Univ, LeBow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",michelle.lowry@drexel.edu,,,Smeal Research Grants Program,Smeal Research Grants Program,"We thank the Smeal Research Grants Program for generously providing funding for this project.

We find that sentiment, proxied by percentage of investors who are bullish on the market, is significantly negatively related to the subsequent three- and six-month performance of the market. The negative relationship is consistent with the contrarian notion of sentiment. In other words, high (low) levels of bullishness tend to be followed by subsequent low (high) returns. This is true even with the inclusion of standard control explanatory variables (Fama-French [1993]). While the significant results hold for the overall market, they are clearly driven by growth, rather than value stocks. Contrary to some earlier studies, we also note significant explanatory power for sentiment when looking at returns of small-, mid-, and large-cap growth stocks. We also noted that the long-term moving average of monthly bullishness increased from 33.3% to 39.0% over the last 18years. In our study period, about 5% of the total sentiment observations are above 56% (very bullish) and about 5% are below 27% (quite bearish). Finally, we find some strength in the lagged autocorrelation structure for the sentiment variable that lasts for just about three to nine months.","[Waggle, Doug] Univ W Florida, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA; [Agrrawal, Pankaj] Univ Maine, Orono, ME 04469 USA",State University System of Florida; University of West Florida; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono,"Waggle, D (通讯作者)，Univ W Florida, Finance, 11000 Univ Pkwy, Pensacola, FL 32514 USA.",dwaggle@uwf.edu,"Agrrawal, Pankaj/AAM-6317-2020","Agrrawal, Pankaj/0000-0002-8617-433X",,,,,22,12,14,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The academic inclusion of fear on the financial markets is realized by the use of the concept of utility in a field that became mostly empirical in the development of modern finance. The creation of models on financial markets takes into account the so-called downside volatility reaction, as a stylized fact defined as the negative correlation between the return of a financial asset and the volatility of that asset. Our paper aims to measure this asymmetric volatility effect on the dynamics of Eastern European stock markets by using a wide set of GARCH models with coefficients for the effect of asymmetry and to detect its connection with the development of the macroeconomic environment.

Although it is generally considered that the European Union would not have great problems as regards food security from the supply availability point of view, the income gaps and poverty of certain categories of the population may raise problems with regard to the population's access to food and threaten the food security in certain poorer EU member states, among which Romania is most often mentioned. This paper makes an estimation of the food demand system parameters in Romania on the basis of the AIDS (Almost Ideal Demand System) model. This model was used for the analysis of food demand in different countries of the world, both in the developing countries, for the identification of vulnerable population categories from the food security point of view, and in the developed countries in order to know the population's consumption behaviour. The data from the Household Budget Survey from the 1st quarter of the year 2011 have been used. The food demand system parameters are determined for the households from the urban and rural areas. The expenditure elasticities are higher in the rural area than in the urban area mainly due to the rural population's lower cash incomes. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Hence, the objective of this study is to provide some preliminary evidence in measuring social values for relevant stakeholders as a result of business activities. In achieving this objective, this study focuses on one aspect of social output, i.e. the development of human capital through the medium of entrepreneurship education at the university for a group of small entrepreneurs. The findings revealed that social output/values are measurable and can be used in enhancing support for the organisations, particularly the provision of Islamic-based micro-finance and other forms of Islamic fundings such as waqf, zakah and saddaqa (charity) as well as the formulation of relevant strategic models in support of developing Islamic-based sustainable organisations.

Nowadays, one of the basic requirements on the company is creation of value for the shareholders and that is why managers have adopted value-oriented methods to be able to measure any change of value. In the past, managers of many companies were focused on the main economic objective which they considered to be the maximization of profits. But this attitude was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of shareholders, because their preferences lie in the value of the company. There will be described the most common value-oriented indicator, economic value added (EVA), in the article. The developer of the EVA concept is Stern Stewart & Company. They criticized the traditional indicators as ROA, ROI, PAT, EPS etc. for their characteristic and the weak explanatory power in terms of value creation. Company valuation through EVA is an appropriate mean to determine creditworthiness of a company. The EVA calculation also provides valuable information for various areas of management. This metric is quantifying the value that was added as a result of the implementation of operational activities during the reference period.

As a result of the application of the new standard, it is expected that more leases will be activated on the balance sheet on the lessees' side. It is probable that the most significant impact will be observable in the case of companies where operating leases are major sources of financing (e.g. transport companies, airlines). The paper deals with the potential impact of the new methodology for lease reporting in one the most affected industries. The aim is not only the calculation of the financial impact and its comparison with the current standards but also the definition of the economic consequences for lessees. In the frame of methodology the selected financial ratios which are supposed to be influenced by the new treatments are used for research.

Second, individualism and uncertainty avoidance influence the precautionary motive for holding cash. Third, firms in individualistic states in the United States hold less cash than firms in collectivistic states. Fourth, we show that individualism is positively related to the firm's capital expenditures, acquisitions, and repurchases while uncertainty avoidance is negatively related.

More efficient outcomes can be achieved by supplementing the emissions tax with direct regulation of abatement technology, or by combining the tax with an abatement technology investment subsidy.

Although the interventions of these institutions in Romania have frequently been subject to public scrutiny, to the author's knowledge the opinions and experiences of local specialists and decision makers have been scarcely investigated in a structured manner. The context of the study lies in the deep transformations of the Romanian economical and political environment in the 1990s, which have been significantly shaped by external influences. The study aims to provide a systematization of the main perspectives on the interaction between the international institutions and Romanian decision makers during this period. Therefore, the main method of study is represented by a critical review of the economic and political literature related to the Romanian transition. The literature available on the subject shows a variety of approaches and levels of analysis. As a consequence, the review is structured based on the personal positioning of the authors (decision makers, academics, foreign observers) and the way they position themselves regarding the research topic (critics, supporters, neutral observers).

The first regime is a return to the high and volatile inflation rate of the 1970s. The second regime, the one expected by most Federal Reserve officials and business economists, is a return to the credible low inflation policy that characterized the U.S. economy from 1983 to 2007, a period known as the Great Moderation. The third regime is one in which policymakers keep policy interest rates at or near zero for the foreseeable future; Japanese data are used to estimate this regime. These time-series models include four variables: per capita gross domestic product growth, consumer price index inflation, the policy rate, and the 10-year government bond rate. These models are used to forecast the U.S. economy from 2008 through 2013 and represent the possible outcomes for interest rates that may follow the return of monetary policy to normal. Here, normal depends on the policy regime that follows the liftoff of the federal funds rate target expected in mid-2015.","[Cooke, Diana A.; Gavin, William T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Cooke, DA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,,,,,19,3,4,0,5,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Namely, modern companies face serious risks and in that situation employees are under the pressure most, since their knowledge and skills are treated as the key factors to the organization success. Besides, pressured by the global competition and need in higher level of flexibility, companies are starting to experiment with the horizontal organizational structures, which makes employees more interdependent and responsible in the decision making process. Employee structure in modern companies has become diverse. Namely, there are a growing number of people from culturally different regions with different level of education and socio-economic background that become the members of organizations. Such diversity leads to the appearance of various types of conflicts that did not exist in the period when labor force was characterized by homogeneity. All this along with the fact that BiH companies passed through a difficult transition period, functioning under unfavorable socio-economic conditions makes clear that conflicts are inevitable. This emphasizes the need for focusing the research attention on the phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the strategies for managing conflicts in BiH companies. The paper presents a part of results of the empirical research conducted in 100 BiH companies, with the questionnaire as a data collection instrument for the survey that included managers as target group. The research results indicate that the strategies face to face discussion (86.8%) and negotiation (78.6%) are the most frequent forms used for conflict management, whereas the strategies of coercion (20.5%) and delusion (3.4) are the strategies least used in conflict management in BiH companies.","[Delic, Adisa; Smajlovic, Selma] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg; [Mahmutovic, Isada] Elektroremont Dd, Banovici, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Delic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",adisa.delic@untz.ba; mahmutovic.isada@hotmail.com; selma.smajlovic@untz.ba,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,3,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,521,534,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700032,0

Yet, most academic studies focus on dairy cattle and neglect that many smallholder farmers in mixed-cropping systems prefer goats, sheep, pigs or poultry over cattle. Using a unique dataset from a national representative agricultural survey in Burundi, we estimate the determinants of livestock keeping with a multivariate probit model. We find that wealthier households keep more livestock, but population density and access to markets are also key determinants. Moreover, even the wealthiest households switch from cattle to smaller animals in densely populated regions, where pressure on land is high and access to pastures limited. This has important policy implications since it questions the emphasis of most development programs by NGOs and governments in Sub-Saharan Africa which promote dairy cattle.","[Desiere, Sam; D'Haese, Marijke] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Niragira, Sanctus] Univ Burundi, Dept Agr Econ, Bujumbura, Burundi",Ghent University,"Desiere, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",sam.desiere@ugent.be; sanctus.niragira@ugent.be; marijke.dhaese@ugent.be,,"Desiere, Sam/0000-0001-7167-8466; D'Haese, Marijke/0000-0002-0544-3420",Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) within the project PAIOSA (FOCRA),Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) within the project PAIOSA (FOCRA),"This research was supported by the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) within the project PAIOSA (FOCRA).

The comparison of the most established benchmark with the less well known price index is performed to determine the nature of the price differential and causality between them, using the high frequency commodity market data. Using sample from September 2009 to December 2013 in weekly frequency, there is a significant non-zero price differential (around 1.6 USD per barrel) between the two series, but we attribute this difference primarily to the difference in the oil blend quality. We find that the Russian market can be considered integrated with world oil market. We also find, rather surprisingly, the Urals is weakly exogenous in the VECM model, while Brent responds to changes in equilibrium. Causality tests confirm that the causal relationship likely is from Urals to Brent, rather than vice versa.","[Hajko, Vladimir; Neubauer, Jiri] Univ Def, Dept Econometr, Fac Mil Leadership, Kounicova 156-65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic",University of Defence - Czech Republic,"Hajko, V (通讯作者)，Univ Def, Dept Econometr, Fac Mil Leadership, Kounicova 156-65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic.",vladimir.hajko@unob.cz; jiri.neubauer@unob.cz,"Hajko, Vladimir/I-4626-2018; Neubauer, Jiří/AAX-8443-2021","Hajko, Vladimir/0000-0002-4089-979X; Neubauer, Jiří/0000-0003-2497-2739",,,,,23,0,0,0,5,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,257,265,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000029,0

Different from conventional financial institutions, the IFIs has a group of Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) to act as the governance decision maker and a gate keeper to the institutions in ensuring that IFIs will comply with the Shariah laws. Thus, the corporate governance dimension in this study includes the size of SSB in addition to the size of board members, the number of independent directors, and the aspects of environmental, social, and profit in the IFIs' mission and/or vision. A total sample of 82 IFIs in Gulf Council Cooperation (GCC) and Non-GCC countries were examined. The study found that the board size, directors' independence, and the aspects of environmental, social and profit in the mission and/or vision have positive relationship for IFIs in GCC countries. However, the size of SSB is found to have insignificant relationship with the sustainability practices of IFIs. The country of origin is found to have a moderating role on the relationships between all of the corporate governance dimensions with sustainability practices except for the size of SSB and sustainability practices relationship.

His model is based on the assumption that every effect caused by humans is to be foreseen and unsurprising. Under the auspices of discrete discontinuities in economic, political, technical and social affairs, they can be noticed before they come into existence as a whole. The printing and packaging industry that process food packaging operate their businesses within a complex, strict set of regulations and industrial guidelines. These ruling frameworks ensure that packaging does not negatively impact the products. Swiss studies have shown that cardboard boxes made from recycled paper fibres can contain significant portions of mineral oil. Animal feeding studies have proven that mineral oil mixtures are stored in the body. They can lead to accumulations and damage. The increase of food-packaging migration alerts in recent times has been highlighted by NGOs' and the media. The German legislator has decided to act with a national approach towards stringent consumer protection. This paper aims to give an overview of the current status of the German Ink and Mineral Oil Ordinance in relation to recent and future risk management within the paper-based packaging supply chain. A possible European spill over will be highlighted. The paper aims to give recommendations for action towards adjusted and more suitable behaviour. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this paper, we are concerned with the distribution of the extreme daily returns of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index. Three well-known distributions in extreme value theory, i.e., Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Logistic (GL) and Generalized Pareto distributions, are employed to model the SSE Composite index returns based on the data from 1991 to 2013. The parameters for each distribution are estimated by using the Power Weighted Method (PWM). Our results indicate that the GL distribution is a better fit for the minima series and that the GEV distribution is a better fit for the maxima series of the returns for the Chinese stock market. This is in contrast to the findings for other markets, such as the US and Singapore markets. Our results are robust regardless of the introduction of stock movement restriction and the global financial crisis. Further, the implications of our findings for risk management are discussed.

Each kind of construction project has its own characteristics and complexities whereas then specific management approaches and solutions are needed. Regarding the rapid development of cities, underground constructions at urban regions, such as metro construction, have been largely used for extending daily human life into underground spaces. Therefore, the recognition of the complex elements of a metro construction can play a significant role in its management and planning. The aim of this study is to investigate these complexities in subway construction. This may develop the possibility of high predictability for these challenges. As metro projects are also urban underground projects, both internal and external issues are studied and their impacts on project management are discussed. It is concluded that exceptional differences in the managing and planning of these constructions is that combined internal and external complexities are carried out simultaneously.

Second, we carry out cluster analysis to 'map' the world through the eyelets of these proxy measures.

The microeconomic data are provided by the Bankscope database, macroeconomic shocks and fiscal data are drawn from Eurostat on-line database. We employ robust OLS estimator to identify the main determinants of bank lending activities. The results confirm significant impact of macroeconomic shocks, banking controls and fiscal variables on European lending activity. Not surprisingly, the impact of monetary policy interest rates is debatable. Instead, central bank financial assets played an important role in the process of bank lending activities. In case of fiscal policy, indirect taxes had a negative impact on lending activities and direct taxes proved to be non-significant; i.e. governments should assist the central bank to support lending activities by lowering the indirect taxes.","[Kucerova, Zuzana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 72100, Czech Republic; [Kucerova, Zuzana; Kapounek, Svatopluk] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Mendel University in Brno,"Kucerová, Z (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 72100, Czech Republic.",zuzana.kucerova@vsb.cz; kapounek@mendelu.cz,"Kucerova, Zuzana/K-6162-2018; Kapounek, Svatopluk/I-8419-2012","Kucerova, Zuzana/0000-0001-6888-9262; Kapounek, Svatopluk/0000-0001-5206-977X",Czech Science Foundation [P403/14-28848S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This paper was financially supported by the Czech Science Foundation via grant No. P403/14-28848S Financial Crisis, Depreciation and Credit Crunch in CEECs.",,15,0,0,0,1,EUROPEAN ASSOC COMENIUS-EACO,BRNO,"PEKARSKA 18, BRNO, 602 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-905405-1-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,71,80,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM2GW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000461004000008,0

After the first oil shock, however, the Greek economy embarked on a long period of deindustrialization in favor of services. Agriculture, although it gradually declined its GDP share as it was expected due to economic growth, it managed to maintain its important role in employment, increased until 1994 its output in constant terms, and kept it constant until 2000. After that year agriculture's output started to decline, especially after 2006 with the implementation of the new Common Agriculture Policy. The current level of agriculture output is below that in 1970 while it contributes to GDP less than 3%. The current paper investigates the reasons of the recent agriculture's collapse, and it identifies long term determinates of the decline of agriculture's competitiveness. It attributes the decline not to the economic recession Greek economy has been experiencing since 2008 with the exception perhaps of a further increase in production costs due to rising energy costs and taxation, while producer prices remained rather constant, but to the lack of technological and organizational improvements, the failure to differentiate production in favor of high value added crops, all together leading Greek agriculture to fail establishing linkages with the other economic sectors, which finally made the sector incapable of being a positive factor of economic growth.

A qualitative descriptive model has been proposed to show official phases of public procurement - T-1 (pre-bidding), T-2 (bidding), T-3 (post-bidding). Moreover, two additional phases have been identified as: T-0 in which the corrupt actors enter the process (before the advertisement of the public tender) and the T-4 phase during which the corrupting parties work out their mutual obligations among each other which were stipulated in the collusive agreements made in the T-0 phase.","[Langr, Ivan; Ochrana, Frantisek] Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Social & Econ Strategies, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11000, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Langr, I (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Social & Econ Strategies, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague 11000, Czech Republic.",ivan.langr@volny.cz; ochrana@fsv.cuni.cz,"Ochrana, Frantisek/E-9765-2018; Langr, Ivan/AAE-9902-2019; Langr, Ivan/G-7449-2017","Langr, Ivan/0000-0003-0792-5666; Langr, Ivan/0000-0003-0792-5666",,,,,26,4,4,1,3,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Besides, sufficient similarities between the two industries were assessed and the applicability of the findings from the cases in the oil and gas industry was assessed. The selected cases (the ongoing projects) have several principal similarities, but the extents of use differ. The project execution model (PEM) of the oil and gas industry is based on codified knowledge from project execution, which makes it easier to transfer such models to other industries. The use of 3D design environments or building information modeling (BIM) in the construction industry is similar to the use of PEMs in the oil and gas industry but BIM differs on model complexity and object information. The findings indicate that it may be possible to develop generalizable project execution concepts in the oil and gas industry by using the conceptual generalisation theory. Indeed, it is herein proposed that the high-similarity between the variables related to PEM and BIM enables the transfer and adaptability of PEM-based concepts to the construction industry.

The green marketing includes more than just a simple building of corporate image. It becomes a modern mean of the enforcement of actual environmental trends to a broad spectrum of business activities. The field of action of green marketing tools is relatively extensive, starting with the protection of environment, production and sale of products and services with ecological conditions and requirements, through the final consumption of environmentally friendly products, which affects the quality of life and health of the whole society. The paper in brief presents the results of the marketing survey that was focused on finding how chosen Slovak companies applied principles of green marketing and used green marketing tools within their business activities, if ever.

Management nowadays is probably the biggest safety threat in the history of human evolution.","[Novak, Jaromir] Univ Palackeho Olomouci, Fak Telesne Kultury, Trida Miru 117, Olomouc 77111, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Novák, J (通讯作者)，Univ Palackeho Olomouci, Fak Telesne Kultury, Trida Miru 117, Olomouc 77111, Czech Republic.",jarminov@seznam.cz,,,,,,,5,1,1,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-145-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,515,521,,,,,,7,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BE3SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371199400068,0

The aim of this article is also to attempt to show how a present system of LSG ORvn in these two types of local self-governments have responded to crisis. LSG budgets need relatively stable revenues to sustain their responsibilities so LSG revenues should be also fairly resistant to crisis and should not overreact to economic fluctuations. The analysis of accessible financial budget data proved that the most vital revenues in the case of investigated types of municipalities are shares from PIT, CIT, real estate tax, tax on transportation vehicles, agricultural and forest taxes and revenues from LSG property. The estimates come from financial reports from The Regional Chamber of Audit. To compare the meaning and importance of these revenues a comparative analysis has been carried out. Maximum, minimum and medians estimates, but also the first and the third quartiles separately for all urban and all rural LSG in 2006-2014 have been taken into consideration. There are presented among others: a share of ORvn in total revenues (TRvn) in the consequent years, changes in TRvn in urban and rural LSG, differences between growth rate of own-median and total-median LSG revenues and other main revenues share in ORvn of LSG. Shares of LSG ORvn in TRvn were changing more in urban LSG than in rural ones. The average growth of it was slower than the average growth of TRvn 2008-2010 mostly in urban LSG. The main reason of it was a big share in TRvn of PIT and CIT shares. This suggests that income taxes are not a stable and efficient source of ORvn during a crisis time. Introduction or acquisition of new ORvn is problematic because: (i) there is a relatively low acceptance of sharing other than direct taxes between central and local government, (ii) there is no space for new sources of revenue for local government, (iii) tax base of different types of LSG is also different between each type.","[Olejniczak, Jaroslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroslaw.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,12,4,4,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,324,331,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600036,0

Also, appropriate asset weight rebalancing has allowed for higher returns and achievement of long-term investment objectives.

In this paper, we focus on how leadership competence at middle-manager level, e.g. site managers, may be enhanced and we examine how higher education may address this need. The overall aim is to suggest how leadership development may be introduced and/or improved in programs and courses. Rather than using a questionnaire or individual interviews, the data was collected in three focus groups. Each group addressed one level of higher education: vocational, bachelor and master, respectively, and included practitioner, teacher and student stakeholders. The focus groups were recorded. The field notes and the photographic documentation strengthened the reliability of our interpretations. The paper describes how focus groups were used, discusses the aggregated findings from the groups and suggests some ways in which education curricula can be improved to incorporate transferable leadership development and competence to contexts in which graduates will operate.

We augment the generalized autoregressive score (GAS) model of Creal et al. (2013) with high frequency measures such as realized correlation to obtain a GRAS model. We find that the inclusion of realized measures significantly improves the in-sample fit of dynamic copula models across a range of U.S. equity returns. Moreover, we find that out-of-sample density forecasts from our GRAS models are superior to those from simpler models. Finally, we consider a simple portfolio choice problem to illustrate the economic gains from exploiting high frequency data for modeling dynamic dependence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we investigate the dynamics of a nonlinear discrete-time duopoly game with differentiated goods, linear demand and quadratic cost functions. The game is modeled with a system of two difference equations. Existence and stability of equilibria of this system are studied. We show that the model gives more complex chaotic and unpredictable trajectories as a consequence of change in the parameter of horizontal product differentiation and a higher (lower) degree of product differentiation (weaker or fiercer competition) destabilize (stabilize) the economy. The chaotic features are justified numerically via computing Lyapunov numbers and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Also, we show that in the case of quadratic costs there are stable trajectories and a higher (lower) degree of product differentiation does not tend to destabilize the economy. (C) 2015 The Authors.

As a result of privatisation a lot of firms had been changing their legal form. Before 1989 in agriculture cooperatives were the usual legal form. Nowadays Joint Stock Company and Limited Liability Companies dominate. This paper examines the impact of legal form of agricultural farms on agency costs for a panel of Slovak agricultural farms. We assume that the legal form of a farm determinates the level of the agency costs. There were three measures used: the ratio of operational expanses to annual sales, sales-to-total assets ratio and return on equity. Using MANCOVA and ANCOVA techniques, we find that the legal form of a farm is a relevant determinant of agency costs level. We also conclude that the use of operational expanses to annual sales ratio is recommended only in industries in which its mean value in long run is lower than 1.","[Toth, Marian; Piterkova, Andrea] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Munk, Michal] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Informat, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra,"Tóth, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",marian.toth@uniag.sk; mmunk@ukf.sk; radovan.savov@uniag.sk; xpiterkovaa@uniag.sk,"Munk, Michal/AAE-7199-2020; Toth, Marian/H-4857-2016; Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Munk, Michal/N-1724-2017; Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019","Munk, Michal/0000-0002-9913-3596;",,,,,20,2,2,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,471,478,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600054,0

It takes AMT vehicles' first gear shifting to second gear as an example to research the effect of each duty parameter on the noise fluctuation between the shifting.","Jiangxi Univ Technol, Automot Engn Inst, Nanchang 330098, Peoples R China",,"Zhou, JK (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Technol, Automot Engn Inst, Nanchang 330098, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,1365,1369,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700267,0

We develop a model to derive how much distortions a government would introduce when it cares about price stability in a situation with limited policy options. We show that there is a trade-off and identify the optimal combination of distortions and stability for given international price shocks and interest groups preferences for stability. We compare these theoretical findings with empirical indicators on actual government interventions in staple food markets. We find that several countries have been able to reduce (short run) price volatility in the domestic markets while at the same time allowing structural (medium and long term) price changes to pass through to producers and consumers. However, this is not the general case. For many countries, even when explicitly taking into account the trade-off (and the benefits of reducing volatility) government policies appear far removed from the optimal trade-off and there appears to be much room for policy improvement.

The historical record has been interpreted to identify future trends and challenges related to food labelling. These challenges are arising in Thailand and many similar emerging economies. Thailand has a good reputation in world food markets and is now becoming a global leader in food production and export. It has become deeply involved with regulations and standards applied by World Trade Organization and Codex Alimentarius while serving its own population with a safe and secure food supply. For consumers considering Thai food products, food labels can provide useful nutrition information and help build trust. Thais began a century ago with policies and laws to enhance food safety and to protect Thai consumers. During the lengthy journey from national to global standards Thai food labels have evolved and now contribute to international food labelling policies. This contribution comes from the perspective of a leading middle income south-east Asian food producer now trading with high income countries around the world. The story of that journey - a case study for many other countries in a similar situation - has not previously been told. This article provides information for policy makers dealing with food labelling, embedding trends and tensions for one middle income food exporter in a long history. Information captured here should be helpful for other middle income countries, especially those with limited records. This strategic knowledge will enable better decisions for future policies.

Little is understood about its effect on obesity. Using data from 14,976 participants aged two and older in the 2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey, this paper examines patterns of processed food consumption and their impacts on obesity while considering the endogeneity of those who purchase processed foods. A major assumption of our analysis of the impact of processed foods on overweight and obesity was that the consumption of processed foods is endogenous due to their accessibility and urbanicity levels. The results show that 74.5% of participants consumed processed foods, excluding edible oils and other condiments; 28.5% of participants' total daily energy intake (El) was from processed foods. Children and teenagers in megacities had the highest proportion of El (40.2%) from processed foods. People who lived in megacities or highly urbanized neighborhoods with higher incomes and educational achievement consumed more processed foods. When controlling for endogeneity, only the body mass index (BMI) and risk of being overweight of children ages two to eighteen are adversely associated with processed foods (+4.97 BMI units, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.66-8.28; odds ratio (OR) = 3.63,95% Cl: 1.45-9.13). Processed food purchases represent less than a third of current Chinese food purchases. However, processed food purchases are growing at the rate of 50% per year, and we must begin to understand the implications for the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We review studies published between 2007 and 2014 that estimate the effects of U.S. corn ethanol policy on corn prices and find estimates ranging from nil to over 80%. Such divergent results make it difficult to assess the merits of alternative biofuel policies. To bring more clarity to the issue and facilitate comparisons across studies, we assemble a database of over 150 medium-to-long run estimates of the effect of corn ethanol production on corn prices from 29 published studies. We first normalize corn price impacts by the change in corn ethanol volume to control for the large differences in ethanol quantities across scenarios. We then conduct a meta-analysis to identify the factors that drive the remaining variation in corn price impacts across studies. In addition to ethanol volumes, we find that modeling framework, projection year, inclusion of ethanol co-products, and biofuel production from other feedstocks explain much of the differences in price effects. The results indicate that a one billion gallon expansion of the US corn ethanol mandate in the year 2015 would lead to a three to four percent increase in corn prices, with smaller price changes projected in future years.

In this paper, a typical case of a scandal concerning set-style yogurt and jelly event reported by a micro-blog was studied and analyzed in terms of its dissemination mode and the mechanism of how a micro-blog from opinion leaders affected public attention. Related sales data of set-style yogurt and jelly products were obtained after the event from a supermarket corporation in Beijing and used to analyze trends affected by the scandal. The results indicate that in the new media age, we media has greatly increased dissemination of the voices of opinion leaders and triggered large-scale communication of food safety messages to the public. In this serious information asymmetry situation between public and food manufacturer, food-safety scandals revealed by we media could easily be noticed by consumers and further affect their judgments of expected utility and their purchasing behavior. Sales volume decreases and negative influence on brand reputation might contribute to correcting food manufacturers' behavior. We media could be an effective tool to improve the food-safety status of the market. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts to reduce childhood obesity have increasingly targeted improvements to school meal programs. In particular, in the United States, the landmark 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) marked the first substantial changes to federal school food policy in recent years to enhance the quality of school meals. Despite these federal policy changes including mandated nutritional improvements and increased federal funding for farm to school programs that can help schools meet the new nutritional standards, there is still significant variation in the prevalence of farm to school programs across the United States. Theories of the policy process suggest that federal policies can vary by state in their implementation and impact, with state-level factors influencing this variation. This paper quantitatively explores the effect of both federal legislation through vertical diffusion and state-level internal determinants on farm to school rates across the country. My findings reveal that state affluence and the average farm to school rate of a state's regional peers emerge as the most significant, positive predictors of state-level farm to school rates. This research sheds light on the current nature of school food programs in the United States that provide critical nutrition to millions of school children each day, and suggests a need for additional research exploring the linkages between federal policy, state level factors, and local implementation of school food programs.

Despite these significant shifts in governing arrangements however, little work has been conducted regarding how consumers respond to, resist and/or engage with these new governance systems in everyday, non-crisis contexts. As such, this paper explores the everyday governance of food risk from the perspective of those whose voices typically go unheard in food policymaking processes - consumers. Drawing on empirical results from focus groups conducted with publics across the Republic of Ireland, consumer perceptions, priorities and lived experiences relating to food risk governance, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) in particular, are explored. This analysis is couched within a normative frame of multi-scalar governance and what makes it 'good' or effective. Accordingly, the paper advances food risk policy debates through a. lens of normative good food risk governance, including analysis of the perceived accountability, transparency and effectiveness of Irish food risk governing structures from a consumer perspective. Identifying limitations in current governing regimes, the paper concludes by critically reflecting on the opportunities and challenges for adopting more adaptive forms of governance in the multi-scalar and evolving policy context that typifies food risk.

First, we specify a physiological model of weight gain with which we show that average differences in caloric intake and physical activity are much too small to explain the weight difference. Second, we estimate regression models that show SNAP participation is not associated with changes in energy balance (i.e., caloric intake and physical activity).

We single out some stylized facts on food global value chains and the Italian food industry. Exploiting a very rich and original dataset, based on a 2011 survey of 25,090 Italian firms operating in manufacturing and related services, we characterize the food industry, describing its main strengths and weaknesses, and analyze the links between the probability to export and the value chain participation. Our results show that participating in a value chain significantly increases the probability to export. This is particularly true for small firms in the industrial food value chain and for firms positioned downstream. Participating in distribution chains, for instance being able to sell products through large supermarkets, also significantly contributes to internationalization. These results can have important implications in terms of trade policy: tariffs and other protection measures are cumulative when intermediate inputs are traded across borders multiple times. Hence, protection can end up in a significantly higher cost of finished goods. When discussing trade policy therefore, it is crucial to think value chain.

In this study, participants (nine hundred Japanese women) were presented with explanations of pesticide residue either in written form only or in written form accompanied by a visual aid (functional graph or illustration), and were asked to make judgments on safety for foods that have pesticide residue. Findings through a web-based survey showed that judgments on food safety were highly difficult for laypeople since they had little knowledge of the technical terms used to describe amounts of pesticide residue. We found that although a visual aid showing their functional relationship did not improve understanding of the technical terms, an illustrated visual aid led to both improved understanding and more accurate judgments on safety. We also found that although cognitive traits measured with the subjective numeracy scale (Fagerlin et al., 2007b) and the Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick, 2005) correlated with judgments on food safety, the judgments were improved with the use of visual aids regardless of cognitive traits. These results show that while not all visual aids enhance understanding of food safety information, appropriately designed visual aids do, and that cognitive traits producing individual differences in judgments on food safety should be taken into account when considering how food safety information should be conveyed.

It discusses how the concept of trust has been treated in the literature and identifies concepts of institutional trust and generalized trust that permeate much of the trust literature. An introduction to the five papers in the special section is provided and common themes across the papers are identified. The papers in the special section provide new empirical insights into the drivers and outcomes of consumer trust in food, with applications to environmental attributes, nanotechnology and functional food, as well as a focus on the relationship between firm-level initiatives (cause-related marketing, branding) and consumer trust. A common policy theme throughout the papers, across different study contexts and in different countries, is that institutional trust remains important and is a shared responsibility across public and private sector actors.

One common concern is that nutrition and health claims create 'magic bullet' or 'halo' effects that lead consumers to believe that a food carrying such a claim is healthier than it actually is. Five experiments were carried out to examine the extent to which nutrition and health claims used in marketing communication affect consumer judgments of food healthfulness. The studies manipulated both explicit health and nutrition claims and implied claims related to suggestive brand names, package design, and imagery. The results show that health and nutrition claims might not be as misleading as suspected. In fact, the studied claims had little effect on consumer judgments of food healthfulness. The claims, however, had detrimental effects on sensory expectations and purchase intentions for the carrier products. These effects were found both for misleading claims as well as for officially approved claims intended to guide consumer food choice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In 8 districts of Odisha, popularly known as the Kalahandi-Balangir-Koraput (KBK) region which is notable for extreme poverty and starvation deaths, the government did away with the targeted food assistance program in 2008 and made the scheme universal. Using a Difference-in-Difference methodology over two repeated cross sectional household surveys, this article finds that the shift from targeted to a universal food security program in the KBK region of Odisha has led to an improvement in the household nutritional intake and diet quality. Further examination suggests that proportion of households consuming below the recommended dietary allowance of calorie, fats and protein has declined significantly in this region post the intervention.

Since these activities often bring new risks, an understanding of cropland decisions and how these interact with shocks is valuable. This paper uses data from Mozambique to examine the effect of weather shocks on cropland decisions. We account for the bounded nature of land shares and estimate a Pooled Fractional Probit model for panel data. Our results show that crop choice is sensitive to past weather shocks. Farmers shift land use away from cash and permanent crops one year after a drought and from horticulture and permanent crop after a flood. However, this reallocation seems temporary as farmers devote less land to staples after two periods. This is consistent with the aim of maintaining a buffer stock of staples for home consumption.

Using a new survey-based index, the women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, we conduct individual-level analyses of nutrition-related indicators including exclusive breastfeeding, children's dietary diversity score, minimum dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet, children's height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age z-scores, and women's dietary diversity score and body mass index. Results suggest that women's empowerment is more strongly associated with the quality of infant and young child feeding practices and only weakly associated with child nutrition status. Women's empowerment in credit decisions is positively and significantly correlated with women's dietary diversity, but not body mass index. This suggests that improved nutritional status is not necessarily correlated with empowerment across all domains, and that these domains may have different impacts on nutrition. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Some practitioners and advocates charge that regulations are unfairly slanted against smaller producers and favor large food manufacturers. Studies of regulatory implementation have suggested that inspection practices offer possible policy accommodations to small food businesses. Yet there has been little research on food safety inspections of small processors. This article describes a study of food safety inspections of small processors in the US state of Michigan. Interactions between inspectors and processors were explored using a qualitative ethnographic approach. Results indicate that these interactions have the potential to achieve accommodative regulatory outcomes. Inspectors took a collaborative, assistive approach which appeared to benefit processor operations as well as improve compliance. These results have implications for policymaking for small processors, and they lay the groundwork for further research on food safety regulatory implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is usually assumed that markets are perfectly competitive, an assumption that is violated in the presence of parastatals. They often play multiple roles in meeting the objectives of government policy through their activities in procurement and distribution of food commodities. After presenting a general framework, we modify it to model the specifics of the Food Corporation of India and the functions that it fulfils in providing price support to farmers and food security to poor households. Keeping the government's policy objectives unchanged, we then alter the functions that the FCI fulfils to be consistent with recommendations from the High Level Committee that recently investigated the role of the FCI. These recommendations included the substitution of negotiable warehouse receipts for the Minimum Support Price scheme for farmers, and the substitution of cash transfers in place of the Targeted Public Distribution System for poor households. We find that this re-instrumentation of the means of achieving policy objectives, together with a consequent greater role for the private sector, leads to substantial welfare gains as well as to greater food security when measured as food availability.

First, it provides a comprehensive review of different approaches to analysing food security. Second, it highlights the added value provided by the capability approach and the human development paradigm. Third, it proposes a methodology to assess food security through this approach. Our proposal entails three basic steps: (1) analysis of food entitlements; (2) analysis of nutritional capabilities and (3) analysis of the capability to be food secure. In this way, we can move beyond income, entitlement or livelihood related frameworks, and identify the root causes of food insecurity. Food insecurity can be the result of a lack of education, health or other basic capabilities that constitute people's wellbeing. This, therefore, allows situating the study within the broader area of wellbeing and development. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This South-South Cooperation enterprise has shown intentions to share elements drawn from previous experiences of programmes implemented in Brazil, particularly in the rural sector. However, Brazilian agricultural policy is notorious for its dualistic structure, and dominant political strategy has been marked by the accommodation of two different occasionally contradictory-agricultural policy agendas, reflecting how current political forces are organized. This article demonstrates how such a dualistic structure shapes Brazil's technical cooperation with Mozambique, pointing out that it is still unclear how far rural development perspectives rooted in the particularities of Brazilian agrarian dynamics would be useful for projects implemented in different rural contexts. We argue that, since Mozambican agricultural plans primarily emphasize a perspective that focuses on market-oriented agricultural modernization, a potential reform of the current cooperation policy toward more inclusive agenda, focused on family farming, faces political economy constraints. We conclude that the appropriation of a foreign project relies on the political economy dynamics of related contexts and power relations of involved stakeholders, an area that could deserve further attention from researchers investigating Brazil-Mozambique relations.

One way to increase food security in small island states is to develop local food sectors by increasing consumers' awareness about local products with sustainable characteristics. We designed an economic experiment to assess consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for yams with sustainable characteristics: the origin, the intrinsic quality of an alternative variety and the mode of production. The results showed that labelling significantly changes consumers' valuation of the different yam profiles. Consumers' WTP for local yams (2.85 (sic) kg(-1)) was significantly higher than for imported yams (1.80 (sic) kg(-1)), while the organic mode of production derives a significant premium if information on production methods has been disseminated. The results also suggested that organoleptic characteristics of new varieties should not be overlooked. We conclude on how the labelling strategy could be facilitated through a policy targeting the development of the local food sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that approximately 80% of the population would be negatively affected by higher maize prices and that poor households would lose a larger proportion of their welfare than wealthy households. More specifically, rural landless households would lose the most, whereas households with landholdings of five acres or more would gain. We simulate a 25% increase in maize prices and find that rural poverty would increase by approximately 1 percentage point and urban poverty by 0.5 percentage points. Moreover, the impact differs among regions; poverty would increase by 3 percentage points in the rural parts of Coast Province, whereas it would be almost unchanged in the rural parts of Western Province. Furthermore, we relax the standard assumption that consumer and producer prices change in the same proportions and allow for heterogeneity in marketing margins among districts. We demonstrate that relaxing this assumption substantially affects the results and that the results from previous research were thus likely biased. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The diets were based on the principle of 'ecological leftovers' for livestock production, i.e. raising livestock on pasture and by-products not suitable for or wanted by humans. The method was applied to Sweden using three different scenarios for livestock production, all taking the starting point that semi-natural pastures should be grazed by ruminants for reasons of biodiversity conservation. The scenarios also included differing use of by-products (from crop production and food processing) to either boost milk production (I-Milk scenario) or produce eggs and pig meat (E-Milk and Suckler scenarios). In I-Milk, milk and meat were produced in intensive systems in which dairy cows and their offspring only grazed to a limited extent, resulting in the human diet containing recommended levels of dairy products (350 ml milk per day) and meat twice a week. Milk could also be exported. In E-Milk, pasture was used more for dairy cows and their offspring, resulting in fewer animals and less milk (150 ml milk per day) and four servings of meat per week. In the Suckler scenario, pasture was grazed by suckler herds providing no milk but meat four times per week. The environmental impacts of the diets were assessed using the planetary boundaries framework. The results showed substantially lower environmental impacts compared with the average current Swedish diet, but the strict absolute climate boundary and the N and P input boundaries were still exceeded for all diets. The approach adopted, of letting the ecological resource capacity act as the constraining factor for livestock production, is in line with agroecology principles and efficient use of land to improve food security, and could be useful in discussions about sustainable consumption of animal products.

Three meat products (beef, pork and chicken), four dairy products (milk, fermented products, cream and cheese) and four pollutants generating environmental damage (greenhouse gases (GHG), nitrogen, ammonia and phosphorus) were included in the analysis. The unit tax applied corresponded to between 8.9% and 33.3% of the respective price per kg product in 2009. Consumer response to the tax was calculated by econometric estimates of the almost ideal demand system (AIDS) for meat and dairy products, using per capita consumption data and prices.

It is seen primarily as a complementary, rural-targeted strategy for better reaching remote populations. This paper presents an ex ante analysis of HarvestPlus' provitamin A maize (PVAM) in Zambia and highlights an empirical approach based on the Zambian 2005/06 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS). Because more than 115 countries regularly conduct a Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HCES), the approach developed in this LCMS-based study can be applied in many other countries to analyze varietal adoption and conduct ex ante studies. Methods: Data from the LCMS and health statistics were used to characterize baseline indicators of vitamin A intake and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost. The introduction and scaling up of PVAM was modeled based on program plans, expert opinion and data on key adoption parameters. An adoption function was specified and expressed in terms of the percent of farmers expected to adopt PVAM over the next 30 years. A logistic regression adoption function was estimated and used to identify the specific LCMS households adopting, producing and consuming PVAM each year. Information from the IFPRI International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) of yearly maize production and demand were used to produce annual estimates of PVAM planted, harvested and consumed. Taking into account an LCMS-empirically-informed, specified market structure, individuals' additional vitamin A intake was calculated. The number of DALYs saved were estimated using the change in vitamin A intake. Combining these estimates with cost data, the cost-effectiveness of PVAM was calculated. Results: Assuming an adoption ceiling of 20% over 30 years, implementation of PVAM will result in average additional intake of 12% of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), a 3 percentage, point reduction in the prevalence of inadequate intake, and savings of 23% of total DALYs. Impacts are concentrated among farming households that have adopted PVAM and consume it from their own production. Their consumption will result in an average additional vitamin A intake, of 172 mu g/day, more than 3 times the additional 54 mu g/day among the entire population. Among this group, the reduction in the prevalence of inadequate intake will be more than 5 times the national average (17.5 percentage points). Valuing a DALY at $1000, PVAM's cumulative value of DALYs saved comes to exceed its cumulative total costs starting in 2019. Over 30 years the cost-effectiveness of PVAM in Zambia was estimated to be $24 per DALY saved, making it very cost-effective. Conclusion: The methodologies employed in this study provide insights and inputs that can be used to target farmers who are most likely to adopt, to measure their vitamin A intake and to craft messages to promote adoption. PVAM is a long term investment that shows great promise in becoming a highly cost-effective addition to the public health arsenal for combatting micronutrient deficiencies if the 20% adoption rate can be achieved and maintained. Doing so will require effective marketing strategies, including efforts to couple this nutrition-sensitive intervention with nutrition-specific activities, such as targeted nutrition messaging and education, in order to increase the likelihood that adopting farmers will prioritize production for home consumption.

The country is pursuing a major public animal health infrastructure upgrade and is seeking better integration with international public animal health programs. The intent of this article is twofold. We provide an overview of and commentary on China's animal husbandry sector and animal disease control policies. We also assess weaknesses in its animal farm biosecurity infrastructure and institutional underpinnings. China's animal health administration shares institutional weaknesses in common with higher-income countries, but her problems are more pronounced. Administrative failings include poorly demarcated and inconsistent oversight as well as weak accountability. Heterogeneous professional standards in animal health careers, emphasis on quantity goals over qualitative metrics, as well as a want in scientific analysis and follow-through when prioritizing are other shortcomings. Spillovers from the general economy as well as government policies on animal health career professionalization and organization of animal sector production have been, on the whole, positive developments. While animal production is changing in ways that may pose intermediate-term threats to animal and human health, the longer-term outcome is likely to be a production base that poses fewer concerns for global health.

Our new measure of standards restrictiveness is created using maximum residue levels of pesticides for 61 importing countries and 66 different products. The index accounts for both the number of pesticides regulated for each product and the allowable level for those pesticides by each importer. The findings suggest that more restrictive standards are associated, on average, with a lower probability of observing trade. However, after controlling for sample selection and the proportion of exporting firms in a gravity model, the analysis finds that the effect of standards on trade intensity in most cases is indistinguishable from zero. This is consistent with the assumption that meeting stringent standards increases primarily the fixed cost to export to a destination. Once a firm adjusts its production to comply with the standards of a foreign market, those standards do not impact the intensity of exports to that market. Finally, our results suggest that exports from developing countries are particularly constrained by stricter standards.

It draws on political economy and market theory to demonstrate that the loss-averting domestic producer benefits that proponents believe the SSM would offer agricultural-importing developing countries may be illusory, insofar as agricultural-exporting countries also seek to avert producer losses. By way of illustration, the paper then uses time series data to analyze past government responses to fluctuations in the world's rice markets. The results suggest that the proposed SSM would deliver at most only a small fraction of the loss-averting benefits that have been advertised by the proponents of the SSM. Since the analysis applies to upward as well as downward spikes in international prices, it underscores the importance of strengthening multilateral disciplines on both import and export trade interventions to reduce beggar-thy-neighbor unilateral trade policy responses to food price fluctuations.

Investigating the effects in both food and non-food spending categories, I find that the rise in SNAP benefits increased not only food at home expenditures, but also housing, transportation, and education expenditures of SNAP households relative to those of non-SNAP households. Specifically, the SNAP benefit increase leads to the reduced out-of-pocket spending on food for infra-marginal SNAP recipients, and the freed up resources allowed households with bounded budgets to fund other essential needs, such as paying mortgage, rent, utility fee, transportation expenses as well as tuition. Examining non-food expenditures provides a more complete picture of the impact of the SNAP benefit increase by shedding light on the spillover effect of the policy change. The result also derives policy implication on ongoing debate about SNAP allotment generosity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To that end, an increasing stream of public investment has been directed to the grain sector, in the form for example of farm expansion subsidies. Our purpose is to assess the potential impacts of China's farm-scale expansion on both yields and per-hectare economic returns. Analysis of a large sample of farm household production data finds (with some exceptions) that grain yields likely will decline as farm size grows, compromising food self-sufficiency targets. More importantly, in only isolated cases would per-hectare economic returns decline with size. Thus, an emphasis on reducing farmland transactions costs may stimulate cropland consolidation and achieve the desired long-term structural transformation.

If we were able to measure sustainability, business stakeholders could optimize food production chains, consumers could demand products based on reduced environmental and social impacts, and policy makers could intervene to meet the growing demand for food in a context of environmental conservation, population growth, and globalization. We proposed to measure profit adjusted for the negative externalities of production as a promising single metric for benchmarking products in terms of their relative sustainability. The adjusted profit differences between different products are then assessed by means of the Bennet Total Factor Productivity (TFP) indicator and the Total Price Recovery (TPR) indicator to highlight areas for potential sustainability improvement. To illustrate the usefulness of the indicator-based approach, we assessed the relative sustainability of two Brazilian conventional soybean meal chains, non-genetically modified (non-GM) and genetically modified (GM) chains. Based on the results, we indicated potential areas for sustainability improvement. Sustainability issues included in the assessment were profitability, global warming potential, eutrophication potential, environmental toxicity, farmworker toxicity, consumer toxicity, deforestation, and loss of employment. Results showed that the non-GM soybean meal chain is more sustainable than the GM chain (higher adjusted profit due to higher TFP and favorable prices especially for outputs). However, both chains require joint efforts to address their economic, environmental, and social deficiencies. These efforts should focus on providing technical and high quality assistance to reduce biocide use, and improving transportation. The analysis in this study could be extended by undertaking a comparative assessment of the sustainability performance of major soybean meal producers, i.e. United States, Argentina, China, and Brazil. The approach proved to be a promising benchmarking tool for agricultural trade flows. It allows an integrated assessment of the dimensions of sustainability along food chains that is sufficiently flexible to compare the sustainability level of various biomass stocks that are produced in different locations and in a variety of environmental and socio-economic contexts. Nevertheless, it requires consensus on which components of sustainability are to be assessed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The study is based on the Advocacy Coalition Framework and relies on discourse analysis as analytical method. In-depth interviews with policy actors in both countries served as empirical basis. A quantitative analysis of the transcripts was used to identify different discourse coalitions, and a qualitative analysis was conducted to examine the discourses and identify their underlying policy beliefs. The paper identified far-reaching differences in the agricultural policy beliefs between domestic policy makers and donors regarding the question: What does it actually take to develop small-holder agriculture?

In Vietnam the safety of daily vegetables is of great concern to both consumers and policymakers. To mitigate food safety risks, the Vietnamese government enforces rules and regulations and relies strongly on a single approach for organizing food provision; being modernizing retail by replacing wet markets with supermarkets. In general, reorganizing food provision in this way is increasingly considered to be a guarantee for food safety, especially in urban settings with growing populations. To assess the effectiveness of this induced retail modernization of the fresh vegetables market in Vietnam's capital Hanoi, this paper examines for whom and under which conditions does this approach deliver the desired outcomes. The survey data and interviews show that ongoing retail modernization in Hanoi reaches only a minor segment of the population and drives a large group of shoppers into informal vending structures. On the basis of five case studies, this paper demonstrates how similar supermarket interventions can yield contrasting outcomes when they do not accommodate for differences in shopper population and do not adapt to variations in the urban conditions. To reduce exposure to unsafe food, particularly for poorer segments of the population, we conclude that developing a flexible portfolio of retail modernization pathways and adopting a reflexive policy approach provide better impact and leverage, as opposed to the current trend of promoting supermarkets as a single, ideal-type form of food shopping.

Motivated by the need to further investigate the concept, this paper develops a conceptual framework that explores the effects of brand trust, trust in the food system, consumer confidence and brand loyalty. While most extant studies have examined the brand trust-brand loyalty link, this paper proposes that: (i) the impact of brand trust on consumer confidence in brand attributes is mediated by trust in the food system, and (ii) brand trust leads to brand loyalty via consumer confidence. The proposition is tested using Structural Equation Modelling techniques based on survey data from a sample of Canadian consumers of packaged green salad. Results indicate that in a food context, brand trust is positively associated with consumer confidence in brand quality and safety, largely via trust in the food system. Furthermore, confidence in credence attributes is shown to lead to brand loyalty. While previous research conceived brand trust as a multidimensional construct, the analysis suggests that trust in food brands could be better explained by a one-factor model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental evidence from Niger,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Livestock; Household surveys; Livelihoods; Questionnaire design; Milk; Niger,COWS,"Milk is an important source of cash and nutrients for many households in developing countries. Yet, our understanding of the role of dairy production in livelihoods and nutritional outcomes is hindered by the lack of decent quality household survey data. Data on milk off-take for human consumption are difficult to collect in household surveys for a number of reasons which make accurate recall challenging for the respondent (continuous production and seasonality among others), introducing possibly severe biases in the computation of full household incomes and farm sales, as well as in the estimation of the contribution of livestock (specifically dairy) production to agricultural value added and the livelihoods of rural households. This paper presents results from a validation exercise implemented in Niger, where alternative survey instruments based on recall methods were administered to randomly selected households, and compared to a 12-month system of physical monitoring and recording of milk production. The results of the exercise show that reasonably accurate estimates via recall methods are possible, and provide a clear ranking of questionnaire design options that can inform future survey operations.

Plant-based meat substitutes have been identified as healthy sources of protein that, in comparison to meat, offer a number of social, environmental and health benefits and may play a role in reducing meat consumption. However, there has been a lack of research on the role they can play in the policy agenda and how specific meat substitute attributes can influence consumers to replace partially replace meat in their diets. In this paper, we examine consumers' preferences for attributes of meat and meat substitute products and develop consumer segments based on these preferences. The results of a choice experiment with 247 UK consumers, using food labels and mince (ground meat), illustrate that the type of mince, fat content, country of origin and price are major factors that influence choice. Carbon footprint, method of production and brand play a secondary role in determining consumers' choices of meat/meat substitutes. Latent class analysis is used to identify six consumer segments: price conscious, healthy eaters, taste driven, green, organic and vegetarian consumers which have different socio-demographic characteristics and meat consumption patterns. Future interventions and policies aimed at reducing meat consumption including labelling, provision of more information, financial incentives, educational campaigns and new product development will be more effective if they are holistic and target specific consumer segments, instead of focus on the average consumer.

The analysis is applied to Turkey, a country where a persistent gap between rural income and urban income has motivated governments to enact policies that support farm income. This paper evaluates two sets of policy instruments: output support, which increases farm revenue from specific crops, and input support which subsidizes particular farm inputs. It also investigates the effects of agricultural policy on farmers' incentive to produce fiber (cotton) versus food (corn and other foods). Using farm-level data from two regions of Turkey, the analysis finds that input supports have had stronger effects on land allocation than output supports. It also shows the presence of significant substitution effects across crops, with the subsidizing of cotton having a significant negative effect on the incentive to grow food crops. This provides useful insights into the economic tradeoff between food and fiber in the design of agricultural policy, and its effects on a country's food security. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixteen socio-economic-demographic variables from various public data sources are studied with a machine learning algorithm to ascertain the causality structure associated with the food environment in the United States. High levels of unemployment and poverty are direct causes of high levels of food insecurity, while low income causes high levels of food insecurity via increased levels of poverty. Unemployment is a common cause for both increased levels of food insecurity and poverty. We find that food insecurity and participation in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are related, yet no direct causality is observed. Contrary to past studies which find that SNAP participation decreased the occurrences of poverty, in contemporaneous time, we find that poverty and SNAP participation are related through several back-door paths, via food insecurity, unemployment, race and food taxes. Obesity and SNAP participation are indirectly related via several back-door paths, namely, race income, poverty and food insecurity and unemployment. Also, food insecurity and obesity are related by several back-door paths. Low income, high food taxes, and race (being Black and non-Hispanic) are direct causes of obesity. The complex causality structure in the US food environment reveals that policy variables cannot be treated independently of their rich causal structure. Government agencies responsible for designing policies for food assistance, poverty alleviation, combating food insecurity and obesity need to consider the interrelationships among these variables.

Within this framework, the importance of fisheries in local and global food systems and its contribution to nutrition and health, particularly for the poor are overlooked and undervalued. This paper reviews current fish production and consumption from capture fisheries and aquaculture, highlights opportunities for enhancing healthy diets and outlines key multi-sectoral policy solutions. Mirroring the call for a diversification of agricultural research and investment beyond a few staple grains, it is anticipated that productivity gains for a few farmed aquatic species will not suffice. Capture fisheries and aquaculture have a complementary role to play in increasing fish availability and access, and must be promoted in ways that support measurable nutrition and health gains. This paper argues that the lack of a nutrition-sensitive policy focus on capture fisheries and aquaculture represents an untapped opportunity that must be realised for ensuring sustainable healthy diets for all.

One function of social protection is to manage or reduce vulnerability. Several instruments are reviewed - weather-indexed insurance, public works programmes, emergency food aid and buffer stock management - which aim to stabilise income and access to food across good and bad years, or between the harvest and the hungry season. Other social protection instruments aim to raise household income and crop production, for instance agricultural input subsidies or input trade fairs, as well as public works projects that construct or maintain physical infrastructure such as rural feeder roads. This paper also argues that entitlements to food can be strengthened if social justice principles are introduced to the design and delivery of social protection programmes. Examples reviewed include rights-based approaches such as employment guarantee schemes, community-based targeting and demand-driven accountability mechanisms. The paper concludes by arguing for a comprehensive approach to social protection that will achieve sustainable food security, by combining interventions that stabilise income or food production with those that raise income or food production, and are designed and delivered in ways that enhance social justice.

While the impacts can be measured with precision only ex post, for policy makers it is critical to get a sense of likely impacts ex ante in order to plan approaches to mitigate these impacts. In this paper we adopt a very simple micro-based simulation approach to analyze how changes in prices of specific food groups, such as maize prices or prices for staple foods, as well as how negative short-term household level income shocks affect the entitlements to calorie consumption of individuals and how these changes affect overall food poverty. We illustrate our approach using household survey data from Malawi. We find that food poverty is of serious concern with large within-country variations. We find that price shocks for staple foods have a considerable impact on food security with particularly strong effects on poor net food buyers in rural and urban areas. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to estimate food security impacts of price and income shocks ex ante in a relatively straightforward fashion that can be done relatively quickly and that is suitable for cross-country assessments of the likely impacts of shocks on food security and the design of appropriate response measures.

We selected ten impact indicators: proportion of dairy income to total household income, total dairy income, proportion of crossbreed cows to the total number of cows in the herd (indicator of technological innovation), amount of feed bought (another indicator of technological innovation), milk production, milk productivity, commercialization, price per liter of milk, price per kg of butter and the share of milk production that is processed at the household level. In order to minimize the biases that may arise by simply comparing members and non-members, we employed a propensity score matching technique. The empirical analysis shows that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations and commercialization but weak in offering better prices. These findings suggest structural trade-offs between different domains of cooperatives' action. Overall, our study concludes that cooperatives can be efficient business institutions to foster rural development and food security. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since then, research on the famine has focused almost exclusively on the external response, the reasons for the delay in the international response, and the implications for international humanitarian action in the context of the global war on terror. This paper focuses on the internal, Somali response to the famine. Themes of diversification, mobility and flexibility are all important to understanding how people coped with the famine, but this paper focuses on the factor that seemed to determine whether and how well people survived the famine: social connectedness, the extent of the social networks of affected populations, and the ability of these networks to mobilize resources. These factors ultimately determined how well people coped with the famine. The nature of reciprocity, the resources available within people's networks, and the collective risks and hazards faced within networks, all determined people's individual and household outcomes in the famine and are related to the social structures and social hierarchies within Somali society. But these networks had a distinctly negative side as well social identity and social networks were also exploited to trap humanitarian assistance, turn displaced people into aid bait, and to a large degree, determined who benefited from aid once it started to flow. This paper addresses several questions: How did Somali communities and households cope with the famine of 2011 in the absence of any state-led response and a significant delay in a major international response? What can be learned from these practices to improve our understanding of famine, and of mitigation, response and building resilience to future crises? (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Using data collected from 129 food shoppers in Grenoble, France, demand models are estimated to determine how product choice is affected by price, taste, and perceived healthiness, and how choices change with the provision of objective health information. Unlike previous studies focusing on relatively complex nutrition labels, we elicit and convey health information using simple nutritional indices meant to lower search and cognitive processing costs. The results indicate that consumers are willing to pay for tastier foods and for healthier foods, particularly if the consumers have objective information (as opposed to perceived, subjective information) on nutrient content. The estimates suggest that the value of the type of nutritional information provided in the experiment is epsilon 0.98 per day. The figure refers to the daily welfare benefits that arise from being able to make a set of choices that better reflect people's preferences by receiving the nutrient index information on all 173 food items versus not having such information.

First, we investigate the equilibrium price relationship between wheat and flour prices to identify whether export restrictions dampened the price transmission from the wheat market to the flour market. Second, we estimate an asymmetric VEC-BEKK-GARCH model to characterize the nature of short-run price adjustments and volatility spillovers between the Ukrainian wheat and flour markets. The results indicate that export controls insulated the flour market from price shocks in the wheat market by reducing the transmission elasticity by 25%. We also find evidence that suggests export controls lead to increased volatility in the flour market in the periods immediately before and after the export controls. However, we find no evidence that the export controls increase the time-invariant (i.e., the constant) part of volatility of wheat or flour prices. Lastly, we do not observe asymmetric spillover effects in the flour market but we do find that the wheat market is more volatile when experiencing positive shocks than negative ones.

The focus of this paper is a cross-section time series analysis of organic policy adoptions over the past several decades to explore the types of factors that have influenced diffusion across time and space.

However, off-season production may increase pesticide risk if crops are more affected by pests and diseases and farmers do not handle pesticides correctly. This study quantified the effect of training in off-season tomato production on the income and pesticide use of smallholder vegetable farmers in southwestern Bangladesh. The study uses farm level data from 94 trained and 151 non-trained farm households and applies propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting to correct for selection bias. For the average smallholder vegetable farmer, training increased net household income by about 48%. We found that 31% of the trained farm households who had initially adopted the technology continued its use in the second year, but farm households who discontinued using the technology also experienced significant income gains from the training. There was a significant increase in pesticide use (+56%) and although there was an improvement in pesticide handling practices, trained farmers may have been more exposed to pesticide health risk. The policy implication is that while off-season vegetable production can create dramatic income improvements, it is important to emphasize safe and sustainable pest management methods as part of policies promoting it.

Food security is also a core component of the human development and capability paradigm, since food access and entitlements are critical for reinforcing essential human capabilities. In introducing this special issue, this paper argues that agriculture is central to improving food security and reducing poverty in Africa. It suggests that realizing the potential of agriculture in Africa requires rapid increases in land productivity and increases in agricultural yields. A science-based approach that integrates gender and sustainability is critical to meet this goal, through the design and implementation of policies that improve the availability farm inputs and farm technology.

The E. coli pathogen occurs naturally within the rumen of livestock (including cattle) and does not affect the health of the cattle, however, can be a source of cross-contamination during food processing or environmental contamination of drinking and irrigation water supplies. A vaccine to reduce the risk of cattle shedding E. coli is licensed for use in Canada and the US, however, adoption of the vaccine by cattle producers has been extremely low. Using data from a survey of cow calf producers in western Canada, the influence of a set of thirteen incentives to encourage adoption of the vaccine is examined using Best Worst Scaling. Incentives include policy interventions, market/supply chain incentives, production protocol incentives, and producer reputation incentives. Heterogeneity in producer responses to the incentives is evident and is further explored with a Latent Class Cluster analysis.

Given that coffee agroecosystems are grown by both organic and conventional schemes of management in Santander, a region which produces coffees with specialist distinctive flavours, this study aims to better understand the factors that influence the adoption of these different schemes of management. A combination of ethnographic techniques and quantitative methods were used to examine the predominant drivers of adoption and revealed farmer perceptions associated with coffee farming, and the complexity of interacting factors, that surround their decision making. The results of qualitative analysis suggests that social identity of coffee growers, the existence of farming spaces (lived, perceived, rationalised), the influence of coffee institutions, attitudes about management practices, and social relations of production, all play an important role in the process of decision making. In quantitative terms, we identified 18 socioeconomic drivers, some with interacting effects that had significant influence on the decision to adopt either organic or conventional practices. In particular, at local scale, important factors were technology availability, the type of landowner, formal education of farmers, the role of institutions, membership of community organisations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm. Likewise, economic drivers, such as crop profitability, determined how farmers are involved in trade and market networks at broad regional, national, and international spatial scales. By adopting a more integrated approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies, we characterised the complexity of factors that influencing adoption of coffee management schemes and show that not only financial factors but also a variety of other social factors drive farmer decision making. Identifying the most influential behavioural drivers provides policy with opportunities to better support farmer livelihoods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This finding creates a public policy dilemma given the widely accepted benefits of breastfeeding. Plausible causes for the negative association include reverse causality and omitted variables. Using the 2005 Demographic and Health Survey from rural Ethiopia, we find a downward bias in the estimated growth effect of breastfeeding duration before we control for the nutritional adequacy of complementary foods. Once the omitted variable problem is addressed, we find no evidence of adverse growth effects from prolonged breastfeeding. Instead, we find that the effect of inadequate supplementation on child growth is stronger for children that are breast-fed for shorter duration.

It has received limited attention compared to other sources of ISIS revenues such as oil, looting, ransom, foreign donations and various forms of taxation. We estimate winter crops production of wheat and barley in ISIS-controlled areas in both Syria and Iraq for the years 2014-2015 and irrigated summer crops production (cotton) in Northeast Syria. We show that remote sensing can give a credible estimation of agricultural production in the absence of statistics. With evidence from MODIS Aqua and Terra Satellites as well as Landsat imagery, we find that agricultural production in ISIS-controlled Syrian and Iraqi zones has been sustained in 2014 and 2015, despite the detrimental impact of conflict. After a drought in 2014 production was able to capitalize on improved rainfalls in 2015. First indications show that the winter grain harvest of 2016 in Iraqi territories of ISIS was significantly above pre-conflict mean and below pre-conflict mean in its Syrian territories. We also show how water flows along the Euphrates have impacted production. We estimate the revenue that ISIS can derive from wheat and barley production and the likely magnitude of an exportable surplus. Agricultural production gives the group a degree of resilience, although its economy is not sustainable in the longer run and could be affected by military collapse. Taxation of recurrent income streams such as agriculture will become more important for ISIS as its extractive sources of revenues show signs of dwindling. Beside non-grain food imports, agricultural production is crucial for its political legitimacy by ensuring food provision to the broader population.

This paper focuses on the rate of change in the prevalence of undernourishment and looks at whether higher economic growth speeds up reductions in undernutrition in developing countries. The analysis uses panel data analysis on data spanning 22 years (1991-2012) and covering 27 developing countries. Results reveal that faster annual economic growth leads to larger annual improvements in undernourishment rates. Both annual and long-term economic growth are relevant. Sustained economic growth has a greater positive impact on undernutrition than short-term economic growth. In addition to economic growth, investments in health, education and access to drinking water are also enabling factors for reducing undernourishment. In conclusion, increased income growth can hasten the effects of food policies aimed at reducing undernourishment, but not to the extent that sustained growth and better access to health, education and drinking water can.

J,"Liefert, WM; Westcott, PC",,,,"Liefert, William M.; Westcott, Paul C.",,,Modifying agricultural export taxes to make them less market-distorting,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Export taxes; Export restrictions; Agricultural trade; Trade policy; Food security,,"From 2006 to 2014, close to 40 countries levied an export tax on at least one agricultural product. Export taxes impose costs on the global economy by reducing total world welfare compared to free trade, and in particular hurt the tax-imposing country's own domestic producers of the taxed good. Yet countries with export taxes have objectives that might make it unlikely for them to eliminate, or even reduce, the taxes. This article examines how a conventional export tax could be modified to make it less market-distorting, and thereby less welfare-diminishing, for both the tax-imposing country and the rest of the world. From a total world welfare perspective, the modified policy analyzed here is a second best alternative to the first best policy of abolishing the export tax and allowing free trade, but nonetheless it improves global economic welfare compared to the standard export tax. The modified policy discussed here achieves the same economic objectives as the tax, such as reducing the domestic price of the exported good, increasing domestic purchases, and raising revenue, but also generates additional exports beyond the volume that occurs under the tax alone. Also, the tax does not involve any government subsidies to producers or consumers. The main original feature of the modified export tax policy therefore is that it not only increases net economic welfare (compared to the unmodified tax scenario), but does so in a way that does not reduce the welfare of any economic group.

Many review exercises have analysed the available evidences to understand the ways in which agriculture can be leveraged to enhance nutritional status; however, very few of them have employed a systematic approach ensuring internal and external validity. The present paper seeks to fill this gap for strengthening the policy recommendations. It demonstrates an association between agricultural interventions and nutritional outcomes; and it shows that the production of targeted nutrition-rich crops, homestead gardens, and diversification of the agricultural production system towards fruits and vegetables and aquaculture can potentially improve nutrient intake and nutritional outcomes. The empowerment of women and nutrition knowledge play a crucial role in establishing linkage between agriculture and nutritional outcomes. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In this paper, we calculate environmental savings by applying a carbon footprint analysis to three food policies implemented by the City of Turin (Italy) in the school catering service (school years 2012/13 and 2013/14). The policies are focused on (I) the production of food (with the requirement of integrated or organic products), (II) the geographical origin of the food (with the requirement of regional food provisioning) and (III) the improvement of urban distribution (with the requirement of shifting to natural gas vehicles). The climate change potential of five of the most consumed foods were studied according to three main phases of the supply chain: production (including all processes in a cradle-to-gate perspective), provisioning (focusing on the transportation from production sites to the peripheral food hubs of the city), and distribution (focusing on the transportation from the city hubs to schools). The results of this study highlight the different climate impacts of the three phases of the supply chain, in particular 61-70% of the greenhouse gases are emitted in the production phase, 6-11% in the provisioning phase and 24-28% in urban distribution. As a consequence, policies that affect production practices have the greatest potential for reducing the carbon footprint of the catering service. Other policies (such as those on transportation) can have controversial effects. Therefore, to improve planning of sustainability policies, the greenhouse gas emission savings achieved by each policy must be analysed in-depth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that both generalized trust and trust in the food system tend to offset negative perceptions associated with the GM food and that respondents who believe in internal control over health are more likely to purchase functional food. Our results also show that joint inclusion of both personality traits (trust and control) provides a clearer interpretation of their impact on preferences. The disutility associated with GM food ingredients outweighs the value that respondents place on enhanced omega-3 content in a canola oil product, suggesting that commercial marketing of canola oil products using genetic modification to enhance levels of omega-3 content may be challenging.

We use panel data covering over a decade to estimate output supply functions for smallholder farmers in Kenya, and compare these among three commodities with distinctive product attributes: maize, kale and milk. We find that despite improved market access over the decade, there is little discernible growth in market participation except in the case of milk. A minority of households consistently sell from year to year and market concentration remains high across all the commodities, indicating that production is largely subsistence. Nevertheless, there is greater market orientation and less market concentration in kale and milk than in maize. For all the commodities, market participation is strongly associated with access to land, productive assets, technology use, expected prices and rainfall amount and reliability. We argue that broad-based smallholder market participation can only be realized through interventions that raise smallholder production of marketable surpluses through raising productivity, and this cuts across even the high value sub-sectors such as horticulture and dairy. Also essential alongside such interventions are strategies to improving market access by reducing transaction costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

What drives support for agricultural protection the broad array of subsidies to farmers and taxes and quotas imposed on agricultural imports in developed countries? We answer this question by testing three competing hypotheses about what drives support for agricultural protection in the US: (i) legislator preferences, (ii) electoral incentives, or (iii) lobbying. Using data on the roll call votes of the members of the 106th through the 110th Congresses (1999-2009) and the scores given to each legislator by the Farm Bureau, our findings suggest that electoral incentives explain a great deal of the variation in support for agricultural protection, but that legislator preferences and lobbying might play a role, too. Moreover, legislator preferences and electoral incentives appear to be substitutes for one another. Why does Congress support agricultural protection? Because many members have electoral incentives to and because many of those who do not still have other personal or strategic interests at stake. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the process by which consumers' interpretation of, and interaction with, labelling results in the formation of trust related judgements. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 24 Australian consumers were conducted. Theoretical sampling was used to gather a wide range of consumer perspectives. Real food packages were used as prompts for discussion in interviews, with one interview section requiring participants to examine particular products while thinking aloud. Process and thematic coding were used in transcript analysis. Labelling was seen by participants as a direct and active communication with 'labellers'. The messages communicated by individual label elements were interpreted more broadly than their regulatory definitions and were integrated during the process of making sense of labelling. This enabled participants to form trust related judgements through interaction with labelling. Finally, product and consumer characteristics varied participants' judgements about the same or similar label elements and products. Divergence in consumer and regulatory interpretations of labelling creates a situation where labelling may be both fully compliant with all relevant legislation and regulation, and still be perceived as misleading by consumers. This suggests that the rational frameworks that policy seeks to overlay on consumers when considering food labelling regulation may be hindering consumer belief in the trustworthiness of labellers. Policy must recognise the different, yet equally legitimate, ways of interpreting labelling if it is to foster, and not undermine, consumer trust in the food system generally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, using the Consideration of Future Consequences (CFC) scale we analyzed if individuals with different time preferences have different choice behavior and valuations in relation to these labels. Results indicate that consumers value both healthy and environmentally friendly attributes displayed on labels.

However, as quality is unobservable, a measurement problem clearly emerges. In this paper we review and apply some of the most recent methods developed in the international trade literature to estimate quality of traded products. We focus on the food sector, where the growing attention on quality and safety issues is leading to an increase in the demand for high quality products. In the first part of our empirical analysis, we investigate the properties of the estimated qualities, drawing some interesting results. In particular we find that, in contrast with what is often assumed in the literature, quality and prices are imperfectly correlated. The second empirical section is dedicated to the study of the relationship between price vs. quality and trade costs. What emerges is that, interestingly, the price and the quality of food exports are influenced differently by ad valorem and specific trade costs. Moreover, the magnitude of this relationship changes according to the level of product differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Five states of India modified TPDS by reducing targeting, lowering grain prices to Rs.1-3 per kg and tightening its administration. This paper assesses the impact of changes in the TPDS on household food consumption using data from a repeated cross-section of Indian households from five rounds of representative consumption surveys between 1993-1994 and 2009-2010. We use the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method to identify the policy impact, first on consumption of food-grains, and second, on food expenditure. We find that modifications in TPDS led not only to an increase in the purchase of subsidized grains from fair-price shops, but also to diversification of the food basket of poor households. We also find evidence for reduction in the diversion of grains from TPDS to the open market in reform states. Finally, we present suggestive evidence that a food policy reform is likely to fail if price and targeting policy components are not accompanied by effective administrative measures to reduce corruption and improve the logistics of subsidized food distribution. These are important findings for India's own National Food Security Act (NFSA) and for other food safety-net programs throughout the developing world. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

They stimulate smallholders to experiment with improved practices, and to engage with research, extension and business development services providers. However, evidence on impact and effectiveness of these grants is scarce. Partly, because attribution of changes in practices and performance to the grant alone is challenging, and the grant is often invested in innovation processes that benefitted from other support in the past. We discuss three modalities: vouchers, business development matching grants and farmer-driven innovation support funds. Our review points to an important and transversal outcome area of innovation grant systems: the creation of human and social capital to sustain creative thinking and innovative practices. Harmonising measurement on these outcomes could enhance the usefulness and comparability of impact studies and facilitate benchmarking of different policy options for smallholder innovation.

There have been repeated calls for CAP to address nutrition-related health, particularly obesity and non-communicable disease (NCD) in the EU. However, aligning agricultural policy such as CAP with nutrition is complex, not least because the aims of agricultural policy are predominantly economic, presenting a challenge for developing coherence between agricultural trade and health policy. This research examined the political priority given to nutrition-related health concerns within CAP to date, and the solutions suggested by agricultural, trade and health policy-makers and public health nutrition advocates, via interviews of 20 high-level participants from respective sectors. The participants provided diverse perspectives, often varying by sector and institution, on the connections between agricultural policy and nutrition-related health, the extent to which nutrition concerns have been addressed via CAP and whether CAP is an appropriate and effective policy approach to improve nutrition-related health in the EU in the future. The key findings suggest the need for communication and agreement of clear high-level nutrition guidelines, clarity on the EU mandate to address nutrition-related health concerns via policy, and stronger engagement of civil society in the issues if CAP is to address nutrition more than it is doing currently. The difference in worldviews between agricultural/trade representatives, and those from public health, also needs to be addressed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from a large scale household panel data set, I estimate the consumed quantities of processed food to decrease by 3.4% due to the unhealthy food tax, while the consumed quantities of unprocessed food increased by 1.1%.

CrM allows companies to signal their overall business culture regarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at the point of sale. More recently retail chains in Germany have started to use CrM as a strategy to differentiate themselves and their products and to secure customer loyalty in highly competitive markets. For consumers the information necessary to assess the fairness of the terms of a CrM campaign is in general not available. Thus, trust becomes an important issue. The aim of our study is to understand the role of trust for the success of a CrM campaign. We consider consumers' trust in a retailer's CrM campaign for the success of a specific campaign as well as the role of consumers' general trust in CrM and thus of potential spillover effects. The empirical study is based on a standardised online consumer survey carried out in Germany. Our hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results reveal that consumers' trust in a retailer's CrM campaign increases consumer's loyalty in the retailer. We, in addition, show that general trust in CrM campaigns, a factor external to the influence of the retailer, has a significant influence on trust in a specific campaign. Based on our results we derive market and policy recommendations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our approach is to model outcomes and participation simultaneously, using exogenous variation in state eligibility to identify SNAP participation. We use this approach for both ordered choices (health) and count outcomes (sickdays, office-based visits, outpatient visits), where the former uses maximum likelihood and the latter maximum simulated likelihood. In addition, we control for state-level unobservables that are correlated with both participation and health, which previous studies of this question have neglected. Our results indicate that SNAP has an consistently positive effect on SAH; it significantly increases the probability of reporting excellent or very good health. We also find that SNAP participants spend about 3 fewer days in bed due to illness each year, and report between 1 and 2 fewer office-based doctor visits and a fraction fewer outpatient visits. Supplementary specifications indicate that, although SNAP participants consume fewer office visits overall, they have more checkups than comparable non-participants.

Our results suggest a robust association between globalization and both obesity and caloric intake. A one standard deviation increase in globalization is associated with a 23.8 percent increase in obese population and a 4.3 percent rise in calorie intake. The effect remains statistically significant even after using an instrumental variable strategy to correct for some possible reverse causality and ommited variable bias, a lagged structure, and corrections for panel standard errors. However, we find that the primary driver (of the 'globesity' phenomenon) is the 'social' rather than the 'economic' dimension of globalization, and specifically the effect of changes in 'information flows' and 'social proximity' on obesity. A one standard deviation increase in social globalization increased the percentage of obese population by 13.7 percent (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This food safety event received extensive media coverage and prompted changes in regulatory controls. Using a panel selection model, we show that prior to December 2003, ground beef recalls had no impact on household purchases of ground beef, even for households that were located in the recall-defined geographic areas. However, we find robust evidence that the 2003 BSE event caused a change in the way people view and respond to recalls of ground beef, a change that persisted for at, least two years following the BSE event. The average impact of a ground beef recall in the post-BSE period is a 0.26 1b per person reduction in retail purchases of ground beef. A decline in purchases of this magnitude would result in over $97 million in losses to the beef industry in a two week period following a nationwide recall. This dwarfs the economic impacts of directly removing recalled beef from supply chains and provides FSIS increased regulatory power due to higher overall industry costs associated with food safety violations.

It discusses the scope of the problem of mislabelling and substitution in fish value chains, how barcoding is currently used in the public and private sectors, and some recommendations for further implementation. It also includes a discussion of the status of DNA barcoding in the United States and in Canada's food safety surveillance systems to combat fraud, mislabelling and species substitution in fish value chains.

The present study tries to fill this gap. By conducting a discourse analysis of the latest CAP reform (2014-2020) documents, we attempted to determine which discourses and discourse strategies predominated in the reform's documentation and how they were implemented into measures and budgetary distributions. The findings show that in the process of CAP reform decision-making, European institutions justified the CAP with a transformation of key discourses (productivist, multi-functional and flea-liberal) by emphasising the hugely popular environmental element while, at the same time, employing a strong productivist discourse at the level of measures and the budgetary distribution between the EU member states and farmers' groups. In order to retain a strong CAP as well as the current distribution of financial resources, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council employed greening as a justification strategy as well as a productivist discourse as a major component in determining CAP measures.

We find that it is mainly attributable to significant measurement errors in the Chinese Rural Household Survey and the calculation of per capita food consumption. In a household survey, total consumption for a household in a certain period is often well recorded, and per capita consumption is obtained by dividing total consumption by household size. Such a calculation of per capita food consumption is vulnerable to a mismatch between food and mouths. Total consumption may be subject to measurement errors caused primarily by food away from home (FAFH). Also, the household size recorded in the survey is not necessarily the same as the number of mouths (consumption household size), who consume the food recorded in the survey. Our results indicate that per capita food consumption in rural China is currently being underestimated by about 30%. Our results also indicate that income elasticities of food consumption are greater than measured elasticities based on the Rural Household Survey data. A direct policy implication for avoiding statistical errors in calculating per capita consumption would be correctly recording the consumption household size corresponding to total consumption in household surveys.

Social capital is the economic value of a person's relationships. In the context of this study, self-efficacy is the belief of a farmer to be able to improve her income with contract farming, which increases her actual ability. Social capital increases the ability of the farmers through social support. We surveyed 400 smallholder pineapple farmers and find that both self-efficacy and social capital are decisive for their successful integration into contract farming. To identify causal effects, we use two instruments, which are also of interest on their own: the historical presence of (1) cocoa cooperatives and (2) Christian missionary schools. During Ghana's colonial period, the British established cocoa cooperatives, which differed in their performance as a function of biogeographic factors and thus persistently shaped the self-efficacy of the farmers. Roughly at the same time, Christian missionaries established missionary schools, which impacted the traditional societies so that social capital decreased. The finding that self-efficacy and social capital are still shaped by historic variables could indicate that these variables are only slowly changing, or that they only do so in the absence of policy intervention. The latter raises the possibility that effective policies could benefit from strong reinforcing feedbacks once self-efficacy and social capital improve. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, taking as a theoretical basis the focus provided by the Resource-Based-View, the innovation and export decisions taken from 2006 to 2011 by 165 agricultural firms and 783 food companies operating in Spain (Europe) are examined here. The results of the bivariate probit and matching models used indicate a bidirectional nature of these decisions in the case of food companies and a positive though not bidirectional one in the case of the agricultural firms. Furthermore, a certain persistence is seen in the use of these decisions in both types of firms. For food companies, capital intensity and size are also determinants of innovation and exports. From the viewpoint of the decisions taken by individual firms, the bidirectional relationship could involve significant pressure in terms of the larger volume of both technological and human resources required. Agricultural and food policy decisions should incentivize these decisions given that in order to operate successfully in the global market it is necessary to acquire these competitive advantages, which also favor the growth of the agriculture and food trades.

Understanding the speed of diffusion of new wheat varieties can contribute to this goal. We apply duration analysis to identify the factors that shorten the time until a farmer replaces one modern variety by another, and test hypotheses concerning two recurring themes of the Green Revolution: farm size differences and the role of information sources in seed diffusion. We find that time to adoption averages only 4 years, but is shorter on larger farms. Factors that speed variety change also differ by farm size. Extension and media sources of information significantly influence adoption among larger farmers relative to information gained through social relationships, but this is not the case for marginal farmers. Traits related to consumption quality speed adoption on smaller wheat farms, where families both sell and consume their wheat; higher yields drive adoption for the most subsistence-oriented, marginal group.

Methods: In two experiments, we tracked the allocation of attention while participants (n = 125) viewed novel and commercial packages with varied FOP designs using a change detection methodology. Results: We found empirical evidence that FOP labels are attended more often, and earlier, than the currently mandated NFP, and that this benefit is due both to its placement on the front of the package and to the design characteristics of the FOP. Specifically, the use of color in FOPs increased attention to the label, but there was no evidence that coding information via facial icons impacted attention. Conclusions: Our work supports a growing body of evidence supporting the use of FOP labels to attract attention to nutritional information. Findings may be relevant to inform policy decisions on labeling standards. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Following a review of legislation of 28 jurisdictions, three prominent differences were discerned, concerning (i) the labelling of different types of nutrition and health claims and their permission; (ii) variations arising in the (pre-marketing) authorisation procedures; and (iii) the use of the scientific minority opinion in substantiating claims. By discussing these legal differences with findings from literature concerning consumer and industry effects, this review puts these pieces of legislation into a broader perspective. The studied pieces of legislation show critical differences and although various approaches have positive points, no optimal approach to regulate nutrition and health claims has been implemented yet. It would be preferable to permit similar types of claims throughout jurisdictions, permit claims that have a lower probability of misleading consumers e.g. nutrition claims to use emerging evidence and to require pre-marketing approval of claims with higher impact. International harmonisation in these aspects should globally lead to improved pieces of legislation, stimulate industrial efforts in functional foods and enhance consumers' opportunity to use health-enhancing products.

They are key planning priorities in the state of Hawaii as well. Approximately 90% of energy and food resources are imported to Hawaii from the continental USA or other parts of the world. While food and energy independence is a goal in many jurisdictions, assessment of the potential for local food and energy production is lacking. Research is needed to examine how agricultural lands can be used to meet food and energy demands, particularly on islands where land is limited. The contribution of this paper is the development of a community-orientated method for evaluating and prioritizing lands for food and energy self-sufficiency, based on local preferences and production possibilities. Based on a review of the literature, community meetings, and expert interviews, three scenarios were developed to assess food and energy production possibilities on Kauai. The first scenario considers maximum food production, the second assigns equal importance to food and energy production, and the third scenario maximizes energy production. Our analysis shows that while currently zoned agricultural lands on Kauai are capable of meeting the energy and nutritional needs of the current population under some conditions, ins not possible under the strictest definition of important agricultural lands. Some aspect or interpretation of the criteria will always have to be relaxed in order to fulfill energy and food-self sufficiency goals. This work broadens policy discussions regarding the preservation of agricultural lands on small islands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To establish causality, we selected study sites that differ in their supermarket access, and employ instrumental variable techniques to allow for endogeneity of supermarket purchases. We find that supermarket purchases increase the consumption of processed foods at the expense of unprocessed foods. Supermarket purchases increase per capita calorie availability, which is linked to lower prices paid per calorie, particularly for processed foods. Our results imply that supermarkets contribute to dietary changes commonly associated with the nutrition transition. The effects on nutrient adequacy are less clear. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified use values related to: being able to continue the business, earning a living from the business, not being tied to the farm (i.e. having time available for other things), product quality, and work environment. We also identified non-use values related to avoidance of suffering, being able to further improve the welfare of dairy cows, the dairy farmer feeling good him! herself, ethical considerations, a feeling of doing the right thing, and animals eating properly (i.e. functioning as dairy cows should). Understanding the values underlying dairy farmers' decision making with respect to animal welfare is an important step in understanding why these farmers work with animal welfare. The results are useful in improving communications from authorities and farm advisors to farmers, as a strategy to gain better acceptance for improved animal welfare standards; in designing product certification schemes in the food industry; and in communicating to the public the values influencing production of dairy products.

Based on a sample of 347 wheat growers in the Guanzhong Plain, this paper simultaneously estimates a production function, and its corresponding first-order conditions for cost minimization, to analyze efficiency of irrigation water use. The main findings are that average technical, allocative, and overall economic efficiency are 0.35, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. In a second stage analysis, we find that farmers' perception of water scarcity, water price and irrigation infrastructure increase irrigation water allocative efficiency, while land fragmentation decreases it.

While the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, which was established in 2008, introduced regulatory, institutional, and organizational innovations in the coffee market, informal norms and conventions remain the primary institutions governing transactions in the local markets. Based on a choice experiment, we found that for coffee farmers the characteristics of the traders are more important than the price offered when anchoring their transactions into personal relationships. This can be explained as the institutional response of farsighted calculative farmers to poorly organized coffee markets and to lacking credit and insurance markets. Contrary to the concept of embeddedness, which claims that economic transactions are embedded into social relationships, social relationships are observed to be embedded into economic relationships. One of the perverse effects of these personal relationship-based transactions is that farmers are insufficiently incentivized to maintain and improve coffee quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis is based on a nationally representative data set from India for the year 2009-10 and we use propensity score matching methods. We find that as compared to households with no commuters, households with rural-urban commuters have higher dietary diversity; whereas households with no fixed place workers have lower dietary diversity.

Methods: We used food balance sheets from 1991 to 2010 to estimate food and nutrient supplies and data from 1993-1996 (n = 3915) to 2005-2008 (n = 2908) Taiwanese Nutrition and Health Surveys to assess intake of Taiwanese population. Age-and-gender Specific Food Guides and Dietary Reference Intakes were multiplied by the population size and then summed to determine food and nutrient needs. Food Security Indices (FSIs) and Nutrient Security Indices (NSIs) were defined as the geometric means of supply-to-needs ratio (S-Nr) and intake-to-needs ratio (I-Nr) with reference to an ideal of 1.0. Higher values indicate potential food insecurity. Results: From 1997 to 2010, the S-Nr for most food categories and nutrients decreased; dairy products and vegetables fell below recommendations in 2010. For food intake, all except cereals/roots increased between the two surveys, but only vegetables and soy/fish/meat/egg met the needs in 2005-2008. For both surveys, high FSIs for dairy (2.16, 2.26) were due to low supply and low intake, and those for soy/fish/meat/egg (1.78, 1.91) to oversupply and overconsumption. The FSIs for fruit improved from 1.50 to 1.17, with a smaller supply but more consumption. NSIs explained the FSIs. Conclusion: FSIs and NSIs capture composite information about the food supply, intake, and recommendations, which allows food security to be monitored with action-points of 1.0 for food and nutrition policy.

The role of farmer seed networks is less well understood and yet is central to debates on current issues ranging from seed sovereignty and rights for farmers to GMOs and the conservation of crop germplasm. In this paper we identify four common misconceptions regarding the nature and importance of farmer seed networks today. (1) Farmer seed networks are inefficient for seed dissemination. (2) Farmer seed networks are closed, conservative systems. (3) Farmer seed networks provide ready, egalitarian access to seed. (4) Farmer seed networks are destined to weaken and disappear. We challenge these misconceptions by drawing upon recent research findings and the authors' collective field experience in studying farmer seed systems in Africa, Europe, Latin America and Oceania. Priorities for future research are suggested that would advance our understanding of seed networks and better inform agricultural and food policy. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Using a panel dataset from Ireland over the period 2005-2010, we test whether the CAP decoupled subsidy payments reduce credit constraints by altering the risk profile of farm earnings. We test for financing constraints in a neoclassical Q model using investment-cash flow sensitivities. Our econometric methodology controls for censoring, heterogeneity and endogeneity. We find that decoupled subsidies do reduce credit constraints. The effect is greater for farms that face higher constraints: dairy farmers and younger farms. This evidence suggests that, over and above the effect on production indicated in previous research, decoupling affects farm investment through financial channels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The causes of food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa include among others; poverty, economic constraints, agricultural and agronomical challenges, rapid population growth, and the effects of adverse climate change. These causes however, are linked to complex interactions, constraints and dependencies amongst the key physical resources in food systems, namely - Water, Land, Energy and Soil Nutrients (WLEN). There is limited insight on the combined impacts of the resource nexus, and how this may constrain the performance of food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. This understanding is essential if the food challenges in the region are to be tackled sustainably. This study provides a detailed analysis of the Uganda's 2012 WLEN nexus resources vis-a-vis the country's current and potential food demand using calorific-demand analysis and source-to-service resource transformation modelling. The analysis determines estimates of the current resource stresses within Uganda's insufficient food system and the interconnected resource implications for the achievement of food security by 2050. The results are visualised using Sankey diagrams. The inferences highlight evident limits across all four resources. Overall, the analysis helps to inform food security policy and the resource context for the present and future management of Uganda's food system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our lab snack-order experiments demonstrate the existence of the LUE effect (-8.3%) and the LOE effect (+4.8%), where the aggregate learning effect is -5.8%. Our results also imply that the LUE can be cancelled out by a positive saliency effect, while the undesirable saliency effect may be mitigated by combining the calorie posting with information about daily calorie needs.

While understandable, this growing focus has perhaps obscured the impact of other variables affecting malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa, i.e. the long-term impact of agricultural policies on food supply and prices, large and persistent seasonal variations in food prices, and the impact of famines which still affect parts of the continent. This paper focuses on the relative impact of these factors on child malnutrition (measured by the number of child admissions to feeding centres) in Malawi and Niger, two countries which closely represent the situation of other small, landlocked, subsistence agricultural economies facing severe food security problems. Our analysis shows that in these countries the drivers of changes in domestic staple prices and child malnutrition are related not only - or not primarily - to variations of international food prices but also to the impact of agricultural policies on food production and prices, in a persistent food price seasonality, and in recurrent and poorly managed famines. These factors can exert a strong upward pressure on food prices and child malnutrition even during years of falling international prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical framework relies on a modified version of the Crepon-Duguet-Mairesse (CDM) model, applied to a sample of 541 Spanish firms over the years from 2008 to 2011 (1910 observations). The first step in our model shows a great impact of public funding; firms receiving national funds invested 54% more in R&D than firms without this type of public support. The share of workers with a degree, and cooperation among firms are also relevant for engaging in R&D in the F&B industry. The second step points out the significant role of R&D expenditure for product and organizational innovation, while we did not find any significant effect for process innovation. The final step reveals that innovation output influences productivity with an elasticity of 0.29 for the innovation variable. Other significant factors affecting labour productivity are the size of the company, investment intensity, international competition, and having foreign participation of over 50% in the company.

Yet little is known of what contributes to nutrition leaders' success or lack of it in particular policy environments. This study of 89 individuals identified as influential within child and maternal undernutrition policy and programming in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya and India sheds light on why particular individuals have been effective in contributing towards positive changes in nutrition policy, and how they operate in the wider policy/political sphere. We employ a framework working outwards from individual capabilities, knowledge and motivations, through to wider political economy considerations and the narratives and knowledge structuring individual capacity. We argue that only by locating individuals within this wider political economy can we begin to appreciate the range of strategies and avenues for influence (or constraints to that influence) that individual leaders employ and encounter.

Interestingly, few studies have examined the behaviors of online survey panelists, particularly their satisficing behaviors on welfare measures. This study demonstrates the use of validation questions (trap questions) to detect survey respondents' satisficing behavior and its impact on consumer choice, willingness to pay (WTP), and consumer surplus (CS) estimates. We find that respondents who fail a validation question (VQ) are more likely to violate the weak axiom of revealed preferences (WARP) in the choice experiment The estimates for preference parameters, WTP, and CS are statistically different between those who pass and those who fail the VQ, In addition, the WTP and CS from respondents passing the VQ in general have smaller variances Ihan those from respondents failing the VQ. These results indicate that without controlling for potential satisficing behaviors, online surveys may produce less efficient estimates (estimates with larger variance) of welfare measures.

We find that although favourable factors were operating in the problem, policy and politics streams to promote policy reform, these were not sufficient to harness the potential opportunity for reform, with several missed opportunities to move the reform process forward. The analysis suggests that more attention to the political economy of the policy process may help to enhance the political feasibility of future policy reform efforts for ICDS policy, and may have lessons for complementary policy reform efforts to improve child nutrition in India.

Methods: The analysis exploits the random assignment of SNAP households in Hampden County, MA, to an intervention group that earned the incentive. Regression models for the impact of the incentive are augmented with measures of food retail access and interactions of random assignment status with food retail access. The main outcome use of the SNAP benefit is based on Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card transaction records. Results: Although households that lived within a mile of a participating supermarket spent approximately $2.13 or 19% more per month on targeted fruits and vegetables at participating supermarkets than households that did not live within a mile of a participating supermarket, we found no evidence that the impact of the incentive on SNAP fruit and vegetable spending varies with distance to retailers. Conclusions: These findings imply that incentives to purchase fruits and vegetables were equally efficacious for SNAP households with high and low access to food retailers.

A cross-sectional pre-test/post-test survey with a control group was administered. The results show considerable change of respondents' susceptibility towards food-related risk and demonstrate that activities during the workshop were recognised by respondents as feasible in the domestic environment.

Using micro-level evidence and a matched plot pair design through which we control for plot and farmer characteristics, we show that the introduction of castor production for biofuel in a poor country as Ethiopia can significantly improve food productivity of rural households who produce raw material for biofuel production. This spillover seems particularly linked to enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance which were provided as part of biofuel feedstock production contracts. Our results thus document another mechanism through which biofuels may influence smallholders' food security, a mechanism that did not receive attention so far. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting from the analysis of the main regulations and initiatives at various administrative levels and by introducing a two-level framework for modelling complex household food waste behaviour, this paper aims at investigating the behaviour of EU-27 citizens towards food waste by referring to the 2013 Flash Eurobarometer survey (n. 388). The multilevel statistical perspective enabled us to jointly consider factors at both individual and contextual levels as potential variables associated with food waste. Firstly, by analysing territorial variability it was possible to identify groups of countries characterized by similar behaviour patterns and therefore target them according to the need and exigency of public policy interventions. Secondly, at individual level it was observed that people living in towns and large cities tend to produce more waste thus emphasizing the need of diversifying policy interventions at local level according to the extent of urbanization. Moreover, education level, sorting practices, attitudes and concern regarding food waste proved to be associated with individuals' behaviour towards food waste. Thirdly, public-private partnerships as well as targeting community-based interventions to address food waste should be encouraged. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The RD is currently being evaluated in terms of its process and likely impact on the health of the English population. This paper analyses the RD food pledges in terms of (i) the evidence of the effectiveness of the specific interventions in the pledges and (ii) the likelihood that the pledges have brought about actions among organisations that would not otherwise have taken place. We systematically reviewed evidence of the effectiveness of the interventions proposed in six food pledges of the RD, namely nutrition labelling (including out-of-home calorie labelling and front-of-pack nutrition labelling), salt reduction, calorie reduction, fruit and vegetable consumption, and reduction of saturated fats. We then analysed publically available data on organisations' plans and progress towards achieving the pledges, and assessed the extent to which activities among organisations could be brought about by the RD. Based on seventeen evidence reviews, some of the RD food interventions could be effective, if fully implemented. However the most effective strategies to improve diet, such as food pricing strategies, restrictions on marketing, and reducing sugar intake, are not reflected in the RD food pledges. Moreover it was difficult to establish the quality and extent of implementation of RD pledge interventions due to the paucity and heterogeneity of organisations' progress reports. Finally, most interventions reported by organisations seemed either clearly (37%) or possibly (37%) already underway, regardless of the RD. Irrespective of the nature of a public health policy to improve nutritional health, pledges or proposed actions need to be evidence-based, well-defined, and measurable, pushing actors to go beyond 'business as usual' and setting out clear penalties for not demonstrating progress.

Unlike biofortification with provitamin A, biofortification with minerals, such as iron and zinc, does not change the color or the appearance of the biofortified crop. Therefore, we test the impact of both nutrition information, and branding and certification, as well as the nature of the brand and of the certifying authority (state level versus international), on consumer demand for HIPM. We find that even in the absence of nutrition information, consumers assign a small but significant premium to the HIPM variety relative to the local variety. This is consistent with consumers' more favorable rating of the sensory characteristics of the high iron variety. Nutrition information on the health benefits of HIPM increases this premium substantially, and regression analysis reveals that consumers prefer international branding and international certification authority to their state-level counterparts.

We used household income data from 7975 households in 24 developing countries across three continents collected by the Poverty Environment Network (PEN). We found 77% of households to be engaged in wild food collection from forest and non-forest environments even though the share of wild food income in total household income was on average only 4%. Poorer households and households experiencing shocks derived higher income shares from wild foods. State land is the main source of forest-derived wild food income while private lands are most important for non-forest wild food income. Considerable regional variation in determinants and the direction of significant relationships indicate there is no one-size-fits-all approach to integrating wild foods into food and forest policies. However, our results reveal potential to increase household food security by integrating wild foods into national food policies in more customized ways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical analysis shows that with an increase in real wages that prevailed in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors in rural areas, relatively larger farmers increased the size of operational farm land by renting in land as well as used more hired-in machines through machine rental and/or service providers, which induces the substitution of labor by machines. Machines and land are complementary and, consistently, the inverse farm size-productivity relationship tends to be reversed among relatively large holders. The results support growing (diminishing) advantage of large (small) farms in the presence of rapidly rising real wages and have food security policy implications to many Asian countries where real wages are rapidly rising and small farms are predominant.

Such estimates cannot be obtained from aggregated sales or household purchase data because they do not break down soda intake by individuals. To fill this gap in the literature, the 24-h dietary recall data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2008) have been merged with soda prices from the Council for Community and Economic Research (C2ER). The variation in soda prices across zip codes and over the years were used to identify the associations of soda prices with the prevalence of sugar-sweetened regular soda intake and caloric intake from soda for children (N = 8032), adolescents (N = 6501), and adults (N = 14,141). The analyses were further stratified by gender, race/ethnicity and income-based socioeconomic status. A 10% higher soda price was associated with lower prevalence (i.e., probability) of regular soda intake by 3.4%, 4.6% and 4.0% for children, adolescents, and adults, respectively, and lower caloric intake from soda by 8.1%, 5.2%, and 6.6%, respectively. The strongest negative associations between soda prices and regular soda intake were found among children and adults; the weakest negative associations were found among minority children and adolescents. By using individual-level data from the 24-h dietary recall data, we identified substantial heterogeneity in the association of soda price with regular soda intake. Our results add to the growing literature suggesting that higher soda prices are associated with reduced regular soda intake. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Paradoxically, this period has been one of robust poverty reduction and rapid economic growth. The reasons for the apparent reductions in calorie consumption underlying increased undernourishment have been the subject of intense debate both within India and internationally. This paper critically reviews this debate, finding that is has taken place outside of the context of India's recent nutrition and epidemiological transitions, which appear to have brought with them increased, not decreased, food consumption. The debate has also taken place under the unchallenged assumption that the data on which the conflicting trends are based, collected as part of the country's Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys (HCESs), are reliable. The paper provides supporting literature and empirical evidence that a probable key source of the calorie decline is incomplete collection of data on food consumed away from peoples' homes, which is widespread and rapidly increasing.

In addition, this study tests the hypothesis that the effect of risk preference on choice depends upon its interaction with risk perceptions. I elicit three distinct measures of risk preference: a standard real-money Holt and Laury measure,.a hypothetical health-variant of the Holt and Laury measure, and a non-context-specific self-assessment measure. I also elicit information regarding risk perceptions (specifically, food safety). These data are combined with choice data focused on consumer preferences for raw oysters. Results indicate that, after controlling for key oyster attributes, perceived risk perception is highly significant. Additionally, the effect of risk preference is significant, and the effect depends on whether respondents held informative or non-informative risk perceptions. In a treatment that includes only named oyster varieties, I find that although respondents generally prefer named Atlantic coast oysters to named Gulf and Pacific coast oysters, those who hold non-informative risk perceptions are even less likely to choose Gulf and Pacific coast oysters as the magnitude of risk aversion increases. In another treatment that includes a generic commodity Gulf coast oyster, I find that although named Gulf coast oysters are generally preferred to the commodity Gulf coast oyster, respondents with non-informative risk perceptions are significantly less likely to choose named Gulf coast oysters as the magnitude of risk aversion increases.

The aim of this analysis, therefore, has been to examine the degree to which factors which determine uptake of personalised nutrition vary between EU countries to better target policies to encourage uptake, and optimise the health benefits of personalised nutrition technology. A questionnaire developed from previous qualitative research was used to survey nationally representative samples from 9 EU countries (N = 9381). Perceived barriers to the uptake of personalised nutrition comprised three factors (data protection; the eating context; and, societal acceptance). Trust in sources of information comprised four factors (commerce and media; practitioners; government; family and, friends). Benefits comprised a single factor. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to compare differences in responses between the United Kingdom; Ireland; Portugal; Poland; Norway; the Netherlands; Germany; and, Spain. The results indicated that respondents in Greece, Poland, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, rated the benefits of personalised nutrition highest, suggesting a particular readiness in these countries to adopt personalised nutrition interventions. Greek participants were more likely to perceive the social context of eating as a barrier to adoption of personalised nutrition, implying a need for support in negotiating social situations while on a prescribed diet. Those in Spain, Germany, Portugal and Poland scored highest on perceived barriers related to data protection. Government was more trusted than commerce to deliver and provide information on personalised nutrition overall. This was particularly the case in Ireland, Portugal and Greece, indicating an imperative to build trust, particularly in the ability of commercial service providers to deliver personalised dietary regimes effectively in these countries. These findings, obtained from a nationally representative sample of EU citizens, imply that a parallel, integrated, public-private delivery system would capture the needs of most potential consumers.

At the centre of these changes are smallholder coffee producers, responsible for 80% of global coffee production. Although rural households are known to depend on more than agricultural production alone, the literature on specialty coffee and certification has rather narrowly focused on coffee income and production. In this study, broader impacts are explicitly taken into account. Household income was decomposed into categories corresponding to specific income-generating activities and coffee income was broken down into price, yield and area effects. Results show that coffee certification encourages farmers to specialise in coffee production, increasing coffee income but not total household income, at least not in the short run. The time and effort required to attain the higher coffee income offered by certified production means farmers have to give up other activities. This substitution effect cancels out the income effect, such that there is no increase in total household income. The lack of an effect on total household income suggests the return to the additional labour effort required for certified coffee production is not higher than in other activities, questioning the benefits of certification for small-scale producers.

The official control including both meat inspection (ante and post mortem) and food safety inspections (verification of FBO's self-inspection) of small-scale slaughterhouses was centralized from municipalities to the National Food Safety Authority (NFSA) in 2011 to address these perceived shortcomings. This study aimed to investigate the early effects of the centralization of meat inspection and food safety inspections, specifically the standardization of meat inspection fees and the quality of meat inspection services. In March all small-scale slaughterhouses (n = 52) received a questionnaire on the effects of centralizing meat inspection. We interviewed 12 small-scale slaughterhouses on site and the official veterinarians of ten of these small-scale slaughterhouses by phone. The results showed that introducing a meat inspection fee structure based on fixed hourly taxation that includes a fixed travel expense, can lead to more standardized fees. The variation in meat inspection fees after centralization was significantly smaller (Levene's test, p = 0.013) than before. Moreover, after centralization, meat inspection fees and the number of slaughtered animal units per year showed no significant correlation. Meat inspection fees decreased for the majority of FBOs, which was expected because of the government subsidies the FBOs received. The majority of FBOs perceived the guidance as good both before and after centralization, and both FBOs and official veterinarians assessed their cooperation as good. The availability of official veterinarians to perform ante and post mortem inspections posed no problem for most FBOs. However, 50% of the FBOs interviewed stated that the official veterinarian had performed no food safety inspections after centralization, which can negatively impact food safety. The majority of the official veterinarians stated that the guidance they received from the NFSA improved after centralization, but they still urged more guidance on interpreting food safety requirements and performing food safety inspections.

Findings indicate that both household composition and income have significant effects on FAFH participation and expenditures. Projections based upon our results suggest that FAFH expenditures in urban China will continue to increase through 2050.

We contribute to the literature in three ways: first, we define indices to assess the extent of asynchronicity and the relative strictness of the GMO approval authorizations of 40 countries considering GMO regulatory developments between 2000 and 2012 regarding cotton, maize and soybeans. Second, we introduce indices that are country-pair specific, product-specific, and year-specific in a gravity model to examine the trade impact of asynchronous regulatory approval across countries. By grouping the countries according to the state of their national regulatory GMO frameworks, we have an even more differentiated view on the trade impact of asynchronous approval that focuses not only on the existence of regulations but also on their restrictiveness. The results from the gravity model show that asynchronous approval has negatively impacted trade flows of cotton, maize and soybeans. It is observed that both asynchronous approvals and the restrictiveness of importing countries' regulations to address the importation of GMO products matter, meaning those countries that have already adopted a comprehensive GMO regulatory framework and have policies to manage the importation of GMO crops tend to feel a higher negative impact on trade flows.

Consumers, however, are unlikely to break their food habits unless they are aware of the problem and motivated by the solutions. Fear appeals are often used to overcome this, however, their effectiveness in the context of meat reduction and climate change is unclear. Given the widespread use of fear appeals in information policy, it is important to understand more. The aim of this study was to explore fear or more specifically the danger control process in a climate change food context in order to understand the factors which motivate consumers to reduce or alter their meat consumption. Using a stratified random sample of 222 respondents in Southern Sweden, we develop a model for predicting intentions to adopt specific and general actions to reduce or alter meat consumption. Our results suggest that the general key to motivating consumers is through increasing their self-efficacy towards adopting meat alternatives and educating them on the importance their actions have in reducing the threat.

This has led to a decline in the per capita availability of food. Increasing agricultural productivity is the key to agricultural growth, and one strategy for increasing agricultural productivity is to use improved seeds. This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in high yielding varieties (HYV) of paddy seed production on costs, yield, and profits of smallholder farms in Nepal. Using farm-level data and a non-parametric propensity score matching estimator, the study finds a significant positive impact of contract HYV seed farming on revenues, profits, and yield, and a significant negative impact on total costs of production. Additionally, very small farms (<= 0.43 ha) with CF in HYV paddy seeds tend to gain the most when it comes to yield per hectare. Our estimates reveal that the average smallholder household in Nepal engaged in CF with input conditions receives higher profits. However, farmers engaged in CF with output conditions tend to have higher yields but smaller profits. Finally, farmers engaged in CF in HYV paddy seeds with both input and output conditions have the highest yield gains and significantly higher profits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of our paper is to determine whether Brazil became more integrated with reduced transaction costs after the introduction of MERCOSUR with respect to its main agricultural trade partners, Argentina (a MERCOSUR member) and the United States (a non-MERCOSUR member). Using a threshold vector error correction model (TVECM), we estimate the transaction cost, price transmission elasticity and half-life adjustments for the most traded agricultural products between Brazil/Argentina and Brazil/United States from January 1980 to December 2012. Our findings suggest a strong MERCOSUR effect, with lower transaction costs and higher price transmission elasticity when compared to a non-agreement scenario. Moreover, the variations of both parameters are highly heterogeneous across products, depending mainly on their degree of differentiation. From a policy perspective, elements such as the sources of comparative and competitive advantages together with investment policies, specific market regulations and agricultural subsidies, among others, are mainly what influence the extent of transaction cost and market integration. Our results show that Brazil has made progress but still has considerable room for improvement in reducing barriers to agricultural products and, as a consequence, to achieving the full benefits of the MERCOSUR agreement.

However, there is limited empirical evidence on the effects of fertilizer subsidy programs on local food prices. Using an instrumental variables approach, we explore the effect of a fertilizer subsidy program on the seasonal growth rates of grain prices in Nigeria. Our results suggest that the fertilizer subsidy program had very small effects on the growth rates of grain prices between the post-planting and post-harvesting seasons. We also find that political influence played a role in the distribution of subsidized fertilizer. We discuss how the weak effects on the price growth rates may be caused by low market orientation, output market structures, greater focus on farmers' incomes, low marginal productivity of fertilizer, and politically influenced targeting.

In particular, we argue that the initial 'shocks' of improvements in quality and increased advertising were magnified through peer effects. Using detailed data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, we analyze the individual choice to drink beer, controlling for a wide range of potential factors. Our results indicate that peer effects played an important role as a 'transmission mechanism' in persuading consumers to start drinking beer.

In this study, we consider the spatially explicit potential impact of alternative healthier eating scenarios for the UK on global blue water scarcity using the concept of a water scarcity footprint. The water required to produce the food consumed by the UK was estimated at 52.6 Gm(3)/y of which 93% is from rainfall at the point where it falls and 7% is blue water withdrawn from surface and ground water resources. Five alternative healthier diets were considered and the impact on the blue water scarcity footprint was modest (ranging from -3% to +2% compared to baseline). However more significant impacts were projected on the geographical distribution of the blue water scarcity footprint. This study has shown that if current trade patterns continue, policies to promote healthier eating in the UK may contribute to increased blue water scarcity at home and in other parts of the world. The use of virtual water estimates and global datasets of water scarcity can help to understand the potential environmental impacts of alternative diets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results suggest that the sign increased the demand for the climate-certified milk by approximately 6-8%, and the result is robust to alternative model specifications. The effect is entirely driven by large stores, such as supermarkets.

Yet, investments in research and development (R&D) targeted to many national food and agricultural economies throughout Africa are fragile and faltering. To gain insight into what could be driving this trend, this article updates, summarizes and reassesses the published evidence on the returns to African agricultural R&D. Based on a compilation of 113 studies published between 1975 and 2014 spanning 25 countries, the reported internal rates of return (IRRs) to food and agricultural research conducted in or of direct consequence for sub-Saharan Africa averaged 42.3%py. In addition to the 376 IRR estimates, the corresponding 129 benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) averaged 30.1. Most (96.5%) of the returns-to-research evaluations are of publicly performed R&D, and the majority (87.6%) of the studies were published in the period 1990-2009. The large dispersion in the reported IRRs and BCRs makes it difficult to discern meaningful patterns in the evidence. Moreover, the distribution of IRRs is heavily (positively) skewed, such that the median value (35.0%py) is well below the mean, like it is for research done elsewhere in the world (mean 62.4%py; median 38.0%py). Around 78.5% of the evaluations relate to the commodity-specific consequences of agricultural research, while 5.5% report on the returns to an all agriculture aggregate. The weight of commodity-specific evaluation evidence is not especially congruent with the composition of agricultural production throughout Africa, nor, to the best that can be determined, the commodity orientation of public African agricultural R&D.

The analysis shows that in absolute terms, production shortfalls relative to demand for starchy staples (particularly rice and wheat) will continue to pose a major challenge for ECOWAS countries. In relative terms, however, imbalances between domestic production and demand will increase more quickly for foods with high income-elasticities of demand, such as meat, dairy products, seafood, fruits and vegetables and vegetable oils. Urban demand will grow two to four times faster than rural demand, depending on the commodity, putting increased pressure on already stressed urban food marketing systems. Substantial variations in supply-demand gaps across countries suggest that more fluid regional trade could help individual countries cope with these challenges. The findings also suggest that the focus of food policies in West Africa, historically on starchy staples (particularly cereals) needs to broaden to include a range of higher-value products for which demand is likely to increase very rapidly in the near future.

On the one hand, during setting and operating their FSMS activities, companies need to consider the riskiness of the 'FSMS context' of the company, including the risk of product and production, and the limitations and opportunities of the organisational and chain characteristics. On the other hand, companies with their narrow 'FSMS context' and actual FSMS, can be influenced by the 'broad context' in a country and sector. This paper presents an analytical framework with operational tools that enable assessment of the status of FSMS in view of the context riskiness at company level, and exploration of the influence of the 'broad context' in a country and sector. The latter was defined to include: food safety governance, agro-climatic, market, and public policy environment. Empirical data from three case studies of leafy greens production, intentionally chosen to represent three European regions with their specific contexts, was used to validate the analytical framework. As a conclusion, we postulate that the FSMS output is a function of the broad context in a country and sector, the 'FSMS context' in a company, and implemented food safety management system. The model is a first step towards conceptualisation of the complex systems influencing FSMS implementation and operation in companies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept articulates the need for mutual exchange by which societal actors become responsive to each other early on in the process of innovation, with a view to facilitate ethically acceptable and sustainable innovation. There is relatively limited evidence to explore the extent to which the process of research and innovation under the terms of RRI is realised in practice, particularly in the context of food and health research. Although research to date has been examining innovation from the point of view of inputs and outputs-R&D funding and patents we propose to examine the cognitive framing of innovation that shapes decisions of those who constitute a part of the innovation chain. This paper explores how the concept of innovation is understood and used in policy implementation, with a particular focus upon 'food and health' science and research policy and funding. Our analysis is based on 55 interviews of various actors engaged in research funding decision-making across eight European countries. Three themes emerged from the analysis: concept of innovation; conditions for innovation; and drivers of innovation; through these themes, the cognitive framing was drawn out. The cognitive framing suggests that innovation in the food and health domain is perceived to be focused on biosciences and marketable applications to the neglect of social sciences and broader public interest; that the innovation network is primarily viewed as centred around scientific/technical and industrial actors; and that the demand-pull dynamic is relevant to innovation in the area of food and health, despite having been relegated in contemporary thinking and policies around innovation. These findings point to the inadequate consideration of the normative issues how problems are to be defined and addressed among national research funders in the food and health domain, and indicate a gap between the ideas of innovation under the terms of RRI and innovation as conceptualised by those involved in its governance.

Yet despite the proliferation of mobile phone-based interventions in the agricultural sector, there is mixed evidence on their impact. We report the results of a randomized evaluation in Niger, in which rural households increased their access to information technology and their capacity to use it. We find that households in treated villages planted a more diverse basket of crops, particularly marginal cash crops grown by women. This did not increase the likelihood of selling these crops or the farm-gate price received, suggesting that other market failures need to be addressed to improve farmers' welfare.

With demand for meat and dairy products forecast to increase 60% by 2050, there is a pressing need to reduce the footprint of livestock farming. Food wastes have a long history as a source of environmentally benign animal feed, but their inclusion in feed is currently banned in the EU because of disease control concerns. A number of East Asian states have in the last 20 years, however, introduced regulated, centralised systems for safely recycling food wastes into animal feed. This study quantifies the land use savings that could be realised by changing EU legislation to promote the use of food wastes as animal feed and reviews the policy, public, and industry barriers to the use of food waste as feed. Our results suggest that the application of existing technologies could reduce the land use of EU pork (20% of world production) by one fifth, potentially saving 1.8 million hectares of agricultural land. While swill presents a low-cost, low-impact animal feed, widespread adoption would require efforts to address consumer and farmer concerns over food safety and disease control. (C) 2015 The Authors.

While a large body of work has shown that virtual water trade can enhance water saving on a global scale, being especially beneficial to arid countries, there are increasing concerns that openness makes countries more dependent on foreign food suppliers and, in this way, more prone to external shocks. Our evidence reveals that the increased globalization witnessed in the last three decades is not associated with the increased frequency of adverse shocks (in food production). Furthermore, building on recent advances in network analysis that connect the stability of a complex system to its topological features, we find that the world is more interconnected, but not necessarily less stable.

They certify that a product has some desirable unobserved quality, typically related to a public good such as being sustainably produced. Two issues that have received limited attention are whether pricing varies across different eco-labels that may compete with each other and to what extent different retailers charge different prices. Using a unique data set of salmon prices in eight different United Kingdom retail chains, we investigate these issues by estimating a price-attribute model that includes two eco-labels and one country-of-origin label. Results show substantial variation in the prices of the different eco-labels and that eco-label premiums vary across retail chains. Specifically, salmon certified with the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label has a high premium in low-end retail chains but no statistically significant premium in the high-end chains. These findings question the ability of the MSC label to transmit consumer willingness-to-pay for public goods through the supply chain to incentivize sustainable management.

We explore the determinants of the three types of labour used on farm (family labour, hired labour and contract labour), with a particular emphasis on the impact of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms and subsidies on the three labour types. We estimate a system of three equations, including a censored model, using the French Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) database. We find that hired labour and contract labour are substitutes as expected, but that hired labour and family labour are complements. This may reveal complementarities between management tasks (which are specifically for the farm head and family labour) and technical operations (the only operations performed by hired labour). In addition, we find that, in general, crop area payments and Single Farm Payments (SIP) have reduced farm labour, while agri-environmental payments, Less Favoured Area (LFA) payments and investment subsidies have increased it. Our results agree with most of the literature that coupled and decoupled area payments reduce labour use on farms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To fill this gap, the current study employs a sophisticated agricultural variant of the GTAP model to evaluate the recently agreed CAP spending limits for the financial period 2014-2020 as well as a more radical 50% cut to the CAP budget proposed by the UK government. The study incorporates methodological innovation in terms of the modelling of CAP budgetary mechanisms. Furthermore, official EU auditing statistics are employed to (i) greatly improve the existing representation of agricultural support payments in the GTAP benchmark data and (ii) implement a detailed contemporary CAP baseline for member states to capture both the decoupled/coupled split of support payments and the distribution of support across both 'pillars'. In general, CAP expenditure cuts have muted impacts on EU and world agricultural markets; whereas changes in net transfer payments have implications for real income and macro trade balances in EU member states. This observation is particularly pertinent when assessing conciliatory reductions in the UK rebate in exchange for deeper CAP budget cuts. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze the welfare implications for various agents in the wheat-flour value chain from 2000 to 2013, a period characterized by major global price volatility and by regular adjustments of domestic policies. We find that the wheat policy has generally benefitted flour consumers and wheat traders at the expense of wheat farmers, with limited effects on flour millers. Our findings illustrate that the welfare implications of policies can be quite different within the producer and consumer umbrellas, which has potentially important implications for economic and political economy analyses and for the design of policies that aim to target the poorest groups along value chains.

The footprint of food products provides a means for consumers to compare environmental impacts across and within product groups. In this study we apply carbon, nitrogen, and water footprints in tandem and present food labels that could help inform consumers about the environmental impacts of individual food products. The footprint factors used in this study are specific to the United States, but the concept can be applied elsewhere. We propose three methods of footprint calculations: footprint weight, sustainability measures, and % daily value. We apply the three footprint calculation methods to four example labels (stars label, stoplight label, nutrition label add-on, and a detailed comparison label) that vary in design and the amount of detail provided. The stars label is simple and easily understood but provides minimal detail about the footprints. At the other end of the spectrum, the detailed comparison label gives context in relative terms (e.g., carbon emissions for equivalent distance driven) for the food product. Implementing environmental impact food labels requires additional understanding of how consumers use footprint labels, and label suitability may vary for government organizations, retail and local grocers, and farmers.

However, livestock industries claim they are deceptive. One strategy to curtail these investigations has been the introduction of so-called ag-gag legislation, which aims to restrict the flow of information coming out of farm facilities. Psychological research suggests that this approach may be counter-productive as reducing information flow often reduces feelings of trust. We sought to extend these findings by applying them to a real-world, timely example and to determine whether the perceived intention to obstruct access to information erodes feelings of trust. Accordingly, this study tested whether simply being made aware of ag-gag laws might have a negative impact on trust in farmers. Participants (n = 716) were randomly assigned to either receive information about ag-gag laws or to a Control condition. We found that most people were unaware of ag-gag laws and that learning about them lead to a decrease in trust in farmers and an increase in support for animal welfare regulations. Interestingly, we also found evidence that awareness of ag-gag laws negatively impacted perceptions of the current status of farm animal welfare as well as the perception that farmers do a good job of protecting the environment. Through this topical example, this study demonstrates that even the intention to restrict access to information can undermine trust. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Robbins, J.

Stakeholder responses to food safety scares can cause significant economic losses for food firms. Assessing the overall impact that may result from a food recall requires a thorough understanding of the costs incurred by firms. However, a direct measurement of a firm's total private costs and losses of revenue associated with a food recall requires firm -level data that is not available. The method utilized in this study overcomes this limitation. Using an event study, the impact of meat and poultry recalls is quantified by analyzing price reactions in financial markets. A unique contribution of this study is evaluating whether recall and firm specific characteristics are economic drivers of the magnitude of impact of recalls on stock prices. On average, shareholders' wealth is reduced by 1.15 percent, equivalently to $109 million, within 5 days after a firm is implicated in a recall involving a serious food safety hazard. However, when recalls involve less severe hazards, stock markets do not react negatively. Firm size, firm's experience handling a recall, media information and recall size are drivers of the economic impact of meat and poultry recalls. Findings from this study provide essential information to the meat industry. In particular, understanding the likely impact of food recall events is critical for firms investing in food safety technologies and protocols. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper analyzes New York City's innovative experiences in regulatory approaches to nutrition. We combined a systematic documentary review and key informant interviews (n = 9) with individuals directly involved in nutrition policy development and decision making. Thematic analysis was guided by Kingdon's three-streams-model and the International Obesity Task Force's evidence-based decision-making framework. Our findings indicate that decisive mayoral leadership spearheaded initial agenda-change and built executive capacity to support evidence-driven policy. Policy-makers in the executive branch recognized the dearth of evidence for concrete policy interventions, and made contributing to the evidence base an explicit goal. Their approach preferred decision-making through executive action and rules passed by the Board of Health that successfully banned trans-fats from food outlets, set institutional food standards, introduced menu labeling requirements for chain restaurants, and improved access to healthy foods for disadvantaged populations. Although the Health Department collaborated with the legislature on legal and programmatic food access measures, there was limited engagement with elected representatives and the community on regulatory obesity prevention. Our analysis suggests that this hurt the administration's ability to successfully communicate the public health messages motivating these contentious proposals; contributing to unexpected opposition from food access and minority advocates, and fueling charges of executive overreach. Overall, NYC presents a case of expert-driven policy change, underpinned by evidence-based environmental approaches. The city's experience demonstrates that there is scope to redefine municipal responsibilities for public health and that incremental change and contentious public discussion can impact social norms around nutrition.

Evidence from a natural experiment,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Supply chain reform; Fresh food prices; Incomplete pass-through; Quasi-experimental design,REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS; MARKET POWER; TRANSMISSION; PRICES; ASYMMETRY; RETAIL,"The market for fresh food is often characterized by a large number of intermediaries delivering the product from the farmer to the retailer. The existence of these intermediaries, especially the informal ones, is often claimed to introduce market frictions that push fresh food prices up. We test the hypothesis that scaling down these frictions reduces the level of prices. Our data come from a policy reform in Turkey concerning the supply chain regulations in the market for fresh fruits and vegetables. Starting from January 1st, 2012, a new law is enacted (i) to remove informal intermediaries, (ii) to reduce the farmers' cost of access to formal intermediaries such as wholesale market places, and (iii) to provide the farmers with the option to directly sell their products to retailers bypassing the wholesale intermediaries. This policy reform resembles a natural experiment that exogenously reduces the supply chain barriers in the market for fresh fruits and vegetables. Using quasi-experimental methods, we show that the policy reform has strikingly reduced the prices in the wholesale market. We also provide some rough evidence that there is no price effect in the retail market, which suggests that part of the wholesale markups may have been transferred to the retailers. Taken at face value, these results provide some hints that consumers have not received any direct benefits from the reform ignoring the general equilibrium effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This enables us to directly predict the nutrition improvement and dietary change at different income levels from different aspects.

Applying a multilevel model on a large dataset of about 90,000 households, we find that the share of households at risk of becoming food-insecure (vulnerability) is higher than the share that is current food-insecure. Households in rural areas are least vulnerable. In contrast, residents of cities and urban areas experience high level of vulnerability that exceeds the average in the Punjab. The risk-induced vulnerability is higher than the structural-induced vulnerability and vulnerability to idiosyncratic shock is higher than vulnerability to covariate shocks. Findings imply that households in the Punjab are vulnerable not as a result of poor resource endowments but because of risk. The Pakistani government should go beyond mere observed food-insecurity to address the needs of the relatively larger population that is at risk of being food-insecure in the future.

We investigate how both responded to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's 2006 rule mandating that the quantity of trans fat in food products be separately labeled on the mandatory Nutrition Facts Panel across an entire differentiated product category. Using a longitudinal data set tracking both product offerings and consumer purchases in the market for margarine and spreads for over a decade, we analyze how product mix and consumer purchase behaviors were influenced by the new regulatory requirement. We find that the number of products bearing voluntary trans fat free labels increased after the labeling regulation was implemented. However, a large number of the newly introduced products exited the market within five years. As a result, the FDA's 2006 rule had a stronger short-run than long-run effect on product offerings. Even after the introduction of additional trans fat free labeled products, such products remained only a small percentage of margarine and spreads product offerings, increasing from a pre-regulation level of 2.3% of the market to a peak of 6.5% in 2007 before dropping to 3.1% by 2011. In addition to firm response, we examine demand-side reactions to the 2006 rule and find that consumers significantly increased their expenditures on trans fat free labeled products soon after the labeling changes were implemented, increasing from about 1.2% of the market in 2001 to a peak of 5.9% in 2007, before returning to 1.8% in 2011. We further explore variations in responses across different demographic characteristics. Although long-run effects are small, the market for trans fat free labeled margarine and spreads settled into a new equilibrium with a somewhat higher level of products in the market than prior to the 2006 rule taking effect and a somewhat higher share of expenditures in the category. Overall, our category-wide analysis of both firm and consumer behavior indicates that the effects of the labeling policy change were smaller in the longer run in this market than would be indicated by an analysis of only new product introductions in response to the policy change.

We find that the WTA/WTP gap is similar between valuations elicited with the contingent vs. the inferred valuation method.

However, a number of questions, particularly those related to the economics of biofuels, have not been fully investigated yet. Using an empirical model, this study analyzes the economics of meeting the biodiesel mandate using soybean oil. The study finds that meeting the biodiesel mandate would reduce social welfare, mainly because of the welfare loss to fuel consumers and net reduction in foreign exchange earnings due to soybean oil imports. However, if Zambia increases its domestic soybean supply, as well as oil yield, soybean-based biodiesel is likely to be welfare-beneficial. The country's welfare is found to be the highest under expanded soybean production and its domestic processing but with no biodiesel mandate.

Our results show that one-third of the rice area in India is affected by droughts, mostly moderate droughts, the frequency of which has increased in recent years. The severity of droughts, however, has reduced. An assessment of their impact reveals a decline in drought-induced losses in rice yield, in absolute as well as relative terms. The weakening effect of droughts is attributed to improvements in farmers' adaptive capacity due to expansion of irrigation facilities and increased availability of improved varieties for the rainfed production systems, along with other coping strategies.

In the Global Action Plan to prevent and control NCDs, the World Health Organization has set a target to reduce mean population salt intakes by 30% by 2025. To achieve this target, salt levels in prepared and processed foods must be reduced. In this paper we propose a step-wise approach for setting targets for salt levels in foods for LMICs, as the basis for voluntary or mandatory policy interventions. The five steps are: (1) identifying the foods which contribute to salt in the diet; (2) agreeing which foods to set targets for; (3) establishing the target levels; (4) stakeholder engagement; (5) establishing monitoring mechanisms. A case study of the process of establishing regional targets in the Pacific Islands is also provided. LMICs with limited resources should establish maximum upper limits for salt for the product categories, which together contribute the majority of salt in the diet. Targets should be standardized (e.g., salt per 100 g of product) and have clear timelines. As well as being the basis for voluntary or mandatory levels for salt levels in foods, targets can also be used to inform labeling and taxation policy.

Design: We searched five databases, five grey literature libraries, and hand-searched reference lists to identify all potentially relevant sources. To be included a paper needed to quantify the impact of UA on food security, dietary diversity, or nutrition status. Papers were screened and quality assessed and data were extracted in duplicate. Setting: Developing and transitional economies. Subjects: Urban farmers, their households, and communities. Results: We identified 11,192 potentially relevant studies and included 13 papers from 12 unique studies. Studies identified both positive and no associations with UA and food security, and in one study's sub-analysis, negative associations were detected. Weak study designs and methods, incomparable measures, compounded with the finding that food insecure households are more likely to engage in UA, all make interpretations difficult. All studies that measured dietary diversity found a positive association. Most studies found a positive association between engagement in UA and food consumption. Findings for nutritional status were mixed, some showing positive associations for stunting. Conclusion: Poor quality and weak study designs made interpretation difficult and the assignment of causation impossible. The evidence base for UA needs to be strengthened before it can be confidently recommended as a strategy to improve urban food security. We did not however, find any evidence to discourage its use.

However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, pen-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia. Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200 m(2)). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Insights from Malawi's input subsidy program,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food security; Storage; Improved maize seed adoption; Input subsidies; Malawi; Sub-Saharan Africa,FERTILIZER DEMAND; RESPONSES; IMPACT,"To date there is limited knowledge of how having access to post-harvest storage technology affects a smallholder African farmer's decision to adopt higher-yielding improved maize varieties. This is a key issue because higher yielding varieties are known to be more susceptible to storage pests than lower-yielding traditional varieties. We address this question using panel data from Malawi, and incorporating panel estimation techniques to deal with unobserved heterogeneity. Our results indicate that acquiring chemical storage protectants after the previous harvest is associated with a statistically significant and modest positive impact on the probability of adopting improved maize, total area planted to improved maize varieties, and share of area planted to improved maize varieties in the next planting season. We also find that the storage chemical subsidy is associated with significant crowding out of commercial storage chemical purchases, as farmers who acquire subsidized chemicals are more than 50 percentage points less likely to purchase commercial chemicals on average. These findings have implications for maize adoption and input subsidy policies, and they indicate that researchers, extension staff, and policy makers should consider post-harvest issue when promoting adoption of improved varieties.

Findings from a field experiment,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food assistance; Cash transfers; Preferences; Sharing norms,RESPONSE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK; MARKET-INFORMATION; TRANSFERS,"To explore whether choices for transfers are influenced by peer monitoring, we examine private versus public choices among monetarily equivalent values of cash and food in northern Kenya. Many northern Kenyan communities face high-levels of chronic food insecurity and are tightly-knit, often sharing food aid transfers. Yet, humanitarian cash transfers are relatively new to the area. Whether cash will be subject to the same sharing norms is not well understood. Utilizing a randomized block experiment, we find that assigning a respondent to choose in front of peers decreases the likelihood of choosing a cash transfer relative to at least some food. We argue that peer monitoring decreases the value of cash relative to food in two inter-related ways. Choosing food in public, first, provides an opportunity for respondents to publicly demonstrate a commitment to local food aid sharing norms. Second,, choosing cash in public may be riskier since cash does not yet have established sharing norms. A critical implication is that transfer choices and retargeting of resources within the community can be influenced by use of public or private discussions when eliciting community views, especially in communities where sharing is a salient social norm.

The impact of livestock transfer and development in rural Zambia,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Livestock donation; Poverty; Consumption expenditure; Revenue; Food security; Dietary diversity,FOOD SECURITY; MILK,"Analyses of the impacts of asset transfer programs often find statistically significant effects on consumption expenditures that are large in percentage terms but small in absolute value. This study explores the practical significance of such impacts using the case of a livestock transfer program among impoverished households in Zambia. As in other studies, results show that the asset transfers increased household consumption expenditure and dietary diversity. Extending previous work, this paper examines whether the increase in expenditures has been large enough to trigger changes in consumption patterns or in subjective assessment of poverty status. Changes in composition of expenditures, composition of diet, and subjective self-assessment of poverty all suggest a growing sense of security and a practically significant change in welfare for treated households. As transfers included three different types of animals - dairy cows, meat goats, and draft cattle - we are able to discern that the specific nature of the asset transferred influences food security impacts. Examination of change in the composition of consumption shows substantial effects on poverty and food security starting within six months of livestock transfers. Persistence of the impact through the next 18 months of our study period indicates that livestock transfers can have a sustained effect on poverty and food security. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An ongoing debate is whether urban agriculture (UA) may serve as a pathway to food security for poor urban households. To assess this potential within low-income countries, we used standard systematic review procedures to synthesize findings from 35 peer-reviewed journal articles from 1980 to 2013 that presented data on UA and food security indicators. Though data quality was often lacking, several key findings emerged. Many of the reviewed studies found subsistence to be the primary motivation for practicing UA, followed by financial benefit, with UA substantially contributing to farming households' food availability in some settings. Results regarding UA's impact on dietary diversity reveal that in some farming systems UA may provide households with greater access to specific foods. Evidence also indicates that UA can be a key source of household income, though actual returns were low. Furthermore, results show that UA can facilitate women's contribution to household food availability amid other household responsibilities, and can provide distinct benefits such as economic and social advancement. Although UA participation does not appear to fully eliminate pressure urban households face in obtaining food, a lack of supportive policies may constrain its potential. Municipal planning and agricultural policies that more effectively incorporate UA and that integrate gender may diminish barriers to productive UA practice. More rigorous research on UA's contribution to food security in settings where supportive policies have been enacted would more clearly elucidate these linkages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the viewpoints of dairy supply-chain members on acceptable innovation is important to be able to improve organic and low-input dairy supply chains. This study uses Stephenson's Q methodology to investigate the opinions of organic and low-input dairy supply-chain members in relation to innovation in the dairy sector. A sample of dairy supply-chain members (consumers, farmers, retailers, processors) was recruited from each European country involved in the study (Belgium, Italy, Finland, the United Kingdom). On the one hand, the data show a high degree of consensus across all of the participants within the supply chain, for whom innovations were deemed not to be acceptable in organic (from an ethical and/or regulatory perspective) and low-input dairy systems. On the other hand, the consumer views of acceptable dairy innovations were centred around animal welfare, while the farmers and processors/retailers preferred innovations related to feed quality, feed efficiency, and soil management. This study illustrates the value of Q methodology in eliciting subjectivities about food-policy-related issues. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent legislative proposals on immigration reform in the United States have renewed discussions about the role of guest worker programs, and highlighted the arguments for and against such programs. Even within the agricultural sector, there has not been strong broad-based support for an expansion in the number of guest workers. A model is developed that considers competing interests between commodity groups (horticulture crops and grain crops) to explain this lack of support, and then a series of simulations are conducted to highlight the possible economic effects of an expanded guest worker program. Results suggest that an increase in the labor supply would have much larger economic impacts for horticultural producers and firms in the supporting input markets. Furthermore, under some conditions, simulation outcomes show how an increase in the labor supply may lead to small revenue losses for both producers and input suppliers in grain markets.

For the analysis we employ a recursive-dynamic agricultural multi-commodity model within a stochastic framework. Results of the 10-years forward looking scenario indicate that the removal of biofuel policies would have a significant effect on price variability of biofuels, but only a marginal impact on the variability of agricultural commodity prices. Without biofuel policies, global biofuel demand would decrease by 25% for ethanol and 32% for biodiesel. Moreover, prices would only moderately decrease for ethanol feedstock commodities like wheat and coarse grains, while prices for biodiesel feedstock commodities, specifically vegetable oils, would be more affected. Due to competing uses of crop production such as feed and industrial use, abolishing biofuel policies would not necessarily lead to an increase in global food security, as food use increases would remain low for most crops and regions.

Our objective was to investigate whether children in rural farming communities of Nepal participating in a community-level, nutrition-sensitive development intervention had improved dietary quality compared with children living in non-participating matched rural communities. Six rural communities of Nepal where livelihoods were predominantly agricultural were selected to participate in the phased implementation of a community-level development intervention by Heifer International. Households and children in each community were surveyed at baseline, and follow-up surveys were implemented every six months for twenty-four months. Detailed data on food consumption for children older than 6 months of age were collected using a 24 h recall for 17 foods and food groups; parents responded for children. A difference-in-differences model with household fixed-effects and an analysis of covariance model were used to analyze the resulting panel data. Results indicated that the impacts of the intervention varied by agro-ecological region and by season. In the Hills region, which is poorer on average and more conducive to livestock production, children who had received the intervention for two years were 2.2 times as likely to have consumed food from an additional food group, 1.27 times as likely to have achieved minimum dietary diversity and 1.38 times as likely to have consumed animal source foods as children who received the intervention for only one year. In the Terai region, which is more conducive to crop production, there was no significant change in dietary quality attributable to the intervention. These results provide evidence that particularly vulnerable families can take advantage of community-level development activities. Given that the effects of community-level development activities were disparate across communities within the same country, we conclude that tailoring development activities for particular locations is necessary for success.

However, relatively little is known about the GHG mitigation potential in agriculture, in particular with respect to the combined effects of technological advancements and dietary changes. Here, we estimate the extent to which changes in technology and demand can reduce Swedish food-related GHG emissions necessary for meeting EU climate targets. This analysis is based on a detailed representation of the food and agriculture system, using 30 different food items. We find that food-related methane and nitrous oxide emissions can be reduced enough to meet the EU 2050 climate targets. Technologically, agriculture can improve in productivity and through implementation of specific mitigation measures. Under optimistic assumptions, these developments could cut current food-related methane and nitrous oxide emissions by nearly 50%. However, also dietary changes will almost certainly be necessary. Large reductions, by 50% or more, in ruminant meat (beef and mutton) consumption are, most likely, unavoidable if the EU targets are to be met. In contrast, continued high per-capita consumption of pork and poultry meat or dairy products might be accommodated within the climate targets. High dairy consumption, however, is only compatible with the targets if there are substantial advances in technology. Reducing food waste plays a minor role for meeting the climate targets, lowering emissions only by an additional 1-3%. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Many of these studies have been predicated on a life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and though transparent in communicating their work within that framework, it has largely gone unmentioned that LCA involves a number of choices by the assessor and LCA methodology developers that are ultimately subjective. This study uses a consequential LCA of the average Danish diet in comparison to model vegetarian and vegan diets, leveraging the cultural perspectives afforded by the ReCiPe methodology, as starting point to explore the ways that subjectivity influences the LCA process and to test the robustness of the results against these different viewpoints. Mirroring earlier studies, we find vegetarian and vegan diets generally perform better environmentally compared to a standard Danish diet, but that there was minimal difference between the two no-meat options. Results were resilient to varying cultural perspectives applied in the model. LCA methodology, though loaded with value judgments, remains a dependable tool for assessing environmental dietary performance, but is less suited for estimating environmental pressures that are highly dependent on local conditions (e.g. chemical toxicity).

Food price volatility causes planning problems for policy makers and is disruptive to the food supply chain. An increasingly common response to stabilizing domestic prices is to implement export restrictions. However, if the country is a large enough exporter, the restriction can exacerbate global price volatility. Using price data on maize, wheat, rice and soy, we estimate the effect of export taxes and quantitative restrictions - as well as other macroeconomic variables - on price volatility. First, we use a univariate structural time series approach to remove regularities such as cycles and trends to yield an estimate of filtered price volatilities. Second, we regress the estimated volatilities from the first stage on a set of explanatory variables using a generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. The results from the GMM regression show that export restrictions implemented between 2006 and 2011 increased price volatility for wheat and rice but not maize and soybean. Simulation results show that the contribution of export restrictions to price volatility is the same order of magnitude as key macroeconomic variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Most studies assessing the influence of nutrition labelling focus on consumer attention to labels, while few concentrate on its effects on actual purchase behaviour. In this study, we present results from an analysis of scanner data provided by a large UK retailer. We focus on two food categories, using store-brand products that are labelled with a front-of-pack, monochrome Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) nutrition label. The analyses are based on models at both an aggregated and disaggregated level to enable us to identify as many influencing factors on food choice as possible. We utilize the SSAg/1 health score for our food categories as a dependent variable to obtain an objective measure of healthiness. Our results suggest that the GDA label introduction reduces attraction of unhealthier products in terms of market share but does not affect product choice behaviour. Instead, price and habit exhibit a greater impact on purchase behaviour and product choice than the GDA label introduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we combine recent national survey data and media reports to quantitatively examine the effects of food scandals and media exposure on food safety risk. We find that media reported food scandals are not significantly related to public concern about food safety risk, suggesting that food risk perceptions may be nationwide rather than region specific. We also find out that more educated citizens with more media exposure are more concerned about food safety risk, and the amplification effect of food scandals is more prominent among residents with higher levels of education. In contrast to our expectation, family income is not significantly related to food safety concern. We also find that females, the elderly, and urban dwellers perceive higher levels of food risk than males, youngsters, and rural residents. The government should pay more attention to public perceptions of food safety, and strengthen its risk communication capacity to mitigate media amplification effects of food safety concern.

Focusing on the latter, we scrutinize the impacts of institutions aimed at facilitating land use dynamism, particularly the Rural Shareholding Cooperatives (RSCs), which have been established recently at the local level in rural China. In general, we find that RSCs can pave the way for the extension of property rights to farmland and promote more efficient land use patterns. Using survey data collected from 300 village committees in rural Jiangsu province, we estimate the effectiveness of RSCs in encouraging land rental. Our analysis reveals that RSCs can serve as intermediate agents for reducing transaction costs associated with exchange of land use rights and, thereby, not only encourage land rental/consolidation activities but also enable the entry of non-farm household entities into the farm business.

In China, expansion of its vegetable exports brought the attention of policy planners to the international food safety regulations. This paper reported the findings from the investigation about a relationship between trades of food and food safety, by focusing on the relationship between Chinese vegetable exports and the maximum residue limits of pesticides (MRLs) regulation set by the importing countries and exporting country. The revealed trade's behavior showed that impacts of MRLs should be seen through two types of information, one was the extent of coverage of regulation measured by the number of pesticides placed under the control, and the other was the regulated residue levels. Probably because the achieved vegetable production growth was supported by the extensive use of many kinds of pesticides, the expanding of the number of regulated pesticides in importing markets, was more likely to act as a barrier to China's vegetable exports compared to the effect of stringency increase of MRLs level. Importing countries' GDP reflecting the market potential showed significantly positive effects on Chinese vegetable exports, while the effects of vegetable production and tariff rate on exports were weakened after years of improvement of productivity and worldwide policy environment. Our results verified the export promoting effect of stringent regulations in exporting country on its trade. These findings strongly suggested that Chinese authorities need to move fast to catch-up to the growing concerns of international importers both from relevant policy planning and implementing, to capture economic growth in the medium-long term.

We show that when the insurer designs the healthcare payment policy to let hospitals dump high-cost patients, there is a trade-off between the disutility of dumped patients (changes in hospitals' rent extraction due to low-severity patients) and the shift in the level of cost reduction efforts for high-severity patients. We also clarify the welfare-improving conditions by allowing hospitals to dump high-severity patients. Finally, we show that if the efficiency of the cost reduction efforts varies extensively and the healthcare payment cost is substantial, or if there are many private hospitals, the patient dumping policy can improve social welfare in a wider environment.","[Takahara, Tsuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7,Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Takahara, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7,Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",mge012tt@student.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Takahara, Tsuyoshi/0000-0001-9555-2796",,,,,34,0,0,1,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

To predict human pressure, we applied a local knowledge-based model to a Geographic Information Systems and Multi-Criteria Evaluation (GIS-MCE) approach. The study area was Nevado de Toluca, which is located in a mountainous forest ecosystem of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. To construct the model, we used cartography data (land cover map, digital elevation model [DEMI, distribution of villages, roads and sidewalks) and local knowledge regarding mushroom harvesting (questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, field trips with mushroom harvesters). The level of pressure model was based on the application of the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC). Thus, harvesters were queried regarding the importance of the main criteria cited in the literature and whether they considered looking for the best harvesting sites. With the information generated, a multi-criteria image was obtained that expressed the potential harvesting pressure. The model was validated with real data from field trips. The location of harvesting sites was then compared with the level of pressure obtained with the GIS analysis model. The model demonstrated that proximity to fir (Abies religiose) forests exerted a greater influence on the value of the obtained pressure level; moreover, this type of vegetation is preferred by the local people for harvesting mushrooms. The final human pressure map confirmed that the model closely reflected the behavior of the mushroom harvesters in the studied region, and it was applied considering the 23 villages within the protected region of Nevado de Toluca. The information obtained can be used to locate areas with increased harvesting pressure, to establish potential sites for mushroom production, to propose a special program that includes management policies with successive harvesting schemes, or to define priority areas for monitoring and conserving this type of non wood forest products (NWFPs).

The ecosystem products are grouped into private and public activities and measured consistently-with the principle of exchange value of the standard national accounts. Private products comprise timber, cork, firewood, conservation forestry, grazing, livestock, hunting, crops and private amenity, while the public ones comprise mushrooms, carbon, water, public recreation, landscape and threatened biodiversity services. Our accounting approach revises and extends the standard agricultural and forestry sector income accounts by incorporating intermediate products, natural growth, private amenity, carbon sequestration and capital gain. Furthermore, our approach extends the standard government sector income accounts by including the economic value of the consumption of public final products delivered by ecosystems on the basis of simulating prices for non-market products. We apply the agroforestry accounting system to a group of 39 agroforestry farm case studies in Andalusia, Spain. We provide results for two agroforestry farm groups: publicly owned coniferous forest and privately owned native hardwood forest (dehesa). Total income attained, on average, 140 per hectare in coniferous forests and 352 per hectare in dehesas. Cork natural growth and private amenity are the main products explaining private income in dehesa farms. Forestry activity products, particularly timber natural growth and the intermediate products of conservation forestry, are the main sources of private income in the coniferous forests. Public incomes from non-market products are the main contributors of total income in dehesas and forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the presence of adverse selection by assessing the effect of healthcare utilization and frequency of use on NHIS renewal. Method: Routine enrolment and utilization data from 2008 to 2013 in two regions in Ghana was analyzed. Pearson Chi-square test was performed to test if the proportion of insured who utilize healthcare in a particular year and renew membership the following year is significantly different from those who utilize healthcare and drop-out. Logistic regressions were estimated to examine the relationship between healthcare utilization and frequency of use in previous year and NHIS renewal in current year. Results: We found evidence suggestive of the presence of adverse selection in the NHIS. Majority of insured who utilized healthcare renewed their membership whiles most of those who did not utilize healthcare dropped out. The likelihood of renewal was significantly higher for those who utilize healthcare than those who did not and also higher for those who make more health facility visits. Conclusion: The NHIS claims bill is high because high risk individuals who self-select into the scheme makes more health facility visits and creates financial sustainability problems. Policy makers should adopt pragmatic ways of enforcing mandatory enrolment so that low risk individuals remain enrolled; and sustainable ways of increasing revenue whiles ensuring that the societal objectives of the scheme are not compromised.,"[Duku, Stephen Kwasi Opoku; Arhinful, Daniel Kojo] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Accra, Ghana; [Duku, Stephen Kwasi Opoku] Free Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Duku, Stephen Kwasi Opoku] Ghana Hlth Serv, Accra, Ghana; [Asenso-Boadi, Francis] Natl Hlth Insurance Author, Accra, Ghana; [Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, Legon, Ghana",University of Ghana; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Ghana Health Service; University of Ghana,"Duku, SKO (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Accra, Ghana.;Duku, SKO (通讯作者)，Free Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Duku, SKO (通讯作者)，Ghana Hlth Serv, Accra, Ghana.",stephen.duku@ghsmail.org,"Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/S-9239-2019","Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/0000-0002-9754-1983",Government of the Netherlands through the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO/WOTRO) [W07.45.104.00],Government of the Netherlands through the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO/WOTRO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),This study received financial support from the Government of the Netherlands through the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO/WOTRO) in the form of a research grant (Grant No. W07.45.104.00).

However, weights attached to these are rarely quantified, thus decisions can depend strongly on decision-maker preferences. To explore the preferences of policymakers and healthcare professionals involved in the decision-making process for different efficiency and equity attributes of interventions and to analyse cross-country differences. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) were carried out in Austria, Hungary, and Norway with policymakers and other professionals working in the health industry (N = 153 respondents). Interventions were described in terms of different efficiency and equity attributes (severity of disease, target age of the population and willingness to subsidise others, potential number of beneficiaries, individual health benefit, and cost-effectiveness). Parameter estimates from the DCE were used to calculate the probability of choosing a healthcare intervention with different characteristics, and to rank different equity and efficiency attributes according to their importance. In all three countries, cost-effectiveness, individual health benefit and severity of the disease were significant and equally important determinants of decisions. All countries show preferences for interventions targeting young and middle aged populations compared to those targeting populations over 60. However, decision-makers in Austria and Hungary show preferences more oriented to efficiency than equity, while those in Norway show equal preferences for equity and efficiency attributes. We find that factors other than cost-effectiveness seem to play an equally important role in decision-making. We also find evidence of cross-country differences in the weight of efficiency and equity attributes.","[Baji, Petra; Gulacsi, Laszlo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Baji, Petra] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Garcia-Goni, Manuel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Aplicada 2, Madrid, Spain; [Mentzakis, Emmanouil] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Dept Econ, Southampton, Hants, England; [Paolucci, Francesco] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Paolucci, Francesco] Murdoch Univ, Murdoch, WA, Australia",Corvinus University Budapest; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Complutense University of Madrid; University of Southampton; University of Bologna; Murdoch University,"Baji, P (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary.;Baji, P (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",petra.baji@uni-corvinus.hu; mggoni@ccee.ucm.es; laszlo.gulacsi@uni-corvinus.hu; e.mentzakis@soton.ac.uk; F.Paolucci@murdoch.edu.au,"García-Goñi, Manuel/AAJ-5062-2020; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Silva-Castillo, Vicente-Xavier xs/S-5324-2018","García-Goñi, Manuel/0000-0001-5266-7112; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Mentzakis, Emmanouil/0000-0003-1761-209X; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746; Paolucci, Francesco/0000-0001-6173-5324; PAOLUCCI, FRANCESCO/0000-0002-6585-7190",Hungarian Scientific Research Fund OTKA [PD 112499]; Evaluating Preferences for Equity and Efficiency among National/Regional Health Policy Makers'' - Spanish Instituto de Estudios Fiscales,Hungarian Scientific Research Fund OTKA(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)); Evaluating Preferences for Equity and Efficiency among National/Regional Health Policy Makers'' - Spanish Instituto de Estudios Fiscales,"The authors are grateful for Georg Rubiko, University of Innsbruck, Austria, Prof. Terje P.

Using longitudinal data on two cohorts of Tennessee public college students and regression discontinuity designs centered around merit-based HOPE scholarship renewal benchmarks, we find that losing one's scholarship results in a small degree of detachment from college and a rise in earnings of about 14 cents per dollar of lost aid. We see no local impact, however, on timely degree completion, which implies that HOPE loss may have merely accelerated a small number of students' migration out of college. It remains to be seen how students fare farther below the renewal threshold, or whether they are better off for having had the HOPE scholarship at all, albeit for a short time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this case, insurance against early termination encourages workers to exert effort, thus allowing the firm to better identify workers' ability.

Materials and methods We collected data on hospital resource use in Norway following a breast cancer diagnosis for the period 1 January, 2008 through 31 December, 2009 for women aged 50-69 years, diagnosed with breast cancer during the period 1 January, 1999 through 31 December, 2009. We estimated treatment costs using a function that included the probability of being at risk for receiving treatment, estimated by means of the Cox proportional hazard model. Results In total, 16,045 patients were included for the analyses among which 10.5 % died during the study period. The mean 10-year per-person treatment cost was (sic)31,940 (95 % CI (sic)31,030-32,880), and lower for cancers detected within the public screening program ((sic)30,730) than for those detected elsewhere ((sic)36,230). For ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and cancers in stages I thru IV, treatment costs were (sic)15,740, (si)23,570, (sic)46,550, (sic)55,230 and (sic)60,430, respectively. Interval cancers occurring within the screening program were generally more resource demanding than both cancers detected at screening or elsewhere.

It therefore takes an actor and interest-based approach on framing. The empirical study is based on 129 media articles on forest conservation published in international print media, TIME and International Herald Tribune between 1990 and 2004. The results indicate that journalists are in a prime position: on the one hand, dominantly framing problems and, on the other hand, acting like a gatekeeper deciding on the visibility and standing of other actors. In their framing, journalists have assigned the role of causers mainly to the political-administrative system (PAS) and enterprises and the role of the helper as well to the PAS but furthermore to NGOs and individuals. Attention paid to media stars addressing forest conservation issues appears as a strategy to increase the news value of the articles. Except for journalists, actors with standing use the chance to present themselves in the role of helper only to a limited extend and they make even more seldom use of the speaker position to point towards a specific causer.

Whereas many disciplines failed to adhere to its fundamental principles, e.g. due to low response rates, often inadequate sampling procedures, or an over-reliance on the cross-sectional approaches, in forest science no systematic evidence can be found, even though this kind of inquiry has been used for almost six decades now. We therefore examine how much research in forest science is survey-based and how its amount has developed over time? Has survey based research in forest science matured? Has this research applied sound methodology and what are the main avenues for improvement? To find answers, we analyzed survey-based articles published in 20 forest science journals from 2005 to 2014 and found that an average of 3.2% of research was survey-based. We could identify a significant increase in the percentage of survey-based articles among the total articles published throughout the same time period. By further analyzing the relative contribution of exploratory, descriptive and explanatory types of survey-based articles, among the total amount of articles we found that the increase in the percentage was mostly concentrated on the group of explanatory articles. According to the research maturity cycle, this indicates that survey-based research in forest science is maturing. By additionally applying a framework of 16 assessment items to our data, we evidenced that for half of these items methodology could have been more carefully applied. Respective improvement avenues were detected by using the Survey Assessment Matrix (SAM). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A systematic review was conducted to identify and summarise the key areas of variability and limitations in modelling approaches in the economic evaluation of treatments for chronic pain. The results of the literature review were then used to support the development of a fully flexible open-source economic model structure, designed to test structural and data assumptions and act as a reference for future modelling practice. The key model design themes identified from the systematic review included: time horizon; titration and stabilisation; number of treatment lines; choice/ordering of treatment; and the impact of parameter uncertainty ( given reliance on expert opinion). Exploratory analyses using the model to compare a hypothetical novel therapy versus morphine as first-line treatments showed cost-effectiveness results to be sensitive to structural and data assumptions. Assumptions about the treatment pathway and choice of time horizon were key model drivers. Our results suggest structural model design and data assumptions may have driven previous cost-effectiveness results and ultimately decisions based on economic value.

Evaluating the impact of Sierra Leone's free health care initiative",HEALTH ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS,"This study evaluates the impact of Sierra Leone's 2010 Free Health Care Initiative (FHCI). It uses two nationally representative surveys to identify the impact of the policy on utilisation of maternal care services by pregnant women and recent mothers as well as the impact on curative health care services and out-of-pocket payments for consultation and prescription in children under the age of 5 years. A Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) is applied in the case of young children and a before-after estimation approach, adjusted for time trends in the case of expectant and recent mothers. Our results suggest that children affected by the FHCI have a lower probability of incurring any health expenditure in public, non-governmental and missionary health facilities. However, a proportion of eligible children are observed to incur some health expenditure in participating facilities with no impact of the policy on the level of out-of-pocket health expenditure. Similarly, no impact is observed with the utilisation of services in these facilities. Utilisation of informal care is observed to be higher among non-eligible children while in expectant and recent mothers, we find substantial but possibly transient increases in the use of key maternal health care services in public facilities following the implementation of the FHCI. The diminishing impact on utilisation mirrors experience in other countries that have implemented free health care initiatives and demonstrates the need for greater domestic and international efforts to ensure that resources are sufficient to meet increasing demand and monitor the long run impact of these policies.","[Edoka, Ijeoma] Wits Sch Publ Hlth, PRICELESS, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Ensor, Tim] Univ Leeds, Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [McPake, Barbara] Queen Margaret Univ Edinburgh, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [McPake, Barbara] Univ Melbourne, Nossal Inst Global Hlth, Melbourne, Australia; [Amara, Rogers; Edem-Hotah, Joseph] Univ Sierra Leone, Coll Med & Allied Hlth Sci, Rebuild Consortium, Freetown, Sierra Leone; [Tseng, Fu-Min] Imperial Coll London, Dept Surg & Canc, London, England",University of Witwatersrand; University of Leeds; Queen Margaret University; University of Melbourne; Imperial College London,"Edoka, I (通讯作者)，Wits Sch Publ Hlth, PRICELESS, Johannesburg, South Africa.",ijeoma.edoka@wits.ac.za,"Ensor, Tim/ABD-5899-2020; McPake, Barbara/AAE-8655-2021","Ensor, Tim/0000-0003-0279-9576; McPake, Barbara/0000-0002-9904-1077; Tseng, Fu-Min/0000-0002-7015-924X; Edoka, Ijeoma/0000-0003-4268-3092",Department for International Development (DFID) [201401] Funding Source: researchfish,Department for International Development (DFID),,,26,11,13,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Research shows that disability is an important determinant of long-term care utilization. In this context, reablement has received increased attention. Reablement is a form of home-based rehabilitation, which focuses on improving independent functioning in daily activities perceived as important by the older adult. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reablement. Methods: The economic evaluation is based on data from a randomized controlled trial in which all participants were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 9 months. The intervention group participated in reablement, while the control group received usual care. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was used to measure self-perceived activity performance and satisfaction with performance. Cost data were based on daily registrations of usage of home-based care personnel during a period of 9 months. Results: Reablement was found to be more cost-effective than usual care. The assessments of performance and satisfaction regarding daily activities were significantly higher in the reablement group compared with the control group and this was achieved at lower cost. Importantly too, in the post-trial period, the intervention group requested significantly fewer home visits which were, on average, of significantly shorter duration compared with the control group. Expenditure on home visits was significantly lower for the reablement group. Conclusions: Reablement is a more cost-effective intervention compared with usual care. Reablement has a potentially large effect on the demand for compensating home-based care services. Policy-makers should therefore consider implementing reablement on a larger scale.","[Kjerstad, Egil] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, POB 7810, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Tuntland, Hanne Kristin] Bergen Univ Coll, Ctr Care Res Western Norway, POB 7030, Bergen, Norway; [Tuntland, Hanne Kristin] Bergen Univ Coll, Dept Occupat Therapy Physiotherapy & Radiog, POB 7030, Bergen, Norway",Western Norway University of Applied Sciences; Western Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Kjerstad, E (通讯作者)，Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, POB 7810, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",Egil.Kjerstad@uni.no,,,Regional Research Funds Western Norway [229759]; Norwegian Association of Occupational Therapists,Regional Research Funds Western Norway; Norwegian Association of Occupational Therapists,"HT, EK and local research assistants were sponsored by the Regional Research Funds Western Norway, grant number 229759.

The analysis suggests that the ASEAN Economic Community and the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free 'Trade Agreement are the most comprehensive agreements and have deeper commitments as compared to the other ASEAN regional Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Despite some broad commonalities, there are significant differences. across them in terms of the negotiating framework, coverage of issues, deadlines and depth of commitments. This lack of coherence across the ASEAN+1 Free 'Trade Agreements and varying domestic interests of negotiating countries would be a difficult task to harmonize under the RCEP agreement. Adding to this complexity are the geopolitics in the Asian region and the emergence of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which involves seven of the RCEP members. The article concludes that the potential success of the RCEP negotiation would depend on the extent to which countries that are part of this partnership can reach a consensus on substantial tariff elimination coverage, a common market access schedule, comprehensive coverage of WTO-plus issues and behind-the-border integration measures that enable both physical and institutional connectivity.","[Basu Das, Sarithita] Inst Southeast Asian Studies ISEAS, Yusof Ishak Inst, ASEAN Studies Ctr, Econ Affairs, 30 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Singapore 119614, Singapore; [Sen, Rahul; Srivastava, Sadhana] AUT, Fac Business Econ & Lavv, Sch Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Sen, R (通讯作者)，AUT, Fac Business Econ & Lavv, Sch Econ, Auckland, New Zealand.",sanchita@iseas.edu.sg; rahul.sen@aut.ac.nz; sadhana.srivastava@aut.ac.nz,"Srivastava, Sadhana/ABE-5126-2021; Sen, Rahul/AFK-4535-2022","Srivastava, Sadhana/0000-0002-1260-267X; Sen, Rahul/0000-0002-8067-7876",,,,,35,10,11,0,27,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Linking our survey records to administrative education and earnings data, we compare earnings and cost expectations to observed values for past students and follow survey participants forward to see how beliefs relate to matriculation and dropout outcomes. We find that students have correctly centered but noisy cost expectations, and appear to systematically overestimate earnings outcomes for past graduates. Students who overestimate costs are less likely to matriculate in any degree program and in their stated first-choice program, and are more likely to drop out. Students who overestimate earnings matriculate at similar rates to other students, but choose degree programs where past students have been less likely to graduate, have earned less early in their careers, and have been more likely to default on student loans. Consistent with an informal model of enrollment choice, students with a stated preference for labor market-related degree characteristics are less likely to overestimate earnings outcomes and choose degrees where past students have gone on to earn more, while the opposite is true for students with a stated preference for enjoyment of the curriculum.

The latter cause a significant cost to the National Health Service and the Personal Social Services in the UK. Tramadol has a higher risk of fractures than some other opioid analgesics used to treat moderate-to-severe pain and, in the model described here, we investigate the cost effectiveness of transdermal buprenorphine treatment compared with tramadol in a high-risk population. Methods A model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of tramadol compared with transdermal buprenorphine over a 1-year time horizon and a patient population of high-risk patients (female patients age 75 or older). To estimate the total cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of treatment, published odds ratios are used in combination with the published incidence rates of four types of fracture: hip, wrist, humerus and other. Results The model shows tramadol to be associated with 1,058 more fractures per 100,000 patients per year compared with transdermal buprenorphine, resulting in transdermal buprenorphine being cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than 7,000 pound compared with tramadol. Sensitivity analysis found this result to be robust. Limitations In the UK data, there is uncertainty regarding the transdermal buprenorphine odds ratios for fractures. Odds ratios published in Danish and Swedish studies show similar point estimates but are associated with less uncertainty. Conclusion Transdermal buprenorphine is cost-effective compared to tramadol at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 pound per QALY.","[Hirst, Alexander; Knight, Chris; Akehurst, Ron] BresMed Hlth Solut Ltd, Northchurch Business Ctr, 84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Hirst, Matt; Dunlop, Will] Mundipharma Int Ltd, Unit 194, Cambridge Sci Pk,Milton Rd, Cambridge CB4 0AB, England; [Akehurst, Ron] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S4 1DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Dunlop, W (通讯作者)，Mundipharma Int Ltd, Unit 194, Cambridge Sci Pk,Milton Rd, Cambridge CB4 0AB, England.",will.dunlop@mundipharma.co.uk,,"Knight, Christopher/0000-0001-6428-0505","Mundipharma International Limited, United Kingdom","Mundipharma International Limited, United Kingdom","This research was funded by Mundipharma International Limited, United Kingdom.

Moreover, speculative capital flows from abroad exacerbated economic volatility and damaged economic growth prospects for all these countries during the crisis period. Thus, it may be important for policymakers to take appropriate actions against the potential risk of economic instability and market volatility from speculative capital.","[Yang, Lu] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Hamori, Shigeyuki] Kobe Univ, Fac Econ, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Kobe University,"Hamori, S (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Fac Econ, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan.",hamori@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,"Yang, Lu/AAR-3577-2020; Hamori, Shigeyuki/J-4877-2019","Yang, Lu/0000-0003-3112-1115; Hamori, Shigeyuki/0000-0003-1498-0188",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [105/31541410516],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 105/31541410516).,,26,7,7,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

A modernist worldview typical of the 1950s would likely characterise this as a process of 'undevelopment'. In a changing world, however, we might elect to see the de-industrialisation of the West as a necessary rebalancing of the uneven development of the colonial era. More commonly, however, the notion of a 'post-industrial' society has been postulated not as a lapse into a pre-industrial epoch or a lasting redistribution of productive wealth, hut rather as marking a paradigm shift into a new stage of post-modern social and economic development (Bell 1973; Masuda 1980; Kumar 2005). By this reading, the most developed countries are deemed as having passed through certain stages in economic and social organisation (namely, agricultural society and industrial society) prior to the pursuit of a post-industrial society. This teleology naturally causes us to question the implications of this new paradigm for a country like India, which has invested so much in industrialisation as the ultimate goal of the development process.","[Athique, Adrian] Univ Queensland, Inst Adv Studies Humanities, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Athique, A (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Inst Adv Studies Humanities, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",a.athique@uq.edu.au,,"Athique, Adrian/0000-0002-9692-4421",,,,,36,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,61,76,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_4,0.0,,,16,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800004,0

The objective of this paper is to analyse the relation between forest cover and the reduction of flood risks on Trinidad. Our hypothesis is that the relation between forest cover and flood control is non-linear, in other words that deforestation of a watershed will increase flood risks in a non-linear way. This implies that the per hectare value of the hydrological service is determined in part by the remaining forest cover of the catchment. We find that this varies strongly between watersheds, between 16 and 268 US $ per hectare per year. Our results demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between catchment's forest cover and the generation of the flood control service, and indicate that even small levels of deforestation can lead to a significant increase in flood risks in Trinidad.

According to this the organization development objectives are determined and the plan is defined for how and when to use development opportunities for objectives realization, how and when to streamline the ways of achieving them.

Based on the analysis of organization innovation policies in industrialized countries, a classification of product innovations strategies is developed: 1. Actively offensive strategy: aims the superiority in terms of innovation in certain areas of activities or in the region of sales. As a rule, it applies to one or more types of production, where there are favorable conditions for it. 2. Moderately offensive strategy: provides the position of the second best producer. Typically, it is used by powerful and large organizations in some activities, the range of which is broader than in the case of actively offensive strategy. 3. Defensive strategy: focused on the preservation of the average organization position, not facing difficulties in sales due to lack of marketing competition. Organization using the defensive strategy usually saves on independent research and development, as it uses the experience and achievements of other companies that are leaders in the given field of innovation. 4. The residual strategy main point is to try to get accustomed to the established markets with average or even obsolete in terms of innovation products.

It was created by European experts as a simple and easy to apply tool, composed of 67 indicators, specially conceived to offer support for European tourist destinations which are interested in developing in a sustainable way. It can be used both as an evaluation tool and as a benchmarking tool. In this context, this paper introduces the Research Project called Destination Intelligent Management for Sustainable Tourism (DIMAST) which was launched in Romania in 2014, aiming to implement the European Tourism Indicator System through a Business Intelligence application. Two qualitative research methods were used within the present paper: the case study and innovation. The first part of the article shortly introduces the information on the European Tourism Indicator System TOOLKIT for Sustainable Destinations. The paper than focuses on the above mentioned Pilot project which has as its main objective to support the local Destination Management Organization from Brasov County, one of the most famous tourist destinations in Romania, to develop in a sustainable way using an innovative Business Intelligence software based on the 67 indicators developed by the European Commission in 2013. The project groups seven partners from tourism research institutions, tourism industry, as well as an ICT software developer and it is actually in progress, a genuine set of indicators being already conceived based on Brasov's profile. Due to the fact that there was not available data for many European Indicators, the article presents how the European system has been genuinely adapted in the case of Brasov County. The main findings of this project can be used as best practice by other European destinations willing to develop in a sustainable way.","[Cismaru, Laura; Dinca, Gheorghita; Bratucu, Gabriel] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Cismaru, L (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",,,,"Romanian Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation, the Joint Applied Research Projects [PN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4, 324/2014]","Romanian Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation, the Joint Applied Research Projects","The research presented in this paper is supported by the Romanian Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation, the Joint Applied Research Projects PN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4, under the contract no. 324/2014.",,12,1,1,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,11,18,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200002,0

It involves various private and public actors who work together to co-create and share new collective knowledge. SF initiatives also involve many policies and tools that need to be reframed in order to facilitate the evaluation of these practices. Research in SF includes the active role of researchers in medium-term initiatives, involving a large number of stakeholders. Thus an evaluation of SF practices is crucial in developing and planning future actions. The complex nature of SF has led to the use of a transdisciplinary approach for the evaluation of its initiatives. This paper explains the transdisciplinary process used in a SF project, describes the nature of the collaborative relationships between researchers and others stakeholders, and examines the factors that inhibit and facilitate this collaboration. The paper highlights the important effects the transdisciplinary approach could have on the future of SF, in terms of network building, the co-production of knowledge, and the development of innovative practices.

Private foundations represent one useful avenue for achieving this end, and the use of private foundations has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in European countries. Many countries have laws which regulate private foundations and several are looking for adjusting or introducing legislation. In this article I have looked at different options for taxation of private foundations and analysed what would be the best approach from the game theory point of view. The article comes to a conclusion that at the Nash equilibrium countries give tax exemptions to private foundations established by non-residents. Also I analyse why countries should be interested in changing taxation, even the best approach seems to avoid collecting tax revenues from private foundations. I believe that service fees a country earns and taxes collected from these fees would be substantial enough to make necessary changes to legislation.","[Kaarlep, Urmas] Estonian Business Sch, Tallinn, Estonia",Estonian Business School,"Kaarlep, U (通讯作者)，Estonian Business Sch, Tallinn, Estonia.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27.0,,,,,,163,172,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700018,0

The friction cost approach has been proposed as a more appropriate alternative to the human capital approach when valuing productivity loss, although its application remains limited. This study reviews application of the friction cost approach in health economic studies and examines how its use varies in practice across different country settings. Methods A systematic review was performed to identify economic evaluation studies that have estimated productivity costs using the friction cost approach and published in English from 1996 to 2013. A standard template was developed and used to extract information from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Results The search yielded 46 studies from 12 countries. Of these, 28 were from the Netherlands. Thirty-five studies reported the length of friction period used, with only 16 stating explicitly the source of the friction period. Nine studies reported the elasticity correction factor used. The reported friction cost approach methods used to derive productivity costs varied in quality across studies from different countries. Conclusions Few health economic studies have estimated productivity costs using the friction cost approach. The estimation and reporting of productivity costs using this method appears to differ in quality by country. The review reveals gaps and lack of clarity in reporting of methods for friction cost evaluation. Generating reporting guidelines and country-specific parameters for the friction cost approach is recommended if increased application and accuracy of the method is to be realized.","[Kigozi, Jesse; Jowett, Sue; Barton, Pelham; Coast, Joanna] Univ Birmingham, Sch Hlth & Populat Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Lewis, Martyn] Keele Univ, Primary Care Sci, Arthrit Res UK Primary Care Ctr, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England",University of Birmingham; Keele University,"Kigozi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Sch Hlth & Populat Sci, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",j.kigozi@bham.ac.uk,"Jowett, Sue/AAO-4198-2021","Jowett, Sue/0000-0001-8936-3745; Kigozi, Jesse/0000-0001-7608-4923; Lewis, Martyn/0000-0001-5290-7833; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166",Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre (Doctoral Research Award in the area of economics of back pain) as part of a National Institute for Health Research programme through Keele University; MRC [MR/K025643/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/K025643/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre (Doctoral Research Award in the area of economics of back pain) as part of a National Institute for Health Research programme through Keele University; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),Jesse Kigozi was supported by the Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre (Doctoral Research Award in the area of economics of back pain) as part of a National Institute for Health Research programme of work funded through Keele University.

With only aggregate data, measurement puts further demands on the empirical strategy. Structural time series models and the state-space form are well suited for unobserved phenomena, such as technical change. In fisheries, technical advance often contributes to increased fishing pressure, and improved productivity measures are important for managers concerned with efficiency or conservation. I apply a structural time series model with a stochastic trend to measure technical change in a Cobb-Douglas production function, considering both single equation and multivariate models. Results from the Norwegian Lofoten cod fishery show that the approach has both methodological and empirical advantages when compared with results from the general index approach, which has been applied in the literature.","[Kvamsdal, Sturla Furunes] NHH, SNF Ctr Appl Res, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Kvamsdal, SF (通讯作者)，NHH, SNF Ctr Appl Res, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",sturla.kvamsdal@nhh.no,,,Norwegian Research Council [234238/E40],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),I acknowledge funding from the Norwegian Research Council (Project no. 234238/E40).,,31,14,15,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

In this context, the present article advances the idea of creating a web platform dedicated to both organic wine producers and organic wine consumers in Romania, based on an innovative Business Intelligence tool for wine products scoring (wines, wine cellars, vineyards and wine events). The first part of the article contains best practice presentation, including a synthesis of WineBook Romanian project. This Romanian Business Intelligence software was created for wine tasting events. Having WineBook as a starting point, this article introduces the ROVINTIS Research Project which has as its main objective to develop a collaborative web platform for the Romanian organic wine friends community. Within this collaborative platform, an innovative Business Intelligence tool will be developed in order to offer decision support to both producers and consumers. The architecture of this ICT solution has two components: a mobile app for wine tourists, which includes an original rating system for Romanian organic wine products (wines, wine cellars, vineyards and wine events), and a back office component which includes specific reports for organic wine producers. The ROVINTIS collaborative web platform is designed to get together the community of organic wine consumers with organic wine producers, winemakers, distributors and event organizers, offering them the possibility to actively interact. Using ROVINTIS platform, organic wine producers will therefore be able to obtain instant feedback from wine tourists and the entire organic wine friend community. The proposed mobile app mainly addresses the savvy wine tourists who consume organic wine, who can be included within the category of the so-called sustainable-oriented tourists. They have to check in, using a QR Code, each time they visit a Romanian wine cellar or vineyard, participate in a wine event or when they simply drink an organic Romanian wine, and rate the wine(s), the cellar, the vineyard or the event using specific rating systems. User scoring notes are also envisaged to be part of the application. As a pilot application, the ROVINTIS model can be afterward adapted to foreign organic wine markets.","[Lupu, Mirabela; Cismaru, Laura; Padureanu, Vasile; Canja, Cristina; Mazarel, Adrian] Transilvania Univ, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Lupu, M (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ, Brasov, Romania.",,"Mirabela, Lupu/HJI-7262-2023",,,,,,9,1,1,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,253,260,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100034,0

The rationale for the choice of this topic was mainly to provide relevant information on a real situation in the tourism market, namely the use of information systems in tourism economic units, more precisely tourism agencies. Statistical inquiry was the method applied in order to fmd out about the information systems employed by the agencies, and to identify both their weaknesses and benefits [3]. The results of the inquiry showed the opinions of the users, but, more importantly, the type of information systems available in agencies and the advantages that they bring. The inquiry was the tool of gathering data. For data interpretation and analysis the statistical program SPSS was resorted to. The findings consist in the fact that managers introduced change in their companies in order to simplify and eliminate useless data and in order to utilize IT systems [2] that would help people work better with data. The emphasis falls on people's training, so that they should understand the business, on correlating employee performance with company performance and on using information and IT software effectively in doing business. Competitive edge will be gained by those companies which obtain superior results in business through the synchronization of three elements: employee management, information and IT [3].

These technologies, together with progress in the area of telecommunications have contributed to the modernization of tourism services.

It is estimated that majority of seafood workers are foreign born. Labor is a major input in the seafood processing industry. Shortage in seafood workers (labor, majority of which are nonimmigrant H-2B workers) can significantly affect seafood production, processing, and result in severe financial problems. However, the relative significance of labor attributes that are most important in hiring decisions, including immigration status, are not clear. Seafood processor preferences for hiring employees are explored in light of references, wages, and immigration status. Using survey data and conjoint analysis, this study determines the relative importance of labor attributes and identifies distinct clusters of processors in terms of processor preferences for hiring labor. The H-2B program reduces companies' training and turnover costs. Many survey respondents complained about high turnover among US workers. Results indicate that for seafood processors, wage is the most important and visa status the least important factor when hiring seafood workers. Findings from this study may have important implications on economic impact studies using input/output models that usually use naive assumptions regarding labor costs and hiring preferences","[Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Agribusiness, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Gillespie, Jeffrey M.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Gillespie, Jeffrey M.] Louisiana State Univ, AgCtr, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Arizona State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Agribusiness, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",Ashok.K.Mishra@Asu.edu; JGillespie@agcenter.lsu.edu,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

This paper will be focused on rail transport, especially on accidents. Rail transport is an important part of the transport system in the Czech Republic because of the railway infrastructure's density. In the monitored period 2008 2015 the accidents in rail transport had relatively declining trend. The aim of this article is to analyze accidents in rail transport in the Czech Republic in the period 2008 2015 and forecast future course for the year 2016. In the first step it will be recognized the seasonal trend of the time series of accidents in rail transport. In case that the time series will have a seasonal component, it must be cleaned of its impact. After seasonal analysis will be investigated the trend component of the time series by the growth characteristics, the chart analysis and the Theil's coefficient. If the time series would include the trend component, we should be able to forecast the accidents in rail transport for the year 2016.","[Motykova, Jana; Svadlenka, Libor] Univ Pardubice, Jan Perrier Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Motykova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Jan Perrier Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,,,University of Pardubice [SGS_2016_008],University of Pardubice,The work was created in connection with the scientific research project of the University of Pardubice SGS_2016_008.

Data are obtained through structured surveys and a workshop in the Mekong River Delta. Results show that for large farms, net present value increases from an average of 589,000 USD/ha to 916,000 USD/ha after implementing RAS. Overall, the probability that RAS is a profitable investment is found to be 99% for both farm sizes. With RAS, the crucial parameters determining profitability are price, yield, costs of fingerling, feed, and initial investment. Findings on the robustness of the economic performance of RAS are useful to support public and private decision making towards increasing the sustainability of pangasius production.","[Pham Thi Anh Ngoc; Meuwissen, Miranda P.

The study explores the perspective of Slow Food members with regard to food waste, in particular members' knowledge and actions with respect to food waste and fast food. In 2014, ten in-depth interviews were conducted with active Slow Food members in Germany. Participants either held a leading role in the organization or were members of the Slow Food Youth movement. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed, using qualitative content analysis. Results show that knowledge with respect to food waste differs among the interviewees. Interviewees highlighted different causes of food waste and provided suggestions how to reduce it. Members interviewed believe that the activities within the movement contribute to the reduction of food waste and raise public awareness. The activities are often events with a social and an educational background with regard to food waste and food commensality.

It then briefly reviews and appraises the current structure and functioning of these different layers of the GFSN and discusses the need and scope for strengthening cooperation between RFAs and the IMF. It argues that the GFSN is still very patchy and there is little reason to expect significant progress in better collaboration between RFAs and the IMF as long as the latter's governance structure is not significantly revamped. Indeed, risks are that the GFSN will become even more fragmented with the further development of the European Stability Mechanism, and the emergence of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement. To prevent a further fragmentation of the GFSN, substantial governance reform of the IMF is urgently needed.","[Volz, Ulrich] Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Volz, Ulrich] German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Volz, U (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Econ, SOAS, Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",uv1@soas.ac.uk,,"Volz, Ulrich/0000-0001-9917-8068",,,,,29,6,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The most popular form of paternalism currently is libertarian paternalism (or 'nudge'), which advocates subtle changes in the presentation or framing of options to steer persons in the direction of better choices. A key issue with libertarian paternalism (as well as more coercive forms of paternalism that share similar goals) is the nature of people's interests and the state of policymakers' knowledge about them. In this chapter, I argue that this issue has been neglected in recent scholarship defending paternalism along behavioural grounds. In particular, I dispute claims that paternalism of means can be meaningfully separated from paternalism of ends, and argue that modern paternalism does not respect people's true interests but instead adopts a perfectionist or objective conception of well-being.","[White, Mark D.] CUNY Coll Staten Isl, Dept Philosophy, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY),"White, MD (通讯作者)，CUNY Coll Staten Isl, Dept Philosophy, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA.",profmdwhite@hotmail.com,,,,,,,34,10,10,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,21,38,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_3,0.0,,,18,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500004,0

Firstly, we derive the corresponding implied iVIX formula under the GARCH diffusion model. Then, using joint data on the Shanghai 50ETF and iVIX index, we develop an efficient importance sampling (EIS)-based joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method for the objective and risk-neutral parameters of the GARCH diffusion model. Furthermore, a particle filter-based estimation method is developed for extracting the latent volatility. Finally, we apply our proposed approach to the actual data on the Shanghai 50ETF and iVIX index. Empirical results show that the volatility risk is priced by the market, and the volatility risk premium is negative, implying that investors act risk averse in the Shanghai stock market.","[Wu, Xinyu; Zhou, Hailin] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu, Peoples R China",Anhui University of Finance & Economics,"Wu, XY; Zhou, HL (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Bengbu, Peoples R China.",xywu@hotmail.com; hailin_zhou@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501001]; MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [14YJC790133]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M580416]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province of China [1408085QG139]; Anhui Province College Excellent Young Talents Fund of China [2013SQRW025ZD],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Anhui Province College Excellent Young Talents Fund of China,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71501001, the MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences under Grant No. 14YJC790133, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M580416), the Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province of China under Grant No. 1408085QG139, and the Anhui Province College Excellent Young Talents Fund of China under Grant No. 2013SQRW025ZD.",,24,2,3,0,12,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Key features of the model are the inclusion of uncertainty and an optimally designed mechanism for paying penalties or buying additional quota when harvests exceed allowances. Contrary to what might be expected, we find that a risk pooling mechanism (through either collective quotas or ITQs) does not necessarily reduce the probability of quota overages. We also show that for arbitrary penalties, the incentive effects faced by harvesters differ under the various approaches. The ability of regulators to optimally adjust the enforcement mechanism (here the quota price) plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the different approaches. Finally, the optimal quota prices and the conditions that trigger them differ across the approaches; hence the impacts on expected profits differ as well.","[Zhou, Rong; Segerson, Kathleen] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 319 Oak Hall,365 Fairfield Way,U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Zhou, R; Segerson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 319 Oak Hall,365 Fairfield Way,U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",rong.2.zhou@uconn.edu; kathleen.segerson@uconn.edu,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Southwest Fisheries Science Center [AB133F-09-CQ-0039],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Southwest Fisheries Science Center(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We acknowledge very useful comments from two anonymous referees, as well as participants at the 2014 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association Annual Meeting, Minneapolis, MN and the 2013 Association of Environmental and Resource Economists Summer Conference, Banff, Canada, as well as seminar participants at Yale University, the University of Rhode Island, Auburn University, Resources for the Future, and the University of Connecticut.

Sixty-year carbon balance was calculated for two Finnish boreal case study areas, one dominated by Scots pine and the other by Norway spruce. Carbon balance included changes in the carbon pools of living forest biomass (above- and below-ground), dead organic matter and wood products, as well as carbon releases from harvesting, transporting and manufacturing. Substitution effects of using biofuel instead of fossil-fuels were also taken into account. Business-as-usual (baseline) management policy (even-aged forestry: thinning from below, harvesting timber for wood-based products from thinning and final felling) and five other management policies were applied by changing the timing and type of thinning and the utilisation of harvested trees. Net present value (NPV, 2%) and carbon balance were maximised with even-flow net income constraints. In both case study areas, postponing the thinning of young stands and using thinning from above improved carbon balance and NPV. The use of pulpwood, logging residues and stumps as biofuel also increased carbon balance. Climate warming improved carbon balance and NPV when harvests were not increased from those under the current climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines how trade reform in Peru and Argentina has gone since the reforms of the 1990s. Peru provides a valuable example of sustaining reforms. Leaders have used negotiations and other international instruments to disseminate among Peruvians a positive vision of Peru in the international economy, and to extend the application of WTO-based governance principles. Peru has introduced few new restrictions and all of them have been through WTO-sanctioned policy instruments. Argentina, on the other hand, has introduced multiple restrictions, through procedures that eschew WTO governance principles. Moreover, leaders there have returned trade politics to the dependencia philosophy that sees the international economy as an exploitive environment.The paper brings out the weakness of international obligations to limit Argentina's return to import substitution and the pains at which Peru has gone to maintain the management of its economy within the same rules that Argentina has so easily violated. To have commercial value, the GATT/WTO principle that members apply only approved methods of trade control must have operational expression in national institutions.","[Baracat, Elias A.] Comis Nacl Comercio Exterior, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Finger, J.

Earlier studies have identified care providers (madres comunitarias) as having, on average, low education levels and not being appropriately trained for the provision of childcare services. In 2007, a vocational education program was introduced which offers a degree in child development and care for childcare providers. In this paper we assess the effects of this program on the quality of care provided in the relevant nurseries and on the nutritional and health status, as well as cognitive and socio-emotional development of beneficiary children in Bogota. This evaluation takes advantage of the gradual geographic expansion of the program in order to estimate treatment effects. Results indicate that the quality of care has significantly increased in these family-based nurseries and that the program has thus had a positive and significant effect on the health, cognitive and socio-emotional development of beneficiary children, especially those younger than 3 years of age.

This article shows why this view is problematic. It argues that national incomes policies generally arose under economic circumstances that left little room for welfare state expansion and instead often forced governments to embark on austerity measures. Based on an analysis of British and Dutch efforts to set up incomes policies and expand the boundaries of the welfare state, the article further argues that post-war wage settlements under which labor unions moderated their wage demands (or better, reserved part of the margin for pay increases) to finance welfare state expansion typically had little to do with government attempts to obtain union support for incomes policies. Instead, they depended on organized labor's willingness to accept that public welfare improvements added to the social wage and were therefore at least partially to be financed by workers themselves.","[Nijhuis, Dennie Oude] Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Nijhuis, DO (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",d.m.oude-nijhuis@hum.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,91,4,4,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

It is therefore closely identified with decentralization and devolution. The practical application of community forestry principles on the ground varies, however. The powers (re-)allocated to the community vary by their extent, substance, and content. In many cases, devolution and transfer of rights and decision-making pertains solely to low value forest products and management costs, while higher value and larger benefits accrue to other actors. In this case, institutionalized extraction is formalized and the possibilities of sustainable local management constrained. Since the higher valued resources are excluded from these systems and programs, community forestry becomes in essence an exercise in the management of leftovers, which is often unsuccessful. In addition, formalization of access can add constraints over the lower valued resources that the community had previously enjoyed. The paper details some of these processes in the cases of Nepal, Kenya, and Cameroon. For community forestry to achieve its aspirations, rights over available high value resources need to be effectively transferred to local communities and formalization needs to be limited or empowering. Further research is needed on the extent to which rights have been devolved over real primary resources, and on the institutionalized constraints to full management of primary as well as secondary resources.

(Alternative estimates using CPS data on out-of-pocket spending suggest somewhat higher price increases.)

The analytic framework argues that state-level laws requiring flat tuition rates for four years contain inflationary risk, which encourages institutions to set tuition higher than they otherwise would with annual adjustments. To empirically test this idea, this study uses a national panel dataset and a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference methodological approach, with Illinois' Truth-in-Tuition law serving as the treatment condition. On average, institutions subject to this law increased annual tuition by approximately 26-30% and aggregate four-year tuition by approximately 6-7% in excess of the amount predicted by the trend for institutions not subject to the law. These findings are robust to multiple alternative specifications and support the idea that state-level guaranteed tuition programs encourage large institutional tuition increases. Implications of these findings for state policymakers, higher education institutional leaders, and college-age students and their families are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

How might its supply and demand factors self-organize? In 2012 a real-time Delphi study, entitled, The Certification of Professional Futurists 2030, was conducted among 142 experts from 29 countries to debate the forces that might diminish or enhance futures work. The study consisted of 14 projections out to the year 2030, ranging from whether the global futures field might employ a viable form of certification for professional futurists, to whether it might share a common accepted understanding of futures assumptions, theory, methods, knowledge, and ethics. Panelists identified themselves with various futures associations. This article presents the findings, including where there is dissent and consensus in the futures field over the likelihood, impact and desirability of the professionalization of its practice. Further scale development using factor analysis, ordered by the theory of competitive advantage, produced a scenario model of three market forces: assimilation, academicisation, or certification. The third force of professional certification by 2030 was deemed least likely and less desirable. This wide ranging survey therefore offers the futures field a common conversation protocol to rethink how it might redesign its value chain and differentiate itself against other professions.

The theory postulates a set of technologies and practices that are unique to each wave. Although a challenge of the Kondratieff wave theory is great variance in interpretations about the timing of the waves among scholars, based on several analyses we suggest that with the financial crisis of 2008, and resulting economic instability, we are experiencing the end of the fifth wave and the emergence of the sixth. We take as our starting point the global trends, particularly those of scarcity and the rising cost of commodities such as energy and raw materials that have led to a widely shared hypothesis that resource productivity will be the key driver of technology and economic growth in the next wave. Socially, this driver will be fortified by growing environmental concerns since climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems seem inevitably to proceed. Both these sources are boosting a generation of new companies and behaviour. In this article our focus is to evaluate weak signals that point to possible directions for the future of organisational practices in the sixth Kondratieff wave. We ask what will be the effects of the changing socio-technical landscape on the working life and organisational culture. The K-waves theory explains how certain ways of organising that have so far developed in the fringes of organisational culture may move into the mainstream, as a product of the systemic restructuring that has often accompanied the new K-wave. We present our findings from a workshop with representatives of five different resource efficiency oriented organisations in the Silicon Valley area. Based on the data we have gathered through the workshop and complementing interviews, we show how organisations base their considerations about the future to a surprisingly large extent on ethical arguments. Our material also includes a case that shows that this ethical approach is not self-evidently related to the aim for resource efficiency. We evaluate our results in the Future Sign - framework presented by Hiltunen. The signals we have gathered are combined with corporate shared value - thinking, and both are interpreted through the Kondratieff - wave theory. Based on our sample of five cases, along with a framework that supports our interpretation, we suggest the ethical motivations as backbone of organisations is a relatively strong future sign that has potential for strengthening in the sixth wave context.

An empirical analysis in 16 OECD countries,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Corporate governance; financialization; industrial relations; labor market institutions; political economy,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INEQUALITY,"This article focuses on the impact of the process of financialization on two central labor market institutions, workers' bargaining power and employment protection legislation, in 16 OECD countries from 1970 to 2009. Financialization is described as a finance-led regime of accumulation and as the emergence of a shareholder value maximization strategy. Using various mechanisms at the micro and macro levels, empirical work has investigated the relationship between the type of financial relations and the agents' capacities of maintaining strong encompassing labor market institutions. I argue that the process of financialization will exert strong pressures on labor markets toward more eroded/decentralized bargaining institutions and more flexible employment relations. This article proposes an updated indicator of workers' bargaining power and various measures of financialization. Using panel data models, our main results point out that increased financialization is clearly associated with a reduction in workers' bargaining power and in the strictness of employment protection.","[Darcillon, Thibault] Univ Paris 07, F-75013 Paris, France; [Darcillon, Thibault] Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite,"Darcillon, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 07, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",thibault.darcillon@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,48,47,49,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Drawing on original research, this article offers the first comprehensive analysis of public debt ownership within the US corporate sector. The research shows that over the past three decades, and especially in the context of the current crisis, a new aristocracy of finance has emerged, as holdings of the public debt have become rapidly concentrated in favour of large corporations classified within Finance, Insurance and Real Estate. Operationalizing Wolfgang Streeck's concept of the 'debt state', the article goes on to demonstrate how concentration in ownership of the public debt reinforces patterns of social inequality and proceeds in tandem with a shift in government policy, one that prioritizes the interests of government bondholders over the general citizenry.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Hager, SB (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hager@fas.harvard.edu,,"Hager, Sandy Brian/0000-0002-1205-3623",,,,,36,18,19,2,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The price-gap approach is applied to estimate China's natural gas subsidies, and the results indicate that China's natural gas subsidies increased from CNY 93.341 billion in 2010 to CNY 188.537 billion in 2012. We also apply the input-output model and find that a natural gas price increase of 10-15 percent has less effect on various price indexes than does complete removal of subsidies. Currently, China's natural gas accounts for a relatively small proportion of the country's primary energy consumption, and thus gas pricing reform will not have a significant negative effect on the macroeconomy. The government needs to implement fiscal policies such as direct subsidies, tiered pricing for natural gas, and city-gate price discounts to relatively underdeveloped provinces to ensure the smooth implementation of reform.","[Lin, Boqiang] Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lin, Boqiang] Minjiang Univ, Newhuadu Business Sch, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chang] Xiamen Univ, China Ctr Energy Econ Res, Sch Econ, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lei] China CITIC Bank, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Minjiang University; Xiamen University; China Citic Bank,"Lin, BQ (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, China Inst Studies Energy Policy, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Energy Econ & Energy Polic, Fujian, Peoples R China.",bqlin@xmu.edu.cn,"Lin, Boqiang/G-3960-2010","Lin, Boqiang/0000-0002-1308-400X","Newhuadu Business School Research Fund; National Social Science Foundation [12ZD059, 14JZD031]; Ministry of Education [10JBG013]",Newhuadu Business School Research Fund; National Social Science Foundation; Ministry of Education,"The article is supported by Newhuadu Business School Research Fund, National Social Science Foundation (Grant No. 12&ZD059 and 14JZD031), and Ministry of Education (Grant No. 10JBG013).",,21,18,18,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In academia, social media is a new pedagogical tool that may be used to engage students both inside and outside the economics classroom, and impact their overall success. In this study we examine the students' view of incorporating social media in the classroom. The survey was administered at three academic institutions. The results are based on a survey administered to students in Principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics courses. Students have the strongest presence, in descending order, on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. However, based on their utilization preferences, these mediums are ranked as follows: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The results indicate that students are concerned with privacy but are more willing to connect with faculty if the connection is one-way and participate if social media is a voluntary part of class. Therefore Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, or Facebook like pages or groups are potentially better mediums for faculty to use in economic classrooms. The survey indicates that students use their social media accounts more frequently than email or Learning Management Systems and, therefore, social media may also be a more effective tool for spontaneous communication for many students.

Changes in this health behavior could contribute to the documented health improvements during economic downturns. Furthermore, the reasons for changes in behavior are not well understood. We explore smoking behavior in Iceland before and after the sudden and unexpected economic crisis in 2008. Furthermore, to explore the mechanisms through which smoking could be affected we focus on the role of labor-market changes. Both real income and working hours fell significantly and economic theory suggests that such changes can affect health behaviors which in turn affect health. We use individual longitudinal data from 2007 to 2009, incidentally before and after the crisis hit. The data originates from a postal survey, collected by The Public Health Institute in Iceland. Two outcomes are explored: smoking participation and smoking intensity, using pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) and linear probability models. The detected reduction in both outcomes is not explained by the changes in labor-market variables. Other factors in the demand function for tobacco play a more important role. The most notable are real prices which increased in particular for imported goods because of the devaluation of the Icelandic currency as a result of the economic collapse.","[Olafsdottir, Thorhildur; Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey] Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Hrafnkelsson, Birgir] Univ Iceland, Fac Phys Sci, Dept Math, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Olafsdóttir, T (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",tho32@hi.is; birgirhr@hi.is; ta@hi.is,"Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023","Olafsdottir, Thorhildur/0000-0003-2003-9984",University of Iceland; Edda Center of Excellence; Icelandic Research Fund (IRS) [130611-051],University of Iceland; Edda Center of Excellence; Icelandic Research Fund (IRS),"Financial support from the University of Iceland Research Fund, Edda Center of Excellence, and the Icelandic Research Fund (IRS, grant number 130611-051) is gratefully acknowledged.

This article aims to explain these different paths of development and their political sustainability, while providing general insights on the dynamics of institutional change in advanced political economies. We demonstrate how firm size had crucial implications for skill formation policies during the phase of industrialization, while the partisan balance of power became highly influential in the post-war decades. An additional key observation is that once a critical juncture is passed, actors adopt their strategies and preferences to reflect the new institutional context. As a consequence, the skill formation regimes of both countries remained relatively stable after the 1980s.","[Dobbins, Michael] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Polit Sci, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Busemeyer, Marius R.] Univ Konstanz, D-78457 Konstaz, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Konstanz,"Dobbins, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Inst Polit Sci, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",dobbins@soz.uni-frankfurt.de,"Busemeyer, Marius R./Q-6951-2016","Busemeyer, Marius R./0000-0003-4085-1689",German Research Foundation (DFG) [BU 1852/4-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The project was partly supported by funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG), Grant No. BU 1852/4-1.",,126,27,27,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, some researchers argue that the future of cities is far from assured. Cities are not only responsible for 70% or more of the world's CO2 emissions, but because of their dense concentration of physical assets and populations, are also more vulnerable than other areas to climate change. This paper attempts to resolve this controversy by first looking at how cities would fare in a world with average global surface temperatures 4 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. It then looks at possible responses, either by mitigation or adaptation, to the threat such increases would entail. Regardless of the mix of adaptation and mitigation cities adopt in response to climate change, the paper argues that peak urbanism will occur over the next few decades. This fall in the urban share of global population will be driven by the rise in biophysical hazards in cities if the response is mainly adaptation, and by the declining attraction of cities (and possibly the rising attraction of rural areas) if serious mitigation is implemented.

We designed a Choice Experiment where landowners expressed their willingness to accept afforestation contracts with varying attributes, one of them being the likelihood of being monitored. Based on agency and social preference theory, respectively, we formulated a model allowing us to test alternative hypotheses regarding landowners' behaviour. The first hypothesis was that landowners may plan not to comply if optimal, which makes monitoring increasingly unwelcome as the contract sum increases. The second hypothesis was that landowners plan to comply and consider monitoring increasingly fair as the contract sum increases. The hypotheses were tested using a discrete mixture RPL model, where three parameters were estimated for an interaction effect between monitoring probability and contract sum (one fixed to zero and two varied freely). Both free parameters were positive and significant, indicating that landowners tend to find monitoring less of a negative feature, the higher the contract sum - suggesting that a group of landowners show social preferences. A latent class model further corroborated that conclusion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

More precisely, we analyze the power spectrum of the series, the wavelet coherency and the average dynamic correlation before and after turbulence episodes occurred after the outburst of the sovereign debt crisis. Our results show that the stock index futures are highly correlated and this correlation increases around financial distress episodes. The contagion phenomenon, associated with a high-frequency correlation, manifested especially after the additional rescue package awarded to Greece.

The support mechanism for electricity generation by Using renewable energy sources was created to achieve the common targets of Latvian State and EU. According to National Renewable Energy Action Plan the consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources will increase from 3030 GWh in 2005 to 5191 GWh in 2020, thus extending by 42%, if the targets and indicative interim targets will be attained. The share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources in the general consumption was 49,9% in 2009, then it dropped to 48,5% in 2010. The share was falling while electricity consumption was rising from 7223 GWh in 2009 to 7500 GWh in 2010.

The analysis was made on the number of nights of the residents and non-residents breakdown by type of comfort, type of the accommodation establishments, at regional level. Further, it was addressed an analyze on the type of expenditures per trip and per nights made for four European countries: Bulgaria, Greece, Spain and Romania, by length of stay. The methodology consisted in a descriptive analyze of the time series, then a seasonality analysis based on two methods, during a quarterly five years period (2000-2014). The results have been reported on the base of the averages of gross seasonal deviations, for seasonality, and growth rate for the expenditures.

The ongoing actions in the supply chain are a mix of cooperative and non-cooperative behavior of the participants. The paper proposes to use biform games for the analysis of supply chains. A biform game is a combination of non-cooperative and cooperative games, introduced by Brandenburger and Stuart (2007). It is a two-stage game: in the first stage, players choose their strategies in a non-cooperative way, thus forming the second stage of the game, in which the players cooperate. The biform game approach can be used for modeling general buyer-supplier relationships in supply chains. First, suppliers make initial proposals and take decisions. This stage is analyzed using a non-cooperative game theory approach. Then, suppliers negotiate with buyers. In this stage, a cooperative game theory is applied to characterize the outcome of negotiation among the players over how to distribute the total surplus. Each supplier's share of the total surplus is the product of its added value and its relative negotiation power. A specific model of this type for analyzing supply chains is presented.","[Fiala, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fiala, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pfiala@vse.cz,"Fiala, Petr/K-6823-2015",,,,,,16,3,3,2,8,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,177,183,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900031,0

Specifically, we use a large set of private insurance claims from the FAIR Health database to show that an increasing spatial concentration of hospital services results in a decreased cost of obtaining intermediate medical services. We explicitly test whether the reduced cost at concentrated locations arises from the ability to share intermediate service providers. The identification relies on state variation in medical lab technician licensure requirements, which influence the cost of intermediate services only through the cost of running a lab. Our findings suggest that agglomeration of the hospital service industry attracts specialized medical labs, which in turn help to reduce the cost of producing laboratory tests.","[Friedson, Andrew I.] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 1380 Lawrence St,Suite 460F, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Li, Jing] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Singapore Management University,"Friedson, AI (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 1380 Lawrence St,Suite 460F, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",andrew.friedson@ucdenver.edu,"Li, Jing/H-6822-2013","Li, Jing/0000-0001-5269-134X",Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 1 grant,"Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 1 grant(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","We would like to thank Stuart Rosenthal, Tomoki Fuji, Wen-Tai Hsu, Jeffrey Kubik, Hani Mansour, and seminar participants at the American Society of Health Economists Conference, and Singapore Management University for their helpful comments and suggestions on previous versions.

This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines, their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing opportunities.

Unfortunately they occur frequently in economic and financial practice. A typical example of a non-stationary process is a random walk. It can be defined as the solution to the stochastic difference equation of the first order. Lool at this equation as an operator equation allows us to employ the access of the functional analysis. It turns out that the equation describing the random walk is an ill-posed problem. The term of ill-posedness was introduced first by J. Hadamard (1902). It means that the solution to the given operator equation either does not exist at all or it is not unique or it is unstable. The ill-posed problem has to be regularized if we wish to obtain a reasonable result. There exist a lot of methods of regularization. One of them is the well-known Tikhonov regularization method named by the outstanding Russian mathematician A. N.

Organizations recognized the potential for generating additional value and competitive advantage by moving their orientation from products and services towards customers. Directions for improvement derived from the environment became as significant as those designed internally, by organization itself. Public companies also became aware of the influence of customer satisfaction on business performance and financial results. CRM idea was adopted worldwide by government representatives, who realized that the best value in public service delivery can be achieved by focusing on the needs of customers, or in this case residents. However, although the benefits which this concept can provide in public enterprises were emphasized by many researchers, its implication on public service is still far from reaching its full potential, particularly in developing and underdeveloped countries. Nevertheless, the use of customer orientation idea in public companies remains to be widely spread and it should represent the guideline for local authorities in such countries. It is not necessary for public companies to buy expensive CRM applications in order to improve customer satisfaction and customer knowledge. In the beginning they can use the data stored in their current information system database for establishing CRM principles in their business, with only minor adoptions. In this way certain benefits can be achieved without implementing radical organizational change. This paper aims to propose a possible solution for adopting CRM concept and improving customer satisfaction in public company which is providing parking service in capital of one developing country from Europe.","[Komazec, Stefan; Todorovic, Ivan; Kostic-Stankovic, Milica; Jasko, Ondrej] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Komazec, S (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia.",komazec.stefan@fon.bg.ac.rs; todorovic.ivan@fon.bg.ac.rs; kostic.milica@fon.bg.ac.rs; jasko.ondrej@fon.bg.ac.rs,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,469,478,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000044,0

In general, the purpose of the article is present the interpretation of European Union (EU) legislation in respect of merger control transactions and merger regulations and its implementation into the Slovak legislation. The standards methodology methods, such as selection, analysis and comparison methods are used in order to meet the above mentioned, specifically, these are used for selection of literature sources, presentation current legal acts and EU legislation. The results and conclusions of the article are presented by deduction method. The article deals with the issue of merger control transactions of selected types of commercial companies. It analyzes the concept of merger transactions under the Competition law of EU and deals with its implementation into the Slovak legislation. The legal basis for EU merger control is Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation or regulation). The regulation prohibits mergers and acquisitions which would significantly reduce competition in the single market. Merger control, as well as other areas of competition law, is in the Slovak Republic, substantially governed by the Act on Protection of Economic Competition. The relevant authority for merger control is the Antimonopoly Office of the Slovak Republic. Having compares the EC Merger Regulation and the Slovak law we came into conclusion that the Slovak legislation is to a great extent in line with the European law. Further, from the tax point of view the article deals with the merger transactions within the EU legislation. The article presents the main rule of EU Merger Directive in the EU legislation and presents implementation of EU Merger Directive into the Slovak tax law. The merger transactions are regulated by The Council Directive 2009/133/EC of 19 October 2009 on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, partial divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member State and to the transfer of the registered office of an SE or SCE between Member States (EU Merger Directive). The main rule of the EU Merger Directive is that a merger, division, or partial division shall not give rise to any taxation of capital gains. The EU Merger Directive is transposed into the Slovak Income Tax Act (Slovak ITA). Following the Slovak implementation of EU Merger Directive, merger transactions are generally treated as not giving rise to a capital gain calculated by reference to the difference between the real values of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes. As a result, it can be summarized that the income received by the shareholders from acquiring new shares and income from exchange of the shares on merger transactions is not subject to income tax. The Slovak ITA essentially deals with mergers transactions. The Slovak ITA presents that the merger transactions are to be made (i) in original (historic), or (ii) in the real value. Thus, in addition, the article formulates the main tax implications of the merger transactions depending on the chosen alternatives, i.e. whether the fair value of the assets and liabilities or their original values are taken over by new successors upon the merger transaction.","[Krajcirova, Renata; Vanova, Alexandra Ferenczi] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Krajcírová, R (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",renata.krajcirova@uniag.sk; alexandra.ferenczi@uniag.sk,"Krajcirova, Renata/T-2768-2019; Ferenczi Vanova, Alexandra/P-4099-2018","Krajcirova, Renata/0000-0001-8581-5994; Ferenczi Vanova, Alexandra/0000-0003-1598-5271",,,,,3,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,509,514,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800050,0

The association between physician density and healthcare is not yet clear. Most studies did not consider district type, which reflects population density. Our research question was, Do specialist density and district type influence the healthcare of IBD patients in Germany? Methods: We combined a claims dataset from a German health insurance fund with population and physician data. Four main aspects were investigated: regular specialist visits, drug therapies, surveillance colonoscopy, and IBD-related hospitalizations. Various regression analyses were performed. Results: The study cohort was comprised of 21,771 individuals, including 9282 patients with Crohn disease and 12,489 patients with ulcerative colitis. Patients who were living in districts with higher specialist densities were more likely to attend specialist visits on a regular basis. No difference in the frequencies of TNF-alpha inhibitor therapies was found. However, individuals from urban areas were more likely to receive a permanent immunosuppressive therapy with continuous specialist support. Conclusions: The results revealed that some aspects had positive effects on the probability of implementing healthcare in accordance with pathways and guidelines. No clear evidence of a general healthcare undersupply in rural areas was found.","[Lange, Ansgar; Prenzler, Anne; Neubauer, Sarah; Zeidler, Jan; von der Schulenburg, J. -Matthias] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Bachmann, Oliver; Manns, Michael P.] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Gastroenterol Hepatol & Endocrinol, Hannover, Germany; [Linder, Roland] Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care WINEG, Hamburg, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Hannover Medical School,"Lange, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Koenigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",al@ivbl.uni-hannover.de,"Bachmann, Oliver/AAV-4258-2021","Bachmann, Oliver/0000-0002-6830-2975",German Research Foundation ( DFG),German Research Foundation ( DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This study was funded by the German Research Foundation ( DFG).,,32,7,7,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

In 2014, Regional Innovation Scoreboard that comparatively assessed innovation performance of 190 regions within the European Union, Switzerland and Norway was published. By evaluating the Summary Innovation Index, which is composed of 25 indicators, Slovakia turns out to be categorized as the Moderate Innovator with positive regional innovation performance growth. Despite awareness of the importance of supporting research and scientific areas, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic in the last annual report on the state of research and development in Slovakia in 2012 concluded, that Slovakia utilizes its research and development potential insufficiently and in comparison with other EU countries, spending on research and development (R&D), with the value 0.68 percent of GDP, belongs to the lowest ones. Worldwide growth in demand for food and feed is one of the most important reasons why it is necessary to focus on innovation and thus spending on the R&D in agriculture. Investments in agricultural R&D will lead to productivity growth of agriculture in different regions of Slovakia, ensuring an increasing level of regional development of Slovak regions. Growth in agricultural productivity will also cause the reduction of pressure on natural resources and the environment. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate and assess the level of regional disparities while taking into consideration innovation performance, agricultural productivity and chosen socioeconomic indicators of regional development and to demonstrate, whether there exists some correlation between the trend of these regional disparities within the Slovak regions. The research of the paper begins with the collection of relevant data, mainly from regional statistical database RegDat and the official Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and its archived agricultural and food publications, publications on the state of R&D. The data availability caused that the article summarizes and evaluates 5 year period-from 2008 to 2012. All of the analyses are focused on NUTS III classification of the Slovak Republic, namely on Bratislava Region, Trnava Region, Trencin Region, Nitra Region, Zilina Region, Banska Bystrica Region, Presov Region and Kosice Region. The first part of the paper focuses on the time-spatial analysis of selected indicators of innovation performance of agriculture, particularly spending on R&D, and socio-economic indicators of the level of regional development, namely Total Gross Agricultural Production per 1 ha(-1), Taxes and Fees per 1 ha-1, Number of Employees per 100 ha-1, in all regions of Slovakia. Secondly, the Coefficient of Variation and Gini Index are applied to evaluate the level of regional disparities within the selected indicators. Subsequently, the method of chain indices reflecting the trend in examined regional disparities is used. In the third part of the paper, we want to demonstrate existence of correlation between the trend of regional disparities of selected indicators of innovation performance, particularly spending on R&D, and the development trend of regional disparities of mentioned socioeconomic indicators of regional development and productivity within the Slovak regions in the agricultural sector. Conclusion of the paper summarizes the results obtained in this research with the accentuation of the importance of reducing regional disparities, the use of innovation and new scientific techniques and methods funding, applied in the agricultural sector, resulting into an increased productivity and the entire socio-economic level of regional development.","[Melo, Daniel] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Moravcikova, Kamila] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Melo, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",daniel.melo44@gmail.com; kami.moravcikova@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,674,683,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800065,0

It seeks to strike a balance between two important goals: preserving the freedom of WTO Members to set and meet their regulatory objectives through measures of their own choosing, while discouraging them from adopting or maintaining measures that unduly restrict trade. This paper analyses the necessity test in relation to trade in services. Under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), the test is used as both an exception and an obligation. The test in the form of an exception draws heavily on Article XX General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) jurisprudence and its content is well established. In contrast, its structure as an obligation is still under negotiation. While the elements for the adoption and interpretation of the test in the form of an obligation appear to be on the table, a lack of political momentum makes progress extremely unlikely. At the same time, discussions in other fora, notably the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), may change the situation. However, these negotiations are still ongoing, which begs the question of whether the necessity test will remain unfinished business.","[Muller, Gilles] Univ Neuchatel, Fac Law, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel,"Muller, G (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Fac Law, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",gilles.muller@unine.ch,,,,,,,22,7,8,0,6,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We use three recent and appropriate methodologies: M-GARCH-DCC, Continuous Wavelet Transforms (CWT), and Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT). The results significantly tend to indicate that effective portfolio diversification opportunities between our sample markets exist mainly for short holding periods while for longer investment horizons, where investor stockholding periods exceed one year, the markets appear to be mostly highly correlated yielding minimal portfolio diversification benefits.

Certain attributes of the Korean economy such as heavy reliance on exports and compressed growth seem to be responsible. Weak cost disease leads to a weak growth disease: the aggregate productivity growth does not monotonically decline over time. Productivity growth has led to the deindustrialization of employment.

The focus lies mainly on the examination of the development of key labor market variables. We also want to capture the changes that occurred due to the Great Recession in 2008. We estimate a DSGE model with search and matching frictions, price and wage rigidities and hiring costs. The monetary authority sets the nominal interest rates according to a Taylor-type rule. The wages setting mechanism and hours worked are the result of the Nash bargaining process. This model is estimated for the quarterly data of the Czech Republic and Hungary for the period 2001Q2 - 2014Q4. The results show that the reactions of variables to monetary shock are larger in the Czech Republic. This suggests that the monetary policy is less efficient in Hungary during the examined period. The bargaining power of workers is stronger in the Czech economy. This coefficient is smaller in Hungary, which is in line with the low trade union participation of workers. The model shows the preference, foreign and disutility from work shocks to be the main cause of the Great Recession in both countries.","[Papai, Adam; Nemec, Daniel] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Pápai, A (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",papai@mail.muni.cz; nemecd@econ.muni.cz,"Němec, Daniel/H-2909-2013","Němec, Daniel/0000-0003-3065-8287",,,,,7,3,3,0,2,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,606,611,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900104,0

Our main findings indicate that the experience of Estonian financial professionals in the field of valuation of intangibles is rather modest. Still, large auditory and consultation firms have developed their own evaluation methodology for the valuation of intangible assets, while the methodological aspects are not that clearly distinguishable in smaller companies. According to the experts, three classical methods are predominantly used for the valuation of intangible properties: cost-based, market-based and income-based method. Option-based approach has been adopted in just a few cases. Income-based approach is the preferred one, although cost-based method has been utilized, too. Market-based approach has oftentimes been not applicable because of the lack of comparable market transactions in Estonia.","[Pars, Maarja] AS LHV Pank, Tallinn, Estonia; [Sander, Priit] Univ Tartu, Tartu, Estonia",University of Tartu,"Pärs, M (通讯作者)，AS LHV Pank, Tallinn, Estonia.",,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,549,556,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200071,0

Findings of this article are based on the questionnaire survey and subsequent data analysis. The statistical methods and procedures were used for the research evaluation. Results of the empirical questioning show that majority of respondents use any form of debt financing (to a various extent). The prevailing debt sources of financing are bank loans, leasing, trade credit, and down payments of customers. Only a small percentage of respondents indicate that they use bonds as a source of corporate financing. To the most frequent reasons for the use of debt resources in companies belong the lack equity sources, tax deductibility of interest cost, or the lower cost of debt. All respondents confirmed the use of equity (to a various extent) in business financing. The primary equity sources of financing are retained earnings, accumulated depreciation, subsidies, reserve funds, and common stock. Furthermore, the findings indicate that to the main reasons for the use of equity sources belong efforts to the reduction of indebtedness, availability of sufficient equity sources, and a lower risk. Even though most companies confirm the use of debt to some extent, it can be stated, that their decisions are in accordance with the pecking-order theory, in which firms consider their own resources (equity and profit) as primary source of financing, and they start considering the debt financing only in case of their shortage.","[Stryckova, Lenka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Stryckova, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic.",,"Stryckova, Lenka/L-2467-2015","Stryckova, Lenka/0000-0003-1108-4193",,,,,13,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,253,260,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200033,0

Co-owned forest managing models, where different owners collaborate and forest users participate however, are still rather an exception of a rule. Bosland (literally forest-land) in Flanders (Belgium) is a statutory partnership of several public forest owners and stakeholders, managing an area of about 22,000 ha of previously fragmented forest relicts. By looking at this case through transition lenses we describe a pioneering case in forest management where a new way of management is adopted more geared towards management for coherence across multiple ecosystem services and across a multitude of stakeholders. By use of a learning history we were able to reconstruct the change trajectory of Bosland. Analysis of this change trajectory through transition lenses aided to identify essential key features in which Bosland differs from 'management as usual' approaches: (i) a distinctive paradigm shift towards management for coherence; (ii) a long term vision that informs and guides the short-term action agenda; (iii) a bottom up approach focusing on participation and co-creation. The methods used and lessons learnt in Bosland can thus be highly interesting for the wider community involved in forest and nature management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have revealed that specialist care for patients with diabetes leads to more positive outcomes than care by general practitioners (GPs) alone. The aim of this study was to estimate the determinants of endocrinologist consultation by patients with diabetes. Methods We used a two-part model to explore both the decision to consult and the frequency of consultations. We used claim data collected for 65,633 affiliates of a French social security provider. Patients were aged over 18 and treated for diabetes (types I and II). We controlled for patients' socioeconomic characteristics, type of diabetes treatment, medical care, and health status. We also controlled for variables, such as the cost of a visit, the distance to the nearest endocrinologist's office, the density of medical practitioners and the prevalence of diabetes in the area. Results The results show that the parameters associated with the decision to consult an endocrinologist were considerably different from factors associated with the frequency of consultations. A marked positive effect of income on the decision to consult was found, whereas travel time to the office had a negative impact on both the decision to consult and the frequency of consultations. Increasing treatment complexity is associated with a higher probability of consulting an endocrinologist. We found evidence of a significant substitution effect between GPs and endocrinologists. Finally, consultation price is a barrier to seeing an endocrinologist. Conclusion Given that financial barriers were identified in the relatively wealthy population analysed here, it is likely that this may be even more of an obstacle in the general population.","[Andrade, Luiz Flavio; Sevilla-Dedieu, Christine] MGEN Fdn Publ Hlth, 3 Sq Max Hymans, F-75748 Paris 15, France; [Andrade, Luiz Flavio; Rapp, Thomas] Univ Paris 05, LIRAES, EA 4470, 12 Rue Ecole Med, F-75270 Paris 06, France",Universite Paris Cite,"Sevilla-Dedieu, C (通讯作者)，MGEN Fdn Publ Hlth, 3 Sq Max Hymans, F-75748 Paris 15, France.",csevilla@mgen.fr,"Rapp, Thomas/ABF-1576-2020; Andrade, Luiz Felipe/N-1506-2018","Rapp, Thomas/0000-0003-0837-9302; Andrade, Luiz Felipe/0000-0002-4868-737X",MGEN Foundation for Public Health,MGEN Foundation for Public Health,"This project was financed by the MGEN Foundation for Public Health.

Using administrative data from North Carolina public schools, this paper jointly estimates the effect of absences and length of the school calendar on test score performance. We exploit a state policy that provides variation in the number of school days prior to standardized testing and find substantial differences between these two effects. Extending the school calendar by ten days increases math and reading test scores by only 1.7% and 0.8% of a standard deviation, respectively. A similar reduction in absences would lead to gains of 5.5% in math and 2.9% in reading. We perform a number of robustness checks including utilizing flu data to instrument for absences, family-year fixed effects, distinguishing between excused and unexcused absences, and controlling for a contemporaneous measure of student disengagement. Our results are robust to these alternative specifications. In addition, our findings indicate considerable heterogeneity across student ability, suggesting that targeting absenteeism among low performing students could aid in narrowing current gaps in performance.

In this paper, rather than asking whether incentives work, we focus on a different question: For whom and under what conditions do incentives work? This question is particularly important because incentives' promise relies on the idea that they might take the place of some cognitive failing or set of preferences that otherwise would have led students to make choices with large long-term benefits. In this paper, we explore whether that is the case. In the context of a summer reading program called Project READS, we test whether responsiveness to incentives is positively or negatively related to the student's baseline level of motivation to read. As a part of the program, elementary school students are mailed books weekly during the summer. We implemented this book-mailing program as a randomized experiment with three treatment arms. Students in the first treatment arm were mailed books as a part of the standard Project READS program. Students in the second treatment arm were mailed books as a part of Project READS, and were also offered an incentive to read the books they were mailed. Students in the third experimental group served as a control and were given books after posttesting occurred in the fall. We find that, if anything, more motivated readers are more responsive to incentives to read, suggesting that to the extent that incentives are effective, they may not effectively target the students whose behavior they are intended to change.

Findings show that the pay structure varies across employment sectors - waged and self-employed - and that the determinants of employment sector vary by gender and family roles. Differences in human capital investment and geopolitical zones also need to be considered. The estimates in the study reveal that there is a marriage premium for both males and females in the waged labour market, but partially support Becker's (1991) gender-based household specialisation model in terms of the relative incidence of self-employment. There is a wage penalty for married women with children in the paid-employment labour market, but motherhood is also negatively associated with income levels for self-employed women. We also find a fatherhood penalty for paid-employed men. Nevertheless, overall, the gender difference is higher in relatively less regulated self-employment compared to the more regulated paid employment labour market. Findings therefore offer some policy inputs but also suggest the need for further research into the causes of the gender pay gap in self- and paid employment, and thus into the overall wage gap in Nigeria that inhibits women's labour market participation and welfare.","[Nwaka, Ikechukwu Darlington; Guven-Lisaniler, Fatma; Tuna, Gulcay] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Nwaka, ID (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Salamis Rd,Via Mersin 10, TR-99628 North Cyprus, Turkey.",ikechukwu.nwaka@emu.edu.tr,"Nwaka, Ikechukwu D./AAE-6228-2020; Lisaniler, Fatma Guven/F-6482-2014","Nwaka, Ikechukwu D./0000-0002-4903-3976; Guven Lisaniler, Fatma/0000-0002-3217-1053",,,,,43,11,11,5,41,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The results show that economic development is capable of attracting more non-Hukou populations. Population growth fosters service development and exerts little influence on manufacturing sectors, where non-Hukou populations accounts for a larger portion than its counterpart.

It commonly takes the form of recommendations by external advisors in developing country situations who encourage formally organized decision making by a local political community. This paper reviews the literature on local tenure, the summaries of case studies in forestry, and the broader history of experience with collectives and cooperatives with the objective of identifying the characteristic cases where some form of collective or community forest management might be successful. The paper identifies four cases. It concludes that, at some level, smaller groups of managers may cooperate in labor and capital intensive activities like fire control or harvesting, or in specialized activities beyond their personal expertise, activities like processing and marketing their products. Successful and sustainable community-wide collective enterprises seldom include agricultural or forest land with the possible, and likely impermanent, exception of low-valued open access land beyond the perimeter of agricultural crops and managed forests.

Using household (n = 427 in 2006, 2009 and 2012) total income panel data sets, with and without environmental income, from Nepal, we analysed the importance of environmental income in household-level poverty assessments (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke indices) and dynamics (movements in the Poverty Transition Matrix). Random effects logit and ordered logit models were applied to estimate variables covarying with poverty categories and compared for annual household incomes with and without environmental income. Using the without environmental income data set significantly changed the number of households classified as poor, as well as rates of movements in and out of poverty. Excluding household-level environmental income also distorted estimation of covariates of poverty incidence and poverty dynamics. Poverty incidence and dynamics models including environmental income perform better than those without. Rural poverty studies based on welfare measures excluding environmental income may thus be inaccurate for environmental reliant communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

BSC included incontinence pads and, for a proportion of patients, anticholinergics and/or occasional clean intermittent catheterisation. A five-state Markov model was used to estimate total costs and outcomes over a 10-year period. The cohort was based on data from two placebo-controlled trials and a long-term extension study of onabotulinumtoxinA. After discontinuation of initial treatment, a proportion of patients progressed to downstream sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). Cost and resource use was estimated from a National Health Service perspective in England and Wales using relevant reference sources for 2012 or 2013. Results showed that onabotulinumtoxinA was associated with lower costs and greater health benefits than BSC in the base case, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicating an 89 % probability that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would fall below A 20,000 pound. OnabotulinumtoxinA remained dominant over BSC in all but two scenarios tested; it was also economically dominant when compared directly with SNS therapy. In conclusion, onabotulinumtoxinA appears to be a cost-effective treatment for overactive bladder compared with BSC alone.","[Freemantle, Nick] UCL Med Sch, Dept Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Rowland Hill St, London NW3 2PF, England; [Khalaf, Kristin] Allergan Pharmaceut Inc, 2525 Dupont Dr, Irvine, CA 92612 USA; [Loveman, Clara] Marlow Int, Allergan Holdings Ltd, Marlow SL7 1YL, Bucks, England; [Stanisic, Sanja] LA SER ANALYT, Corso Porta Nuova 34, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Gultyaev, Dmitry; Lister, Johanna] LA SER ANALYT, Meeraner Pl 1, D-79539 Lorrach, Germany; [Drake, Marcus] Univ Bristol, Sch Clin Sci, Southmead Rd, Bristol BS10 5NB, Avon, England; [Drake, Marcus] Univ Bristol, Bristol Urol Inst, Southmead Rd, Bristol BS10 5NB, Avon, England",University of London; University College London; AbbVie; Allergan; AbbVie; Allergan; University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Freemantle, N (通讯作者)，UCL Med Sch, Dept Primary Care & Populat Hlth, Rowland Hill St, London NW3 2PF, England.",nicholas.freemantle@ucl.ac.uk,"Drake, Marcus/C-4542-2014","Drake, Marcus/0000-0002-6230-2552",Ferring; Allergan; Ipsen; Apogepha; Astellas; Pfizer,Ferring(Ferring Pharmaceuticals); Allergan(AbbVieAllergan); Ipsen(Ipsen); Apogepha; Astellas(Astellas Pharmaceuticals); Pfizer(Pfizer),"The authors take full responsibility for the content of the manuscript but would like to thank Dr. Polly Field and Sophie Shina from Oxford PharmaGenesis for editorial support in developing the manuscript.

In this framework, the smart city is actually a popular vision in discourses on urban development. This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen's voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom. This paper analyses the role of citizens in four alternative smart city imaginaries. The thesis proposed is that all four imaginaries are characterised by citizens playing a subaltern role, and hence the smart city is a relatively poor concept if intended as a model of the urban life of the future.

Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is the only causal therapy of AR and AA, and can be administered as subcutaneous injections at the physician or as sublingual drops or tablets at home. The usual treatment duration is 3 years. Objective: This study aimed to elicit patient preferences to identify the AIT administration mode preferred by patients. Methods: A discrete-choice-experiment (DCE) was developed to determine how people weight different treatment options using a paper-based questionnaire from June to September 2014, including 16 study centres. Main inclusion criteria: >18 years, grass, birch and/or house dust mite AR with moderate to severe symptoms, AIT-naive and AIT-indicated. DCE-attributes were: Administration form, number and duration of physician visits, frequency of life-threatening anaphylactic shocks, local side-effects and co-payments. Results: Two-hundred thirty-nine subjects participated, resulting in analysable 1842 choices. All attributes were significant predictors for the treatment-choice. Ranked by importance, the following first three attributes are most preferred by patients: 1st Number and duration of physician visits: Fewer visits with shorter duration preferred (0.658*) 2nd Frequency of life-threatening anaphylactic shocks: Lower risk of shocks preferred (0.285*) 3rd Local side-effects: Preference for rash/swelling on upper arm over itching/swelling under the tongue (0.210*) (*coefficient-size represents relative importance of the attributes) Conclusion: The most important attribute is the number and duration of visits to a physician. A lower risk of life-threatening anaphylactic shocks was ranked as the second whereas co-payments and administration form play a limited role.","[Damm, Kathrin] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Hannover, Germany; [Volk, Janina; Winkler, Thomas; Thiessen, Ivonne; Wuestenberg, Eike G.] ALK Abello Arzneimittel GmbH, Griegstr 75,Haus 25, D-22763 Hamburg, Germany; [Horn, Andreas] ENT Practice Neckar Dres Zeuner Horn & Vasvari, Heidelberg, Germany; [Allam, Jean-Pierre] Univ Bonn, Dept Dermatol & Allergy, Bonn, Germany; [Troensegaard-Petersen, Ninette; Serup-Hansen, Niels] ALK Abello, Horsholm, Denmark; [Borchert, Kathrin; Mittendorf, Thomas] Xcenda GmbH, Hannover, Germany; [Wuestenberg, Eike G.] Dresden Univ, Med Fac, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Dresden, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; ALK-Abello AS; University of Bonn; ALK-Abello AS; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Volk, J (通讯作者)，ALK Abello Arzneimittel GmbH, Griegstr 75,Haus 25, D-22763 Hamburg, Germany.",janina.volk@alk.net,,,"ALK-Abello, Horsholm, Denmark","ALK-Abello, Horsholm, Denmark","The study was funded by ALK-Abello, Horsholm, Denmark.",,24,14,14,0,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Various jurisdictions worldwide have implemented forest carbon mitigation strategies and policies to reduce their GHG emissions or increase carbon sequestration. Yet the policy literature on forest carbon mitigation is limited, and no attempt has been made so far to systematically document a jurisdiction's existing forest carbon mitigation policies and policy gaps. This paper applies policy gap analysis to policies for GHG and forest management in the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, as a case study focusing on the challenges posed by existing policies and the opportunities for policy innovation to more effectively promote forest carbon mitigation. This policy gap analysis shows that while BC has an ambitious climate action regime for fossil fuel-based emissions, it has few policies explicitly targeting forests or the use of harvested wood products for carbon mitigation. As a result, forest carbon mitigation is an under-exploited opportunity for the province. Throughout history, forest management policies have evolved in response to changing social values, such as protection of fresh water, fish and wildlife, and biodiversity. As this case study of BC illustrates, it is time for jurisdictions to renew their forest policies to more effectively incorporate opportunities for carbon mitigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results can be used to predict changes in informal care associated with changes in the health of the patient measured using EQ-5D. Methods Data was used from a prospective survey of inpatients containing 59,512 complete responses across 44,494 individuals. The number of days a friend or relative has needed to provide care or help with normal activities in the last 6 weeks was estimated using the health of the patient measured by EQ-5D, ICD chapter and other health and sociodemographic data. A variety of different regression models were estimated that are appropriate for the distribution of the informal care dependent variable, which has large spikes at 0 (zero informal care) and 42 days (informal care every day). Results The preferred model that most accurately predicts the distribution of the data is the zero-inflated negative binomial with variable inflation. The results indicate that improving the health of the patient reduces informal care need. The relationship between ICD chapter and informal care need is not as clear. Conclusions The preferred zero-inflated negative binomial with variable inflation model can be used to predict changes in informal care associated with changes in the health of the patient measured using EQ-5D and these results can be applied to existing datasets to inform economic evaluation. Limitations include recall bias and response bias of the informal care data, and restrictions of the dataset to exclude some patient groups.","[Rowen, Donna; Dixon, Simon; Hernandez-Alava, Monica; Mukuria, Clara] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Dixon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",s.dixon@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009; Hernandez, Monica/0000-0003-4474-5883; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109",Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,Policy Research Programme in the Department of Health; Department of Health Policy Research Programme,We are grateful to Gavin Roberts and Danny Palnoch from the Department of Health for their comments throughout this project.

We explain how this vertical fiscal externality can lead unilateral state-level environmental policy to generate a welfare gain in the implementing state, at the expense of other states, even absent any environmental benefits. Using a computable general equilibrium model of the Canadian federation, we show that vertical fiscal externalities can be the major determinant of the welfare change following environmental policy implementation by a state government. Our numerical simulations indicate that- as a consequence of vertical fiscal externalities- state governments can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 20 percent without any net cost to themselves.

Yet cooperation is often absent in real world social dilemmas, including many environmental problems. We propose that this discrepancy arises because in the Public Good game, the worst freeriders can do is to not contribute to the public account, while in many real world environmental situations freeriders can even appropriate contributions made by others before the public good is produced. We introduce the Claim Game that modifies the Public Good game by allowing for appropriating the contributions of others before the public good is produced. The impact of such possible takings on public good production is dramatic. No public good is produced, not even in the initial stages of interaction, We link our findings to the relevance of common pool games for modeling environmental problems, and stress the need to experimentally test environmental institutions within harsher social dilemmas than the standard Public Good game.

This article argues that the limited regulatory changes of German and British financial markets can be explained by the influence moral boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate financial practices had on policymakers' crisis perception. In German public debate of 2008, speculation as opposed to firm investment was seen as cause of the crisis. The British crisis narrative held illegitimate profits responsible that were gained from excessive risk-taking as opposed to risk management. These distinct legitimizing patterns (a) fostered a selective perception of the crisis that downplayed domestic structural causes of the crisis, and (b) directed regulatory efforts away from fundamental reforms. In fact, both national debates saw the institutional regime of their financial markets re-affirmed by the crisis and in need of readjustment. Conceptually, the article shows the affinity between public moral boundaries of legitimate economic practices and the core institutional principles of market regimes.","[Muennich, Sascha] Univ Gottingen, Inst Sociol, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Münnich, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Inst Sociol, Gottingen, Germany.",sascha.muennich@sowi.uni-goettingen.de,"Muennich, Sascha/ABC-4193-2021",,"Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne, Germany; Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne, Germany; Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA","The research for this article was generously supported by the Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Societies, Cologne, Germany, as well as by the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA.

To study the severity of this problem, induced by the mismatch of local and national incentives, I look at the enforcement of the Swedish Environmental Code which is enforced at the local level. I measure enforcement in terms of environmental fines issued in each of Sweden's 290 municipalities. I argue that the Green Party values the tradeoff between business friendliness and environmental concerns differently from other parties. Using both a difference-in-differences approach and IV, I find that municipalities with the Green Party in the ruling coalition issue more fines than other municipalities. This is problematic from an efficiency and equality perspective. The result suggests that politicians do not only affect environmental policy, but also that for a given policy, they can affect the outcome through implementation and enforcement.

A Two-Stage Least Square instrumental variable and a logit model with difference-in-differences are employed. We find that the cultural hysteresis is less prominent among Mediterranean countries.

J,"Peng, SY",,,,"Peng, Shin-yi",,,GATS and the Over-the-Top Services: A Legal Outlook,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE,"Over-the-Top (OTT) services refers to content delivery through an Internet platform; hence, an OTT application is any service that provides a product over the Internet and bypasses traditional distribution. Examples of OTT services may include chat applications (e.g., WhatsApp, Line, WeChat) and streaming video services (e.g., Netflix, Apple TV). This article is of the view that, based on the CATS jurisprudence, it is at least arguable whether OTT voice and messaging services fall under the CATS definition of Computer and Related Services. This article also suggests that the OTT TV, in the case that a Member did not base its audiovisual services schedules on the CPC and makes no reference to CPC codes, should fall under section 2. D. of W/120 as the use of a different medium to provide a service did not create a new service. In addition, with respect to the vertical competition between infrastructure and content, there is a disconnection between traffic and revenue, leading many operators to block or degrade OTT traffic. This article stresses the position that any further action to introduce the concept of network neutrality into TiSA should bear in mind that a proper balance should be struck between developed countries' trade interests and developing countries' development needs. Moreover, with respect to the horizontal competition between foreign content and domestic content, local broadcasters who supplied services within a Member's jurisdiction are at a significant disadvantage compared to OTT service suppliers who housed their servers outside the member's territory. The recent leak of TiSA negotiating texts on e-commerce, in which the U.S. advocates the need to ensure that governments do not require ICT service suppliers to use local infrastructure or establish a local presence as a condition of supplying services, have also caused some concern.","[Peng, Shin-yi] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Peng, Shin-yi] Natl Commun Commiss, Taipei, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Peng, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.;Peng, SY (通讯作者)，Natl Commun Commiss, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,49,8,8,0,21,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Although the results are obtained from a small convenience sample, and hence cannot be generalized, we find that participants are willing to pay premiums of $0.90-$1.23 per half-pound for domestic shrimp (regardless of production method) and $0.60-$1.03 per half-pound for wild-caught shrimp. We also find evidence that Gulf Coast shrimp are stigmatized; controlling for other characteristics, participants are willing to pay $1.03-$1.34 less per half-pound for Gulf Coast shrimp.

The fact that the privileged category for post-conflict decisions are those groups capable of acting as spoilers has tended to exclude women's groups from the categories considered most important to involve in decision making. Exacerbating this exclusion is the reluctance of international decision makers to encourage affirmative action measures in these contexts. This carries through to the minimal-state approach to economic recovery efforts. Provisions are needed to foster and invite women's voice in decision making, and build more active-state approaches to women's livelihood recovery.","[Goetz, Anne Marie] NYU, Ctr Global Affairs, Sch Profess Studies, New York, NY 10007 USA; [Jenkins, Rob] CUNY Hunter Coll, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10065 USA",New York University; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY),"Goetz, AM (通讯作者)，NYU, Ctr Global Affairs, Sch Profess Studies, 15 Barclay St,Room 442, New York, NY 10007 USA.",amg22@nyu.edu; prof.jenkins@btopenworld.com,,,,,,,40,18,20,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Although recent studies have found associations between women's autonomy and a number of health outcomes, fundamental issues regarding adequate measurement of women's autonomy remain. The Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) provides a direct measure of motivational autonomy. It expresses the extent to which a woman faces coercive or internalized social pressure to undertake domain-specific actions. This contribution addresses a key critique of current measures of autonomy, which focus on decision making or ignore women's values. This study examines the measurement properties and added value of a number of domain-specific RAIs using new nationally representative data from the Republic of Chad. A striking finding is that women on average have less autonomous motivation in all eight domains compared to their male counterparts.","[Vaz, Ana; Alkire, Sabina] Univ Oxford, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Oxford, England; [Pratley, Pierre] George Washington Univ, Global Hlth, Washington, DC 20052 USA",University of Oxford; George Washington University,"Vaz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Dept Int Dev, Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, England.",ana.vaz@qeh.ox.ac.uk; pierrepratley@gmail.com; sabina.alkire@qeh.ox.ac.uk,,"Pratley, Pierre/0000-0003-1829-7060",,,,,29,37,41,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

But the differences in CSR activities and perceptions among different types of family businesses has not yet been researched, even if there are important differences in family businesses. Drawing on the evolution of CSR approach from positive to post positive and to Habermasian approach, and integrating it with a view of family firms as systems made of three different subsystems that over the course of time can be differently preponderant, we identify a typology of family firms. Our typology supports a fine-tuned understanding of the dynamics of CSR and family businesses in different configurations and facilitates envisioning the futures of family businesses in the development of CSR through the different types but also beyond. With this work we contribute to the literature by suggesting that patterns of CSR can be conceived by drawing on the evolving political conception of CSR. Specifically, we show that family firms can represent an ideal laboratory to depict the possible evolution of family firms CSR behaviors and test the tenets of the Habermasian approaches in addition to other approaches.

We then use a Markov regime switching model to identify the high financial stress episodes. We examine periods of heightened financial stress and its relationship to high incidence of domestic and global disturbances. Finally, we construct a global financial liquidity index and assess the relationship between financial stress and global liquidity. Using a bivariate Markov regime switching VAR model, we find a regime-dependent relation between global liquidity and financial stress. Moreover, global liquidity shocks seem to strain these emerging economies in such a way that global illiquidity heightens financial stress.","[Cevik, Emrah I.] Namik Kemal Univ, Dept Econ, Tekirdag, Turkey; [Kirci-Cevik, Nuket] Bulent Ecevit Univ, Dept Business Adm, Zonguldak, Turkey; [Dibooglu, Sel] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 408 SSB,One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA",Namik Kemal University; Bulent Ecevit University; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis,"Dibooglu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 408 SSB,One Univ Blvd, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",dibooglus@umsl.edu,"Kırcı Çevik, Nüket/AFM-7310-2022; Dibooglu, Sel/AAJ-4102-2020; Cevik, Emrah I/K-1967-2019","Dibooglu, Sel/0000-0002-3865-5868; Cevik, Emrah I/0000-0002-8155-1597; Kirci Cevik, Nuket/0000-0002-0104-1088",,,,,43,12,13,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The Supply Chain Formation problem is described in terms of a directed acyclic graph where the nodes are represented by the component suppliers/consumers. Intelligent agents negotiate in the name of component suppliers/consumers on three constraints (scope, time, cost) giving raise to SLAs. We express the SLAs as utility functions and by running max-sum algorithm we conclude that in complex projects scenario where the graph is always a tree the proposed model will converge to the optimal solution and the overall project requirements will be achieved at the best utility value and will be propagated autonomously across all component providers within the project environment.","[Covaci, Florina Livia] Univ Babes Bolyai, Business Informat Syst Dept, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Covaci, FL (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Business Informat Syst Dept, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",florina.covaci@ubbcluj.ro,"Covaci, Florina/AAZ-7707-2020",,,,,,25,0,0,0,4,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,295,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300047,0

Much of the undergraduate learning in horticulture is passive; therefore, more active learning strategies should be introduced. One such active learning technique is scenario-based learning (SBL). This form of learning allows students to apply academic knowledge to a simulated 'real-life' situation. It is particularly suited to promoting group participation and learning. Its use provides students with the opportunity to recognise and solve problems, to think critically and to develop teamwork skills. Recently, an SBL project was introduced to the Fruit Production (HORT30190) undergraduate module at University College Dublin. In order to implement the project, the class was divided into groups and each group was required to establish a hypothetical commercial dessert, culinary or cider apple orchard in Ireland. The groups were required to consider site characteristics, growing and pruning systems, rootstocks, cultivars, pollinator selection and planting density. They presented their results in class using posters and submitted a personal learning journal associated with the project, both of which were assessed by staff. Student response to the SBL project was evaluated for benefits such as increased understanding of course material, acquisition of transferable skills and enjoyment of the learning method. This project is an example of formative assessment in action. Scenario-based learning allows students to contextualise learning while acquiring transferable skills. It is suitable for implementation in a wide range of diverse university modules.","[Elliott-Kingston, C.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Doyle, O. P.

Associated yield and quality losses have severe negative economic consequences at the farm level. Consequently, proper hail risk management adapted to local conditions is essential for successful farm management. To manage hail risk, fruit farmers can select from various options. Both hail cannons and cloud seeding planes are only economically viable if shared among a group of farmers due to the high investment needed. A popular farm-specific hail management instrument is spatial diversification of orchards. The most commonly used instruments are anti-hail nets and hail insurance. A major difference between anti-hail nets and hail insurance is that establishing an anti-hail net requires a long term investment while the decision for a hail insurance can be made annually. Furthermore, the two instruments hedge hail risk in different ways. While hail insurance covers (ex post) the monetary yield and quality loss the anti-hail net prevents yield and quality damage. Based on a time series of 10 years of insurance data of three apple orchards in Germany a risk analysis (historical simulation) of hail insurance and anti-hail nets is presented. The risk analysis accounts for orchard-specific hail risk and farmers' risk aversion applying an expected utility model. Analysis shows that hail insurance is particularly interesting for highly risk averse farmers with high debt-to-asset ratios associated with low initial wealth at locations with medium hail risk. At locations with high hail risk, anti-hail nets are the preferable risk management instrument in terms of certainty equivalent outcomes.","[Gandorfer, M.; Hartwich, A.; Bitsch, V.] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Grp Econ Hort & Landscaping, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Gandorfer, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Chair Grp Econ Hort & Landscaping, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",,,"Gandorfer, Markus/0000-0002-0624-153X",,,,,15,6,6,1,15,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132.0,,,,,,141,146,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.19,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400019,0

The use of both methods shows they are complementary, since the ratios correlated to the extracted factors in PCA are also important in defining the canonical variates in CCA, showing the relationship between them.","[Garcia-Gallego, Ana; Mures-Quintana, Maria-Jesus] Univ Leon, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"García-Gallego, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leon, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",ana.ggallego@unileon.es; mj.mures@unileon.es,"García-Gallego, Ana/F-5779-2016",,,,,,25,4,4,0,9,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In this paper, we conduct experiments with some of the most promising nature-inspired metaheuristics, for assessing their performance when using them to replace backpropagation as a learning method for neural networks. The selected metaheuristics are: Cuckoo Search (CS), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the PSO-GSA hybridization, Many Optimizing Liaisons (MOL) and certain combinations of metaheuristics with local search methods. Both the neural network based classifiers and function approximators are evolved in this way. Classifiers have been evolved against a training dataset having bankruptcy prediction as a target, whereas function approximators have been evolved as NNARX models, where the target is to predict foreign exchange rates.","[Georgescu, Vasile] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Georgescu, V (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",vasile.georgeseu@feaa.ucv.ro,"Georgescu, Vasile/AAE-7661-2021",,,,,,13,3,3,0,5,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The impulse response analysis shows that the U.S. economic policy uncertainty shocks have significant and negative effects unanimously on the U.S., European, Asian, and Islamic stock markets. A contractionary monetary policy shock, in terms of a higher federal funds rate, has also a statistically significant and negative effect on all of the stock markets. The variance decomposition results indicate that the Islamic stock index is mainly affected by the U.S. stock index shock, thus negating its dichotomy hypothesis. The U.S. economic uncertainty shock explains an important portion of fluctuations for all four stock indices.

In this paper, I extend the basic VAM to allow for interactive effects between teachers. Using data from North Carolina's primary schools, I find that teacher complementarities within schools are extremely small. This finding suggests that there is little to gain by assigning students to particular teacher sequences. Moreover, measures of teacher effectiveness generated from a typical VAM are not likely to be biased by interactions with past teacher inputs.","[Kinsler, Josh] Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Kinsler, J (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jkinsler@uga.edu,,,,,,,21,2,3,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Since its introduction, the Baltic Dry Index has become one of the foremost indicators on the volume of worldwide trade and manufacturing activity. Over decades estimation of Markov regime-switching regressions typically relies on the assumption that the latent state variable controlling regime change is exogenous. In many macroeconomic applications there is common where it is natural to assume the state is endogenous. It is often the case that the estimated state variable has a strong business cycle correlation. Literature has shown that data sampled at high frequency can provide accurate estimates of volatility and therefore provide an accepted forecasting accuracy.

Conclusions resulting from the study can be used for improving statistical analysis in tourism research and while developing tourism destination strategies.","[Lebedev, Anton] Vladimir State Univ, Murom Inst, Vladimir, Russia",Vladimir State University,"Lebedev, A (通讯作者)，Vladimir State Univ, Murom Inst, Vladimir, Russia.",,,,RFBR [16-36-00291 MO_a],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project No. 16-36-00291 MO_a.,,10,0,0,0,17,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,725,731,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100095,0

The results indicate that jumps contribute significantly to tail dependence between individual stocks and the aggregate market. Jumps are more tail dependent than raw returns and account for an average of 17 percent of the daily tail-dependence coefficient. We also find that jump tail dependence is asymmetric and substantially stronger in the lower tail than in the upper tail. Ignoring jump tail dependence may lead to underestimation of risks and produce inaccurate conclusions about the tail neutrality of a portfolio.,"[Li, Sophia Zhengzi] Michigan State Univ, Dept Finance, E Lansing, MI USA; [Wang, Hao] Michigan State Univ, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhao, Hua] Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, 422 South Siming Rd, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Xiamen University,"Zhao, H (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Sch Econ, 422 South Siming Rd, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",zhaohua@xmu.edu.cn,,,Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [15YJA790089]; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Econometrics; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars,Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Econometrics; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars),"This research was supported by the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Project no. 15YJA790089), the Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Econometrics, and the Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars.",,38,3,4,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Consequently, productivity, income and return on labour have been low leading to poverty and food insecurity. In this study, the traditional approach of improving farm income by increasing production and productivity solely through technical capacity building of small farm was not followed. Instead a mixed method approach was used by establishing value chains, and engaging links in the chain involved in production, processing, transport, marketing and consumption and by using visual methods of identifying training needs of small landholders to enhance their capacity to participate. The challenges that small landholders faced were identified in a training needs workshop, using visual ethnographic techniques. Specific training needs were identified as horticulture production, business management and marketing. Small landholders from the Central Province were trained to improve their capability to capitalize on opportunities in the value chain.

The article presents a comparative analysis of the development of information technologies and its impact on economic growth; the article also analyzes the similarities and peculiarities of IT development in the BRICS countries and state support for the IT sector in these countries. The study is based on comparative analysis and correlation analysis of data. The basis for the study is data from the World Bank, the World Economic Forum (WEF), The Total Economy Database, and other public sources. Information technologies in the BRICS countries are developing quite rapidly, and each country has its peculiarities. It should be noted a significant backlog of India in almost all indexes. In this country, it is necessary to solve the problems with access to technology, at the same time India is a well-known supplier of IT services. Russia has a well developed infrastructure and a high level of education, but it does not make it the leader in the competitiveness and economic development. China is known as a supplier of IT products, and more and more of it is a product of own R&D. South Africa and Brazil are the leaders in the ratio of preparedness of population and companies to use information technology. In all BRICS countries, government is supporting IT industry. Particular attention is given to export support and tax incentives for businesses to make it invest in education. At the moment, the BRICS countries should analyze the experience and the strengths of each other, to be able to implement joint projects in the IT sector and engage private investment.","[Revinova, Svetlana] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Revinova, S (通讯作者)，Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia.",,"Revinova, Svetlana/Q-7857-2018; Revinova, Svetlana/Z-5525-2019","Revinova, Svetlana/0000-0002-2442-2393; Revinova, Svetlana/0000-0002-2442-2393",RFBR [15-06-05146],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The reported study was partially supported by RFBR, research project No 15-06-05146.",,8,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,353,360,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200046,0

However, empirical evidence of this relationship is scarce. A major shortcoming of previous research is that it is either cross-sectional, which casts general doubt on the causal nature of the estimates, or it is longitudinal and based on aggregated data, which makes it difficult to control for compositional effects or to analyze the individual-level implications of the hypothesis. This article estimates cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of inequality, while simultaneously controlling for the composition of data at the individual level. The article finds a positive within-country effect of inequality on demand for redistribution but no such relationship between countries. This finding points to an unobserved variable at the country level. Following the literature, the article considers welfare regimes as a possible factor capturing these unobserved country differences. However, none of the existing welfare regime typologies performs well in terms of capturing unobserved heterogeneity or in general explanatory power. All in all, the article finds robust support for the proposition that demand for redistribution is positively related to inequality, but it casts doubt on the utility of cross-sectional analysis and the welfare regime approach.","[Schmidt-Catran, Alexander W.] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Schmidt-Catran, AW (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",alex@alexanderwschmidt.de,,,,,,,65,103,108,1,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

In this contribution, I examine firstly which limits, if any, the principle of proportionality ('Verhaltnismassigkeitsgrundsatz') as applied by the German Federal Constitutional Court imposes on governmental 'choice architects'. While nudges as such generally do not interfere with fundamental rights, including the very broad 'right of personal development' of Art. 2(1) Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, their implementation will often interfere with the fundamental rights of citizens other than the decision makers and therefore trigger constitutional scrutiny. Since paternalistic motives are - in principle - not accepted as legitimate ends that may justify an interference with fundamental rights, nudges solely intended to protect the decision maker from self-harm may not pass the proportionality test. Secondly, I examine whether the necessity prong of the proportionality principle may force the legislator to choose a non-coercive nudge over a more traditional coercive measure. Given the empirical evidence of the limited effectiveness of nudges in changing behaviour compared to traditional regulatory means, I come to the conclusion that the proportionality principle does not compel the use of nudges.","[Schweizer, Mark] Univ St Gallen, Sch Law, Dufourstr 50, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Schweizer, M (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Sch Law, Dufourstr 50, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",mark.schweizer@gmail.com,,,,,,,93,7,9,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,93,119,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_7,0.0,,,27,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500008,0

Fluctuations of external environments impact on the economy of companies and enterprises, reducing their financial and economic sustainability, creating an even more urgent need for tools to manage their sustainability. The difficulty in creating conditions for sustainable functioning of the national economy lies in the fact that at the turn of XX-XXI centuries the globalization of the world economy, which is manifested in the interdependence of the economies of individual countries, the impact of the international economic relations on the state of the national economy, increased. Sustainable international economic relations arise between countries. Economic integration, which is due to the international division of labor, internationalization of capital, the global nature of scientific and technological progress, increasing openness of national economies and free trade, occurs. Convergences of the economies of various countries, their inclusion in a single reproduction process on a global scale take place. Despite the fact that international economic integration is quite high and promising level of development of the world economy, it increases the degree of uncertainty of the external environment of functioning of enterprises in various countries, making them dependent and vulnerable to changes in the economies of other countries.

The present chapter outlines a sympathetic, `internal' critique of Nudge's policy framework (Thaler and Sunstein 2008. Nudge: Improving decisions about health, wealth, and happiness. New Haven: Yale University Press) identifying a fundamental problem that has received little attention to date. Thaler and Sunstein define their key concept as the use of a particular toolkit (rationally-neutral behavioural interventions) to promote a specific policy goal (individuals' self-judged well-being). To remain within the boundaries of these defining parameters, the chosen toolkit must nudge only by helping boundedly rational people better achieve their own ends. However, a closer look at this intuitively appealing approach reveals a fundamental problem of fit that should trouble even those who support Nudge's mission. Namely, while the tools of nudging can sometimes promote its declared goals, other tools can often do so equally well or even more effectively. And the tools of nudging are equally suited to promoting goals that are excluded by Nudge's own framework. This problem of fit causes some of Thaler and Sunstein's own applications to breach the boundaries of what they define as legitimate nudges and, more significantly, obscures the broader potential of behaviourally-informed policies and the substantial trade-offs involved in their implementation.","[Tor, Avishalom] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Law Sch, 3163 Eck Hall Law, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Tor, A (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame Law Sch, 3163 Eck Hall Law, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",ator@nd.edu,,,,,,,28,5,5,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,3,10,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_1,0.0,,,8,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500002,0

Methodological basis of the study consists of methods of system analysis, comparisons and analogies, logical-semantic modeling. Using the methods of comparative analysis, and mapping of statistical data the authors presented a comparative description of countries by level of human resource development. In the course of the study, the leaders were identified and countries who want to actively increase this figure. As the theoretical framework used works of domestic and foreign scientists on the problems of human resource management. Critical issue of workforce development is full employment and efficient use for economic growth and on this basis increasing the level and quality of life of the population.

We test whether these laws affected patients' propensity to switch doctors and the prices of new- and existing-patient visits. We also examine the effect of laws on hospitals' adoption of electronic medical record (EMR) systems.

Objective This study models how duration affects the value of health states, using discrete choice data. Methods A study was conducted comprising health profiles including various durations. Health states were described with the EQ-5D. Duration was introduced as a sixth domain with six levels (1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50 years). Sixty pairs of health profiles were selected, applying a Bayesian approach. Two hundred eight university students self-completed the computerized response tasks. Data were analyzed with a conditional logistic regression model. Results There is clear evidence for non-linear values for duration, that is, preferences for duration are more accurately described by a logarithmic function. Conclusions In discrete choice experiments using health states with different durations, these data present the first evidence for decreasing marginal utility for duration. Our results suggest that refinement of the standard QALY framework may be needed for states with a long duration.","[Scalone, Luciana] Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth, Fac Med, Dept Clin Med & Prevent, Villa Serena,Via Pergolesi 33, I-20052 Monza, Italy; [Stalmeier, Peep F.

We argue that this persisting strength is the result of 'strategic recoupling' through which former low-end exporters forge new links to the domestic market or supply higher value-added products to export markets while relocating parts of their operations to regions with lower production costs. Drawing on empirical data from clusters in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), it is analysed how local governments can act as agents in such processes.

Data from catfish pond studies at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff (UAPB) were used to develop mathematical models of catfish foodfish in multiple-batch culture across a variety of management alternatives. Two different functional forms (Cobb-Douglas and a modified translog) were each developed into average and stochastic frontier models. Inefficiency terms were found to be non-significant in the frontier models, thus making the average and frontier models equivalent. In the average regression models, the modified translog form demonstrated superior statistical values as compared to the Cobb-Douglas form, but the latter resulted in lower prediction error and was validated with the Chow test when used to predict observations from commercial catfish farms. This approach appears to have merit from the perspective of its statistical properties, and represents a step towards development of a model that could be used for farm management purposes.","[Bastola, Umesh; Engle, Carole R.; Dey, Madan M.; Xie, Lin] Univ Arkansas Pine Bluff, Aquaculture Fisheries Ctr, Pine Bluff, AR USA",University of Arkansas System; University Arkansas Pine Bluff,"Engle, CR (通讯作者)，Engle Stone Aquat LLC, 1225 Cottontown Rd, Strasburg, VA 22657 USA.",cengle8523@gmail.com,"Bastola, Umesh/AAH-9714-2019","Dey, Madan/0000-0001-5273-2789",,,,,53,5,5,2,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

On the one hand it considers the external approach, that is, the analysis of visible signals linked to the emerging issues that in an early stage are called weak signals. On the other hand, it tries to study emerging issues taking into account their internal motivations. In this case the aim is to value the social, economic or other kind of reasons that are hidden under emerging issues. A post-structuralism perspective (CIA, causal layered analysis) is used to address this objective. This double approach allows to consider emerging issues in a holistic way, taking into account what is visible and what is not so apparent.

This effect operates via the influence of the NSS on a university's position in separately published, subject-specific league tables, suggesting that information contained in the league table rankings is more salient. The impact of rankings is greater for more able students, for universities with entry standards in the upper-middle tier, and for subject-departments facing more competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Dupuits, E",,,,"Dupuits, Emilie",,,Transnational self-help networks and community forestry: A theoretical framework,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Community forestry; Transnational self-help network; Norm-building; Discourse analysis; Mesoamerica,REGIME COMPLEX; GOVERNANCE,"Global forest governance is generally analyzed as highly fragmented, meaning that it involves a multiplicity of actors and institutions. This fragmentation may be one explanation of the proliferation of multiple discourses around forest governance produced by some dominant actors. In this context, community forestry organizations are seeking, through their association in the form of transnational self-help networks, to promote alternative discourses around their own model of communitarian governance. These recent experiences question the traditional concepts and approaches that only consider community forestry organizations at the local scale. Based on a transnational political sociology perspective and on concrete experiences from Mesoamerica, this paper aims to present an innovative analytical framework to understand how transnational self-help networks of community forestry contribute to transform norms of forest governance through their discourses. It aims in particular to capture the mechanisms leading to the translation of norms between scales and the production of discourse coalitions within the network. The goal is finally to consider transnational self-help networks of community forestry as full-fledged actors within global forest governance, with the capacity to transform the nature of key norms of governance, particularly those directly affecting their own model.

However, most SMFEs operate in the informal sector, and thus have become a target for current forest sector reforms stemming from Ghana's involvement in two international mechanisms: FLEGT and REDD. This paper examines how SMFEs are being incorporated into FLEGT and REDD plans, and asks whether reforms under these mechanisms will serve to advance SMFEs in the country while tackling illegal and unsustainable forest activities. The analysis shows that FLEGT-related reforms will target governance issues downstream in the domestic lumber supply chain, without tackling a root cause of illegalities and challenges within the SMFE sector: tree tenure. In contrast, REDD planning includes a strong focus on the illusive tenure issue, but to date has placed little emphasis on SMFE promotion. The paper concludes that reforms associated with both mechanisms may work complementarily to advance a legal and sustainable SMFE sector, but only if local communities are incentivized to manage forest and tree resources through clarification of land and tree tenure. Reasons for why tenure reform has been such a sticking point are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This, however, is a challenging task, as customer needs tend to vary over time. As future is uncertain, a significant degree of uncertainty is attached to the anticipation of the future customer needs. This issue is especially relevant to manufacturers of aircraft, as extensive development costs and long product life cycles require a solid decision basis when initiating a new aircraft development program. Therefore, this paper is targeted at supporting the anticipation of future customer needs under uncertainty by proposing an approach to the derivation of robust design requirements through the consideration of alternative future scenarios. The approach is composed of several methodical steps that comprise the building of multiple scenarios, a scenario-specific analysis of the target market and customers, a description of distinct Concepts of Operations, and eventually a derivation of design requirements to form the aircraft specification. The paper ultimately portrays a case study that demonstrates the applicability and allows further evaluation of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The asymmetry between players raises normative issues about fairness, rights, and equality that are not present in the symmetric game, where efficiency is the major relevant normative concept. Playing the game in class requires students to confront the distributional question and shows how issues of efficiency can become entangled with other moral issues when solving economic policy problems. The game allows instructors to incorporate theories of distributive justice into economic reasoning in the classroom, as has been widely suggested recently.","Union Coll, Econ, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Union College,"Schmidt, SJ (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Econ, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",schmidsj@union.edu,"Schmidt, Stephen/HTP-9086-2023",,Union College Nichols Fellowship,Union College Nichols Fellowship,Support from the Union College Nichols Fellowship is gratefully acknowledged.,,20,0,0,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The intervention and observation period spanned 1 year and 329 participants were enrolled. The intervention consisted of at least one home visit and quarterly telephone calls. Data on resource use and quality of life were collected quarterly. The primary measurements of effect were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) health utilities from the German time trade-off. The secondary measurements were EQ-5D-3L utility values and patients' self-rated health states according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) among survivors. To estimate mean differences, a linear regression model was used for QALYs and a gamma model for costs. Health states among the survivors were analysed using linear mixed models. To assess the impact of different health state valuation methods, VAS-adjusted life years were constructed. The mean difference in QALYs was small and not significant (-0.0163; CI -0.0681-0.0354, p value: 0.536, n = 297). Among survivors, EQ-5D-3L utilities showed significant improvements within 6 months in the intervention group (0.051; CI 0.0028-0.0989; p value: 0.0379, n = 280) but returned towards baseline levels by month 12.

Evidence from the Four-Day School Week,EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FULL-DAY KINDERGARTEN; ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; NATURAL EXPERIMENT; JUVENILE CRIME; TIME; ECONOMICS; GENDER; MATTER; ME,"School districts use a variety of policies to close budget gaps and stave off teacher layoffs and furloughs. More schools are implementing four-day school weeks to reduce overhead and transportation costs. The four-day week requires substantial schedule changes as schools must increase the length of their school day to meet minimum instructional hour requirements. Although some schools have indicated this policy eases financial pressures, it is unknown whether there is an impact on student outcomes. We use school-level data from Colorado to investigate the relationship between the four-day week and academic performance among elementary school students. Our results generally indicate a positive relationship between the four-day week and performance in reading and mathematics. These findings suggest there is little evidence that moving to a four-day week compromises student academic achievement. This research has policy relevance to the current U.S. education system, where many school districts must cut costs.","[Anderson, D.

These two initiatives are (1) charter school expansion and (2) improvement of resource equity across urban public school systems through policies often referred to as weighted student funding formulas. In this article, we focus on New York and Houston, two cities where districts have adopted initiatives to improve equity of the distribution of school site funding and have concurrently experienced significant expansion of charter schooling. We find that charter schools have the tendency to amplify student population differences across schools by disability, language, and low income status, and that charter schools' access to financial resources varies widely. Nevertheless, we find that in very large urban districts like New York City, where charter market share remains small, the overall effects of charters on system-wide inequity remain small.","[Baker, Bruce D.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Educ Theory Policy & Adm, Grad Sch Educ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Libby, Ken; Wiley, Kathryn] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Baker, BD (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Educ Theory Policy & Adm, Grad Sch Educ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",bruce.baker@gse.rutgers.edu; kenmlibby@gmail.com; Kathryn.wiley@colorado.edu,,,National Education Policy Center; Shanker Institute,National Education Policy Center; Shanker Institute,This article is an outgrowth of a project initially funded by the National Education Policy Center and the Shanker Institute.,,38,7,10,1,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Interventions prior to birth, rather than early in childhood, may reduce the probability or the severity of the shock and may be relatively cost effective. One such intervention, bed rest during pregnancy, is frequently prescribed to reduce the likelihood of preterm birth. Premature infants experience worse average initial infant health than full-term infants and these differences may persist into adulthood without mediation. Recent medical literature on the efficacy of bed rest is mixed, but tilts towards a negative or zero relationship between bed rest and infant health, suggesting that this intervention does not improve initial health status. This is not surprising given the difficulty of navigating a crucial threat to identification: conditions leading to bed rest recommendations are correlated with infant health. We investigate this question using Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data. Among women who experience a medical issue during pregnancy, we compare outcomes of infants born to mothers who are observationally similar yet differ in whether they are recommended bed rest. Using OLS and matching methods, we find a positive relationship between bed rest and the likelihood of low birth weight and prematurity (consistent with prior medical literature). Yet our results also show that bed rest decreases the incidence of very low birth weight (at least -15.4 percent), very premature outcomes (at least -7.7 percent), and a reduction for infant death. We provide additional evidence that suggests bed rest shifts initial health status upward. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that when accounting for cost savings over both the short and the long run, bed rest may be more cost-effective treatment than post-birth interventions.","[Durrance, Christine Piette] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA; [Guldi, Melanie] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Durrance, CP (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",christine.durrance@unc.edu,,,,,,,41,5,5,0,1,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Scholars examining this trend tend to diagnose it at once as techno positivist in its insistence on design yoked to quantifiable variables and computational modeling and, alternatively, as an imperative integral to realizing ecologically sustainable innovation. This article investigates this tension. It reflects on the role of futurists, designers, architects, urban planners, social scientists, and artists in interpreting and utilizing comprehensiveness as a design frame. Among nine experimental foresight workshops at the inaugural Emerge conference at Arizona State University, many focused on producing physical objects or media, one modeled and expanded upon a method pioneered by architect and polymath R. Buckminster Fuller. At a time when many of the capabilities to realize Fuller's specifications for big data have matured, I investigate whether comprehensive design as framed by Fuller's method shows promise as a trend enabling ecologically sustainable innovations. A historical look at Fuller's Design Science and the reflection on it in the Emerge workshop marks an opportunity to highlight and interpret the resurgence of comprehensive thinking in design while navigating the contradictions this orientation engenders.

While some scholars claim that women benefit from such marriages in terms of higher consumption or leisure time, others believe that such relationships can be oppressive for women, as compared to monogamous relationships. Using household data from the 2005/6 Ghanaian Living Standards Measurement Survey V and the 2008 Ghanaian Demographic Health Survey, this study finds little evidence to support the view that women experience economic benefits from these unions. Polygynous women in Ghana tend to be more accepting of and experience more domestic violence, and they have less decision-making power within the household than women in monogamous marriages. Thus, there seems to be more evidence to support the view of polygyny as an oppressive institution rather than the outcome of a woman's rational choice.","[Ickowitz, Amy] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Forests & Livelihoods, Bogor, Indonesia; [Mohanty, Lisa] Trident Univ Int, Dept Gen Educ, Cypress, CA USA",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Ickowitz, A (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Forestry Res, Forests & Livelihoods, Bogor, Indonesia.",a.ickowitz@cgiar.org; lisa.mohanty@trident.edu,,"Ickowitz, Amy/0000-0002-0965-7661",,,,,43,12,14,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Specifically, we focus on her development of the concepts of integration and participation with respect to the employer-employee relationship in the context of the low-skill workforce. At their core, both of these concepts relate to the idea that management should attend to the concerns of workers. However, recent trends that have had the effect of reducing the attachment of workers to their organizations, particularly changes in the psychological employment contract and the use of contingent and temporary workforces, also reduce the likelihood of genuine integration and participation in organizations. We then connect these changes to the problem of income inequality and suggest that the same organizational practices that have reduced employee attachment may also lead many people to question the legitimacy of capitalism as an economic system through the absence of a societally shared prosperity. We suggest that by reconnecting to Follett's concepts of integration and participation in the employer-employee relationship, better results can be obtained for both organizations and workers, leading to restored faith in capitalism. We close with an agenda for future research based on the implications of Follett's work for present-day organizations and society.

However, risk is often conceptualized as an alternative measure of the socio-economic status. We show that employment risk and socio-economic status are distinct, cross-cutting determinants of social policy preferences. More specifically, we analyze the policy preferences of high-skilled labor market outsiders as a cross-pressured group. We first establish that labor market vulnerability has spread well into the more highly educated segments of the population. We then show that the effect of labor market vulnerability on social policy preferences even increases with higher educational attainment. We conclude that that labor market risk and educational status are not interchangeable and that the high skilled are particularly sensitive to the experience of labor market risk. Thereby, our findings point to a potential cross-class alliance between more highly and lower skilled vulnerable individuals in support of a redistributive and activating welfare state. Thus, they have far-reaching implications for our understanding of both the politicization of insider/outsider divides and the politics of welfare support.","[Haeusermann, Silja; Kurer, Thomas] Univ Zurich, Inst Polit Sci, Ctr Comparat & Int Studies CIS, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schwander, Hanna] Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Bremen,"Schwander, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",hanna.schwander@zes.uni-bremen.de,,,Swiss National Science Foundation [100017 131994/1]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100017_131994] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work benefited from generous funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation (research grant nr. 100017 131994/1).,,65,96,106,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

By contrast, among the Yoruba of Nigeria, women have some levels of autonomy and independence such that they can accumulate property to which their husbands have no claim, yet they customarily do not have any inheritance right to their husbands' property. This study examines how this gender-equitable property rights regime affects gender relations at the household and societal levels through in-depth interviews conducted in 2012 with fifty-six purposively selected women property owners who lived in urban Ibadan, Nigeria.

More than economic power is required to attain equality.

Optimal portfolio selection in a multi-period setting where risk preferences are allowed to change in every period is discussed. The change in the market conditions is modelled according to a Markov Chain. Dynamic programming approach is used to obtain the solution of the optimal policy and the corresponding value function is applied The applicability of PLEC utility is demonstrated here, in order to obtain an optimal policy which depends on the wealth invested and also on the period of investment along with the state of the market. The focus is on using the different PLEC utility functions for representing various investors of the market.","[Arif, Afreen H.; Pakkala, T. P.

One such boundary is the boundary between markets. This article shows that a critical contemporary arena for the differentiation of one product or service market from another is competition (or antitrust) law, which, through its work of market definition, seeks to identify the boundaries of competition: the location of the borders between meaningful economic spaces within which buyers and sellers encounter one another and establish prices. The article argues that in envisioning markets ('the law's markets'), competition law simultaneously constitutes markets, and it demonstrates this through an empirical examination of the exercise of such law in three economic sectors: insurance, grocery retailing, and pay-television. It also shows, however, that competition law is perennially dogged by conflict - both over the placement of such conceptual boundaries, and over the very process of placement and the status of the market boundary itself - and that its application and effects can only be understood in this light.","[Christophers, Brett] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, Geog, Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Christophers, B (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res, Geog, Uppsala, Sweden.",brett.christophers@ibf.uu.se,,,,,,,45,21,22,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Previous studies have shown that there are inequities in health care services utilisation (HCSU) in the OECD area. In recent years, measures have been taken to enhance health care access. This paper re-examines income-related inequities in doctor visits among 18 selected OECD countries, updating previous results for 12 countries with 2006-2009 data, and including six new countries. Inequalities in preventive care services are also considered for the first time. The indirect standardisation procedure is used to estimate the need-adjusted HCSU and concentration indexes are derived to gauge inequalities and inequities. Overall, inequities in HCSU remain present in OECD countries. In most countries, for the same health care needs, people with higher incomes are more likely to consult a doctor than those with lower incomes. Pro-rich inequalities in dental visits and cancer screening uptake are also found in nearly all countries, although the magnitude of these varies among countries. These findings suggest that further monitoring of inequalities is essential in order to assess whether country policy objectives are achieved on a regular basis.","OECD, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Devaux, M (通讯作者)，OECD, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",marion.devaux@oecd.org,,,,,,,35,146,152,6,46,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

These clinical results lead to a decrease in health care resource utilization and, therefore, have a positive impact on health economics of atrial fibrillation. The cost-effectiveness of apixaban has been assessed in a variety of clinical settings and countries. However, data from emergent markets, as is the case of Argentina, are still scarce. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of apixaban versus warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in patients suitable for oral anticoagulation in Argentina. A Markov-based model including both costs and effects were used to simulate a cohort of patients with NVAF. Local epidemiological, resource utilization and cost data were used and all inputs were validated by a Delphi Panel of local experts. We adopted the payer's perspective with costs expressed in 2012 US Dollars. The study revealed that apixaban is cost-effective compared with warfarin using a willingness to pay threshold ranging from 1 to 3 per capita Gross Domestic Product (11558 - 34664 USD) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 786.08 USD per QALY gained. The benefit is primarily a result of the reduction in stroke and bleeding events. The study demonstrates that apixaban is a cost-effective alternative to warfarin in Argentina.","[Giorgi, Mariano Anibal] Inst Univ CEMIC Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Caroli, Christian] FLENI, Dept Cardiol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Giglio, Norberto Damian] Hosp Ricardo Gutierrez, Dept Epidemiol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Micone, Paula] Univ Austral, Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Pilar, Argentina; [Aiello, Eleonora; Vulcano, Cristina; Blanco, Julia] Bristol Myers Squibb Argentina, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Donato, Bonnie] Bristol Myers Squibb US, Wallingford, CT USA; [Quevedo, Joaquin Mould] Pfizer US, New York, NY USA",Austral University; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer,"Giorgi, MA (通讯作者)，Inst Univ CEMIC Sch Med, Dept Pharmacol, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",marianoagiorgi@hotmail.com,"Giorgi, Mariano/AAM-6486-2021","giorgi, mariano/0000-0002-1488-0438",Pfizer; Bristol-Myer Squibb,Pfizer(Pfizer); Bristol-Myer Squibb,This study was funded by a grant from Pfizer and Bristol-Myer Squibb.; The model design and development was supported by Pfizer and Bristol-Myer Squibb.; M.A.G. and N.D.G. have received consulting fees and research funding from Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.; JMQ was full time employee at Pfizer.; C.C. has no competing interests to declare.; Article processing charge will be supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb.; All authors declare no non-financial competing interests.,,37,9,10,0,27,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Based on these indices there can be drawn the standardized elements of a contract for derivatives used as alternative mechanisms for the transfer of the agro-climatic risks.","[Hurduzeu, Gheorghe; Popescu, Maria-Floriana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Hurduzeu, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",gheorghe.hurduzeu@rei.ase.ro; mariafpopescu@yahoo.com,"Hurduzeu, Gheorghe/Q-9006-2017; Popescu, Maria-Floriana/R-6808-2016","Hurduzeu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-1929-1851;",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134197],European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development,"This work was cofinanced from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/134197, Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.",,50,0,0,0,1,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,251,258,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200031,0

The objective of this study is to identify potential factors affecting the level and growth rate of sawnwood consumption in Europe. Econometric models with sawnwood consumption per capita as the dependent variable are estimated for 17 European countries for the period of 1980-2012. The per capita form normalizes the data in regard to the size of the markets, and therefore makes the data more comparable across countries and overtime. The results indicate that the sawnwood consumption per capita is related to construction activity, income, and prices. However, the results point to large regional differences in the drivers of sawnwood consumption across Europe. Moreover, in densely forested and scarcely populated regions, there have been structural changes that may have been caused by changes in the market share of sawnwood in the construction markets, which the models measuring economic activity are unable to capture.

The resulting models, expressed in mathematical language, make no allowance for culture, as they never engage with the society's way of life or the moulding of individuals within society. This paper compares the static approach to distributive justice with a cultural one, arguing that a case for redistribution should rest upon its cultural effects in assisting well-being and social cohesion. Unless we recognise culture, we can have little understanding of why inequalities matter, where they come from, and how they might be reduced. Redistribution may be motivated by universal value judgements taken from external sources, but it also entails internal cultural changes that refashion social relations through cumulative causation. In practical terms, it has to penetrate beyond reallocating resource endowments to bring revised attitudes in a society less tolerant of unequal outcomes. Egalitarian reforms will flourish only if they generate and reflect an egalitarian culture.","[Jackson, William A.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Jackson, WA (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",,,"Jackson, William Anthony/0000-0001-5194-7307",,,,,94,1,1,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The use of subgroups based on preferences is rare, except when religion based, and controversial. If it were decided to treat subgroup preferences as valid determinants of public policy, a transparent analytical procedure is needed. In this proof of method study we show how public preferences could be incorporated into policy decisions in a way that respects both the multi-criterial nature of those decisions, and the heterogeneity of the population in relation to the importance assigned to relevant criteria. It involves combining Cluster Analysis (CA), to generate the subgroup sets of preferences, with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), to provide the policy framework into which the clustered preferences are entered. We employ three techniques of CA to demonstrate that not only do different techniques produce different clusters, but that choosing among techniques (as well as developing the MCDA structure) is an important task to be undertaken in implementing the approach outlined in any specific policy context. Data for the illustrative, not substantive, application are from a Randomized Controlled Trial of online decision aids for Australian men aged 40-69 years considering Prostate-specific Antigen testing for prostate cancer. We show that such analyses can provide policy-makers with insights into the criterion-specific needs of different subgroups. Implementing CA and MCDA in combination to assist in the development of policies on important health and community issues such as drug coverage, reimbursement, and screening programs, poses major challenges -conceptual, methodological, ethical-political, and practical -but most are exposed by the techniques, not created by them.","[Kaltoft, Mette Kjer; Nielsen, Jesper Bo] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Publ Hlth, Res Unit Gen Practice, DK-5000 Odense C, Denmark; [Turner, Robin] Univ New South Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Cunich, Michelle] Sydney Med Sch, NHMRC Clin Trials Ctr, Charles Perkins Ctr, Camperdown, NSW 2050, Australia; [Salkeld, Glenn] Univ Sydney, Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Dowie, Jack] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England",University of Southern Denmark; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Dowie, J (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",jack.dowie@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Kaltoft, Mette Kjer/0000-0002-7056-8297; Cunich, Michelle/0000-0002-0163-3665; Dowie, Jack/0000-0002-4572-9562",,,,,57,11,11,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Therefore, our research purpose was to determine if the sources of information used by the members of the academic community may influence the quality values that are promoted and desired in the Romanian public universities. In order to achieve our goal, we developed a survey based on questionnaire among the members of the academic community from five Romanian public universities (Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi, Bucharest University of Economic Studies, University of Bucharest, Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca, West University of Timisoara) and we applied a logistic regression analysis.

In the case of the time-varying autoregressive process, we investigated optimization of parameters such as lag length, windowing and overlap. In the wavelet analysis approach, we investigated the type of wave and scale. Performance of the methods was presented on the gross domestic product data of USA, United Kingdom and Korea. These representatives were chosen from the perspective of available sample size and for the reason that the countries represent economy in different geographic areas.

Combining value- and process-based explanations from Finnish forest controversies,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Compromise; Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations; Forest politics; Governance; Legitimacy; Participatory processes,CONFLICT-MANAGEMENT; PARTICIPATION; CONSENSUS; DELIBERATION; LAND,"Environmental problems are often complex and involve fundamental value contradictions. There is a need to explore whether a well-designed process can contribute to a legitimate decision 'closure' even in the presence of value conflicts. We examine why environmentalists did not accept a compromise between industrial forestry and full conservation in the case of some forestry debates in Northern Finland and the Liperinsuo site in particular. Contradictory value positions between the environmentalists and the Finnish state forestry enterprise can only partly explain the lack of legitimacy, because past decision-making processes form specific legacies affecting even the legitimacy of current decisions and compromises. By exploring the continuum of decision-making processes from the point of view of 'opening up' and 'closing down', we identify some conditions for processes contributing to legitimate decision 'closures', including: 1) the inclusion of all the relevant participants, 2) the problems which the decision should solve are co-defined and mutually agreed on; 3) the timing of the necessary 'closing down' of the decision is mutually agreed on; 4) the processes are transparent, and 5) the decision 'closures' are not transformed from one scale to another without possibilities for participation. By nurturing these conditions through deliberate process design, capacity to legitimately 'close down' decisions in order to resolve complex and value-laden environmental conflicts will increase.

Performed on a sample of 276 entrepreneurs, the questionnaire, the main objectives of the research have been to estimate the influence of the main characteristics of the business environment on the company start-up and to identify the characteristics of entrepreneurs in order to define a profile of the entrepreneur. Due to the defining importance of entrepreneurial education, the research paid great attention to the identification and assessment of the skills the investigated entrepreneurs had. The originality of this paper consists in the identification of the entrepreneurs' characteristics and skills tightly correlated with the idiosyncrasies of the Romanian business environment.

This process asked for a totally different legal basis for the activity of companies. The legal basis is since quit instable, as it quickly changes according to the demands both on the domestic and European level. Until now, the legal framework for corporate governance in Romania developed in three steps. In 1990 the first modern companies legal framework was adopted. It regulated five types of companies, each with its own particularities in ownership and management. After the official intention to join the European Union ( 2007), the legal framework supported some adjustments, in order to align to the communities system of law. The corporate governance also registered some positive but also negative influences. In the third phase, as a result of social environment pressure, the legal framework changed dramatically in 2011, when a new Civil Code came into force.

It is important to emphasize the influence of the early studies since later financial assessment models were built on the earlier paradigms. The basic thrust of this effort is to encourage the greater employment by managers of quantitative models that allow decision makers to generate all the factors needed to estimate real financial gains and/or losses before any intervention strategy is implemented in the workplace. As indicated, the use of these quantitative models to estimate the net financial gains of using particular intervention strategies or the value of certain types of worker behaviors, can ultimately save companies from making gross tactical errors and, more positively, can assist management in promoting the organization's long-term economic goals with all the incumbent rewards..","[Tziner, Aharon] Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel; [Birati, Assa] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Tziner, A (通讯作者)，Netanya Acad Coll, Netanya, Israel.",atziner@netanya.ac.il; abirati@walla.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,1,8,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200001,0

The study undertakes an empirical assessment of the main sources of youth unemployment in Africa. Based on panel data of 41 African countries covering the period 2000-2010, the study finds a demographic youth bulge and poor economic growth from both supply and demand sides of the market to be key drivers of youth unemployment in Africa. Employment-to-population ratio as a measure of country's job creation ability and vulnerable employment as a proxy for informality are observed to have had a decreasing effect on youth unemployment. The empirical findings also suggest higher youth employment rates among females than males and a higher concentration in urban than rural areas. Investment in the high labour absorption sectors of agriculture and manufacturing is advocated as job creation strategies, along with population control measures to slow the growing youth population in Africa. High growth in the low employment sectors of mining and extractive industries could serve as resource generating avenues to promote investment in education and skill training, along with infrastructure to facilitate growth in high labour absorption sectors.","[Baah-Boateng, William] Univ Ghana, Legon, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Baah-Boateng, W (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, POB LG 57, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",wbaahboat@post.harvard.edu,"Baah-Boateng, William/IWU-7065-2023","Baah-Boateng, William/0000-0002-2751-9625",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"This article benefited from funding support by the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) based in Nairobi and a version was first presented at the Panel Session of the 40th Biannual Conference of the AERC held in Lusaka, Zambia on 30 November-4 December 2014.",,51,46,52,0,38,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Currently, governmental measures mostly focus on providing financial support, such as direct payments, to forest owners after disasters. However, in the light of more weather extremes, this could lead to a heavier financial burden for national budgets. Therefore, the current financial support system has to be reconsidered with regard to privatizing foresters' risks. Insurance could play a key role, but in many countries forests are rarely insured. In order to explain insurance coverage, we analyzed foresters' preferences regarding fire and storm insurance, which are expressed as their willingness-to-pay (WTP). Therefore, we measured the risk attitude and conducted a discrete choice experiment with 137 German foresters, using various policy and forest enterprise scenarios. Our results show that most foresters have a very low WTP for insurance, and individual risk attitude was not of significant influence. The WTP was higher for fire than for storm insurance, presumably due to liquidity preservation motives. Policy programs involving unconditional support after disaster reduced the WTP. Instead, subsidized insurance premiums increased the WTP and thus, should be considered to establish an efficient insurance market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, higher education institutions often require low-performing students to repeat failed courses, a full term, or even a full year. This paper is the first to investigate the effects of such a (grade) retention policy on student performance in higher education. We study a setting where first-year undergraduates who fall short of a pre-defined performance requirement have to repeat all first-year courses before they can proceed to the second year. To determine the causal effect of retention and repetition on student performance, we apply a sharp regression discontinuity design to administrative data from a Swiss university. Based on a sample of 5000 students, we find that grade retention increases dropout probabilities after the first year by about 10 percentage points. Repetition of a full year persistently boosts grade point averages by about 0.5 standard deviations, but does not affect study pace and major choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of Swedish forestry, participation has mainly been implemented as a top-down venture, without adequate integration of all interests. Linking local interests to national policy-making through participatory action research and future-oriented methodologies has not yet been tried in Sweden. We develop and implement a participatory action research model with the objectives to (i) facilitate a discussion among local stakeholders about their common future in relation to their forested landscapes and, (ii) to connect the local level with the national, institutional level. First, local stakeholders are brought together to create commonly desired visions in case studies of two forested landscapes in Sweden. Second, national policy-makers are engaged in a discussion on how to achieve the locally-desired visions. The ability of the two-step participatory action research model to achieve these objectives is then evaluated based on norms of Communicative Action and criteria of participatory planning. The results demonstrate the positive opportunity to engage local stakeholders in a constructive discussion about their common future, but also show some practical constraints of participatory methods, in particular the risk of institutional authorities disregarding local knowledge and claims.

A household is categorized as unorthodox if its members report that they consume goods that contradict conservative Sunni practices, such as alcohol. This information is then used in female labor force participation estimations. Results show that living in an unorthodox household has a positive and highly significant effect on the probability of married women's labor market participation. For single women, the estimations provide weaker evidence regarding the positive effect of unorthodoxy on the probability of participation in education and the labor force. The study concludes that protection of the rights to follow unorthodox practices in society may bear positive implications with regard to women's agency.","[Kizilca, F.

Utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, 1997, we implement six different sets of instruments based on geographic variation: presence of a four-year or two-year college in the county, inverse log distance to in-state two-year colleges, distance weighted tuition and distance-weighted enrollment at in-state two-year colleges, and inverse log distance to all colleges. We find that these alternative measures yield differing estimates of the impact of educational attainment on earnings. Using our preferred measure of geographic variation, one additional year of postsecondary attainment results in a 9.7% increase in yearly earnings. We find a larger impact of postsecondary attainment for women, and no measurable impact of postsecondary attainment for men. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Of particular interest is the challenge to embed community perspectives in a communication process of climate change solutions. In this paper we argue that 3D interactive simulations using design inquiry as a development process, can be an effective way of communicating climate change solutions and multiple community responses. People are more likely to engage with the challenges associated with complexity of climate change at the local level when their perspectives are integrated into viable and multiple pathways for action. Future scenarios of change processes situated in local experiences in compelling and interactive ways can be disseminated holistically by making links between scientific, social, political, economic and cultural elements. Design inquiry, as a research approach, integrates contextual knowledge into communication processes to aid imagining, re-thinking and reembodying viable pathways that explore the kinds of futures we collectively envision. This paper examines the contributions that design inquiry makes to climate change communication using an interactive simulation environment for designing futures. We discuss these ideas using the example of the Future Delta project, a virtual 3D environment that enables the exploration and simulation of multiple community-based climate change solutions in the Corporation of Delta, British Columbia.

This paper exploits a district policy change that suddenly shifted advanced eighth graders into a virtual classroom for Algebra I. After the policy, higher-ability eighth graders in the treatment district began taking Algebra I in the virtual classroom at rates similar to the statewide average of their peers in traditional classrooms. The change in course delivery provides a unique opportunity to study effects of a virtual course on academic outcomes. The analysis uses variation in program uptake across performance quintile, district, and year in a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach to estimate the causal effect of the virtual course, finding that eighth grade virtual students tend to underperform relative to eighth graders who took Algebra I in a traditional classroom and relative to pre-policy, same-district students who had to take the course in ninth grade.

Through so-called 'Trade & Sustainable Development Chapters', the EU's new generation of regional and bilateral trade agreements include explicit provisions on labour rights promotion, Corporate Social Responsibility and environmental sustainability. While legal scholars have commented extensively on these provisions, little is known about their practical application. With regard to labour rights in particular, the International Labour Organization has noted the lack of empirical evidence on the effects of integrating labour rights provisions in trade agreements. Based on extensive desk research and a series of interviews in Brussels and Bogota, the present article aims to bridge this gap by providing insights into how the practical application of labour provisions and monitoring mechanisms plays out in a particular country context. Our findings identify significant shortcomings in both the design and application of the current sustainability chapters, affecting not only their effectiveness but also the credibility of the EU as a normative actor as a whole.","[Marx, Axel; Lein, Brecht; Brando, Nicolas] Univ Leuven, Leuven Ctr Global Governance Studies, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Marx, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Leuven Ctr Global Governance Studies, Leuven, Belgium.",axel.marx@ggs.kuleuven.be; brecht.lein@ggs.kuleuven.be; nicolas.brando@ggs.kuleuven.be,"Marx, Axel/AFC-1551-2022","Marx, Axel/0000-0003-1474-0539; Brando C., Nicolas/0000-0003-1238-2205",,,,,40,28,28,1,16,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

However, it is unclear whether PBF provides good value for money compared to status quo or other interventions aimed at strengthening the healthcare system in LMICs. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesize the existing literature that examines whether PBF represents an efficient manner of investing resources. We considered PBF to be efficient when improved care quality or quantity was achieved with equal or lower costs, or alternatively, when the same quality of care was achieved using less financial resources. A manual search of the reference lists of two recent systematic reviews on economic evaluations of PBF was conducted to identify articles that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, a search strategy was developed with the help of a librarian. The following databases and search engines were used: PubMed, EconLit, Google Scholar and Google. Experts on economic evaluations were consulted for validation of the selected studies. A total of seven articles from five LMICs were selected for this review. We found the overall strength of the evidence to be weak. None of the articles were full economic evaluations; they did not make clear connections between the costs and effects of PBF. Only one study reported using a randomized controlled trial, but issues with the randomization procedure were reported. Important alternative interventions to strengthen the capacities of the healthcare system have not been considered. Few studies examined the costs and consequences of PBF in the long term. Important costs and consequences were omitted from the evaluations. Few LMICs are represented in the literature, despite wide implementation. Lastly, most articles had at least one author employed by an organization involved in the implementation of PBF, thereby resulting in potential conflicts of interest. Stronger empirical evidence on whether PBF represents good value for money in LMICs is needed.","[Turcotte-Tremblay, Anne-Marie; Ridde, Valery] Univ Montreal, Publ Hlth Res Inst, Off 3060, 7101 Ave Parc, Montreal, PQ H3N 1X9, Canada; [Turcotte-Tremblay, Anne-Marie; Spagnolo, Jessica; Ridde, Valery] Univ Montreal, Sch Publ Hlth, 7101 Ave Parc, Montreal, PQ H3N 1X9, Canada; [Spagnolo, Jessica] Douglas Mental Hlth Univ Inst, 6875 LaSalle Blvd, Montreal, PQ H4H 1R3, Canada; [De Allegri, Manuela] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Med Fac, Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Turcotte-Tremblay, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Publ Hlth Res Inst, Off 3060, 7101 Ave Parc, Montreal, PQ H3N 1X9, Canada.;Turcotte-Tremblay, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Sch Publ Hlth, 7101 Ave Parc, Montreal, PQ H3N 1X9, Canada.",anne-marie.turcotte-tremblay@umontreal.ca,"Ridde, Valery/AAD-2736-2019; ridde, valery/AAV-1016-2020","Ridde, Valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; ridde, valery/0000-0001-9299-8266; De Allegri, Manuela/0000-0002-8677-1337; Spagnolo, Jessica/0000-0002-1125-3121",Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [ROH-115213]; CIHR [CPP-137901],Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS)(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Sante (FRQS)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"AMTT received a training bursary from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).

The analysis focuses on factors leading to variations in inpatient and outpatient costs and excludes fixed costs associated with dialysis, transplant surgery and high cost drugs. Methods Annual costs of inpatient and outpatient hospital episodes for patients starting renal replacement therapy in England were obtained from a large retrospective dataset. Multiple imputation was performed to estimate missing costs due to administrative censoring. Two-part models were developed using logistic regression to first predict the probability of incurring any hospital costs before fitting generalised linear models to estimate the level of cost in patients with positive costs. Separate models were developed to predict inpatient and outpatient costs for each treatment modality. Results Data on hospital costs were available for 15,869 incident dialysis patients and 4511 incident transplant patients. The two-part models showed a decreasing trend in costs with increasing number of years on treatment, with the exception of dialysis outpatient costs. Age did not have a consistent effect on hospital costs; however, comorbidities such as diabetes and peripheral vascular disease were strong predictors of higher hospital costs in all four models. Conclusion Analysis of patient-level data can result in a deeper understanding of factors associated with variations in hospital costs and can improve the accuracy with which costs are estimated in the context of economic evaluations.","[Li, Bernadette; Cairns, John] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Fotheringham, James] Sheffield Kidney Inst, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ravanan, Rommel] Southmead Hosp, Richard Bright Renal Unit, Bristol, Avon, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Southmead Hospital,"Li, B (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",bernadette.li@lshtm.ac.uk,"Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020",,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0109-10116]; Kidney Research UK Clinical Training Fellowship; Kidney Research UK [TF1/2010] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [RP-PG-0109-10116] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [RP-PG-0109-10116] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Kidney Research UK Clinical Training Fellowship(Kidney Research UK (KRUK)); Kidney Research UK(Kidney Research UK (KRUK)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This article presents independent research commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under the Programme Grant for Applied Research (RP-PG-0109-10116) entitled Access to Transplantation and Transplant Outcome Measures (ATTOM).

Firstly, the paper examines the concept of power and the political power of interest groups. Interest groups seek to be able to use their power through Influencing policy outcomes and framing the underlying dimensions that define policy issues. In the next step the paper defines factors of dispositional political power: formal, informal, internal, and external. Formal factors are primarily based constitutionally or legislatively and are ensured through the right to associate and form associations to advocate common interests. Informal factors represent the abilities of interest groups to operate in the political process. Internal factors represent the ability of interest groups to work within the group and external factors represent the behaviour towards other associations, government, non-governmental organisations, etc. Semi-structured questionnaires to former and present FOAs officials were used containing questions about the basic role of FOAs as they can be found in the scientific literature. The crucial internal factor limiting the dispositional power of FOAs is the lack of financial resources for providing services or necessary apparatus, which might strongly hinder the fulfilment and achievement of set goals in policymaking. The disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests also limits FOAs' dispositional power. The most important external factor from the officials' perspective is the disinterest of the state bureaucracy towards non-state forests at the sectoral and cross-sectoral level. There is a common agreement between FOA officials that current strategies and tactics in the form of dialogue are inefficient. FOAs are considered as a partner in policy formulation, but their actual political power is low, due to the disunity among FOA leaders and ineffective strategies and tactics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Survey data were collected from 183 self-selected physicians and linked to administrative databases to capture the provision of services to the patients served for the 12 month period ending June 30, 2013, and the characteristics of the patients at the beginning of the study period. Two stochastic frontier regression models were used to estimate efficiency scores and parameters for two separate outputs: the number of distinct patients seen and the number of visits. Results: Because of missing data, only 165 physicians were included in the analyses. The average efficiency was 0.72 for both outputs with scores varying from 4 % to 93 % for the visits and 5 % to 94 % for the number of patients seen. We observed that there were both very low and very high efficiency scores within each model. These variations were larger than variations in average scores across models.","[laberge, Maude] Univ Florida, Dept Hlth, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Serv Res Management & Policy, 1225 Ctr Dr,Room 3111, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA; [laberge, Maude; Wodchis, Walter P.; Laporte, Audrey] Canadian Ctr Hlth Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wodchis, Walter P.; Barnsley, Jan; Laporte, Audrey] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wodchis, Walter P.; Barnsley, Jan] Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Wodchis, Walter P.] Toronto Rehabil Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; Toronto Rehabilitation Institute,"Laberge, M (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Dept Hlth, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Serv Res Management & Policy, 1225 Ctr Dr,Room 3111, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.;Laberge, M (通讯作者)，Canadian Ctr Hlth Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",maude.laberge@phhp.ufl.edu,,"wodchis, walter/0000-0003-2494-7031",Health System Performance Research Network (HSPRN) - Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care [06034]; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) - Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care,Health System Performance Research Network (HSPRN) - Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) - Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care,This study was supported by the Health System Performance Research Network (HSPRN grant # 06034) and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) which are funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.,,63,11,15,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The interconnection between masculinity and the work, knowledge, forest owners and professionals in the sector contributes to exclusion of women. In response to this, women forest owners have formed networks in different local areas. Through focus group interviews, this study examined the strategies, functions and positions of these networks, both in their individual locations and the overall policy processes of gender mainstreaming of the sector, to scrutinise the reproduction of gender inequities and the gendered notion of forestry. The results show how the networks are acting to expand the discursive space, establish alternative publics and empower their members by inventing and circulating counterdiscourses. The different strategies adopted by the networks appear to have emerged in response to contemporary political processes. The conclusion is that one single public sphere cannot encompass the diversity of the contemporary forestry sector, indicating a need to contain a multiplicity of publics, both to challenge the modes of deliberation that mask domination and to facilitate transformative processes.

The study revealed that the major setback in attaining sustainable forest management does not necessarily lie in the conflicting interests of actors, but also in the social processes that guided the negotiation of these conflicting interests. Processes initiated by bureaucratic institutions did not adequately appreciate the efforts of the existing indigenous structures. The differences in the modelling of social change by the agents of change had negative impacts on governance outcomes and disrupted collaborative actions. This study argues that indigenous structures should not just be regarded as mediators in the processes of forest management. Their actions are influenced by powerful actors (elites). They are thus embedded in complex configurations that can retard sustainable forest management processes. There is a need to carefully explore and understand the various contexts in which these complex configurations influence forest management in order to foster sustainable collaborative management.

We provide a framework highlighting the likelihood of heterogeneity in program effects, depending upon whether recipients are marginal or inframarginal workers. We then utilize a matching approach to estimate the effects of the Federal Work-Study program, leveraging the fact that FWS funding varies across institutions for idiosyncratic reasons. Our results suggest that about half of FWS participants would have worked even in the absence of the subsidy; for these students, FWS reduces hours worked and improves academic outcomes, but has little impact on early post-college employment. For students who would not have worked otherwise, the pattern of effects reverses. Overall, the positive effects are strongest for subgroups who are the least likely to have access to the program, suggesting there may be gains to improved targeting of funds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We wondered whether per-capita rates of admission for ACSCs in France demonstrated geographic variation, were changing, were related to other independent variables, or were comparable to those in other countries; further, we wanted to quantify the resources such admissions consume. Methods We calculated per-capita rates of admission for five categories (chronic, acute, vaccination preventable, alcohol-related, and other) of ACSCs in 94 departments in mainland France in 2009 and 2010, examined measures and causes of geographic variation in those rates, computed the costs of those admissions, and compared rates of admission for ACSCs in France to those in several other countries. Results The highest ACSC admission rates generally occurred in the young and the old, but rates varied across French regions. Over the 2-year period, rates of most categories of ACSCs increased; higher ACSC admission rates were associated with lower incomes and a higher supply of hospital beds. We found that the local supply of general practitioners was inversely associated with rates of chronic and total ACSC admission rates, but that this relationship disappeared if we accounted for patients' use of general practitioners in neighboring departments. ACSC admissions cost 4.755 billion euros in 2009 and 5.066 billion euros in 2010; they consumed 7.86 and 8.74 million bed days of care, respectively. France had higher rates of ACSC admissions than most other countries examined. Conclusions Because admissions for ACSCs are generally considered a failure of outpatient care, cost French taxpayers substantial monetary and hospital resources, and appear to occur more frequently in France than in other countries, policymakers should prioritize targeted efforts to reduce them.","[Weeks, William B.] 35 Centerra Pkwy, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA; [Weeks, William B.] Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Hanover, NH USA; [Ventelou, Bruno; Paraponaris, Alain] Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, INSERM, SESSTIM,UMR 912, Marseille, France; [Weeks, William B.; Ventelou, Bruno; Paraponaris, Alain] Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France",Dartmouth College; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Weeks, WB (通讯作者)，35 Centerra Pkwy, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA.;Weeks, WB (通讯作者)，Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Hanover, NH USA.;Weeks, WB (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France.",wbw@dartmouth.edu; bruno.ventelou@inserm.fr; alain.paraponaris@inserm.fr,"Weeks, WB/G-7436-2014","Paraponaris, Alain/0000-0001-8281-8305; Weeks, William/0000-0002-9918-1360",,,,,47,42,47,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This article investigates whether the observed gender gap is due to the related gender inequality in social institutions, which affects women's daily life and deprives them of social and economic empowerment inside and outside the home. Using Afrobarometer survey data (rounds 2 [2002-3], 3 [2004-5], and 4 [2008-9]), the study finds that the gender difference in support for democracy is no longer significant once gender discrimination is controlled for in the family code, physical integrity, or civil liberties components of the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI). Interaction terms show that women's support for democracy is only lower in places where gender inequality in these social institutions is particularly large. This study thus provides evidence that women who live in countries with favorable institutions toward women are more supportive of democracy than women who do not.","[Konte, Maty] United Nations Univ, UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Maastricht University; University of Gottingen,"Konte, M (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ, UNU MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands.;Klasen, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",konte@merit.unu.edu; sklasen@uni-goettingen.de,,,UNU-MERIT; UNU-WIDER,UNU-MERIT; UNU-WIDER,"We would like to thank Tony Addison, Cecilia Garcia-Penalosa, Seif Dendir, and James Thurlow for their helpful comments.

The paper places these gender dynamics within the context of socioeconomic changes during the last thirty years and investigates how gender inequality became assimilated into both official and popular discourses of Chinese life, thereby facilitating the ascendancy and power of the sexual economy.","[Zurndorfer, Harriet] Leiden Univ, LIAS, SAS China, Fac Humanities, Arsenaalstr 1, NL-2311 CT Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Zurndorfer, H (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, LIAS, SAS China, Fac Humanities, Arsenaalstr 1, NL-2311 CT Leiden, Netherlands.",h.zurndorfer@kpnplanet.nl,,,,,,,84,56,59,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Using panel data from annual household surveys and data on health insurers' premiums and quality ratings over the period 2006-2012, we estimate a random effects logit model of people's switching decisions. We find that switching propensities depend on health plan price and quality, and on people's age, health, education and having supplementary or group insurance. Young people (18-35 years) are more sensitive to price, whereas older people are more sensitive to quality. Searching for health plan information has a much stronger impact on peoples' sensitivity to price than to service quality. In addition, searching for health plan information has a stronger impact on the switching propensity of higher than lower educated people, suggesting that higher educated people make better use of available health plan information. Finally, having supplementary insurance significantly reduces older people's switching propensity.","[Boonen, Lieke H. H.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with histiocytosis from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, the UK, and Sweden. Data on demographic characteristics, health resource utilisation, informal care, loss of labour productivity and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire. A total of 134 patients (35 France, 32 Germany, 30 Italy, 24 Spain, 7 Bulgaria, 4 UK and 2 Sweden) completed the questionnaire. The average annual costs ranged from a,not sign 6832 to a,not sign 33,283 between countries, the year of reference being 2012. Estimated direct healthcare costs ranged from a,not sign 1698 to a,not sign 18,213; direct nonhealthcare costs ranged from a,not sign 2936 to a,not sign 17,622 and labour productivity losses ranged from a,not sign 1 to a,not sign 8855. The mean EQ-5D score for adult histiocytosis patients was estimated at between 0.32 and 0.85, and the mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale score was estimated at between 50.00 and 66.50. The main strengths of this study lie in our bottom-up approach to costing and in the evaluation of histiocytosis patients from a broad perspective (societal costs). This type of analysis is very scarce in international literature for rare diseases in comparison with other illnesses. We conclude that histiocytosis patients incur considerable societal costs and experience substantial deterioration in HRQOL.","[Iskrov, Georgi; Stefanov, Rumen] Inst Rare Dis, Plovdiv 4023, Bulgaria; [Astigarraga, Itziar] BioCruces Hlth Res Inst, Hosp Univ Cruces, Dept Pediat, Bizkaia, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera Reina, Toledo, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Red Investigacin Servicios Sanitarios Enfermedade, Madrid, Spain; [Linertova, Renata] Fundacin Canaria Investigacin Sanitaria FUNCANIS, Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; [Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Evaluat & Planning Serv, Canary Islands Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz de La Palma, CA, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] SpainRDR CIBERER, Inst Rare Dis Res, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; [Schieppati, Arrigo] Centro Ric Cliniche Malattie Rare Aldo Cele Dacc, Ist Ric Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Ranica, Bergamo, Italy; [Taruscio, Domenica] Natl Ctr Rare Dis, Ist Superiore SanitA ISS, Rome, Italy; [Pentek, Marta] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Schulenburg, Johann Matthias Graf von der] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Hannover, Germany; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy & LSE Hlth, London, England; [Chevreul, Karine] URC Eco Ile France, AP HP, Htel Dieu, Paris, France; [Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Fattore, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, Milan, Italy; [Iskrov, Georgi; Stefanov, Rumen] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Publ Hlth, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Chevreul, Karine] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] INSERM, ECEVE, F-U1123 Paris, France",Hospital Universitario Cruces; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERER; Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); Corvinus University Budapest; Leibniz University Hannover; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Bocconi University; Medical University Plovdiv; Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm),"Iskrov, G (通讯作者)，Inst Rare Dis, Plovdiv 4023, Bulgaria.",iskrov@raredis.org,"Astigarraga, I/I-1215-2014; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; chevreul, karine/AAN-2380-2020; Posada, Manuel/C-3832-2008; Stefanov, Rumen/W-7961-2019; Iskrov, Georgi/AAO-2925-2021; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Taruscio, Domenica/A-6646-2015","Astigarraga, I/0000-0002-5012-0137; Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Posada, Manuel/0000-0002-8372-4180; Stefanov, Rumen/0000-0003-3587-7278; Iskrov, Georgi/0000-0002-0988-0062; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252; FATTORE, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-6545-2110; Taruscio, Domenica/0000-0001-5403-233X",Social Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union [A101205],Social Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union,"Supported by the Social Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project, which has received funding from the European Union in the framework of the Health Programme [grant A101205].

We believe virtually all of the deficiencies noted by the Panel could be easily addressed with minor changes to MOFCOM practices. The real significance of this dispute lies in what it tell us about the larger trade policy dance between the US and China. On the one hand, with the series of related WTO disputes the US has demonstrated that China must comply with WTO rules. The more vexing challenge, however, is the apparent tit-for-tat motivation for this and other recent Chinese trade policies, and on this point this dispute does little to change the calculus. The prospective nature of WTO relief makes it almost impossible for the WTO to discourage the type of opportunistic protectionist actions exemplified by this case.","[Mitchell, Andrew D.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Prusa, Thomas J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA",University of Melbourne; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Mitchell, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.;Prusa, TJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA.",a.mitchell@unimelb.edu.au; prusa@rutgers.edu,"Mitchell, Andrew D/AAO-3714-2021","Mitchell, Andrew D/0000-0001-8399-8563",,,,,13,9,9,1,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2016,15.0,2,,,,,303,325,,10.1017/S1474745615000749,0.0,,,23,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GM,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372461000008,0

The objective of this article is to examine the relationship among firms' technological capability-building process, indigenous institutions, and the evolution of a particular technological trajectory within the PPI. To meet this objective, this article draws on a case study design based on primary and long-term evidence gathered through extensive fieldwork in Brazil. This article shows that (1) Brazil's PPI began by developing technological capabilities in long-fiber technology led by global leaders; instead of moving on a subsequent path-following trajectory, these firms accumulated innovative capabilities that led to the development of the short-fiber trajectory; (2) these capabilities initially permitted the implementation of incremental changes in forestry and process technologies, which evolved into sophisticated R & D; and (3) indigenous institutions shaped this trajectory by providing firms with human capital and research support, funding for production and initial innovative capability development, and IPO and entry into export markets. These capabilities and institutions were effective in developing a technological trajectory that enabled Brazil's PPI to achieve an internationally leading position in this industry; however, new capabilities and institutional arrangements are needed to support Brazil's PPI firms' incipient diversification and to mitigate self-reinforcement. This article shows that innovative capability building combined with effective indigenous institutions enable firms even those from a late-industrializing country to create a new technological trajectory. Given the innovation opportunities in the PPI, managers and policy makers should not be satisfied with their achievements; rather, they should be alert to innovative new entrants and explore novel technologically advanced paths.

HC services include Home Health Care (HHC) and Homemaking/Personal Support (HMPS), distinction rarely seen in the literature. This paper argues that it is important to distinguish between these types of HC, since the factors that drive the likelihood of the receipt of each type of care may differ, and also to investigate the interrelationship between them. We explored the interrelationship between receipt of publicly funded HMPS and HHC, and the determinants of the receipt of each type of services. A Panel Two-Stage Residual Inclusion approach was applied to estimate the likelihood of the receipt of HC services using data for those aged 65 and over from 9 biannual waves of the Canadian National Population Health Survey (1994-95 to 2010-11). We found that there are in fact differences in the determinants of the likelihood of HHC and HMPS receipt. Moreover, receipt of publicly funded HMPS was found to be complementary with receipt of publicly funded HHC services after adjusting for functional and health status. Dependence on help with activities of daily living, health status, household arrangement, and income were found to be determinants of the propensity to receive both publicly funded HHC and HMPS services. This study aims to contribute to the existent literature by taking a step toward explicitly modelling the potential interaction between the determinants of the receipt of different types of HC services simultaneously, as a system. Our methodological approach, a Panel Two-Stage Residual Inclusion method, seems to effectively address problems that are known to be a source of bias in the literature.","[Mery, Gustavo; Wodchis, Walter P.; Laporte, Audrey] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Hlth Sci Bldg,155 Coll St,Suite 425, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada; [Mery, Gustavo; Wodchis, Walter P.; Laporte, Audrey] Canadian Ctr Hlth Econ, 155 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada",University of Toronto,"Mery, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Hlth Sci Bldg,155 Coll St,Suite 425, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada.;Mery, G (通讯作者)，Canadian Ctr Hlth Econ, 155 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5T 3M6, Canada.",gustavo.mery@utoronto.ca,,"wodchis, walter/0000-0003-2494-7031; Mery, Gustavo/0000-0002-3629-7470",Health System Performance Research Network (MOHLTC) [06034]; Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) [84310],Health System Performance Research Network (MOHLTC); Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),This work was supported by funding from the Health System Performance Research Network (MOHLTC Grant No. 06034) and by a grant from the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR grant 84310).

Several proxies for this unobserved variable are considered, including a newly proposed one based on a factor model. We focus on identifying periods of prolonged interventions and identify its key macro-financial determinants. Two broad conclusions emerge from the stylized facts and the econometric evidence. First, the best protection against costly reserves accumulation is a more flexible exchange rate. Second, the necessity to accumulate reserves as a bulwark against goods price inflation is misplaced. Instead, there is a strong link between asset price movements and the likelihood of accumulating foreign exchange reserves that are costly. Policy implications are also drawn.","[Filardo, Andrew J.] Bank Int Settlements, Basel, Switzerland; [Siklos, Pierre L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Bank for International Settlements (BIS); Wilfrid Laurier University,"Siklos, PL (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, 75 Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",psiklos@wlu.ca,,,,,,,73,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The intermediate role of puzzling and powering in tackling wicked problems,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLICY; GOVERNANCE,"In this paper we analyze how the process of visioning about 'wicked' long-term policy issues developed as a result of co-evolving processes of framing, puzzling and powering. In this article we discuss a case of cross-border joint visioning on multipurpose land use planning in a multi-stakeholder process on the transboundary river Scheldt, whose estuary is shared by the Netherlands and Belgium, in which three different rounds can be distinguished, showing a different logic to organizing the processes of framing, puzzling and powering when the focus on the long term diminishes. This analysis helps us move beyond an often naive perspective of beyond multi-stakeholder processes. We conclude that productive interaction between framing, puzzling and powering is more easily realized in situations of drafting a long-term vision, compared to situations in which long-term visions have to be translated in shorter-run implementation projects.

Thus, TFP growth captures technical change and the overall efficiency. The main contribution of this study to the literature is the following. TFP dynamics may be examined as the autoregressive distributed lag model, but different sets of the key indicators should be used to assess the determinants of TFP growth in various groups of countries.

Solutions: What is practical and relevant to meet their needs? 3. Key Message: What do people need to know to make a change? 4. Message Form and Delivery: How can the message best be packaged and delivered? 5. Evaluation: How can each step be improved?

While the teaching of this model is made up of a variety of tools and techniques, the success of the model relies on following its own tenants, including effective communication via a Key Message.

When describing communication culture, it is all about communication and organisational culture as two closely linked aspects in any business organisation. It is important how these two phenomena operate in the organisation. This study will look at satisfaction with communication and knowledge sharing habits as organisational culture values in the organisation. Communication satisfaction is defined as satisfaction with information flow and with mutual relationships among the members of organisation. Whereas, knowledge sharing occurs when organisational members share organisationally relevant information, suggestions, ideas and expertise with one another. Tasks of the study were to explore on the basis of the review of scientific sources and study how satisfaction with communication affects knowledge sharing in the organisation from the point of view of employees and supervisors. For this particular study, the questionnaire is selected as the most appropriate data collection method for high-quality research. To obtain the data required for the study, quantitative research was carried out regarding the communication satisfaction and knowledge sharing in Latvian companies, interviewing both employees (N=46) and supervisors (N=32) from 29 different companies. The Communication Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) was developed by Downs and Hazen in an attempt to discover the relationship between communication and job satisfaction. Knowledge sharing was measured using Cummings' knowledge sharing scale. The level of employees' satisfaction with communication is an important factor and closely related to the question whether employees feel valued on the part of management and on the whole organisation. Analysing the results of supervisors' responses, it can be concluded that among the selected parameters, there is a negative correlation on the whole. A statistically significant negative correlation exists between intragroup knowledge sharing and satisfaction with communication (r=-0.510, alpha=0.01). Likewise, a weak negative correlation is observed between the knowledge sharing and satisfaction with communication (r=-0.386, alpha=0.01). When estimating the results of employees' responses in the context of research, significant relationships appear among knowledge sharing and satisfaction with communication. A significant moderately strong correlation exists among intragroup knowledge sharing and satisfaction with communication (r=0.471, alpha=0.05) Communication is vital to create and maintain relationships as well as the ability to communicate effectively.

Due to this development, a number of permanent stores must consider the possibility to sell their goods and services through online distribution channels. Parallel on-line and off-line distribution channels integrate and form one multi-channel system or omni-channel system. Multi-channel distribution and the use of alternative retail forms emphasize demands for the logistics complexity. Therefore, modern distribution and logistic systems must follow innovative marketing approaches. In terms of methodology, by analyzing logistic solutions and focusing research on the e-commerce, we define the key aspects of logistics for multi-channel distribution or for online stores. Logistics plays a key role in the multi-channel distribution. Integration of physical and informational flows of on-line and off-line channels is one of the key elements to achieve successfully functioning multi-channel business operation. Presumably, logistics is one of the key elements in creating value for the customer, so its role in the multi-channel distribution is of great importance.

It was during the formation of double-entry bookkeeping, when emergence of the main elements of modern accounting took place and understanding the need to reflect the results of the impairment of assets in accounting appeared, and that determined the main purpose of the research deep analysis of the archival material in order to identify the facts of depreciation charging, determination of the specific algorithm for calculating the depreciation charging and the order of depreciation reflection in accounting. The discovery of four different examples of depreciation charging in the accounts of double-entry bookkeeping, two of them belonging to the end of the 12th early 13th centuries, can be introduced as the result of the research. Equally important, a uniform method of assets impairment accounting did not exist; using the data from the medieval archives, the authors were able to identify two different methods: assets impairment accounting; algorithm for linear distribution of assets value according to the periods of useful life.

Specifically, the report focuses on the damage caused by the disaster that occurred on March 11, 2011 and the subsequent recovery process. These related disasters resulted in approximately 20,000 deaths, destruction of many towns and cities, disruption to communications and flooding of approximately 23,600 ha of farmland. More than 270,000 people are still living in temporary accommodation, because the ground level needs to be raised before construction of new towns can commence. The earthquake and tsunami also caused a nuclear meltdown at the nuclear power plants located in Fukushima Prefecture. The Asian Horticultural Congress, to be held in Tsukuba in 2012, had to be cancelled. The main reduction in agricultural and horticultural production was observed in the Fukushima Prefecture. Subsequently, the Japanese government constructed new greenhouses furnished with large-scale advanced technology for vegetable and fruit production, particularly in this region. New technology includes robotic management and harvesting of strawberries. The daily lives of the Japanese people are becoming more stable as recovery progresses.","[Kanahama, K.] Tohoku Univ, Fac Agr, Aoba Ku, Tsutsumidori Amamiyamachi 1-1, Sendai, Miyagi 9818555, Japan",Tohoku University,"Kanahama, K (通讯作者)，Tohoku Univ, Fac Agr, Aoba Ku, Tsutsumidori Amamiyamachi 1-1, Sendai, Miyagi 9818555, Japan.",,,"Worsley, Anthony/0000-0002-4635-6059",,,,,0,0,0,1,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-36-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1126.0,,,,,,43,50,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1126.5,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BI1PC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406635200005,0

The predictive model is based on the financial and non-financial indicators of Estonian municipalities for the years 2004-2014 and the risk of encountering financial difficulties is defined as the value of the variable primary operating outcome to depreciation of tangible fixed assets of the population over the years 2011-2014. The classification accuracy of the discriminant model comprising seven independent variables found as a result of the analysis is 88% and the same indicator for the logit model is 87%. The variable with the highest descriptive capacity in predicting the risk of encountering financial difficulties is the ratio of primary operating outcome to the primary operating revenues.

On one hand there has been sustained economic growth, but on the other growing inequality (D'Costa, Ray in this volume). Redressing these inequalities is the key development challenge now facing India. A key dimension of this transformation has been a shift of the centre of gravity of the economy to the manufacturing and especially services sectors, creating a huge and growing urban middle class, increasingly cut off from the agrarian traditions of their forebears. Nevertheless, agriculture remains the main livelihood of over half the population, and India is still a major agricultural producer. The challenge of redressing this specific imbalance is the focus of this chapter. Since the 1960s, agriculture has itself been transformed technologically and economically. The results have ranged from the growth of successful multinational corporations to multi-suicides of small farmers, from new commercial crops to environmental degradation. Indian agriculture is now poised between two futures-one of increasing technology-driven intensification and integration into national and global markets-the other a neo-Gandhian vision of local communities renewed by ecologically based forms of small-fanning producing for more local consumption. This chapter reflects on the development challenge posed by this critical moment, through the lens of a point where these alternative visions meet and interact-the dynamic border-zone between the irrigated plains and the foothills and valleys of the Himalayas, where old varieties and practices meet global export markets.","[MacRae, Graeme] Massey Univ, Anthropol, Auckland, New Zealand",Massey University,"MacRae, G (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Anthropol, Auckland, New Zealand.",graememacrae@gmail.com,,"Macrae, Graeme/0000-0003-2323-1314",,,,,47,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,107,129,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_6,0.0,,,23,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800006,0

The aim of research, presented in the paper, is to evaluate the impact of subsidies and support measures, inter alia, sub-measures, under Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 for encouraging bioenergy production on sustainable rural development. For example, to assess job creation and preserved work places; to evaluate further sustainability regarding the principles and framework of latest European Union legislation and guidelines in the sphere of renewables. The appropriate qualitative and quantitative research methods have been used in the process of study, using the data from different databases. Only impact in the primary sector and several activities in the secondary sector (e.g. chipping, operation of pellet mills, operation of biogas plants etc.) have been evaluated. The main socioeconomic impacts, such as the establishing enterprises (e.g. biogas plants), creation of new jobs, have been investigated. The support under RDP for encouraging entrepreneurship and diversification into non-agricultural activities have been granted for existing enterprises (i.e. microenterprises), agricultural farms and for founding and development of new enterprises. The findings of research show that there are both the benefits and shortcomings or some negative effects. Despite the support for the bioenergy projects, having provided new jobs and retaining the existing ones in rural areas, the cost of new jobs is comparatively high. The sub-measure of RDP 2007-2013 Support for energy production from agricultural and forestry biomass is the least effective (i.e. capital intensive) from the point of view of creating jobs. On the other hand, the sub-measure Support for creation and development of micro-enterprises is most productive in terms of net job creation (the average amount of investment per job created is the smallest).","[Melece, Ligita; Krievina, Agnese] Inst Agr Resources & Econ, Riga, Latvia",Institute of Agricultural Resources & Economics,"Melece, L (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Resources & Econ, Riga, Latvia.",,"Melece, Ligita/AAZ-6705-2020","Melece, Ligita/0000-0002-3120-3711",National Research Programme Innovation and Sustainable Development (SUSTINNO); Latvian Council of Science [448/2012],National Research Programme Innovation and Sustainable Development (SUSTINNO); Latvian Council of Science(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science),This research has been funded by the National Research Programme Innovation and Sustainable Development (SUSTINNO) and by the Latvian Council of Science (Grant Project No 448/2012).,,10,2,2,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,101,108,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200013,0

The results show that accounting for recreational benefits leads to the formation of the grand coalition, whereas only partial cooperation occurs when payoffs are confined to profits from commercial fisheries.","[Oinonen, Soile] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, POB 140, FIN-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Gronbaek, Lone] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Laukkanen, Marita] VATT Inst Econ Res, POB 1279, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Levontin, Polina] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Silwood Pk Campus, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Lindroos, Marko; Nieminen, Emmi; Parkkila, Katja] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pintassilgo, Pedro] Univ Algarve, Fac Econ, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Pintassilgo, Pedro] Univ Algarve, Res Ctr Spatial & Org Dynam, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Pulkkinen, Henni; Romakkaniemi, Atso] Univ Oulu, Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 413, Oulu 90014, Finland",Finnish Environment Institute; University of Southern Denmark; VATT Institute for Economic Research; Imperial College London; University of Helsinki; Universidade do Algarve; Universidade do Algarve; University of Oulu; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Oinonen, S (通讯作者)，Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, POB 140, FIN-00251 Helsinki, Finland.",soile.m.oinonen@ymparisto.fi; lg@sam.sdu.dk; marita.laukkanen@vatt.fi; levontin@hotmail.com; marko.lindroos@helsinld.fi; emmi.e.nieminen@helsinki.fi; katja.parkldla@helsinki.fi; ppintas@ualg.pt; henni.pulkkinen@luke.fi; atso.romakkaniemi@luke.fi,"Levontin, Polina/AAG-7070-2019; Oinonen, Soile/ITV-1351-2023; Lindroos, Marko/B-7966-2015; Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/H-5848-2019","Levontin, Polina/0000-0001-8229-4054; Oinonen, Soile/0000-0002-0793-1858; Pintassilgo, Pedro Miguel/0000-0001-9115-4301; Lindroos, Marko/0000-0002-9351-6115; Laukkanen, Marita/0000-0003-3189-189X; Gronbaek, Lone/0000-0002-9022-378X",Academy of Finland's Research Programme on Sustainable Governance of Aquatic Resources; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [BSAB/105744/2014],Academy of Finland's Research Programme on Sustainable Governance of Aquatic Resources; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work was conducted as part of the Economics of Aquatic Food Webs project, funded by the Academy of Finland's Research Programme on Sustainable Governance of Aquatic Resources.

In its essence, business constitutes processing economic resources with the aim of achieving certain entrepreneurial goals (profits, goods, services). The resources of a business process constitute a set of means required to be used in entrepreneurial activity i.e. in the production, creation, sales of goods or services, and the management of these processes. For this reason, the resources of a business process are the sources and prerequisites of achieving entrepreneurial goals, the constituent elements that turn opportunities into tangible results [2]. Sensible business process resource management involves employing sufficient resources to achieve the goals set, rationally combining them in production force, distributing them in a balanced and reasoned way in order to secure an income (profit) in excess of the costs associated with obtaining such resources. In turn the lasting competitive advantages of a company are largely the result of interaction of elements within a rather complex structure of resources providing for entrepreneurial activity. This defines the relevance of studying how changes in resources provision influence business development tendencies and modify management patterns in services companies.","[Plotnikov, Vladimir A.; Volkova, Albina A.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Plotnikov, VA (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Plotnikov, Vladimir/A-4854-2014",,Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools [NSH-9726.2016.6],Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools(Leading Scientific Schools Program),This article was prepared within the Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools NSH-9726.2016.6 The implementation of state economic policy through the development of tools of strategic and indicative planning.,,12,1,1,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,573,580,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100075,0

In this research, we take a global approach and investigate the impact of a country's exports importance at a macroeconomic level for its economic growth through the Linear mixed-effects method(LMM). We include 186 countries in our analysis and find that generally there is statistically significant evidence that the level of aggregate exports affects economic growth, but this relationship is both time and country specific. Thus, although countries that employ policies to encourage exports experience higher economic growth, on average, this positive relationship is stronger in some countries than in others, and even absent or negative in some instances. For a more thorough analysis, we also identify the group of developed G7 countries and that of developing CEE economies and estimate the relationship in comparative perspective. Results confirm that the positive impact of exports on growth is generally higher for CEE countries, for which exports seem to be the main factor to exert a positive influence on growth as opposed to the developed G7 economies, which seem to depend more on investments for growth.","[Popa, Ioan; Tudor, Cristiana; Belu, Mihaela; Paraschiv, Dorel] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tudor, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ioan.popa.rei@gmail.com; cristiana.tudor@net.ase.ro; belumihaela@gmail.com; dorel.paraschiv@ase.ro,"Belu, Mihaela/I-1104-2013; Mihaela, Belu/HPE-6574-2023; Tudor, Cristiana/AGZ-0508-2022; tudor, cristiana/A-2705-2010; Popa, Ioan/D-2816-2015; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/O-9071-2016","Belu, Mihaela/0000-0001-7631-6798; Tudor, Cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666; tudor, cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666; Paraschiv, Dorel Mihai/0000-0002-4559-3466","CNCS-UEFISCDI [IDEI 303, PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593]","CNCS-UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","This research was supported by CNCS-UEFISCDI, Project number IDEI 303, code PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593.",,20,1,1,0,5,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

An original conceptual framework is developed to analyse how the logic of journalism is enacted vis-a-vis that of advertising in a setting in which an old technology for news production - print newspaper - coexists with a new one - website - and thus encounters between new and old technological possibilities make workings of institutional logics particularly visible. The findings point out different mechanisms of institutional work dealing with actions that, made possible by new technological possibilities, are potentially, but not necessarily classified as divergent from institutional logics.","[Raviola, Elena] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Raviola, Elena] Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Dubini, Paola] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Via Roengen 1, I-20100 Milan, Italy",Copenhagen Business School; University of Gothenburg; Bocconi University,"Raviola, E (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark.;Raviola, E (通讯作者)，Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, Gothenburg, Sweden.",er.ioa@cbs.dk,,,,,,,93,5,5,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

In such scenarios, due to the high levels of fear associated with radioactivity, citizens were frequently shown to lose their trust in the authorities. While previously only the nuclear companies and the national authorities had the possibility to collect and publish fairly accurate radioactivity environment levels, the advancements associated with the Internet of Things - IoT, such as the introduction of internet-connected microcontroller based boards, coupled with the development of cheap radiation sensors is making it possible for regular citizens to collect their own radiation measurements. The present paper proposes such a solution that uses the Pocket Geiger radiameter and the Arduino UNO board in order to collect radiation data. Our proposal is based on the device-gateway communication model of the Internet Society. Moreover, the collected measurements can easily be shared in real-time with fellow citizens using Twitter or stored in the cloud for further analysis.","[Roxin, Ioan] Univ Franche Comte, Montbeliard, France; [Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Darastean, Horia; Stan, Alexandra] Univ Oradea, Oradea, Romania",Universite de Franche-Comte; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Oradea,"Roxin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Franche Comte, Montbeliard, France.",ioan-roxin@univ-fcomte.fr; liviu.cotfas@ase.ro; darahoriam@yahoo.com; ale_stan@yahoo.com,"Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian/D-2317-2009","Cotfas, Liviu-Adrian/0000-0002-4192-183X",,,,,19,0,0,0,6,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,38,44,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300007,0

It demonstrates how the literature on this subject for the past 20 years has developed into a distinct research field and the article sketches a set of different methodological approaches as well as geographical and thematical variations within the field. In particular, the overview points to a recent shift in focus from a preoccupation with the identity-cultivating qualities of monetary organization to an emphasis on how collective identities legitimize monetary organization. Based on the literature review, the article points to two underdeveloped themes for future research to investigate: (1) further studies on the interrelation between the legitimacy of monetary organization and national identity, (2) an increased focus on central banks and monetary authorities, as well as the historical development in which monetary organization evolved in concert with ideas of the national identity and nationalism.","[Sorensen, Anders Ravn] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Sorensen, AR (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",ars.mpp@cbs.dk,,,,,,,82,5,6,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Firstly, two common clustering algorithms and three supervised learning algorithms are tested by real world data of a Chinese clothing company. The results indicate that the supervised algorithms perform better, which illustrates potential correlation between adjacent selling periods. Secondly, the correlate factors and attribute weight are estimated using principal component analysis (PCA). After that, a group of multi-factor weighted K-means algorithms are proposed and tested on the data set. The results show that a three-factor weighed algorithm has better performance than the others, which can make full use of the correlation factors between adjacent sales periods, therefore promises an 80% overall accurate classification rate.","[Zheng, Jia-zhou] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,"Zheng, JZ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhengjiazhou_eric@163.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-368-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,427,432,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BF8YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385266400077,0

Evidence from a natural experiment,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Teaching quality; Student evaluation; Student grade; Hedonic value of grade surplus; Psychological reward-penalty,GRADING LENIENCY; RATINGS; VALIDITY; GRADES,"This article analyzes the behavior of students in a college classroom with regard to their evaluation of teacher performance. As some students are randomly able to see their grades prior to the evaluation, the natural experiment provides a unique opportunity for testing the hypothesis as to whether there exists a possibility of a hedonic (implicit) exchange between the students' grades and teaching evaluations. Students with good grades tend to highly rate the teaching quality of their instructors, in comparison with those who receive relatively poor grades. This study finds that students with better grades than their expected grades provide a psychological gift to their teachers by giving a higher teacher evaluation, whereas it is the opposite with those students receiving lower grades than their expectation. These empirical results demonstrate that a previous interpretation on the effect of student grades in an incumbent course with regard to the teaching quality may have to be somewhat discounted.

Objective This study assessed whether baseline comorbidities present in 2,594 patients with AD participating in two semagacestat randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) would significantly impact overall costs. Methods Resource utilization was captured using the Resource Utilization in Dementia Scale-Lite. Comorbidities and concomitant medications were tabulated via patient and caregiver reports. Only baseline data were analyzed. Direct and indirect costs per month were calculated per patient. The relationship between cost and explanatory variables was explored in a regression model. Results The baseline monthly cost of care in this RCT population was 1,147 pound +/- 2,483, with informal care costs accounting for 75 % of costs. Gender, age, and functional status were significant predictors of costs (p <= 0.0001). The cost ratio was not impacted when the number of comorbidities was added to the model (cost ratio = 0.95; 95 % CI 0.91-0.99) or when combined with the number of concomitant medications (cost ratio = 0.97; 95 % CI 0.95-1.00). Inconsistent findings related to the impact of individual comorbidities on costs were noted in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions The number of comorbidities, alone or when combined with concomitant medications, did not impact baseline costs of care, perhaps because RCTs often enroll less severely ill and more medically stable patients. However, higher costs were consistently associated with greater functional impairment similar to non-RCT databases. Supplemental sources (e.g., claims databases) are likely needed to better estimate the effects of disease and treatment on costs of illness captured in RCTs for AD.","[Kahle-Wrobleski, Kristin] Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Fillit, Howard] Alzheimers Drug Discovery Fdn, New York, NY USA; [Fillit, Howard] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Kurlander, Jonathan] Optum, Eden Prairie, MN USA; [Reed, Catherine; Belger, Mark] Eli Lilly & Co Ltd, Windlesham, Surrey, England",Eli Lilly; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Optum; Eli Lilly,"Kahle-Wrobleski, K (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",wrobleski_kristin_kahle@lilly.com,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"These studies and the preparation of this paper were funded in full by Eli Lilly and Company.

Medicare Advantage, a principal example of selection in the literature, is, however, subject to anti-selection regulations. Because selection causes economic inefficiency and because the historically favorable selection into Medicare Advantage plans increased government cost, the effectiveness of the anti-selection regulations is an important policy question, especially since the Medicare Advantage program has grown to comprise 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, similar anti-selection regulations are being used in health insurance exchanges for those under 65. Contrary to earlier work, we show that the strengthened anti-selection regulations that Medicare introduced starting in 2004 markedly reduced government overpayment attributable to favorable selection in Medicare Advantage. At least some of the remaining selection is plausibly related to fixed plan characteristics of Traditional Medicare versus Medicare Advantage rather than changed selection strategies by Medicare Advantage plans.","[Newhouse, Joseph P.; Price, Mary; Mcwilliams, J.

A systematic review of the literature published in English or Spanish was performed by electronically searching MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, NHS-EED, and EconLit. Some keywords were implantable cardioverter defibrillator, heart failure, heart arrest, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, syncope, sudden death. Selection criteria were the following: (1) full economic evaluations published after 1995, model-based studies or alongside clinical trials (2) that explored the cost-effectiveness of ICD with or without associated treatment compared with placebo or best medical treatment, (3) in adult patients for primary or secondary prevention of SCD because of ventricular arrhythmias. Studies that fulfilled these criteria were reviewed and data were extracted by two reviewers. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed and a narrative synthesis was prepared. In total, 24 studies were included: seven studies on secondary prevention and 18 studies on primary prevention. Seven studies were performed in Europe. For secondary prevention, the results showed that the ICD is considered cost-effective in patients with more risk. For primary prevention, the cost-effectiveness of ICD has been widely studied, but uncertainty about its cost-effectiveness remains. The cost-effectiveness ratios vary between studies depending on the patient characteristics, methodology, perspective, and national settings. Among the European studies, the conclusions are varied, where the ICD is considered cost-effective or not dependent on the study.","[Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Pinilla-Dominguez, Pilar; Linertova, Renata] SESCS, Santa Cruz De Tenerife 38109, Canary Islands, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Linertova, Renata] Fdn Canaria Invest & Salud FUNCIS, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Linertova, Renata; Imaz-Iglesia, Inaki] Red Invest Serv Salud Enfermedades Cron REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Lidia; Linertova, Renata] Univ La Laguna, Ctr Invest Biomed Canarias CIBICAN, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain; [Pinilla-Dominguez, Pilar] CIBERESP, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Quintana, Antonio; Caballero-Dorta, Eduardo] Hosp Univ Gran Canaria Dr Negrin, Serv Cardiol, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain; [Javier Garcia-Garcia, F.] Hosp Univ Nuestra Senora Candelaria, Unidad Calidad & Seguridad Paciente, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain; [Imaz-Iglesia, Inaki] ISCIII, AETS, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Agencia de Evaluacion de Tecnologias Sanitarias (AETS),"García-Pérez, L (通讯作者)，SESCS, Camino Candelaria 44,1a Planta, Santa Cruz De Tenerife 38109, Canary Islands, Spain.",lidia.garciaperez@sescs.es,"García-Pérez, Lidia/C-6364-2011; Imaz-Iglesia, Iñaki/E-4751-2010; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011","García-Pérez, Lidia/0000-0002-5626-8116; Imaz-Iglesia, Iñaki/0000-0002-7864-4194; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252; Garcia-Quintana, Antonio/0000-0002-2475-2616","Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Fundacion Canaria de Investigacion y Salud (FUNCIS), Spain","Instituto de Salud Carlos III(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Fundacion Canaria de Investigacion y Salud (FUNCIS), Spain","The authors would like to thank Melany Worbes-Cerezo, Pedro Serrano-Aguilar, and Andres Fernandez-Ramos.

This paper investigates the effect of an intensive coaching program aimed at reducing school dropout rates among students aged 16-20. Students received support and guidance with their study activities, personal problems and internships in firms. The coaching program lasted one or two years. Students were randomly assigned to the coaching program. We find that one year of coaching reduced school dropout rates by more than 40% from 17 to 10 percentage points. The second year of coaching further reduced school dropout by 1 percentage point. The program is most effective for students with a high ex-ante probability of dropping out, such as students no longer obliged to be in formal education, male students, and students not living with both parents. Cost-benefit analysis suggests that one year of coaching is likely to yield a net social gain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Towards answering these questions the paper examines two places known for their forest landscapes and livelihoods and with community forestry activities: the Himalayan country of Bhutan and the U.S. western state of Montana. Bhutan's top-down, national community forestry program and Montana's bottoms-up, collaborative effort known as the Montana Legacy Program are shown to be highly different not only in their institutional arrangement but also in their engagements with particular forms of neoliberalism including type of markets, regulatory processes, market opportunities, and the role of the private sector. Their differences reveal important ways that market forces and market-oriented interests shape threats as well as solutions to meeting forest protection and livelihood objectives in the two contexts, but produce unpredictable partnerships and awkward contradictions in the process.

In addition, individual investors earn a small market-adjusted excess return in the short-horizon future as compensation for liquidity provision.

These hypotheses are (1) that market-wide liquidity determines liquidity of individual stocks; (2) that liquidity varies with firm size; (3) that sectoral-based liquidity affects individual stock liquidities differently; and (4) that commonality in liquidity has an asymmetric effect. Drawing on a two-year data set on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges comprising over 34 million and 48 million transactions, respectively, we find strong support for commonality in liquidity and a greater influence of industry-wide liquidity in explaining liquidity of individual stocks. Moreover, our results suggest that of the three main sectorsfinancial, industrial, and resourcesthe industrial sector's liquidity is most important in explaining individual stock liquidities. Finally, we do not find any evidence of size effects and document an asymmetric effect of market-wide liquidity on liquidity of individual stocks.","[Narayan, Paresh Kumar] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Econ & Financial Econometr Res, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Zhang, Zhichao] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham, England; [Zheng, Xinwei] Deakin Univ, Fac Business & Law, Dept Finance, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University; Durham University; Deakin University,"Narayan, PK (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Econ & Financial Econometr Res, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",paresh.narayan@deakin.edu.au,"Narayan, Paresh Kumar/AEM-2143-2022; Narayan, Paresh/AAE-8777-2019","Narayan, Paresh/0000-0001-7934-8146",,,,,32,13,17,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We analyzed forest management changes that are financially viable for a forest owner to compensate for carbon loss resulting from the forest harvest residue extraction, and thus lead to truly carbon-neutral forest bioenergy. The management options studied included forest fertilization, elongated rotation periods, varying the type of forest residues extracted, and leaving high stumps. The costs of carbon loss compensation varied widely from 5 to 4000 (sic) ha(-1) between the management options. The lowest costs resulted from harvesting quickly decomposing branches combined with low levels of fertilization. Harvesting all residues and applying intensive fertilization regimes or postponing final felling generated the highest costs. A requirement for fast carbon loss compensation increased the costs. The results indicated that changes in the forest management improve the carbon benefits of forest bioenergy, and some of these changes are inexpensive for the forest owner. The optimization results suggested that the longer time period was allowed for the carbon loss compensation, the fewer cost-effective silvicultural measures existed in the optimal combination of management regimes for the compensation.

The model projects that the total fish supply will increase from 154 million tons in 2011 to 186 million tons in 2030, with aquaculture entirely responsible for the increase. The fastest aquaculture growth is expected for tilapia and shrimp, while the largest expansion is expected in India, Latin America and Caribbean and Southeast Asia.

Comparisons between siblings are used to control for selection and duration analysis methods are used to account for the presence of current students in the data. These methods are compared to OLS to demonstrate the importance of accounting for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity and for students who have not yet completed their schooling. Early childhood care and education significantly reduces the probability of dropping out, specifically during basic education. The change in educational attainment from early childhood care and education is approximately one additional year of schooling. Key pathways for this effect include improved school performance, such as increases in test scores and decreases in repetition, during basic education. Results indicate expanding early childhood care and education would be an important and effective policy for improving educational outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
