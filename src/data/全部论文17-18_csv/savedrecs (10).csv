I focus on models where the unobservables have a factor structure and enter an unknown structural function non-additively. The setup allows the individual effects to impact outcomes differently in different time periods and it allows for heterogeneous marginal effects. I provide sufficient conditions for point identification of all parameters of the model. Furthermore, I present a non-parametric sieve maximum likelihood estimator as well as flexible semiparametric and parametric estimators. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the estimators perform well in finite samples. Finally, in an empirical application, I use these estimators to investigate the relationship between teaching practice and student achievement. The results differ considerably from those obtained with commonly used panel data methods.","[Freyberger, Joachim] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Freyberger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,Robert Eisner Memorial Fellowship,Robert Eisner Memorial Fellowship,"This paper is a revised version of my job market paper.

Using these indicators, we separately estimate the effects of overall and gender-specific economic shocks. We find only modest evidence of a link between overall economic conditions and child maltreatment. However, analysis by gender reveals robust evidence that maltreatment decreases with indicators for male employment and increases with indicators for female employment. These opposite-signed effects are consistent with a theoretical framework that builds on household-time-use models and is supported by an analysis of time-use data, though we discuss other mechanisms that may also play important roles.

This paper shows that adopting a forward-looking Wicksellian rule that responds to the price level, rather than to inflation, is one potential remedy for the indeterminacy problem. This result is shown to be robust to variations in both the labor supply elasticity and the degree of price stickiness, the inclusion of capital adjustments costs, and if output also enters into the interest-rate feedback rule. Finally, it is shown that the superiority of Wicksellian rules over Taylor rules is not only confined to forward-looking policy, but also extends to both backward-looking and contemporaneous-looking specifications of the monetary policy rule.","[McKnight, Stephen] Colegio Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"McKnight, S (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Camino Ajusco 20, Mexico City 10740, DF, Mexico.",mcknight@colmex.mx,"McKnight, Stephen/AAH-1560-2020","McKnight, Stephen/0000-0003-0669-1511",,,,,16,1,1,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We find that German-speaking primary school children are about 16 percentage points more likely than Italian-speaking children to delay gratification in an intertemporal choice experiment. The difference remains significant in several robustness checks and when controlling for a broad range of factors, including risk attitudes, IQ family background, or residential area.

However, its subjective probability formulation, first elaborated by Savage, is linked to Ellsberg-like paradoxes and ambiguity aversion. This has led various scholars to work out non-Bayesian extensions of EUT which cope with its paradoxes and incorporate attitudes toward ambiguity. A variant of the Ellsberg paradox, recently proposed by Mark Machina and confirmed experimentally, challenges existing non-Bayesian models of decision-making under uncertainty. Relying on a decade of research which has successfully applied the formalism of quantum theory to model cognitive entities and fallacies of human reasoning, we put forward a non-Bayesian extension of EUT in which subjective probabilities are represented by quantum probabilities, while the preference relation between acts depends on the state of the situation that is the object of the decision. We show that the benefits of using the quantum theoretical framework enable the modeling of the Ellsberg and Machina paradoxes, as the representation of ambiguity and behavioral attitudes toward it. The theoretical framework presented here is a first step toward the development of a 'state-dependent non-Bayesian extension of EUT,' and it has potential applications in economic modeling.","[Aerts, Diederik] Free Univ Brussels VUB, Ctr Leo Apostel Interdisciplinary Studies CLEA, Krijgskundestr 33, B-1160 Brussels, Belgium; [Haven, Emmanuel; Sozzo, Sandro] Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Haven, Emmanuel; Sozzo, Sandro] Univ Leicester, Res Ctr IQSCS, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; University of Leicester; University of Leicester,"Sozzo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Business, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.;Sozzo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Res Ctr IQSCS, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",diraerts@vub.ac.be; eh76@le.ac.uk; ss831@le.ac.uk,"Aerts, Diederik/IZD-9129-2023; Haven, E./AAC-2273-2022; Aerts, Diederik/H-5408-2011","Sozzo, Sandro/0000-0003-4338-3737; Aerts, Diederik/0000-0003-2266-6658",,,,,60,14,15,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Moreover, financial cycle synchronization dominates business cycle synchronization in the eurozone, especially after the introduction of the single currency. For some peripheral country pairs, we even find some evidence of decoupling' of business cycles relative to the core countries but majority of marginal business cycle effects do not change much before and after the common currency. The former observation supports the plea for more Europe-wide macro-prudential regulation whereas the latter observation gives ammunition to those economists who always stress that the euro zone architecture is an unfinished business and that the conditions for an optimum currency area are not fulfilled.","[Ahmed, Jameel] State Bank Pakistan, Financial Stabil Dept, Karachi, Pakistan; [Chaudhry, Sajid M.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Straetmans, Stefan] Maastricht Univ, Limburg Inst Financial Econ LIFE, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Birmingham; Maastricht University,"Ahmed, J (通讯作者)，State Bank Pakistan, Financial Stabil Dept, Karachi, Pakistan.",,"Ahmed, Jameel/ABC-9250-2021","Ahmed, Jameel/0000-0002-6816-5640; Chaudhry, Sajid/0000-0001-8769-8920",Higher Education Commission of Pakistan,Higher Education Commission of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan),Jameel Ahmed gratefully acknowledges research support from Higher Education Commission of Pakistan.,,77,9,9,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The now-standard heterogeneous firm model posits measurezero firms that compete under monopolistic competition and decide whether to export to foreign markets. However, much of international trade is dominated by a few global firms, which participate in the international economy along multiple margins and account for substantial shares of aggregate trade. We develop a new theoretical framework that allows firms to have large market shares and decide simultaneously on the set of production locations, export markets, input sources, products to export, and inputs to import. Using US firm and trade transactions data, we provide strong evidence in support of this framework's main predictions of interdependencies and complementarities between these margins of firm international participation. Global firms participate more intensively along each margin, magnifying the impact of underlying differences in firm characteristics and increasing their shares of aggregate trade.","[Bernard, Andrew B.] Dartmouth Coll, Tuck Sch Business, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Jensen, J.

The increase in GDP per capita that ASEAN economies experienced during 1970-2010 significantly contributed to a higher share of income accruing to the middle class in these countries. Econometric model estimates show that the impact of a rise of the middle class on economic growth depends on initial levels of GDP per capita. In the majority of ASEAN countries, a rise of the middle class that is unrelated to GDP per capita growth would have had a significant negative effect on economic growth for levels of ASEAN economies' GDP per capita in 1970. In contrast, for recent values of GDP per capita a rise of the middle class would positively contribute to growth of GDP per capita in ASEAN. We show that investment is an important channel through which the income share of the middle class affects economic growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Contrasting theoretical work and policy analyses suggests that linking, or at least unfettered linking, may not always be beneficial. The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) is unique in that, until 2013, it allowed unlimited use of Kyoto allowances. NZ ETS, thus provides an ideal context to explore the effect of linking and linking restrictions on carbon pricing of small systems. Using data on importation and exportation of allowances, we provide the first empirical analysis of the determinants of allowance prices in the early phase of the NZ ETS. Our results indicate that imports of offsets rather than fundamentals have been the major price determinant. Moreover, the pricing of New Zealand units (NZUS) can be placed into three distinct periods, delineated by two structural breaks. In the first period, the system is largely autarkic; in the second period, as international offset prices drop below the NZU price, the system becomes a price taker; in the final period, following policy interventions, the system regains some independence. The case of the NZ ETS shows that small trading systems need to impose, or have the option to impose, quantitative import restriction so as to reap the benefits (lower abatement cost), but not the drawbacks (importation of distortions and market integrity issues), of linking.

Using a large matched firm-worker panel data sample for French manufacturing, we find that the respective industry distributions of the rent-sharing estimates are correlated and slightly overlap, but are significantly different on average. Precisely, if we only rely on the firm-level information, we obtain an average rent-sharing estimate of roughly 0.30 for the productivity regression and 0.17 for the wage determination regression. When we also take advantage of the worker-level information to control for unobserved worker ability in the model of wage determination, we find as expected a lower average value of 0.10.

Specifically, we distinguish three dimensions of public adaptation: extent, structure (form and timing) and organisation (coordination across territorial authorities and policy fields). Within each of these dimensions, we investigate how the self-interest of voters, pressure groups, bureaucrats and politicians may bias adaptation decisions. Thus, we indicate specific barriers to efficient public adaptation. Based on this framework, we illustrate how Germany's response to major flood disasters reflects the incentive structure of concerned stakeholders and their political interaction. The ad hoc character of some public adaptation measures implies a clear bias from the efficient benchmark.

This paper bridges this gap by providing a closed form expression for consumption with liquidity constraints for a wide class of utility functions (HARA). Using this expression, I prove that the consumption function is strictly concave in wealth if a relevant liquidity constraint exists. Moreover, households respond to a tightening of the liquidity constraint by reducing consumption, becoming more sensitive to wealth changes, and having a more concave consumption function in wealth. These results thus provide theoretical underpinnings for how contractions in credit supply affect households. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The average effects mask significant heterogeneity by industry and demographic group, including substantive adverse effects for older, low-skilled workers in manufacturing.

The revelation of preferences is indicated by the estimated coefficients for each of the determinants of happiness such that their weights in the proposed migration-based index directly result from observed data. Finally, we compare the country classification suggested by our proposed index and two existing indexes based on self-assessed happiness, and analyse the sources of existing mismatches, with policy implications.","[Marques, Helena] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Edificio Jovellanos,Cta De Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Pino, Gabriel] Univ Talca, Fac Econ & Negocios, 2 Norte 685, Talca, Chile; [Tena, J.

This paper is concerned with inference (i.e. confidence intervals and hypothesis testing) in semiparametric models. In contrast to the conventional approach based on t-ratios, we advocate likelihood-based inference. In particular, we study two widely applied semiparametric problems, weighted average derivatives and treatment effects, and propose semiparametric empirical likelihood and jackknife empirical likelihood methods. We derive the limiting behaviour of these empirical likelihood statistics and investigate their finite sample performance through Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, we extend the (delete-1) jackknife empirical likelihood toward the delete-d version with growing d and establish general asymptotic theory. This extension is crucial to deal with non-smooth objects, such as quantiles and quantile average derivatives or treatment effects, due to the well-known inconsistency phenomena of the jackknife under non-smoothness.","[Matsushita, Yukitoshi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Otsu, Taisuke] London Sch Econ, London, England",Hitotsubashi University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Matsushita, Y (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,ERC [SNP 615882]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780133] Funding Source: KAKEN,"ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The authors would like to thank an anonymous referee and participants at the 2017 Japanese Economic Association Spring Meeting for helpful comments.

I simulate a marriage market to predict potential spouse earnings for a sample of single mothers in order to estimate the potential losses or gains in earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage. Using multinomial logistic regressions, I then analyze how the anticipated loss in earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage affects the likelihood of marrying or cohabiting. Results suggest that the average earned income tax credit-eligible woman can expect to lose approximately US$1,300 in earned income tax credit benefits in the year following marriage, or about half of pre-marriage benefits. Single mothers who expect to lose earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage are 2.5 percentage points less likely to marry their partners and 2.5 percentage points more likely to cohabit compared to single mothers who expect no change or to gain earned income tax credit benefits upon marriage. Despite recent policy efforts to reduce the size of the marriage penalty embedded in the earned income tax credit structure, these results suggest that the earned income tax credit still creates distortions in marriage and cohabitation decisions among low-income single mothers.","[Michelmore, Katherine] Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Michelmore, K (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm & Int Affairs, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",kmmichel@syr.edu,,,Institute for Education Sciences [R305B110001],Institute for Education Sciences,"The author would like to thank Michael Lovenheim, Kelly Musick, Sharon Sassler, and Laura Tach for helpful advice and comments.

The central question in this paper is how to design monetary policy when expectations formation is not perfectly rational. Instrumental rules that use actual rather than forecasted inflation produce lower inflation variability and reduce expectational cycles. A forward-looking Taylor rule where a reaction coefficient equals 4 produces lower inflation variability than rules with reaction coefficients of 1.5 and 1.35. Inflation variability produced with the latter two rules is not significantly different. Moreover, the forecasting rules chosen by subjects appear to vary systematically with the policy regime, with destabilizing mechanisms chosen more often when inflation control is weaker.","[Pfajfar, Damjan] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Zakelj, Blaz] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Pompeu Fabra University,"Pfajfar, D (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, 20th St & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",damjan.pfajfar@frb.gov,,,,,,,52,31,31,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The analysis covers a four-year period (2012-2015). Three multinomial logit models were designed, one for trade with each of western Denmark's (DK1) Nord Pool day-ahead spot market trading partners: eastern Denmark (DK2); southern Norway (NO2); and Stockholm, Sweden (SE3). It was found that both wind energy production and planned energy cross-border flow have a large effect on the probabilities of the pricing outcomes, with greater wind energy production in DK1 linked to lower prices in DK1 and lower wind energy linked to higher prices in DK1, although the effects varied considerably across trading partners. For example, if western Denmark's wind share of production was less than 33%, on average there was a 253% increase in the probability of DK1 having a higher price than NO2, and, in the SE3 model, this corresponding value was 359.8%, which encourages trading behavior to reduce the price differences. However, the existence of such large price differences suggests that interconnector transmission capacity or trading volume is not enough to balance the price in these circumstances. Overall, the results support the conclusion that increased interconnection can reduce price differences. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose the paper extends the seminal Balassa-Samuelson model by international capital markets with a particular focus on their impact on national wage policies. Capital flows are assumed to be able to invert the traditional direction of transmission of real wage increases from the tradable sector to the non-tradable sector and to make real wages increase beyond productivity increases. The augmented Balassa-Samuelson model is extended to trace cyclical deviations of real exchange rates from the productivity-driven equilibrium path. Panel estimations for the period from 1995 to 2013 reveal correlations in line with the Balassa-Samuelson effect, if Greece is excluded from the panel. For Greece, this in turn implies indication in favour of a credit-driven real wage increases beyond productivity increases what we call a pseudo Balassa-Samuelson effect.","[Belke, Ansgar; Haskamp, Ulrich] Univ Duisburg Essen, Univ Str 12, D-45112 Essen, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] CEPS Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; [Belke, Ansgar] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Leipzig University,"Belke, A (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Univ Str 12, D-45112 Essen, Germany.;Belke, A (通讯作者)，CEPS Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.;Belke, A (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",ansgar.belke@uni-due.de; ulrich.haskamp@uni-due.de; schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2018,45.0,2,,,,,409,424,,10.1007/s10663-017-9366-6,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GD0FR,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430176500009,0

We use externally imposed tariff reductions as an exogenous source of variation in TFP (following Topalova and Khandelwal ) and test for spillovers arising from observation, labour mobility and intermediate input use.

In this data, consumer search behavior is observed prior to a transaction. I use data on consumers shopping for books online to link prices and consumer search patterns at different bookstores, estimating consumer search costs in the context of a fixed-sample search model. The search patterns indicate that consumers visit relatively few firms and exhibit a strong search preference for prominent retailers. I control for search intensities at different retailers during consumers' search process and find that search cost estimates are lower than when assuming consumers sample equally among alternatives. Accounting for heterogeneity in consumer search intensities across retailers reduces search cost estimates from $2.30 to $1.24 per search. I examine search cost heterogeneity by using a rich set of consumer characteristics and relating them to search patterns and search costs estimates. I use a flexible random effects model in which the number and order of firms visited by the consumer are her optimal ordered choices, allowing search cost cutoffs to depend on regressors. The estimates indicate that consumer search costs are related to their observable characteristics, such as income, where individuals with income greater than $100,000 incur relatively higher search costs.

In contrast to earlier studies, quantile regression is used to allow the relationship between arts attendance and other controls and happiness to vary across different levels of happiness. The relationship found in prior studies is confirmed, but the quantile regression results show that the nature of the relationship varies across the distribution of the happiness variable. A significant relationship is found at the lower quartile, and a moderate relationship (significant at the 10% level) is found at the median level.","[Hand, Chris] Kingston Univ, Kingston Business Sch, Kingston Hill, Surrey KT2 7LB, England",Kingston University,"Hand, C (通讯作者)，Kingston Univ, Kingston Business Sch, Kingston Hill, Surrey KT2 7LB, England.",c.hand@kingston.ac.uk,"Hand, Chris/A-3509-2008","Hand, Chris/0000-0002-4472-6618",,,,,55,25,25,5,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We find evidence that investors are subject to the disposition effect in each market phase but with a far stronger propensity during the bear market. However, we show that investors also make the greatest progress in learning during this period. We attribute these improved learning results to the prompter feedback received during bear markets and the harsher financial consequences of the disposition effect at such times. The learning achievements identified can mainly be traced back to learning by doing and less to learning about ability. Our results suggest that future studies about learning in financial markets should consider the market environment as an important determinant.

With a higher upper bound on money holdings, such policies can be engineered without inflation, and it is uncertain whether inflation is necessary for the optima. We investigate this possibility and confirm their results in a more generalized setting. At the optima, interest on cash is not provided, and positive inflation arises in a similar manner to Deviatov and Wallace (2014).","[Nozawa, Wataru] Kyushu Univ, Dept Engn, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Yang, Hoonsik] Sejong Univ, Dept Econ & Trade, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea",Kyushu University; Sejong University,"Yang, H (通讯作者)，Sejong Univ, Dept Econ & Trade, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea.",ozawa@doc.kyushu-u.ac.jp; hoonsik.yang@sejong.ac.kr,"Nozawa, Wataru/T-4228-2017","Nozawa, Wataru/0000-0001-8075-4248",,,,,16,0,0,0,1,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

The best response has a simple characterization where the optimal information acquisition time is unaffected by the other bidders' strategies. We prove the existence of an equilibrium in a novel way by characterizing it as a fixed point in the space of bid distributions rather than the space of bid functions. Furthermore, we show that when bidders have homogeneous ex-ante private information about valuations: (1) The English auction generates more revenue than the Vickrey auction when the number of bidders is sufficiently large; and (2) the English auction is more efficient than the Vickrey auction when the information acquisition cost are relatively small. We present numerical simulations that show that these effects can be large. Our findings provide an additional explanation for the popularity of the English auction, even in settings where the bidders' valuations are independent.","[Rezende, Leonardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente,225 SL 210F, BR-22451900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,"Rezende, L (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente,225 SL 210F, BR-22451900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",lrezende@econ.puc-rio.br,,,Melvin and Joan Lane Stanford Graduate Fellowship,Melvin and Joan Lane Stanford Graduate Fellowship,"This paper is an updated version of chapter 2 of my Ph.D. dissertation.

We compare two types of existing UI systems. When UI is organized at trade union level (decentralized Ghent UI), trade unions strategically lower the benefit levels of their UI schemes to deter welfare recipients from other unions from entering their UI scheme, leading to a race to the bottom in UI provision. With centralized provision of UI, by contrast, trade unions do not fully account for the cost of higher wages as mobility allows them to partially shift the burden of unemployment to other UIs. A system of coordinated UI, combining a centrally set benefit level with decentralized funding as in Ghent UI systems, can circumvent both the strategic benefit setting and the fiscal externality problems, thus reconciling the equity and efficiency aims in the design of unemployment insurance.","[Saha, David] Berlin Econ, Schillerstr 59, D-10627 Berlin, Germany; [Schoeb, Ronnie] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Schöb, R (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",ronnie.schoeb@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2018,46.0,2,,,,,305,326,,10.1007/s10663-017-9398-y,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HT8TD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464836700004,0

This paper studies how the potential for indeterminacy impacts on the possibility of recovering a DSGE model's structural shocks via empirical vector autoregressions (VARs), which in turn requires the model's reduced form representation to be fundamental. By means of a simple example, we first establish that indeterminacy is neither necessary nor sufficient for (non)fundamental representations to arise. We then investigate the relationship between indeterminacy and nonfundamentalness in the context of a general class of linearized DSGE models, which nests the New Keynesian framework as a special case. It is shown that an indeterminate equilibrium model may generically admit a fundamental moving average representation, even when its determinate counterpart always involves nonfundamentalness. As a main implication, checking for existence of a VAR representation of a DSGE model's equilibria cannot be regarded as an indirect test for the indeterminacy hypothesis.","[Sorge, Marco Maria] Univ Salerno, Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Sorge, Marco Maria] CSEF, Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Sorge, Marco Maria] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Salerno; University of Gottingen,"Sorge, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",msorge@unisa.it,,"Sorge, Marco Maria/0000-0002-8311-039X",,,,,39,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2018,69.0,2,,,,,509,524,,10.1111/meca.12198,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB2MW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428888200010,0

Using results on the existence of tangential polygons, it derives necessary and sufficient conditions for the irregular N-gon method to be applied, given the parameters of a Blotto game. The method does particularly well when the battlefield values satisfy some clearly defined regularity conditions. The paper establishes the parallel between these conditions and the constrained integer partitioning problem in combinatorial optimisation. The properties of equilibrium distributions numerically generated using the irregular N-gon method are illustrated. They indicate that the realised allocations, weighted by battlefield value, are less egalitarian and depend more strongly on battlefield values than previously thought. In the context of the US presidential elections, the explicit construction of equilibria provides new insights into the relation between the size of a state and the campaign resources spent there by presidential candidates.","[Thomas, Caroline] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Thomas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",caroline.thomas@austin.utexas.edu,,,,,,,42,29,30,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This inverted U-shaped, cross-sectional relationship between emigration and development was first hypothesized by Zelinsky's theory of the mobility transition. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the upward segment of the curve (the most common being the existence of financial constraints), they have not been examined in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose two decomposition methods to disentangle the main drivers of the mobility transition curve to OECD destination countries. Our simple decompositions shed light on the role of both microeconomic drivers (i.e., financial incentives and constraints) and macroeconomic drivers, as well as the skill composition of the population. Our double decomposition further distinguishes between migration aspirations and realization rates by education level. Overall, we provide consistent evidence that the role of financial constraints, while relevant for the poorest countries, is limited. Rather, a large fraction of the increasing segment is explained by the skill composition and by macroeconomic drivers (i.e., by factors that do not change in the short-run).","[Thu Hien Dao; Docquier, Frederic] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Thu Hien Dao] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Econ, Bielefeld, Germany; [Docquier, Frederic] Natl Fund Sci Res, FNRS, Brussels, Belgium; [Parsons, Chris] Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Peri, Giovanni] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Bielefeld; Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; University of Western Australia; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",daothuhien.dth@gmail.com; frederic.docquier@uclouvain.be; christopher.parsons@uwa.edu.au; gperi@ucdavis.edu,,"Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141; Parsons, Christopher/0000-0001-8528-4089",European Commission under European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus framework,European Commission under European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus framework,"This paper benefited from very helpful suggestions from two anonymous referees.

Evidence from matched employer-employee data,ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Import competition; Gender wage gap; employer-employee data,LABOR-MARKET; IMPACT,"Using Italian matched employer-employee data, I examine how accounting for unobserved worker or firm heterogeneity can impact estimates of import competition's impact on industry-level gender wage gaps, and how this can be driven by changes in the composition of female workers and firms within affected industries. First, in wage regressions, I find that import competition lowers women's wages relative to men, but only in specifications that include worker or firm fixed effects. Accounting for these sources of heterogeneity matters because: (1) women that earn low wages are more likely than men to change industries or leave the sample, and (2) firms that employ women are more likely to exit and shrink due to import competition. My findings illustrate how, using data or methods that do not account for worker and firm heterogeneity, researchers can conclude that import competition can improve gender equality, when in fact gender equality is worsened.

Existing results do not consider random shock, where the quantity is independent of the degree of reversibility and the investment trigger is always decreasing with the degree of reversibility. In contrast, we show that with random shock, the quantity exhibits an inverse U-shape, and the investment trigger is not always monotonically decreasing with the degree of reversibility. Additionally, we show that the firm undertakes a smaller quantity with random shock than without random shock for any degree of reversibility. Finally, we find that the presence of random shock decreases firm value, which implies that random shock is costly for firms.","[Cui, Xue; Shibata, Takashi] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan",Tokyo Metropolitan University,"Cui, X (通讯作者)，Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan.",xcuiaa@hotmail.com,"Shibata, Takashi/J-6330-2014; Shibata, Takashi/N-3122-2019","Shibata, Takashi/0000-0001-9724-6469; Shibata, Takashi/0000-0001-9724-6469","Asian Human Resources Fund of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government; JSPS KAKENHI [26242028, 16KK0083, 17H02547]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26242028, 16KK0083, 17H02547] Funding Source: KAKEN","Asian Human Resources Fund of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Asian Human Resources Fund of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and JSPS KAKENHI (Grant numbers: 26242028, 16KK0083, and 17H02547).",,9,2,2,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

More precisely, the situation faced by Taiwan is a core interest in China's economic diplomacy strategy. We investigate whether the one-China policy (OCP) has had visible effects on bilateral trade flows. In other words, does the compliance of diplomatic commitments with China undermine Taiwanese trade and enhance China's trade position? Using a structural gravity model based on worldwide panel data for the period 1948-2012, we approximate the OCP through two dummy variables: the vote by countries of the UN resolution about China's recognition in 1971 and the existence of diplomatic ties with China. The first component of the OCP drastically increased on average in trade flows with China regardless of the vote of trading partners concerning this UN resolution as well as that for Taiwan. On average, results suggest that diplomatic relations with China improve bilateral trade flows for China, but a trade-deteriorating effect appears for Taiwan with certain ex-colonies. We also find that the effects of these economic diplomacy components confirm previous results reported for the period studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We identify under which conditions a separating equilibrium exists where the firm's investment decisions signal its type to the judge, who responds with a correct verdict, thus avoiding future appeals. Our paper also finds conditions under which a pooling equilibrium exists whereby the firm's investment in precaution conceals its type from the judge, who can respond with an incorrect verdict thus giving rise to appeals. Furthermore, we show that the separating equilibrium is more likely to arise if the percentage of revenue that defendants are required to pay in punitive damages decreases, if the punitive-to-compensatory ratio increases, and if the legal cost of filing an appeal increases.","[Espinola-Arredondo, Ana; Munoz-Garcia, Felix] Washington State Univ, 111C Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Tantihkarnchana, Pitchayaporn] Penn State Univ, 101G Hulbert Hall, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Washington State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Espínola-Arredondo, A (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, 111C Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.;Munoz-Garcia, F (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, 101G Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.;Tantihkarnchana, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, 317 Kern Grad Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",anaespinola@wsu.edu; fmunoz@wsu.edu; pxt34@psu.edu,,"Espinola-Arredondo, Ana/0000-0002-5983-9527; Munoz-Garcia, Felix/0000-0001-6727-3618",,,,,27,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The analysis is based on time series data spanning from 1960 to 2015 for the South Tyrolean mountains in Italy. Since 1960, winter temperatures have increased by 0.4 degrees Celsius per decade, on average. A nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is employed for the estimations. This model allows two separate coefficients to impact tourism demand, following temperature changes (decreases or increases). Results reveal that an increase in winter temperatures by one degree Celsius leads to a decline in the number of accommodation guests (arrivals) by eight per cent, while temperature decreases have no effect on the number of arrivals. However, sensitivity to temperature increases has been declining since the early 1990s, probably due to the widespread usage of snowmaking facilities. The number of these facilities has increased by almost 10 per cent per year on average over the same period. In recent years (1986-2015), and as a consequence of these measures, temperature increases no longer have an effect on winter tourism demand. Conversely, decreases in temperatures lead to small increases in arrivals (by four per cent increase due to a one degree Celsius decrease).","[Falk, Martin] WIFO, Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria; [Lin, Xiang] Sodertorn Univ, Alfred Nobels Alle 7, SE-14189 Huddinge, Sweden",Sodertorn University,"Lin, X (通讯作者)，Sodertorn Univ, Alfred Nobels Alle 7, SE-14189 Huddinge, Sweden.",xiang.lin@sh.se,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019; Lin, Xiang/AFK-5217-2022; Lin, Xiang/AAG-3795-2022","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513; Lin, Xiang/0000-0003-3747-9038",,,,,48,20,21,3,27,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We identify the free trade and the autarky equilibrium as polar cases. We show that no other two-stage market equilibria exist if the commodity space is two-dimensional. An example demonstrates that other, so-called intermediate equilibria exist for three-dimensional commodity spaces. We then provide an explicit construction of special classes of intermediate equilibria. Moreover, we study the consequences when some countries control the agency that organizes trade at the global level and we analyze the role of international goods arbitrage.

We described a product on sale with two presentation formats (money-off, e.g. 11a,notsign less and percentage, e.g. 36% less) and we compared the preferences for these formats, presented jointly and separately. The experimental results indicate that the consumers consider the percentage format more attractive than money-off format, but when they are presented jointly the attractiveness of the percentage format decreases, reaching the level of the money-off format. This effect is modulated by the numeric ability of the consumers: the preferences of the highly numerate consumers are not modified by the presentation formats. On the contrary, low numerate consumers are highly attracted by the percentage format but they change radically their preferences once the percentage discount is presented with the money-off format, which indicates the actual amount of saved money. These results indicate that a class of consumers-those with low numeracy-is particularly vulnerable to messages presented with certain specific forms. However, at the same time, it is possible to mitigate this effect by providing pieces of information which can compensate the excessive attractiveness of the percentage format.","[Graffeo, Michele; Bonini, Nicolao] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Graffeo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",michele.graffeo@gmail.com; nicolao.bonini@unitn.it,,"Bonini, Nicolao/0000-0001-8871-0936","European Union; Provincia Autonoma di Trento (7th Framework Program People, Marie Curie Action-COFUND, project PEOCC)","European Union(European Union (EU)); Provincia Autonoma di Trento (7th Framework Program People, Marie Curie Action-COFUND, project PEOCC)(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU))","The authors contributed in equal measure to the development of the paper.

The evidence on the use of Bayesian Model Averaging approach in forecasting exchange rates reveals limited predictive power, but strong support for forecasting inflation. Overall, the evidence overwhelmingly points to the context of the forecasts, relevance of the historical data, data transformation, choice of the benchmark, selected time horizons, sample period and forecast evaluation methods as the crucial elements in selecting forecasting models for exchange rate and inflation.","[Kavtaradze, Lasha] Int Black Sea Univ, Galt & Taggart, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Mokhtari, Manouchehr] Univ Maryland Coll Pk, College Pk, MD USA",International Black Sea University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Kavtaradze, L (通讯作者)，Int Black Sea Univ, Galt & Taggart, Tbilisi, Georgia.",l.kavtaradze@ymail.com,,,,,,,212,6,6,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In this paper, it is shown that net capital stock also exerts a super-multiplier effect, which, contrary to the exports multiplier, happens to be independent from the income elasticity of the demand for imports. Methods: A theoretical model is here presented where given the exports and net capital stock levels, the income level is adjusted to get trade balance equilibrium. We carried out econometric estimations using a fixed effect model and unbalanced panel data to compute the elasticities of both GDP and production for the domestic market vis-a-vis exports and the net capital stock. Our estimations are based on data from six Latin American countries for the period 1951-2015 and the sub-periods prior and after economic liberalization. Results: The elasticities of both GDP and production for the domestic market vis-a-vis the net capital stock proved to be higher than the said elasticities with respect to exports. Conclusions: Capital accumulation can positively affect the trade balance through economic capacity building and import substitution. Capital accumulation imparts a super-multiplier effect; as Hicks (1950) had pointed out, it makes space for aggregate demand to increase regardless the value of the income elasticity of the demand for imports. McCombie's foreign trade super-multiplier is valid if and only if the income elasticity of total absorption of goods and services is lower than one. Yet, if such elasticity happens to be higher than one, an increase in exports will call for a reduction of the aggregate demand components other than exports so as to preserve the Balance of Payments dynamic equilibrium.","[Perrotini Hernandez, Ignacio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Div Estudios Posgrado Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Alberto Vazquez-Munoz, Juan] Benemerita Univ Autonoma Puebla, Fac Econ, Puebla, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla,"Hernández, IP (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Div Estudios Posgrado Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",iph@unam.mx; javazque@econs.umass.edu,"Vázquez-Muñoz, Juan Alberto/N-4070-2017",,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

An indicator is introduced to compute the net inflation effect on output (NIEO) based on the difference between two concepts of core inflation, where both are computed using the decomposition of VAR residuals. We find that for all countries, when inflation is increasing the NIEO is significantly positive and is negative during periods of decreasing inflation. Typically, countries which follow anti-inflationary policies if the NIEO is of small magnitude suffer relatively minimal damage in output, whereas if the same policies are undertaken when the NIEO is large the damaging effects on output could be much greater. This suggests that the NIEO could be a useful indicator of the likely effects of policy, especially for countries which have frequent episodes of high inflation, and in those countries which employ inflation-targeting policy, as the timing of monetary policy actions could be optimized to take account of this real effect of inflation.","[Shah, Imran H.; Corrick, Ian] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Saboor, Abdul] Univ Arid Agr, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan",University of Bath; Arid Agriculture University,"Shah, IH (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",i.h.Shah@bath.ac.uk; i.corrick@bath.ac.uk; drabdul.saboor@uaar.edu.pk,"Saboor, Abdul/AAI-7723-2020; Shah, Imran/W-6547-2019","Shah, Imran/0000-0002-3662-4128",,,,,68,0,0,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

However, this literature has not yet addressed the issue of how to quality-adjust the impact of workers entering and exiting the labour market. We outline a theoretical framework for dealing with quality adjustment of labour services caused by workers entering and exiting employment. To illustrate the theoretical framework, we use the case of Norway in the period 1997-2013. The impact on labour services due to our quality adjustment of net entry is found to be cyclical. While the adjustment for the quality of net entry amounts to about -0.3 percentage points annually during expansions, it is offset by about the same magnitude during contractions.","[von Brasch, Thomas; Cappelen, Adne; Iancu, Diana-Cristina] Stat Norway, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"von Brasch, T (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, NO-0033 Oslo, Norway.",vonbrasch@gmail.com; adne.cappelen@ssb.no; diana-cristina.iancu@ssb.no,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

However, empirical studies on the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in the services sector, are sparse, even more so at the industry level. The location theory asserts that FDI inflows into a host country are determined by variables related to resources, infrastructure, market conditions, cost and business environment. This paper investigates the validity of the location theory on Malaysia using a set of panel data for eight services industries from 2003 to 2010. We find that at the industry level, market size, ICT infrastructure and human capital have significantly influenced FDI inflows into the services sector. However, the impact of FDI liberalisation is not significant compared to the dynamic changes of the other variables as progress in FDI liberalization is slow and limited.","[Yean, Tham Siew] ISEAS Yusof Ishak Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Yean, Tham Siew; Kam, Andrew Jia-Yi] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies IKMAS, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [bin Noh, Nirwan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Minist Finance Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Yean, TS (通讯作者)，ISEAS Yusof Ishak Inst, Singapore, Singapore.;Yean, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies IKMAS, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.",siew_yean@iseas.edu.sg; cchizz@yahoo.com; nirwan.noh@treasury.gov.my,"Kam, Andrew Jia Yi/R-4041-2017",,National University of Malaysia [AP-2017-003/1],National University of Malaysia,This work was supported by Projek Arus Perdana Grant (AP-2017-003/1) from the National University of Malaysia.,,35,2,3,1,14,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

For the Dutch T-Mobile/Orange merger, we observe an increase in the mobile tariff prices in the Netherlands in the analysed period, relative to the control countries. We cannot firmly establish whether this price increase was exclusively caused by the T-Mobile/Orange merger or in part by possible price effects brought about by the KPN/Telfort merger consummated two years earlier in the Netherlands.

This paper employs identification through generalized forecast error variance decompositions to estimate spillovers across four systemic markets in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) framework. We find that asset prices react most strongly to international shocks within the same asset class, but that there are also substantial international spillovers across asset classes. Rolling estimations analysis provides evidence that global asset markets have become more integrated and that the bilateral relationships change over time.

Furthermore, we prove that there is no more discriminating stable tournament solution than the bipartisan set and that the bipartisan set is the unique most discriminating tournament solution which satisfies standard properties proposed in the literature.","[Brandt, Felix; Seedig, Hans Georg] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Brill, Markus] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Suksompong, Warut] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Technical University of Munich; University of Oxford; Stanford University,"Brandt, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",brandtf@in.tum.de,"Brandt, Felix/JQJ-3604-2023","Brill, Markus/0000-0001-9509-7017","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [BR 2312/7-1, BR 2312/7-2]; Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; ERC Starting Grant [639945]; Stanford Graduate Fellowship; MIT-Germany program",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); ERC Starting Grant; Stanford Graduate Fellowship(Stanford University); MIT-Germany program,"This material is based onwork supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Grants BR 2312/7-1 and BR 2312/7-2, by a Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, by ERC Starting Grant 639945, by a Stanford Graduate Fellowship, and by the MIT-Germany program.

We analytically show that in an open economy not only do these two distinct status-seeking motives have very different growth effects, but these growth effects are also quite different from the conventional wisdom based on a closed economy. Status-seeking behavior need not favor economic growth. The asset portfolios of households and the imperfection of the international asset market both play an important role and jointly govern the growth effects of social status seeking. We also perform a quantitative experiment, showing that our analytical findings are robust and empirically plausible.

The TFP values are estimated on the basis of the Cobb-Douglas production function, with the assumption of regional differences in productivity. The parameters of the productivity function were analysed with panel data, using a fixed effects model. There are many economic variables that influence the TFP level. Some of them are highly correlated, and therefore the factor analysis was applied to extract the common factors - the latent variables that capture the common variance among those observed variables that have similar patterns of responses. This statistical procedure uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. Each component is interpreted using the contributions of variables to the respective component. I estimated a dynamic panel data model describing TFP formation by regions. An attempt was made to incorporate the common factors among the model's explanatory variables. One of them, representing the effects of research activity, proved to be significant.","[Danska-Borsiak, Barbara] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Spatial Econometr, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Danska-Borsiak, B (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Spatial Econometr, Lodz, Poland.",danska@uni.lodz.pl,,"Danska-Borsiak, Barbara/0000-0002-3264-3954",,,,,25,8,8,0,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

At the same time, the Eurozone as a whole adopted a currency system with features similar to the US currency regime. In emerging economies, as in the US economy, the adoption of these models was accompanied by strong growth in capital inflows, as well as severe financial (mostly banking) and/or macroeconomic (mostly trade) imbalances. Several authors have linked capital inflows with imbalances as cause and effect. This work uses some of those arguments, along with statistical data on the characteristics and evolution of capital inflows registered by the Spanish economy, and by the Eurozone as a whole, in order to propose a causal link between post-Euro exchange rate regimes adopted in Spain, capital inflows, and the imbalances that preceded the financial crisis of 2008.","[Fernandez, Rafael; Garcia, Clara] Univ Complutense Madrid, ICEI, Cea Bermudez 38,6 E, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"García, C (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, ICEI, Cea Bermudez 38,6 E, Madrid, Spain.",clgarcia@ucm.es,"García Fernández-Muro, Clara/KCY-6440-2024","Fernandez, Rafael/0000-0003-0602-4233",,,,,63,8,8,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We compare the macroeconomic outcome of restructuring with scenarios where the debt reduction is achieved via fiscal adjustment. In line with the empirical evidence, we assume that the sovereign debt is held by domestic agents and by agents in the rest of the monetary union; after the restructuring the sovereign borrowing rate increases and the increase is fully transmitted to the domestic households' borrowing rate; and the government cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign agents when restructuring. We also assume that the small economy does not exit from the monetary union after the restructuring and that the restructuring does not have systemic effects on the rest of the union. Our results suggest that the restructuring can imply persistent and large reduction of output, especially if the share of public debt held domestically is large, the private foreign debt is high, and the spread paid by the government and the households does increases.","[Forni, L.] Univ Padua, Padua, Italy; [Pisani, M.] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy",University of Padua; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Forni, L (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Econ, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",lorenzo.forni@unipd.it,,,,,,,18,8,8,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This study aims to answer whether the subsidies only ensure that green electricity plants are profitable or whether other market participant as, for example, landowners benefit from the subsidy in the form of windfall gains as well. To identify the causal effect of the subsidies, we investigate the impact of the introduction of a price guarantee in the form of a feed-in tariff for wind electricity in Germany on land prices. We employ two different approaches. Both approaches exploit quasi-experimental variation in wind strength across 260 non-urban counties in combination with the introduction of the subsidies. Based on a difference-in-differences design, we find that land prices increased by roughly 1100 euro in high-wind areas after the introduction of the subsidy. Further, using an instrumental variable estimator we document that around 18% of expected wind turbine profits are capitalized into land prices. Finally, we show that wind turbine subsidies account for 4% of overall agricultural income in 2007.","[Haan, Peter; Simmler, Martin] DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Haan, Peter] Free Univ Berlin, Garystr 21, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Simmler, Martin] Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin; University of Oxford,"Simmler, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Business Taxat, Pk End St, Oxford OX1 1HP, England.",martin.simmler@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,,DFG [HA 5526/3-1],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank the Editor Chris Knittel, two anonymous referees, Gunnar Breustedt, Mike Devereux, Dominika Langenmayr, Beat Hintermann, and Joel Slemrod as well as seminar participants at DIW Berlin and Oxford University and participants at the IIPP conference 2015 in Dublin and the EEA conference 2015 in Mannheim for helpful comments.

In a stylized synthesis of a common pool resource and ultimatum game, agents are activated sequentially within an organizational architecture wherein they can take a share of the available resources or choose to blow the whistle, an action that sets all payoffs to zero. The resources not taken will grow and benefit all agents. Six basic organizational architectures are tested, including horizontal, vertical, pyramid shaped, and inverted pyramid-shaped structures. Our results suggest that horizontal and pyramid structures are more effective at reducing embezzlement. Rates of embezzlement and whistleblowing increase with the number of levels in the structure. Holding the number of levels constant, embezzlement rates are lower in pyramid shaped structures than inverted-pyramid shaped structures, while whistleblowing rates are unchanged. Our results are relevant to public agencies, foreign aid, charitable non-profits, and other contexts where capital leakage is a common problem and the costs of whistleblowing are borne broadly by the members of the organization.

The underlying data are micro datasets collected through nationally representative household surveys which are mostly conducted by national statistical agencies. In comparison with wage measures based on macroeconomic data sources, we find that industry wages based on micro survey data are more reliable. Furthermore, data from nationally representative micro surveys are becoming increasingly available, thus allowing for better coverage, especially of low-income countries. The database provides a reliable source of data for research on inter-industry wage structures and gender wage differentials, across countries and over time. It may also serve as a basis for further research on the determinants and implications of inter-industry and gender wage variations.","[Van Ha Le] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Finance & Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [De Haan, Jakob] Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Germany; [De Haan, Jakob] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [De Haan, Jakob; Dietzenbacher, Erik] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands",Ton Duc Thang University; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; Ifo Institut; University of Groningen,"Le, VH (通讯作者)，Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Finance & Banking, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",levanha@tdt.edu.vn,"Dietzenbacher, Erik/AAK-6681-2021","Dietzenbacher, Erik/0000-0001-8874-4175",,,,,20,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Theoretical analysis shows that gains from reforms aiming at liberalizing formal labor markets can be annulled by shifts in the public sector employment and wage policies. Since the public sector accounts for a substantial share of employment in developing countries, this approach is crucial to understand the main labor market outcomes of such economies. Wages offered by the public sector increase the outside option value of the workers during the bargaining processes in the formal and informal sectors. It becomes more profitable for workers to search on-the-job, in order to move to these more attractive and more stable types of jobs. The public sector therefore acts as an additional tax for the formal private firms. Using data on workers' flows from Egypt, we show empirically and theoretically that the liberalization of labor markets plays against informal employment by increasing the profitability, and hence job creations, of formal jobs. The latter effect is however dampened or even sometimes nullified by the increase of the offered wages in the public sector observed at the same time.","[Yassin, Shaimaa] Univ Lausanne, DEEP, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Yassin, Shaimaa] Univ Le Mans, GAINS TEPP, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Langot, Francois] Univ Le Mans, GAINS TEPP & IRA, Paris Sch Econ, Cepremap, Le Mans, France; [Langot, Francois] IZA, Le Mans, France",University of Lausanne; Paris School of Economics; Le Mans Universite,"Yassin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, DEEP, Lausanne, Switzerland.;Yassin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Le Mans, GAINS TEPP, Lausanne, Switzerland.",yassin.shaimaa@gmail.com; flangot@univ-lemans.fr,,"langot, francois/0000-0001-7737-5319",University of Paris 1 Panthon-Sorbonne (CES and Paris School of Economics); University of Le Mans (GAINS-TEPP),University of Paris 1 Panthon-Sorbonne (CES and Paris School of Economics); University of Le Mans (GAINS-TEPP),The research reported in this manuscript has been funded by the University of Paris 1 Panthon-Sorbonne (CES and Paris School of Economics) and the University of Le Mans (GAINS-TEPP) during the Ph.D. of the author.,,24,7,8,0,12,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

In order to ensure the harmonious activity of the institutions engaged in R&D and to reduce the uncertainty of the commercialization of technologies, an advanced tool for verifying decisions on technology development at early stages of commercialization, i.e. an instrument for assessing the commercial potential of technology, is needed. Over the last decade, the analysis of the tools on a global scale led to the unequivocal conclusion - so far developed methodical basis has suffered from lack of maturity for its practical use in business, a need for assessing commercial potential at an early stage of technology commercialization has been ignored, and the assessment of commercial potential has not considered the specificity of high technology. Purpose of the article: This article discusses in detail the preparation and application processes of the model for assessment the commercial potential of high technologies. Methods: in the model the multiple criteria method is applied the selection of which was determined by the motive related to the goal or assessment - assess the commercial potential of high technologies. Findings & Value added: The essence or scientific novelty embraces the creation or a qualitatively new original science-based model for assessing the commercial potential of technologies thus flexibly applying it to assessing different levels of technologies. The original model is based on: the focus on the specificity of high technologies in assessment the commercial potential of technologies; the focus on the early stage of technology commercialization by assessing the commercial potential of technologies; flexibility in the application of the model taking into account the technological level, legal status, opportunity to assess the commercial potential of technologies in different countries and institutions; mathematical calculations based on assessing commercial potential.","[Zemlickiene, Vaida; Bubliene, Raimonda; Jakubavicius, Arturas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zemlickiene, V (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Creat Ind, Traku St 1, LT-01132 Vilnius, Lithuania.",vaida.zemlickiene@vgtu.lt,"Jakubavicius, Arturas/AAS-8918-2021; Zemlickienė, Vaida/E-8037-2017","Jakubavicius, Arturas/0000-0001-7936-5931; Bubliene, Raimonda/0000-0003-3576-3975",,,,,28,16,16,3,16,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We find strong political polarization, Left-wing respondents are more pessimistic about mobility: their preferences for redistribution are correlated with their mobility perceptions: and they support more redistribution after seeing pessimistic information. None of this is true for right-wing respondents, possibly because they see the government as a problem and not as the solution.","[Alesina, Alberto; Stantcheva, Stefanie] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 210, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Alesina, Alberto] IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Alesina, Alberto; Stantcheva, Stefanie] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stantcheva, Stefanie] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Teso, Edoardo] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Bocconi University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Harvard University,"Alesina, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr 210, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Alesina, A (通讯作者)，IGIER, Milan, Italy.;Alesina, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",aalesina@harvard.edu; sstancheva@fas.harvard.edu; eteso@fas.harvard.edu,,,"Pershing Square Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior,; Russell Sage Foundation; De Benedetti Foundation","Pershing Square Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior,; Russell Sage Foundation; De Benedetti Foundation","This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Esther Dutlo, Coeditor.

Large exemptions on commercial bank holdings at the Swiss National Bank result in the average rate being significantly less negative than the marginal rate. With this constellation the policy transmission to the real economy is asymmetric. It fully satisfies the needs of a small open economy in search of a negative interest differential, not those of an economy aiming at a classical monetary stimulus at the zero bound. While the Swiss design would make it possible to impose rates that are significantly more negative with modest complementary features, the unpopularity of negative rates makes it likely that the ambition to totally free monetary policy of the ZLB will, in the near future, be thwarted by democratic realities.","[Danthine, Jean-Pierre] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Danthine, Jean-Pierre] CEPR, London, England",Paris School of Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Danthine, JP (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",jean-pierre.danthine@psemail.eu,,,,,,,6,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The analyzed literature provides evidence for a mediocre degree of persistence in abnormal profits. An initial analysis of the distribution of reported profit persistence estimates reveals some degree of excess variation. This points toward publication bias that favors significant results independent of their algebraic sign. The MRA, however, reveals that publication bias is particularly favoring results that indicate profit persistence and thus contradict the neoclassical model of perfect competition. Moreover, the MRA enables to control for heterogeneity driven by the study design. We find that the analyzed country (developing vs. developed), the applied econometric approach, as well as the analyzed period of time are significant drivers of heterogeneity in reported persistence estimates.","[Hirsch, Stefan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Hirsch, S (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",stehirsch@ethz.ch,"Hirsch, Stefan/H-3552-2018","Hirsch, Stefan/0000-0003-2668-6824",,,,,101,23,24,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To investigate persistence of such interventions, we randomly assign households to moral suasion and dynamic pricing that stimulate energy conservation during peak-demand hours. We find significant habituation and dishabituation for moral suasion-the treatment effect diminishes after repeated interventions but can be restored to the original level by a sufficient time interval between interventions. Economic incentives induce larger treatment effects, little habituation, and significant habit formation.

However, high investment costs and risk hinder the diffusion of CCS. To avoid stranded assets or high future costs for retrofitting, new plants can be made carbon capture ready (CCR) to enable them to accommodate future CCS retrofitting at low additional costs. Current CCR investment decisions are closely related to future CCS retrofitting and CCS operation decisions in subsequent stages, all of which would be affected by uncertainties. We develop a three-stage CCR investment decision model under multiple uncertainties which allows for investment and especially operating flexibilities. Applying this model to China shows that CCS operating flexibility under the carbon-pricing scheme may actually lower the probability of investing in a CCR plant, and neglecting it may overestimate the propensity for investing in CCR. Moreover, learning effects, which reduce the costs of future CCS retrofitting, may be detrimental to CCR investment, indicating that the policy support for research on, development of, and deployment of CCS to reduce CCS costs should be coordinated with CCR investments. Although higher electricity prices can increase the value of an investment opportunity, it may restrain CCR investment. Finally, CCR investment does not appear to be economically viable under current conditions in China because of low carbon prices, high carbon price risks, high CCR investment costs and the high opportunity costs of CCS operation.

Although the concept of Granger-causality is defined for the conditional distribution, the majority of papers have tested Granger-causality using conditional mean regression models in which the causal relations are linear. We apply a Granger-causality in quantiles analysis that evaluates causal relations in each quantile of the distribution. Under this approach, we can discriminate between causality affecting the median and the tails of the conditional distribution. We find evidence of bi-directional causality between changes in renewable energy consumption and economic growth at the lowest tail of the distribution; besides, changes in renewable energy consumption lead economic growth at the highest tail of the distribution. Our results also support unidirectional causality from fluctuations in oil prices to economic growth at the extreme quantiles of the distribution.

Contrary to the policy objective, NGDP targeting may increase macroeconomic turbulence. DSGE models that prove the effectiveness of NGDP stabilization policy rest on two assumptions. The first assumption is that macroeconomic volatility is a consequence of exogenous shocks to an otherwise stable system. The second assumption is that central banks can act upon aggregate variables. Neither of these assumptions is accurate. An economy is an ecology of interacting agents, some of whom have rivalrous plans. Macroeconomic volatility is an endogenous and intrinsic feature of such an economic system. Furthermore, central banks act upon some agents in the economic system, not on aggregate variables. The percolation of central bank actions through production networks can impede coordination efforts of economic agents during recessions, thereby increasing macroeconomic volatility.

The empirical results show that iterated combination approach outperforms the standard combination approach for both in- and out-of-sample. Specifically, the iterated combination forecasts always yield significantly larger out-of-sample R-2 values and higher success ratios than the corresponding standard combination forecasts. Furthermore, we document that the results are robust to various settings, including alternative proxies of crude oil prices, three predictor sets, different forecasting windows, and various standard combination approaches. From an asset allocation perspective, we measure the economic value of the iterated combination approaches, where the leverage of oil futures trading is considered. The results suggest that the more accurate forecasts of the iterated combination approaches can generate substantially larger certainty equivalent return (CER) gains for a mean-variance investor in practice.

We find that communication alone leads to statistically significant but limited price drops. When, in addition, bidders can exchange transfers, revenues decline substantially, with over 70% of our experimental auctions culminating in the object being sold for approximately the minimal price. Furthermore, the effects of communication and transfers are similar across auction formats. We contrast these results with those generated in repeated auctions.

This research paper also analyses the Mean reversion phenomenon in emerging and developed stock markets. For this purpose, seven emerging markets and five developed markets were considered. Descriptive statistics showed that the emerging markets have higher returns with the higher risk-return trade-off. In contrast, developed markets have low annual returns with a low risk-return trade-off. Correlation analysis indicated the significant positive correlation among the developed markets, but emerging and developed markets have shown relatively insignificant correlation. Results of ARCH and GARCH revealed that the value of likelihood statistics ratio is large, that entails the GARCH (1,1) model is a lucrative depiction of daily return pattern, that effectively and efficiently capturing the orderly reliance of volatility. The findings of the study showed that the estimate 'beta' coefficients given in conditional variance equation are significantly higher than the 'alpha', this state of affair entails that bigger market surprises tempt comparatively small revision in future volatility. Lastly, the diligence of the conditional variance estimated by alpha + beta is significant and proximate to integrated GARCH (1,1) model, thus, this indicates, the existing evidence is also pertinent in order to forecast the future volatility. The results signified that the sum of GARCH (1,1) coefficients for all the equity returns' is less than 1 that is an important condition for mean reversion, as the sum gets closer to 1, hence the Mean reversion process gets slower for all the emerging and developed stock markets.","[Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem; Ghauri, Saghir Pervaiz; Ashraf, Muhammad] Indus Univ, Fac Management Sci, Block 17, Karachi 75500, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G 6, LT-4422 Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G 6, LT-4422 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@lsu.lt,"Chaudhry, Shehzad/Y-3430-2019; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Chaudhry, Shehzad/0000-0002-9321-6956; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502;",,,,,104,14,16,1,13,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The novelty of this work is that, in addition to an econometric specification derived from the neoclassical model of growth, which is common in the empirical literature, it also estimates a specification derived from post-Keynesian theory of growth from the Thirwall's Law. This is intended to give greater robustness to the results. The econometric technique used is the estimator of the Generalized Method of the Moments in first differences of Arellano and Bond (1991), in addition to fixed effects by generalized least squares and standard errors corrected for panel. The results show that both in the neoclassical specification and in the post-Keynesian one, inequality and the redistributive effect have a negative effect on the economic growth of the countries in the sample. Now, while in the neoclassical specification the coefficients are statistically significant, in the derivative of the Thirwall Law they are not. These results are consistent with the accumulated empirical evidence, where in most cases the results show a negative effect of inequality on growth.","[Atienza Montero, Pedro; Blanco Mellado, Jose Antonio] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Montero, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",atienza@us.es; josanp3@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,2,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

However, there is an absence of research dealing with the relationship between IPR protection and the international competitiveness of high-tech industries, especially the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. This study aims to examine the impact of the strength of IPR protection on the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, by using time series data from 1995 to 2014. A modified Ginarte-Park (GP) index is used to measure the strength of IPR protection, while the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index is used to measure the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. A multivariate time series model and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation are employed to examine the relationship between IPR protection and the RCA index. The results show that strict IPR protection does not enhance the international competitiveness of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.

For that, we use a dynamic factor model, summarizing efficiently six individual uncertainty proxies, namely two macroeconomic and financial uncertainty factors based on the unpredictability, a measure of (micro) economic uncertainty, the implied volatility index, the corporate bond spreads, and an index of economic policy uncertainty. We then compare the effects of uncertainty on economic activity when the UCI is used instead of individual uncertainty proxies in structural VAR models. The interest of our UCI is to synthesize theses effects within one measure of uncertainty. Overall, the UCI was able to account for the most important dynamics of uncertainty which play an important role in business cycles.","[Charles, Amelie] Audencia Business Sch, Nantes, France; [Darne, Olivier] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes, France; [Tripier, Fabien] Univ Evry, EPEE, Evry, France; [Tripier, Fabien] CEPII, Paris, France",Audencia; Nantes Universite; Universite Paris Saclay,"Darné, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Chemin Cens Tertre,BP 52231, F-44322 Nantes, France.",olivier.darne@univ-nantes.fr,,,Region des Pays de la Loire (France) through the grant PANORisk,Region des Pays de la Loire (France) through the grant PANORisk,Amelie Charles and Olivier Darne gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Region des Pays de la Loire (France) through the grant PANORisk.,,35,23,26,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Then, the geographically weighted regression model is utilized to explore the influencing mechanism on the TFP. The results indicate the differences of the regional construction industry TFP are enlarging. There is obvious spatial correlation and heterogeneity in the regional TFP without a relatively stable space pattern. The TFP also exhibits convergence effects among three major regions.

Theoretically, some scholars belonging to the post Keynesian endogenous money tradition advocate that a decrease (increase) in interest rates leads to a positive (negative) effect on the amount of loans demanded by households and firms. On the other hand, some heterodox economists maintain that interest rates do not stimulate firms' credit demand but that a certain degree of influence is allowed for loans provided to households. By applying a vector autoregression (VAR) and vector error-correction model (VECM) methodology to European Central Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development data for the eurozone, this article proposes an empirical validation of such theoretical premises by analysing the relationship between the different types of credit provided by commercial banks and the corresponding interest rates. The main results show a negative relationship between the interest rates and the credit provided for the purchase of houses. Conversely, no significant relationship is found between loans granted to enterprises and loans for the purchase of consumption goods and the corresponding interest rates.","[Deleidi, Matteo] UCL, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Deleidi, M (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",,"Deleidi, Matteo/GQI-3801-2022","Deleidi, Matteo/0000-0001-6371-5255",EU Horizon 2020 grants: DOLFINS [640772],EU Horizon 2020 grants: DOLFINS,This research is supported by EU Horizon 2020 grants: DOLFINS Nr. 640772.,,62,22,25,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

A characteristic of China's export trade is its strong dependence on assembly and processing activities. To take proper account of this, China's VS shares should explicitly distinguish processing export production from other production. We estimate China's annual VS shares from 2000 to 2012the latest year for which a special input-output table is available that makes such an explicit distinction. We find that VS shares increased from 2000 to 2004 and subsequently started to decrease. To explore why it has declined, we introduce a new structural decomposition approach. We find that the decrease of the VS share appears to have been driven mainly by the substitution of imported intermediates by domestic products. This occurred in particular in the production of exports, which implies an upgrading of China's position in global value chains.","[Duan, Yuwan] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dietzenbacher, Erik] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Jiang, Xuemei] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xikang; Yang, Cuihong] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xikang; Yang, Cuihong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Groningen; Capital University of Economics & Business; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Mathematics & System Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Duan, YW (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",duanyuwan@126.com,"Duan, Yuwan/AAP-3781-2020; Dietzenbacher, Erik/AAK-6681-2021","Jiang, Xuemei/0000-0002-5639-0453; Duan, Yuwan/0000-0002-0557-7525; Dietzenbacher, Erik/0000-0001-8874-4175","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473244, 71673269, 71704195]; Beijing High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of China [2017000026833ZS01]; Beijing Social Science Fund of China [16YJC068]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of China; Beijing Social Science Fund of China,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473244,71673269, 71704195]; Beijing High-level Innovative and Entrepreneurial Talent Program of China [2017000026833ZS01]; Beijing Social Science Fund of China [16YJC068].",,43,19,21,5,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Milk-run routes are optimized in term of total distance using the modification of split delivery vehicle routing problem. Weight and volume attributes of delivery are considered. Proposed routes are compared with the realized routing plan.","[Fabry, Jan] SKODA AUTO Univ, Dept Logist Qual & Automot Technol, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic; [Pelikan, Jan] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Vaclavu, Tomas] Cleverlance Enterprise Solut, Project Manager Banking, Automot, Dukelskych Hrdinu 34, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fábry, J (通讯作者)，SKODA AUTO Univ, Dept Logist Qual & Automot Technol, Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic.",fabry@savs.cz; pelikan@vse.cz; tomas.vaclavu@cleverlance.com,,,Czech Grant Agency [16-00408S],Czech Grant Agency(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This paper was supported by the grant No. 16-00408S of the Czech Grant Agency.,,10,0,0,0,5,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,81,86,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500010,0

This paper aims to provide a critical review of the legal issues arising from using BIM and of their associated solutions. A systematic review was conducted of fifty-five (55) journal articles and conference papers published from 2007 to 2017 to identify the legal issues. The identified legal issues were then analysed in relation to the solutions provided by the construction industry. The results of the study revealed that (1) an alternative project delivery approach that does not modify the original orientation of the design-bid-build procurement structure is required to deliver BIM effectively. (2) The potential change in the standard of care for project participants due to additional roles required in delivering BIM needs further investigation. (3) The roles for auditing a BIM delivery system must be included in the contracts to ensure the quality and compliance of BIM deliverables. The study not only reviews the legal issues associated with BIM, but more importantly, it also offers significant insights for future research.","[Fan, Su-Ling] Res Dev Ctr Construct Law, D204,5,Lane 199,Kinghua St, Taipei 10650, Taiwan; [Fan, Su-Ling] Tamkang Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 151 Ying Chuan Rd, Tamsui, Taipei County, Taiwan; [Lee, Cen-Ying] Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Chong, Heap-Yih] Curtin Univ, Sch Built Environm, Bentley, WA, Australia; [Skibniewski, Miroslaw J.] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Tamkang University; Curtin University; Curtin University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Lee, CY (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Dept Construct Management, Bentley, WA, Australia.",cenying.lee@postgrad.curtin.edu.au,"Skibniewski, Miroslaw J./P-5310-2018; Chong, Heap-Yih/M-8354-2017; Lee, Cen Ying/AEH-0405-2022; Su-Ling, Fan/AAV-9497-2021","Chong, Heap-Yih/0000-0002-6080-7530; Lee, Cen Ying/0000-0001-6222-2061; Su-Ling, Fan/0000-0002-0552-5442",,,,,80,29,30,2,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Using UK longitudinal household data, we find that the feeling of not being able to cope financially matters for individual mental health and general health status even when controlling for individual heterogeneity and potential reverse causation. We develop a theoretical model which brings some of the rigour of lifetime economic decision-making models to bear on our understanding of the causes of financial strain. Our estimation results for this model highlight that shocks to how we view our financial situation are more important for subjective financial well-being than not having enough income or being liquidity constrained. Recent welfare and pension reforms intended to reduce budget deficits may have exacerbated financial strain and thus increased public healthcare costs. In the case of disability benefits reform, we find that the uncertainty generated by an opaque process of reassessment caused financial strain to increase even when households were not materially worse off.","[French, Declan] Queens Management Sch, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland",,"French, D (通讯作者)，Queens Management Sch, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland.",declan.french@qub.ac.uk,,"French, Declan/0000-0001-9360-9429","Centre of Excellence for Public Health, Queens University, Belfast [MRC] [MR/K023241/1]","Centre of Excellence for Public Health, Queens University, Belfast [MRC]","I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Centre of Excellence for Public Health, Queens University, Belfast [MRC grant number # MR/K023241/1].",,47,7,8,2,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

As well as physical strength and driving technique, skills to adjust equipment are critical for racers to win a race. Based on the contingency theory of social capital, this study analysed comprehensive panel data of motorboat racers and revealed that bonding and bridging social capital had different impacts on performance according to life cycle stages of racers and changes in regulation. First, bonding social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are less experienced and most need psychological aid stemming from strong ties. Second, bridging social capital has a positive impact on performance when racers are more experienced and have accumulated absorptive capacity to learn efficiently from diverse sources of knowledge. Third, both bonding and bridging social capital lose their explanatory power after the changes in regulation that shifted ownership of propellers from racers to the authority, which could mitigate the significance of the formation of small groups among racers to share cost and knowledge regarding the improvement in propellers.

By using structural equation modeling (partial least squares) on a sample of 192 Spanish firms we conclude that: (1) if managers perceive employees to be affectively committed, they will be willing to enhance OLC and to trust them; (2) managerial trust favors OLC and product innovation and (3) OLC appears to exert a full mediation between managerial trust and product innovation.","[Garcia-Cruz, Joaquin; Real, Juan C.] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Management & Mkt, Seville, Spain; [Roldan, Jose L.] Univ Seville, Dept Business Management & Mkt, Seville, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; University of Sevilla,"Real, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Management & Mkt, Seville, Spain.",jcreafer@upo.es,"Roldán, José L./E-6307-2010; García-Cruz, Joaquín/K-5697-2017; Real, Juan C./E-2584-2013","Roldán, José L./0000-0003-4053-7526; García-Cruz, Joaquín/0000-0003-2100-5137; Real, Juan C./0000-0003-4835-0870","Regional Ministry of the Economy, Innovation and Science of the Andalusian Regional Government (Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia, Junta de Andalucia), Spain (Proyecto de Investigacion de Excelencia) [SEJ-6081]; Modalidad B.8: Ayudas para el Desarrollo de Lineas de Investigacion Propias IV Research Plan Universidad Pablo de Olavide","Regional Ministry of the Economy, Innovation and Science of the Andalusian Regional Government (Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia, Junta de Andalucia), Spain (Proyecto de Investigacion de Excelencia); Modalidad B.8: Ayudas para el Desarrollo de Lineas de Investigacion Propias IV Research Plan Universidad Pablo de Olavide","This research was supported by the Regional Ministry of the Economy, Innovation and Science of the Andalusian Regional Government (Consejeria de Economia, Innovacion y Ciencia, Junta de Andalucia), Spain (Proyecto de Investigacion de Excelencia SEJ-6081).

Tacit collusion can involve price wars on the equilibrium path. Explicit collusion involves firms secretly sharing their private information to avoid such price wars, but this is illegal and runs the risk of sanctions. We find that, in contrast to the conventional wisdom but consistent with some empirical evidence, illegal cartels are least likely to arise in markets with a few symmetric firms, because tacit collusion is relatively more appealing in such markets.

Optimal incentive regulation implies a trade-off between providing an optimal match of consumers with green and brown electricity and efficient incentives to invest in cost reductions. We show that a single price cap on green electricity is ineffective as it yields the same expected market outcome as with an unregulated firm. Price caps on both green and brown electricity are akin to a market share target policy which implements efficient investment but gives an inefficient ex post consumer allocation. A single price cap on brown electricity (weakly) dominates these schemes and gives rise to three different optimal regulation regimes as a function of the underlying technology parameters.

We consider first an AK model, and then introduce public capital. Labour supply is exogenous. We find analytically that the presence of wealth positionality always causes distortions ( although a preference for absolute wealth by itself is non-distortionary). Consumption positionality introduces a distortion only if wealth is an argument in the utility function and the marginal degree of positionality in wealth does not match that of consumption. Two corrective tax instruments, a consumption or an income tax, are required for internalization of externalities in an AK set-up; the optimal choice of public investment is an additional instrument when public capital is introduced.

Specifically, the paper investigates whether successful invention efforts in one country, measured by way of granted wind power patent counts, have had positive effects on the neighboring countries' abilities to generate patents of the same category. Data on the number of patents granted at the European Patent Office during the period 1978-2008 are used for the eight national technological leaders in the western European wind power sector. The few comprehensive wind power studies that exist have only found limited evidence of international knowledge spillovers. However, in this paper, we find that international spillovers are statistically significant determinants of a country's wind power patenting outcomes. Geographical distance is also taken into consideration, and the knowledge spillover effects are shown to become stronger with decreases in this distance. The results should have important policy implications, for example, for a national government when it comes to applying an investment strategy in wind power or, alternatively, free-riding on other countries' invention efforts.","[Grafstrom, Jonas] Lulea Univ Technol, Econ Unit, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology,"Grafström, J (通讯作者)，Lulea Univ Technol, Econ Unit, SE-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",jonas.grafstrom@ltu.se,,"Grafstrom, Jonas/0000-0002-5952-6379",,,,,93,28,29,4,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

We do this by setting up a general policy problem in which forward guidance plays a role, and then examine the consequences for performance when that guidance is withdrawn. We show that forward guidance provides enhanced controllability and stabilizability-especially where such properties may not otherwise be available. As a by-product, we find that forward guidance limits the scope and incentives for time-inconsistent behavior in an economy whose policy goals are ultimately reachable.

Research on inequality has furthered new types of models to decompose and problematize various sources of income inequality, but attention to entrepreneurship as an increasingly prevalent occupational choice in these models remains scant. This paper seeks to bridge these two literatures using regression-based income decomposition among entrepreneurs and paid workers distinguishing between self-employed (SE) and incorporated self-employed (ISE) individuals in Sweden. We find that the proportion of self-employed in the workforce increases income dispersion by way of widening the bottom end of the distribution, whereas the proportion of incorporated self-employed contributes to income dispersion at the top end of the distribution.

The government also seeks to promote agricultural exports and farmers' participation in processing and distributing agricultural products. Led by the Prime Minister's Office, and taking advantage of changes in the political environment of agriculture that have weakened the political power of farmers and JA, the government has launched a reform offensive with variable impact: progress has been made in some areas (e.g. JA reform) but little change in others (such as rice production adjustment).

Following report release, volume increases and remains elevated for up to 15 to 20 minutes. The volume spikes for the non-trading releases relative to the trading releases, but are identical after the first reaction. Report releases during non-trading hours cause a large spike in volatility at the onset of trading which subsides quickly. In contrast, releases during trading hours result in a smaller volatility spike, which extends for 5-6 min at a higher magnitude. Adjusting volatility by normal trading volatility indicates that volatility in trading hour release is higher in both immediate response and persistence.

We look into the component of Korean macroeconomy using SPCA and then identify the key variables of the component. Our major findings are that various hybrid models outperform benchmark models including an autoregressive model, and that this result becomes clearer as the forecast horizons lengthen. We also find that the main ingredients of Korean macroeconomic black box as indicated by SPCA include interest rates, construction orders received and employment variables.

Each group elects one delegate who can freely decide on each group member's contribution to the global public goods. Our results show that people mostly vote for delegates who assign equal contributions for every group member. However, in contrast to standard theoretical predictions for our delegation mechanism, unequal contributions across groups drive cooperation down over time, and it decreases efficiency by almost 50% compared to the selfish benchmark.

Using a very rich data set, our econometric analysis that is based on matching methods reveals that the usual home advantage disappears when the game is in the middle of the week instead of being on the weekend. Our results indicate that, as the midweek matches are unevenly allocated among teams, the actual schedules of the Bundesliga favor teams with fewer home games in midweek.

However, how did market evolve? Previous research has explored the impacts of spatial distance and transportation conditions on market integration. This article argues that natural disasters also played a crucial role in the evolution of market integration in China, particularly in the grain market. When natural disasters occur, governments' relief measures and merchants' arbitrage activities will gradually promote interconnectivity among local grain markets. In this article, China's major grain monthly price data set from 1746 to 1795 and the Chinese historical disaster records dataset from 1696 to 1795 are used to analyse the impact of natural disasters on grain market integration. The empirical results show that natural disasters have a significantly positive effect on the integration of the grain market. The findings continue to hold after controlling the traffic conditions, grain varieties and lag effect. This study proposes a new perspective for understanding the evolution of the grain market.","[Li, Yao; Ruan, Jianqing; Ye, Chunhui] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Ruan, JQ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",ruanjq@126.com,,"Ruan, Jianqing/0000-0002-4440-589X",,,,,23,2,2,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Comparing such consumption-based emissions data to conventionally-measured territory-based emissions data produces several useful conclusions. For example, most countries are net importers of carbon emissions their consumption-based emissions are higher than their territory-based emissions. Also, while low and high income countries tend to have the largest ratios (of consumption-based emissions to territory-based emissions), the majority of middle-income countries have ratios greater than one as well. Furthermore, China alone is responsible for over half the global outflows of carbon via trade. The econometric estimations which were robust across income levels determined that: (i) trade was significant for consumption-based emissions but not for territory-based emissions; (ii) exports and imports offset each other so that exports lower consumption-based emissions, whereas imports increase them; and (iii) the fossil fuel content of a country's energy mix is more important (likely significantly so) for territory-based emissions than for consumption-based emissions; and (iv) domestic fossil fuel prices (oil, gasoline) had a negative impact on territory-based emissions but were insignificant for consumption-based emissions. Hence, there is a wedge between (i) the emissions a country is responsible for consumption-based emissions and (ii) the emissions that a country's domestic policies affect territory-based emissions. So, countries should have both an interest and a responsibility to help lower the carbon intensity of energy in countries that are particularly important for global carbon transfers China and India.

Our results suggest that there is an asymmetric effect of business cycles on total fertility rate. Both economic boom (in terms of an increase in real GDP per capita) and recession (in terms of a decrease in real GDP per capita) will decrease fertility rate. The effect of economic recession dominates that of economic boom. Policy implications generated from our results include the ideas that intervention designed to increase female fertility should put more emphasis on reducing the substitution effect of childbearing (such as the provision of care for children) during economic boom periods, while subsidies for childbearing and care for children that could sufficiently reduce the income effect of childbearing should be given during economic recession periods.","[Lin, Yu-Hu] Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Nantou, Taiwan; [Chen, Wen-Yi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Chen, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",lin2138@nkut.edu.tw; chenwen@nutc.edu.tw,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Furthermore, the study investigates whether these manufacturing firms innovate persistently or discontinuously over the period. The results suggest a positive link between the intensity of R&D activities and the generation of product and process innovations.

The analysis further shows marginal spillover effects that persist over longer time periods in sovereign ratings of other countries in the same region from a sovereign rating change in one country. These results imply that the regional bilateral linkages between countries serve as channels of capital and sovereign credit rating information flow.

I weight items based on marginal utilities, estimated using a structural model of household preferences. Using data from the Living Standards Measurement Surveys from Malawi (2004, 2010, 2013), Nicaragua (1998, 2001, 2005), and Bulgaria (1995, 1997, 2001), I find that the marginal utility weights are positively but not linearly increasing in price for most items.

To examine the in-sample information content, the conditional variance equations of GARCH family models are augmented by incorporating implied volatility index as an explanatory variable. The return-based realized variance and the range-based realized variance constructed from 5-min data are used as proxy for latent volatility. To assess the out-of-sample forecast performance, we generate one-day-ahead rolling forecasts and employ the Mincer-Zarnowitz regression and encompassing regression. We find that the inclusion of implied volatility index in the conditional variance equation of GARCH family model reduces volatility persistence and improves model fitness. The significant and positive coefficient of implied volatility index in the augmented GARCH family models suggests that it contains relevant information in describing the volatility process. The study finds that volatility index is a biased forecast but possesses relevant information in explaining future realized volatility. The results of encompassing regression suggest that implied volatility index contains additional information relevant for forecasting stock market volatility beyond the information contained in the GARCH family model forecasts.","[Pati, Pratap Chandra; Barai, Parama; Rajib, Prabina] Indian Inst Technol, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur,"Pati, PC (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol, Vinod Gupta Sch Management, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",pratap.pati@vgsom.iitkgp.ernet.in,"Pati, Pratap Chandra/ABA-1379-2020","Pati, Pratap Chandra/0000-0001-6066-5889",,,,,33,21,23,5,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the real world, however, arbitrage possibilities are often severely restricted and this may lead to substantial price heterogeneity. Here we focus on frictions that can be modeled as the bargaining constraints induced by an incomplete trading network. In this context, the interplay among the architecture of the trading network, the buyers' valuations, and the sellers' costs shapes the effective arbitrage possibilities of the economy. We characterize the configurations that, at an intertemporal bargaining equilibrium, lead to a uniform price. Conceptually, this characterization involves studying how the network positions and valuations/costs of any given set of buyers and sellers affect their collective bargaining power relative to a notional or benchmark situation in which the connectivity is complete. Mathematically, the characterizing conditions can be understood as price-based counterparts of those identified by the celebrated Marriage Theorem in matching theory.","[Polanski, Arnold] Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] Bocconi Univ, Dept Decis Sci, Milan, Lombardia, Italy; [Vega-Redondo, Fernando] IGIER, Milan, Lombardia, Italy",University of East Anglia; Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Polanski, A (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",A.Polanski@uea.ac.uk,,"Polanski, Arnold/0000-0001-9146-6364",,,,,17,1,1,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

While all lone parents face a trade-off in time spent earning wages and time spent caring for children, mothers are likely to earn wages lower than fathers, thus increasing their chances of falling into poverty. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2013 Current Population Survey, we estimate the size of the gender poverty gap among lone-parent families. We apply the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to assess whether this gap can be solely attributed to parent and family demographics. Much of the poverty gap, however, is attributed to unobservables, suggesting the increased likelihood of being in poverty for lone-mothered families may be, in part, due to gender-based discrimination in labour markets.","[Provencher, Ashley] Siena Coll, Dept Econ, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA; [Carlton, Audrey] Union Coll, Financial Aid, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Union College,"Provencher, A (通讯作者)，Siena Coll, Dept Econ, 515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",aprovencher@siena.edu,,,,,,,16,2,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Since then there has been constant debate, both in media and academia, as to whether attempts to reduce carbon emission would spell the concomitant economic slowdown. The purpose of this paper is to build a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to see the effects of emission decrease on Korea economy. Design/methodology/approach To answer the above question, we build a comprehensive framework to gauge the economic impact of Paris Convention through the lens of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model using Armington and Melitz model. Findings Contrary to conventional wisdom, Korea's economic performance in terms of welfare remains robust when the carbon emission is reduced. Broadly speaking, Korea's welfare does not contract significantly in part due to expansion at the export market. For instance, the energy intensive industry (EIT) is affected most directly from the Paris Convention commitment and yet it experiences growth in export. On the contrary, the authors find that the general economic impact on Korea's output is negative. The additional experiment using Melitz model shows that as the carbon reduction is enforced, both the number and the average productivity of the exporting firms increase in the EIT sector, which the authors refer in the paper as the Melitz Effect. Practical implications This paper shows that what can be occurred in Korean industries by emission decrease commitment. Social implications One byproduct from restricting carbon emission is the surge in the electricity price. This is due to the fact that industries have to shift away from traditional fuels such as oil to electricity for energy. Therefore the authors propose that industrial policies aimed at balancing electricity price should accompany the plan to reduce carbon emission. Originality/value For Korean economy, the effects of emission reduction is researched using Armington and Melitz model at the same time. Especially, this is the first research case using the Melitz model in this Korean topic.","[Roh, Jae-whak] Hansung Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Hyunjae] Korea Energy Econ Inst, Ulsan, South Korea",Hansung University; Korea Energy Economics Institute,"Roh, JW (通讯作者)，Hansung Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",jwroh@hansung.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [2016-01-032],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (2016-01-032).,,28,2,2,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We perform extensive robustness checks to mitigate concerns about potential threats to identification posed by measurement error and unobservables. Our evidence indicates that women who do not feel treated with respect and dignity have a higher incentive to migrate abroad. The likelihood that these migration intentions are turned into actual preparations, however, depends on more traditional determinants such as household income, network effects and family obligations. Furthermore, we also show that more intense gender imbalances in economic and political opportunities prevent women from actually moving abroad.","[Ruyssen, Ilse; Salomone, Sara] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Ghent, Belgium; [Ruyssen, Ilse; Salomone, Sara] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Salomone, Sara] UNU CRIS, Potterierei 72, B-8000 Brugge, Belgium",Ghent University; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Ruyssen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, SHERPPA, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Ilse.Ruyssen@Ugent.be; Ssalomone@Cris.unu.edu,,"Ruyssen, Ilse/0000-0002-8259-4492",,,,,89,51,54,4,57,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Given that the detection of sector ranking is crucial for preparing a proper development plan, in the same vein we apply two types of feature-ranking methods (namely, stepwise regression and ant colony optimization (ACO-MLP based). The findings suggest a consistent relationship between the theory and economic growth in both linear and nonlinear models. However, the nonlinear model outperforms its competitor. In general, we find that the manufacturing sector is the most strategic sector in Indonesia, as it has been ranked first in both linear and nonlinear forms. Hence, its development path could be reinforced by more investment in this leading sector and then followed by investment in construction, hotels and restaurants, and agriculture.","[Saliminezhad, Andisheh; Lisaniler, Fatma G.] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkish Republi, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Saliminezhad, A (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkish Republi, Turkey.",a.saliminezhad@gmail.com,"saliminezhad, andisheh/AAV-3353-2021; Lisaniler, Fatma Guven/F-6482-2014","saliminezhad, andisheh/0000-0002-3074-7522; Guven Lisaniler, Fatma/0000-0002-3217-1053",,,,,59,5,5,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

However, little effort has ever been made to assess collusion, which is important and necessary for curbing collusion in construction projects. Specific to the context of China, this paper developed an artificial neural network model to assess collusion risk in construction projects. Based on a comprehensive literature review, a total of 22 specific collusive practices were identified first, and then refined by a two-round Delphi interview with 15 experienced experts. Subsequently, using the consolidated framework of collusive practices, a questionnaire was further developed and disseminated, which received 97 valid replies. The questionnaire data were then utilized to develop and validate the collusion risk assessment model with the facilitation of artificial neural network approach. The developed model was finally applied in a real-life metro project in which its reliability and applicability were both verified. Although the model was developed under the context of Chinese construction projects, its developing strategy can be applied in other countries, especially for those emerging economies that have a significant concern of collusion in their construction sectors, and thus contributing to the global body of knowledge of collusion.","[Shan, Ming] Cent S Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Le, Yun; Hu, Yi] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yiu, Kenneth T.

The designated benchmark country is the USA due to the availability of time series data making comprehensive analyses possible. We use Harding and Pagan (2002) and the Cardinale and Taylor (2009) model to isolate poverty cycles in the U.S. during 1959-2013. Once isolated, we test the poverty cycles for duration dependency, and their synchronization with the U.S. business cycles observed over the same period. We find that poverty dynamics measured through poverty cycles differ for alternative poverty rate indicators. Another critical point is the magnitude of change in the poverty cycles. Prolonged and more volatile poverty cycles have a significant adverse impact on people and families facing them. That is particularly important for policymakers who should rethink poverty policy guidelines aimed at helping people with more volatile poverty cycles first. Our is the first study, to our knowledge, to isolate poverty cycles and focus on their nature. Poverty cycles should attract more attention from policymakers since they more accurately assess nations' economic well-being than output (GDP).","[Skare, Marinko; Prziklas Druzeta, Romina] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia; [Skare, Damian] Sch Econ Pula, Kovaciceva Ul 3, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr,"Družeta, Romina Pržiklas/X-7993-2019; Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Prziklas Druzeta, Romina/0000-0002-8983-5201",Croatian science foundation [9481],Croatian science foundation,This work has been fully supported by Croatian science foundation under the project number 9481 Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.,,32,4,4,3,15,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The TPP's contributions to Japan's growth strategy include: (i) creating trade and investment opportunities abroad for Japanese companies through ambitious liberalization targets; (ii) advancing domestic reforms - with the largest service and agricultural liberalization commitments to date; and (iii) increasing bargaining leverage in other trade negotiations. But the domestic reform goals of Abenomics in agriculture have come up short due to opposition from domestic lobbies. American trade politics - which culminated in the US withdrawal from the TPP - have upended the goals of trade policy under Abenomics. Japan's best option in this new environment is to deliver on high quality, multi-party trade agreements: concluding negotiations with Europe; scaling up the ambition of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership; and salvaging a TPP 11.

Currently, more attention is paid to the association between environmental regulations and industrial competitiveness (IC) because of pressures on economic development and environmental protection. In this study, we identify and explain the association between environmental regulations and IC in China. As the largest developing country in the world, China has the unavoidable responsibility of protecting the environment and promoting global economic development. We analyse the mechanisms behind environmental regulations and industrial competiveness at the provincial level and conclude that the impact of environmental regulations upon IC is not a simple linear one, but a U-shaped relationship. It is argued that the crucial intervention to activate the U-shaped relationship, or Porter's Hypothesis, is innovation, which can be triggered by stringent regulations and well-designed policies.","[Stavropoulos, Spyridon; Xu, Yuanze] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Stavropoulos, Spyridon; Xu, Yuanze] Erasmus Univ, EHERO, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wall, Ronald] Erasmus Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Dev Studies IHS, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Wall, Ronald] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Fac Commerce Law & Management, Johannesburg, South Africa",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Witwatersrand,"Stavropoulos, S (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Stavropoulos, S (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, EHERO, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",stavropoulos@ese.eur.nl,"Wall, Ronald/AAF-2228-2019","Wall, Ronald/0000-0003-2783-4294; Stavropoulos, Spyridon/0000-0003-0783-2988",,,,,59,83,86,4,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Therefore traditional top-down approaches provide a rather limited insight into these phenomena. Further, research in economics has been mostly focused on addressing tangible factors, while human agents in economic settings often do not adhere to rational reasoning, and trust is one such kind of reasoning. Thanks to recent technological advancements new approaches are enabled, and this paper proposes a novel and anticipatory research methodology for studying economics phenomena that enables inclusion of trust. The methodology, called auxiliary composite simulations, builds upon recent advancements in computational trust management. By doing so it enables bottom-up simulations of trust driven economic phenomena.

I study the effects of information exchange through strategic delay on long-run beliefs and outcomes. Investment decisions are delayed when the information structure prohibits informational cascades. When there is only moderate inequality in the distribution of information, equilibrium beliefs converge in the long run, and there is an insufficient aggregate investment relative to the efficient benchmark. When the distribution of information is more skewed, there can be a persistent wedge in posterior beliefs between well and poorly informed agents, because the poorly informed tend to drive out the well informed.","[Wagner, Peter A.] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Wagner, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Bonn, Germany.",paw@uni-bonn.de,,,German Science Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TR 15],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am indebted to Martin Osborne, Colin Stewart, Ettore Damiano, Pauli Murto, Sven Rady, and three anonymous referees, as well as participants at the European Econometric Society Meeting for valuable discussions, helpful comments, and suggestions.

Based on an Analytic General Equilibrium Model (AGEM), this study simulates the impacts of Gradually Strengthened Energy Cap (GSEC) on China's production sectors, households and price system. The results show that, firstly, GSEC can lead to contractionary effect and crowding-out effect in the fossil fuel production sector, which transfers part of labor and energy inputs from fossil fuel production sector to non-fossil-fuel production sector. Secondly, if the growth rates of total capital and labor inputs in the whole economy can be maintained above certain levels, the non-fossil-fuel production sector will keep growing under the GSEC. Thirdly, energy cap policy will not reduce residential consumption. Fourthly, the prices of labor, energy and intermediate inputs will rapidly grow along with the GSEC. Fifthly, policymakers should improve the investment- and, employment-related policies to reduce the constraint of energy cap on China's economy. In conclusion, collaborated with investment and employment policies, energy cap policy will not hinder the economic development or harm the consumption in residential sector.","[Wang, Feng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiying] Baarerstr 59, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland; [Tue Anh Nguyen] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Ctr Int Dev, Cambridge, MA USA",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Harvard University,"Liu, XY (通讯作者)，Baarerstr 59, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland.",wangfeng123@xjtu.edu.cn; xiyliu@gmail.com; T.Nguyen@greenwich.ac.uk,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673217, 71173170]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71673217, 71173170].",,86,5,5,1,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using quasi experimental variation created by a tax reform, which increased taxation of partnerships substantially relative to firms of other legal form, and the population of income tax returns filed in Pakistan in 2006-11, I document that treated firms report significantly lower earnings, migrate into informality, and switch business form in response to the increase in tax rate. The revenue loss caused by these behavioral responses is so large that by the third year after the reform the government was collecting less revenue than it would have without the tax increase. This implies that the new tax rate was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve and would not have been optimal under any social preferences. The richness of the data and tax variation permits me to decompose the observed responses into real and evasion margins and to identify fiscal externalities created by the reform on other tax bases. The welfare cost of the reform increases by around 40% once these externalities are taken into account.","[Waseem, Mazhar] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Waseem, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Arthur Lewis Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester, Lancs, England.",mazhar.waseem@manchester.ac.uk,"Waseem, Mazhar/AAI-3230-2020","Waseem, Mazhar/0000-0002-0115-842X","International Growth Centre (IGC), Pakistan Program","International Growth Centre (IGC), Pakistan Program","I thank the Editor and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Once the existence of the cointegration between domestic savings and investment is ensured by allowing for endogenous structural breaks, Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) estimation procedures are implemented to obtain reliable inferences. Empirical results reveal that the relationship between Chinese domestic savings and investment has undergone some major changes. More specifically, with the introduction of managed floating exchange rate regime, a substantial reduction is observed in the almost unitary saving retention coefficient of the fixed exchange rate period. Furthermore, the correlation has experienced a slight increase since 2009, which coincides with the worldwide protectionist policies adopted in the depth of the global financial crisis.","[Yildirim, Dilem] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Orman, Ethem Erdem] Republ Turkey Prime Minist Undersecretariat Treas, Insurance Supervis Board, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Prime Ministry Turkey,"Yildirim, D (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",dilem@metu.edu.tr,"YILDIRIM, Dilem/ABA-1256-2020",,,,,,59,12,14,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

However, the mechanisms of how energy-related emissions are driven by inter-sectoral linkages remains unexplored. In this paper, a subsystem input-output model was developed to investigate the temporal and sectoral changes of emissions in China from 1997 to 2012. We decomposed total emissions into internal, spillover, feedback, and direct components. Our results show that the equipment manufacturing, construction and services sectors are the main sources of emissions during the whole period, which have a larger spillover component, primarily through indirect upstream emissions in the heavy-manufacturing, transportation, and power sectors. The emissions from the power and transportation sectors are dominated by direct rather than the spillover emissions. The shares of the feedback and internal components in the heavy manufacturing sectors were significantly higher than those of other sectors. Our results suggest that further addressing carbon emissions along the supply chain of equipment manufacturing, construction and services sectors, and improving technologies in the heavy manufacturing and power sectors holds important future opportunities for curbing the rapid growth of carbon emissions in China.

Using a simple graphic model, it defines the basic ties in lobbying, which, in terms of economic theory, is viewed as a series of ties of a predominantly market nature, where the market concerned is the information market. The role of the Government, which is generally regarded as the central decision-making authority, mainly consists in creating a favourable institutional environment, which does not interfere with spontaneous market relationships However, there are certain situations that the Government could, or should regulate, and this paper discusses such situations using three hypothetical scenarios - a lobbying-free society, a society where lobbying exists, but is not transparent, and a society where lobbing is transparent. The conclusion discusses various regulation options.","[Zak, Milan] Univ Econ & Management, Narozni 2600-9A, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic",,"Zák, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ & Management, Narozni 2600-9A, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",milan.zak@vsem.cz,"Zak, Milan/AAB-3520-2021","Zak, Milan/0000-0002-5814-7668",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [16-08786S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"This research received funding from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic, Project No. 16-08786S Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences.",,6,0,0,0,4,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,414,420,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200045,0

Licensing is made through a payment based on a two-part tariff, namely a fixed fee plus a royalty per output unit. Regarding the innovation value when commercialized by each user (high or low), we compare a symmetric information context where such value is publicly known with a situation in which users have private information about the value, but with their period-1 output signalling that value. We find that the patent holder is more likely to prefer to grant two licenses under signalling than under symmetric information, which highlights the benefits of resorting to market competition between users to reduce the amount of informational rents.","[Antelo, Manel; Sampayo, Antonio] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Antelo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Santiago, Spain.",,"Rodriguez Sampayo, Antonio/L-7672-2014","Rodriguez Sampayo, Antonio/0000-0002-8667-4940; Antelo, Manel/0000-0003-1846-6872",Xunta de Galicia [GPC2013-045]; European Regional Development Fund; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48884-C3-1-P],Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We are very grateful to two anonymous referees and the Editor (Chris Orme) whose comments and suggestions greatly contributed to improve the manuscript, particularly referring to Propositions 5 and 6.

(Harvard University Press, 2015) sets out a range of concrete proposals aimed at reducing income inequality, which cover a very broad span but include major changes to the income tax and social transfers system and the minimum wage. These are framed with specific reference to the UK but have much broader relevance in demonstrating how substantial the impact on inequality of such measures could be. This paper assesses the first-round effects of these tax, transfer and minimum wage reforms on income inequality and poverty based on a microsimulation approach using EUROMOD. The reforms involve a significantly more progressive income tax structure, a major increase in the minimum wage to the level which is estimated to represent the 'Living Wage', and alternative routes to reforming social transfers - either to strengthen the social insurance element or to restructure the entire system as a Participation Income (a variant of Basic/Citizen's Income). The results show how the first-round effects of either set of tax and transfer proposals would be to substantially reduce the extent of income inequality and relative income poverty and the paper draws out how the two approaches differ in their effects. The additional impact of raising the minimum wage to the Living Wage is modest, reflecting in particular the position of beneficiaries in the household income distribution and the offsetting effects on household income of the withdrawal of means-tested cash transfers.","[Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.; Nolan, Brian] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Leventi, Chrysa; Sutherland, Holly; Tasseva, Iva] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester, Essex, England; [Nolan, Brian] Univ Oxford, Dept Social Policy & Intervent, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Essex; University of Oxford,"Sutherland, H (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester, Essex, England.",hollys@essex.ac.uk,"Tasseva, Iva/IXN-4154-2023","Tasseva, Iva/0000-0003-3302-8918; Nolan, Brian/0000-0002-5992-4182","ESRC [ES/H00811X/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,45,19,19,6,42,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

A positive and significant effect of per capita FDI stocks on host country export quality is noted for the developing nations using all these methods.

Solutions are related to underlying supply and demand conditions, and to the extent of uncertainty and of rationing efficiency. With expected earnings maximization, greater uncertainty widens the range of parameter values for which a minimum wage should be set. With expected worker surplus maximization and sufficiently efficient rationing, a minimum wage should always be set.

Using previously unexploited data on couples' work schedules we investigate the effect of flexible working on couples' coordination of their daily work schedules in the UK. We consider three distinct dimensions of flexible working: flexibility of daily start and finish times (flexitime), flexibility of work times over the year (annualized hours), and generalized control of working hours. We show that having flexitime at work increases a couple's amount of coordination of their daily work schedules by a half to 1 h, which is double the margin of adjustment enjoyed by couples with no flexitime. The impact is driven by couples with children. In contrast to flexitime, the other two forms of flexible working do not seem to increase synchronous time. Our results suggest that having flexitime plays an important role in relaxing the work scheduling constraints faced by families with young children, and that effective flexible working time arrangements are those that increase the worker's and not the employer's flexibility.","[Bryan, Mark L.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Sevilla, Almudena] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Econ, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Room 4-13D,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",University of Sheffield; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Sevilla, A (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Econ, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Room 4-13D,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",m.l.bryan@sheffield.ac.uk; a.sevilla@qmul.ac.uk,,"Bryan, Mark/0000-0002-5000-8946","Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/J003271/2]; ESRC through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) [ES/H00811X/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1, ES/J003271/2, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L009153/1, ES/J003271/2, ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for funding under grant no.

I first show that in standard models driven by TFP shocks, the balance sheet channel disappears when agents can write contracts on the aggregate state of the economy. Optimal contracts sever the link between leverage and aggregate risk sharing, eliminating the concentration of aggregate risk that drives balance sheet recessions. I then show that uncertainty shocks can help explain this concentration of aggregate risk and drive balance sheet recessions, even with contracts on aggregate shocks.

We examine what accounts for the inequality of log-earnings at a point in time and for the inequality of the log of earnings averaged over five quarters.

Two approaches are considered: the discrete choice and the transition probability approach, where individual agents face a binary decision and choose one of them with a certain probability. These assessments are adjusted upward or downward in response to what the agents observe, which leads to changes in the aggregate sentiment and the macroeconomic variables resulting from the corresponding decisions. Typical applications of the two approaches alternatively give rise to what will be called a weak and a strong form of animal spirits. On the whole, the literature included in this survey provides examples of applications of a modelling tool that demonstrates a considerable flexibility within a canonical framework.","[Franke, Reiner] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Westerhoff, Frank] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",University of Kiel; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Franke, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",franke@uni-bremen.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021; Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015; Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103",,,,,80,37,37,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We conduct industry level stochastic frontier analysis and estimate a technical inefficiency model which allows for an interaction between ICT and upstream regulation. A panel dataset from EU and US industries is used for the period 1995-2007. We find that ICT contributes significantly in reducing technical inefficiency in low technology manufacturing. In service industries this influence is strong only at low levels of regulation. Likewise, in the same sectors, anticompetitive regulation exerts an increasing effect on inefficiency. We fail to establish any significant influence of ICT on the efficiency of high technology industries. When considering alternative dimensions of regulation, most regression estimates confirm baseline results as regards the inefficiency influence of either ICT or regulation. However, the conditional impact of ICT differentiates and depends on the type of regulation examined. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is performed using a rich dataset, covering six EU countries (Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Spain) and combining information from the EFIGE survey and Amadeus balance sheets. Our results show that the labour share is lower for exporting firms and for those engaged in foreign direct investments or offshoring activities. These findings are robust to an array of sensitivity tests. Our instrumental variable analysis indicates that causation goes from internationalisation to changes in the labour share. An investigation into the channels of the negative impact of internationalisation shows that these effects are not related to the composition of the labour force, technological factors or firm market power.

A standard model of heterogenous producers, amended to include a channel for innovation, is calibrated to the U.S. to serve as a benchmark. Canadian specific features that affect innovation spending, namely tax/subsidy policy, regulatory burden and innovation costs are applied to this benchmark, together and in isolation, to quantify their importance. When applied together, the model replicates many aspects of the Canadian economy and predicts lower innovation spending, average firm size and productivity, closely in line with the evidence. Differences in innovation costs account for the majority of firm size and productivity differences, while fairly modest differences in regulatory burden translate to sizeable aggregate losses because they alter incentives to innovate. Subsidies to innovation have subdued effects due to higher innovation costs and regulatory burden, but imply larger productivity differences if absent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For that, we apply a panel vector autoregression model on a large sample of 180countries over the period 1996-2014. Using two corruption indexes and subsample estimations, results provide evidence that the inflation-corruption nexus is bidirectional. The causal effect is more important from corruption to inflation. Interactions remain significant but heterogeneous across subsamples with different income levels. The corruption effect is persistent only in low-middle income economies and its adverse effect on inflation is weaker in high-income economies. The two-way relationship between inflation and corruption reflects the inability to control inflation and the situation of the poverty trap in some countries.","[Sassi, Seifallah; Gasmi, Amira] Univ Carthage, Lab Appl Econ & Finance, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Sassi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Carthage, Lab Appl Econ & Finance, Tunis, Tunisia.",,,,,,,,16,9,10,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Unless the positional externalities have been internalized, an indicator of such externalities must be added to genuine saving to arrive at the proper measure of welfare change.

The approach first extends the Bagwell and Staiger (1999, 2011) model from trade agreement accession negotiations to the setting of enforcement negotiations, and the resulting theory guides the empirical assessment on trade volume outcomes from WTO disputes over 1995-2009.","[Bown, Chad P.] Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Reynolds, Kara M.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, 4400 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics; American University,"Bown, CP (通讯作者)，Peterson Inst Int Econ, 1750 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",cbown@piie.com; reynolds@american.edu,,"Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384; Bown, Chad/0000-0002-6963-7857",World Bank's KCP Trust Fund,World Bank's KCP Trust Fund,"We acknowledge the generous financial support from the World Bank's KCP Trust Fund.

This practice is termed evergreening or zombie lending. Due to a prolonged recession and stagnation coupled with relatively high share of non-performing loans, such practice may be occurring in Europe nowadays. We use data for Croatia, a country that fought recession for several years, to study the existence of zombie lending practice. We analyse credit supply to individual enterprises in Croatia at the beginning and in the midst of the recent crisis and determine to what extent zombie lending is present and how lending behaviour changed during the crisis period. Results of the estimated regressions indicate that there is evidence that some of the loans being prolonged are the result of zombie lending practices. This implies that policymakers should be aware of the possibility of such a relationship between banks and firms, as well as of its impact, and should try to minimise it.

The purpose here is to revisit the principles of central banking and the theoretical framework for applying them in light of these changed conditions. We focus on different understandings of the economic process and how they relate to the principles of central banking, comparing the dominant technocratic approach to central banking theory with a more traditional political economy approach. We consider the recent use of 'unconventional' tools of monetary policy and a range of current proposals for reform of money, banking and central banking. It is argued that central banking needs a new framework which recognises the interdependencies between the conditions for monetary stability, financial stability and economic stability and between the policy measures by which these goals may be addressed.","[Dow, Sheila] Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland; [Dow, Sheila] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Stirling; University of Victoria,"Dow, S (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",s.c.dow@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,76,27,28,2,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper addresses three main issues: the progress and experience towards financial integration in Africa, the degree and timing of the integration process in selected African stock markets, and the effect of financial integration on economic activity. First, using time-varying parameters from a state-space model, we assess the degree and timing of financial integration in Africa and found results that indicate contemporary patterns toward increasing financial globalisation relative to regionalisation. Second, using carefully specified parametric and nonparametric regression analyses, we found that higher levels of financial integration are associated with higher levels of growth and investment, but not necessarily total factor productivity. The relationships become even clearer when we zoom in on the nonparametric iso-growth surface plots, which show that there is a threshold level of financial development that is consistent with growth in a financially segmented economy. Finally, some policy implications are gleaned from the results and the experiences in Asia and Europe.","[Ekpo, Akpan] West African Inst Financial & Econ Management WAI, Lagos, Nigeria; [Ekpo, Akpan] Presidential Econ Management Team, Lagos, Nigeria; [Chuku, Chuku] Univ Uyo, Dept Econ, Uyo, Nigeria; [Chuku, Chuku] African Dev Bank, Macroecon Policy Forecasting & Res Dept, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Chuku, Chuku] Univ Manchester, Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Uyo; African Development Bank Group (AfDB); University of Manchester,"Chuku, C (通讯作者)，Univ Uyo, Dept Econ, Uyo, Nigeria.",tahekpo@waifem-cbp.org; tchukuachuku@gmail.com,,"Chuku, Chuku/0000-0003-4737-6147",African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) [RC 13537],African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),We thankfully acknowledge funding for this project provided by the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) with Grant No. RC 13537.,,58,8,9,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In this paper, I build on a recent literature to show why such policies are inefficient if consumers differ in their willingness-to-pay for insurance conditional on the insured losses they generate. Using administrative claims data, I then show that this type of demand heterogeneity is empirically relevant in a consumer health plan setting. Younger and older consumers and men and women reveal strikingly different demand for health insurance, conditional on their objective medical spending risk. This implies that these groups must face different prices so as to sort themselves efficiently across insurance contracts.

On the one hand, a progressive tax system can counteract inequality in initial conditions and substitute for imperfect private insurance against idiosyncratic earnings risk. On the other hand, progressivity reduces incentives to work and to invest in skills, distortions that are especially costly when the government must finance public goods. We develop a tractable equilibrium model that features all of these trade-offs. The analytical expressions we derive for social welfare deliver a transparent understanding of how preference, technology, and market structure parameters influence the optimal degree of progressivity. A calibration for the U.S. economy indicates that endogenous skill investment, flexible labor supply, and the desire to finance government purchases play quantitatively similar roles in limiting optimal progressivity. In a version of the model where poverty constrains skill investment, optimal progressivity is close to the U.S. value. An empirical analysis on cross-country data offers support to the theory.","[Heathcote, Jonathan] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of Oslo; Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Heathcote, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.",,"Violante, Giovanni L./F-1872-2017",,"European Research Council (ERC) [IPCDP-324085]; Oslo Fiscal Studies; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Oslo Fiscal Studies; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Formerly titled Redistributive Taxation in a Partial Insurance Economy.

We show that it is not the level of inflation but its volatility that matters for the choice of a UoA. In the presence of inflation uncertainty, money can still become both an MoE and a UoA as long as the conversion cost is higher than its maximum buyers are willing to bear for ensuring stable consumption against inflation uncertainty. Also, the choice of a UoA in the presence of fiat money as an MoE determines endogenously the nominal price rigidity or flexibility. An economy adopting money as a UoA yields the short-run nominal rigidity and the Phillips-curve relationship. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We proceed to compare the performance of our model with those of Fama and French (1993, 1996) and Carhart (1997)'s. We find that the authors' 52-week high strategy achieves a positive, though statistically insignificant return in 1980-2014, with severely divergent performances in subperiods 1980-2000 (significantly positive) and 2001-2014 (significantly negative). Overall, our model for portfolios built on momentum outperforms the 3-factor model but falls short from Carhart (1997)'s. Subperiod analysis shows results in line with the complete sample for 1980-2000, while both momentum models' performance in subperiod 2001-2014 seems influenced by the unanticipated momentum crash of 2009. We conclude that a momentum risk factor should be included in a given asset pricing model, but evidence suggests it should be based on Jegadeesh and Titman (1993).","[Lobao, Julio; Fernandes, Joao Meira] Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Lobao, J (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, Oporto, Portugal.",jlobao@fep.up.pt; 199303842@fep.up.pt,"Lobão, Júlio/AAF-4837-2019","Lobão, Júlio/0000-0001-5896-9648",,,,,42,1,1,0,6,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

We find that incorporating RI can significantly improve the model's predictions in both dimensions in general equilibrium. In addition, we find that intertemporal substitution plays an important role in determining the two key dispersion moments via affecting the degree of optimal attention in equilibrium.

This paper develops an equilibrium model of decentralized markets that accommodates general market structures with coexisting exchanges. Decentralized markets can allocate risk among traders with different risk preferences more efficiently, thus realizing gains from trade that cannot be reproduced in centralized markets. Market decentralization always increases price impact. Yet, markets in which assets are traded in multiple exchanges, whether they are disjoint or intermediated, can give higher welfare than the centralized market with the same traders and assets. In decentralized markets, demand substitutability across assets is endogenous and heterogeneous among traders.","[Malamud, Semyon] EPF Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Extranef 213, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Malamud, Semyon] CEPR, London, England; [Rostek, Marzena] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Malamud, S (通讯作者)，EPF Lausanne, Swiss Finance Inst, Extranef 213, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;Malamud, S (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",semyon.malamud@epfl.ch; mrostek@ssc.wisc.edu,,"Malamud, Semyon/0000-0001-6574-7322","NET Institute; NSF [SES-1357758]; Swiss Finance Institute; Swiss National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1357758] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NET Institute; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss Finance Institute; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank four anonymous referees for many helpful comments and suggestions.

Flanagan (The perilous life of symphony orchestras: artistic triumphs and economic challenges. Yale University Press, New York, 2012) found that US symphony orchestras were able to avoid the negative consequences of this earning gap by fostering strong private support. In the present study, we find that, in contexts where private funding is not as readily accessible, like in Canada, arts organizations have more incentive to keep expenses under control. This can be understood in terms of resource dependence where government funding bodies, due to a homogeneous set of demands, put pressure on organizations to control their expenses and reach greater audiences. Using panel data covering a period of 8 years and forty-eight orchestras, the results show that Canadian orchestras, when compared to US ones, achieve a lower rate of expense increases over time and are more reactive to economic downturns.","[McGrath, Tara; Legoux, Renaud; Senecal, Sylvain] HEC Montreal, Dept Mkt, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"McGrath, T (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Mkt, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",tara.mcgrath@hec.ca,,"McGrath, Tara/0000-0002-3814-8866",,,,,31,4,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The main result is a characterization, via observable choice, of introspective unawareness a DM who is both unaware of some information and aware she is unaware. Under dynamic introspective unawareness, the DM is unwilling to commit to future choices, even when given the flexibility to write a contingent plan that executes a choice conditional on the realization of uncertain events. This is a behavior that cannot be explained by uncertainty alone (i.e., without appealing to unawareness). In a simple strategic environment, the acknowledgment of unawareness can lead to strategic concealment of choice objects (i.e., actions), in turn, leading to a desire for incomplete contracts.

As a nationwide event, it receives cult status in the Netherlands. In this paper, it is argued that rankings are coordination games. To demonstrate this, statistical methods are applied, first to analyze the extent to which competition prevails between pop songs. While conventional charts collect pop song rankings on a commercial basis, the Top 2000 ranking is voted on once a year. Moreover, a very wide range of songs is allocated to 2000 positions. The ranking displays tremendous stability among the top five songs over the years and demonstrates the importance of superstardom. Moreover, a detailed statistical analysis provides evidence that there is hardly any competition among the most liked 100-150 songs. The empirical distribution of these songs follows a Pareto distribution, whereas the songs up to rank 1500 are exponentially distributed. These different distributions may be explained by two different voting strategies, namely voting for the individually most liked songs and voting to maximize the social value of the Top 2000 by taking account of the assumed preferences of other voters. In this manner, superstardom acts as a coordination device in a large-scale coordination game.","[Prinz, Aloys] Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, Wilmergasse 6-8, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Prinz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, Wilmergasse 6-8, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",Aloys.Prinz@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,75,2,3,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We consider choices over lotteries which determine the number of offspring and involve both idiosyncratic and aggregate risks. We distinguish between two types of aggregate risk: environmental variations and natural disasters. Environmental variations influence the death and birth rates, while natural disasters result in instantaneous drops in population size. Our main result is a utility representation of the evolutionary optimal behaviour. The utility is additively separable in the two types of aggregate risk. The term involving environmental variations is a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility which induces the same attitude towards both idiosyncratic and aggregate risk. The term involving disasters cannot be interpreted as an expected utility maximization and induces less tolerance towards aggregate risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The major subsidisers of oil are OPEC countries, and the effects of subsidy removal here are quite pronounced. Consumption of oil in the transport sector of OPEC countries declines significantly. As a result, the global oil price falls slightly, and other regions increase their oil consumption to some degree. Although OPEC consumers are worse off by the subsidy removal, total welfare in OPEC increases due to higher profits from oil production. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While there are several initiatives promoting the use of biogas, credible analyses of its effects on the use of alternative energy sources and energy related expenditure are limited. This study uses panel data from households engaged in dairy farming in rural East Java to assess the impact of a household level programme, which promotes the construction of digesters that produce biogas, on energy use and expenditures. Both a difference-in-difference analysis and a pipeline comparison show that the use of digesters leads to a sharp reduction in energy related expenditures and a reduction in the use of firewood and liquefied petroleum gas. However, without subsidies, the payback period of between 11 and 14 years, albeit based only on reductions in energy costs accruing from investing in a digester, is perhaps too long to justify the investment.

An unbalanced panel dataset of 1994 Swiss households from 2010 to 2014 collected via a household survey is used to estimate an electricity demand frontier function. We further investigate whether energy and investment literacy have an influence on the household electricity consumption. The results show significant inefficiencies in the use of electricity among Swiss households, both transient (11%) and persistent (22%). We note that the high persistent inefficiency is indicative of structural problems faced by households and systematic behavioral shortcomings in residential electricity consumption. These results indicate a considerable potential for electricity savings and thus reaching the reduction targets defined by the Swiss federal council as part of the Energy Strategy 2050, wherein end-use efficiency improvement is one of the main pillars. The results support a positive role of energy and, in particular, investment literacy in reducing household electricity consumption. Policies targeting an improvement of these attributes could help to enhance efficiency in the use of energy within households. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As part of that, he restated his concept of the natural growth rate as an optimum welfare rate. This paper examines Harrod's dynamic welfare economics, built around his concept of optimum saving developed as a reaction to Ramsey's approach to capital accumulation. It is shown that, according to Harrod, the saving rate does not affect the long-run growth rate of per capita income, which is determined by technical progress. Moreover, the economy will grow at the natural (full employment) rate only if economic policy is able to bring saving to its 'optimum' level in macroeconomic equilibrium. Harrod's interest in optimal growth was motivated by his double concern with growth policy in mature economies and economic development in poor countries.","[Boianovsky, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mboianboianovs@unb.br,,,Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq); Comissao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes),Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Comissao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq) and Comissao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes).,,76,7,7,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

It is argued that inflationary bias results if central bankers do not precommit to a monetary policy rule. The macro literature, however, does not address the way in which board members arrive at the optimal choice of inflation rate. That is a matter of a micro subfield called social choice. If we consider that on any board, members have different priors about the states of nature for the economy, but they all receive the same signal before deciding, then they will have different posterior probabilities for the states, even if they have many data, if one state has a low probability of occurring, such as an unlikely catastrophic-risk event. Thus, it is not clear what the optimal plan is. Therefore, discretion rather than rules may be the optimal plan in social choice settings.","[Bonilla, Claudio A.] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Bonilla, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Sch Econ & Business, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Suite 1905, Santiago, Chile.",cbonilla@fen.uchile.cl,"Bonilla, Claudio A./P-4777-2016",,,,,,9,1,1,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Still, economic analyses of this phenomenon are rare. In a theoretical model, we show that presenteeism arises due to differences between workers in the disutility from workplace attendance. As these differences are unobservable by employers, they set wages that incentivize sick workers to attend work. Using a large representative German data set, we test several hypotheses derived from our model. In line with our predictions, we find that stressful working conditions and bad health status are positively related to presenteeism. Better dismissal protection, captured by higher tenure, is associated with slightly fewer presenteeism days, whereas the role of productivity and skills is inconclusive.","[Hirsch, Boris] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, IWH, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Hirsch, Boris] IZA, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Lechmann, Daniel S.

Having as benchmark the New-Keynesian model of Rabanal and Rubio-Ramirez (2005), the main additional feature introduced refers to the extension to a small open economy setting in order to account for this specific aspect of the Romanian economy. Within the inflation targeting monetary policy regime, forecasts of central macro variables, inflation in particular, play an important part. Because inflation reacts to monetary measures with a considerable lag, the central bank's policy has to be forward-looking. Based on univariate measures of forecast performance, it is shown that the VAR with DSGE model prior produces forecasts that improve on those obtained using an unrestricted VAR model and the popular Minnesota prior in case of inflation, real exchange rate and nominal interest rate. Moreover, the DSGE-VAR model is informative about the structure of the economy and can help the story-telling in the central banks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

There are a few models which employ a more refined approach with an explicit transportation sector providing transportation services which are then used to ship goods between locations. In this paper we show that this approach, although much more convenient than the iceberg approach, still lacks full usability due to the fact that markets, hence prices are defined at the regional level and as a result, transportation costs can not be endogenous at the trade relation level. Moreover, under regional level market clearing the iceberg and the more detailed approach are equivalent. We propose to refine the definition of market equilibrium and move it to the trade relation level. Using this approach we can gain full advantage of the explicit transport sector in the model with respect to trade cost evolution. We show through simulations that refining the way trade costs are modelled indeed gains new insights, and that moving the market definition to the trade relational level leads to qualitative changes in the effect of labor supply shocks on main model variables. The paper also presents a method to estimate a SAM by reallocating data from standard industries to a transportation sector which is then consistent with the model setup. This SAM can be used to calibrate the refined model with a detailed transportation sector.","[Sebestyen, Tamas] MTA PTE Innovat & Econ Growth Res Grp, Rakoczi Ut 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary; [Sebestyen, Tamas] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Rakoczi Ut 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary",University of Pecs,"Sebestyén, T (通讯作者)，MTA PTE Innovat & Econ Growth Res Grp, Rakoczi Ut 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary.",sebestyent@ktk.pte.hu,"Sebestyén, Tamás/Y-5603-2019","Sebestyen, Tamas/0000-0002-5596-0151","MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth Research Group; New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities, Hungary","MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth Research Group; New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities, Hungary","This research gained support from the MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth Research Group, as well as from the New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities, Hungary.

Our paper question the effectiveness of a modified cancelled order tax with no exemptions, all orders cancelled or modified within half-second time span are taxed. Our study has important implications for the regulation of HFT; we provide recommendations for regulators in relation to market rules which have yet to be introduced, using an artificial market framework. This paper addresses the question of whether this tax leads to a reduction in HFT activities and, as a result, to deterioration or amelioration of market quality. The evidence we provide should help market regulators to better understand the role played by HFT firms as liquidity suppliers. We show that HFT liquidity is short-lived. With the implementation of tax, decreased HFT activities do not have a statistically significant impact on market volatility and market liquidity measured by bid/ask spreads, but decrease dollar volumes as a liquidity measure. In addition, reduced HFT activities lead to less efficient markets as the deviation from fundamentals increases.","[Veryzhenko, Iryna] LIRSA CNAM, Labex ReFi, 40 Rue Jeuneurs, F-75002 Paris, France; [Harb, Etienne; Louhichi, Wael] Essca Res Lab, 55 Quai Alphonse le Gallo, F-92513 Boulogne, France; [Oriol, Nathalie] Cote dAzur Univ, SRM GREDEG CNRS, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France",heSam Universite; Conservatoire National Arts & Metiers (CNAM); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Louhichi, W (通讯作者)，Essca Res Lab, 55 Quai Alphonse le Gallo, F-92513 Boulogne, France.",iryna.veryzhenko@cnam.fr; etienne.harb@essca.fr; wael.louhichi@essca.fr; nathalie.oriol@gredeg.cnrs.fr,"Harb, Etienne/AAH-7865-2021","Harb, Etienne/0000-0002-4222-1173",,,,,67,7,7,1,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We provide tools to characterize and quantify the effects of trade opening on the distribution of disposable income (after redistribution). We propose two adjustments to standard measures of the welfare gains from trade: a 'welfarist' correction inspired by the Atkinson (1970) index of inequality, and a 'costly-redistribution' correction capturing the efficiency costs associated with the behavioral responses of agents to trade-induced shifts across marginal tax rates. We calibrate our model to the United States over the period 1979-2007 using data on the distribution of adjusted gross income in public samples of IRS tax returns, as well as CBO information on the tax liabilities and transfers received by agents at different percentiles of the U.S. income distribution. Our quantitative results suggest that both corrections are nonnegligible: trade-induced increases in inequality of disposable income erode about 20% of the gains from trade, while the gains from trade would be about 15% larger if redistribution was carried out via non-distortionary means.

For this purpose, we performed a five-round experiment with 95 established real-life couples in Germany. In each round, the couples received the same total amount of money, but the relative allocation to the spouses differed and they had to agree on an irreversible private goods consumption pattern. We find that for the majority of the sample, the consumption choices depend on the spouses' relative resources. While this suggests a rejection of income pooling at the mean, a substantial share of the couples do indeed pool their resources. Pooling behavior is more common among couples in which the spouses' socioeconomic characteristics are more similar. In particular, traditional couples with distinct work division between the spouses are significantly less likely to pool their individual resources and treat any spouse's income symmetrically. Conventional variables used to approximate income pooling are only loosely related to the behavior observed in our experiment.","[Beblo, Miriam; Beninger, Denis] Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Welckerstr 8, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Beninger, Denis] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France",University of Hamburg; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Beblo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Fac Business Econ & Social Sci, Welckerstr 8, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",miriam.beblo@wiso.uni-hamburg.de; denis.beninger@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,52,11,15,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Between 1991 and 1999, feed-in tariffs were prescribed through the Electricity Feed-in Law - the so-called Stromeinspeisungsgesetz (SEG) - at relatively moderate rates. From 2000 onwards, the SEG was replaced by the Renewable Energy Sources Act - the so-called Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) - with much higher subsidy rates. The rise in subsidies to renewable power generation under the EEG came along with a substantial increase in electricity prices provoking an intense public debate on the benefits of renewable energy promotion. In our regression analysis, we assess one popular justification for feed-in tariffs: the demand side effect of induced innovation. We find that the innovation impact of the German feed-in tariff scheme over the last two decades supports the positive innovation hypothesis. However, the inducement effect of the feed-in tariff scheme under the EEG is not significantly different from that of the SEG. Given the drastic cost of the EEG, we caution against the appraisal of the EEG feed-in tariff scheme solely on the grounds of its impact on technological innovation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a monopolist that faces an ex ante choice to commit to price discrimination or to a uniform price. We introduce a simple model in which a monopolist can use analytics to access consumer data to both price-discriminate and offer customized products. In turn, consumers can protect their privacy to avoid price discrimination at a cost. By committing not to price-discriminate, the firm induces consumers to not protect their data, which allows it to customize the product. It can then extract the extra value through an increased uniform price. This strategy is profitable when the value added through customization is sufficiently high. An intermediate quality of analytics gives the monopolist more incentives to set a uniform price.","[Montes, Rodrigo] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC 20004 USA; [de Corniere, Alexandre] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Montes, R (通讯作者)，Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC 20004 USA.",rmontes@compasslexecon.com,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,35,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

To do so, we use a panel of 29 European countries covering the period from 1991 to 2012. We find the unemployment rate negatively affects the divorce rate, pointing to a pro-cyclical evolution of the divorce rate, even after controlling for socio-economic variables and unobservable characteristics that can vary by country, and/or over time. Results indicate that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate involves almost 0.025 fewer divorces per thousand inhabitants. The impact is small, representing around 1.2 % of the average divorce rate in Europe during the period considered. Supplementary analysis, developed to explore a possible non-linear pattern, confirms a negative relationship between unemployment and divorce in European countries, with the inverse relationship being more pronounced in those countries with higher divorce rates.","[Gonzalez-Val, Rafael; Marcen, Miriam] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain; [Gonzalez-Val, Rafael] IEB, Fac Econ & Empresa, John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Marcén, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Empresa, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",rafaelg@unizar.es; mmarcen@unizar.es,"Pérez, Miriam Marcén/V-8124-2019; Gonzalez Val, Rafael/B-8992-2015","Pérez, Miriam Marcén/0000-0002-1944-4790; Gonzalez Val, Rafael/0000-0002-2023-5726","Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-34828, ECO2013-45969-P, ECO2013-41310-R]; DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER; Santander Universidades (Becas Iberoamerica Jovenes Profesores e Investigadores y Alumnos de Doctorado)",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); DGA (ADETRE research group); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Santander Universidades (Becas Iberoamerica Jovenes Profesores e Investigadores y Alumnos de Doctorado),"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2012-34828, ECO2013-45969-P and ECO2013-41310-R projects), the DGA (ADETRE research group), and FEDER.

The United States has the highest corporate tax rate among countries with advanced economies, and-despite offering significant additional deductions, exclusions, and tax credits-it imposes the heaviest tax burdens. This paper offers a new measure of corporate tax burdens based on information in tax expenditure budgets; this measure implies that the burden of U.S. corporate taxation in 2017 is equivalent to that produced by a corporate tax rate of between 31.7 and 34.8 percent, without additional deductions, exclusions, or tax credits. Efficient design of a business tax system encourages activities with beneficial economic spillovers and imposes lighter burdens on those industries and activities that are most responsive to taxation.

Bogomolnaia and Moulin (2015) show that there is a tension between size and fairness: the guaranteed size ratio of any envy-free mechanism is at most r(m), which converges decreasingly to 1 - 1/e approximate to 63.2% as the maximum size increases. They then ask whether r(m) is also the guaranteed size ratio for any ordinally efficient and envy-free mechanism. We study this issue and show that the lower bound of the guaranteed size ratio of ordinally efficient and envy-free mechanisms converges to 1/2 as the maximum size increases, which means that almost half of the maximum size is wasted at the lower bound.

Using a small open economy model we estimate changes in the long-run level and variance of Australia's terms of trade and study the quantitative implications of these changes. An innovation of our analysis is to account in estimation for structural changes in the terms of trade. We find that long-run commodity prices increased by 35% in mid-2003 and that the volatility of shocks to commodity prices doubled soon after. The increase in the level of commodity prices is much smaller than single-equation estimates suggest. This is because our inferences rely on many observables that in general equilibrium also respond to shifts in the long-run level of the terms of trade. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To that end, recent initiatives are focused explicitly on rural areas and have a positive impact on the flow of agricultural credit. Despite the significance of the above initiatives in enhancing the flow of institutional credit to agriculture, the links between institutional credit and net farm income and consumption expenditures in India are not very well documented. Using large, national farm household level data and IV 2SLS estimation methods, we investigate the role of institutional farm credit on farm income and farm household consumption expenditures. Findings show that, in India, formal credit does indeed play a critical role in increasing both net farm income and per capita monthly household expenditures of Indian farm families. Finally, we find that, in the presence of formal credit, social safety net programs like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) may have unintended consequences. In particular, MGNREGA reduces both net farm income and per capita monthly household consumption expenditures. On the other hand, in the presence of formal credit, the Public Distribution System may increase both net farm income and per capita monthly household consumption expenditures.","[Kumar, Anjani; Saroj, Sunil; Joshi, P.

Persistent regional price differences due to Indonesia's insular geography enable this study to show that energy prices have a small (but statistically significant) adverse long-run effect on competitiveness - though different energy types matter in different sectors. By estimating cross and own price elasticities and Uzawa-Allen partial elasticities of (inter-fuel) substitution, this study also shows that firms have the ability to respond to higher energy prices by adjusting their energy mix, i.e. substituting certain energy goods for others. Moreover, this study shows that firms also respond to higher energy prices by increasing energy efficiency, and by passing on costs to end-users. Nevertheless, these response measures are not sufficient to fully mitigate the adverse effect of energy prices on firms. Based on these results, policy recommendations are offered which are of immediate relevance for the design of energy pricing reforms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Children's utility depends on their human capital, which depends on the time their parents spend with them and on the parents' human capital. We first show that as returns to human capital increase, couples at the top of the income distribution should spend more time with their children. This in turn should reinforce assortative matching, in a sense that we precisely define. We then embed the model into a transferable utility matching framework with random preferences, a la Choo and Siow (2006), which we estimate using US marriage data for individuals born between 1943 and 1972. We find that the preference for partners of the same education has significantly increased for white individuals, particularly for the highly educated. We find no evidence of such an increase for black individuals. Moreover, in line with theoretical predictions, we find that the marital college-plus premium has increased for women but not for men.

It employs several market power indices to structurally estimate price elasticities. A newly developed market power index for crude oil markets is implemented. In this approach OPEC is the central player and acts as a dominant producer in the global oil market. We quantify how a change in market structure (such as changes in marginal cost of production) would contribute to market power exercise of OPEC and have an ultimate impact on price elasticity of demand for oil. Our price elasticity predictions fall in a range reported in the literature, however estimates for pre-crisis deviate from the post-crisis ones. In fact, demand response to crude oil prices has almost doubled during the crisis. This severe change in price response can be associated with record price levels caused by supply shortages and surge in alternative renewable energy resources. The key advantages of this methodology over the existing literature are that it is simple to use and estimates price elasticity using a competition framework without specifying demand/supply function(s), and utilizes commonly observable market variables that can be applied to any admissible data frequency.

Children who work learn responsibility and work-ethic, increasing adult earnings. However, working children have less time for play and homework, hindering cognitive development, resulting in lower earnings. The limited existing empirical work is similarly confounding. This paper assesses the nexus between child labour and adult earnings using unique data from an Ecuadorian 2015 labour market survey. It applies novel instrumental variable regression techniques that account for earnings, education and child labour being jointly determined. The sample is divided into age cohorts (20s, 30s, 40s and 50+) to ascertain the long-run consequences of child employment at different stages of life. The results suggest that former child (and teenage) workers earn significantly less per hour. The analysis of cohorts reveals that the effect is stronger for older workers. This gives impetus to the hypothesis that child work hinders cognitive development, which becomes more evident when workers reach full maturity. The study concludes with policy recommendations.","[Posso, Alberto] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Int Dev & Trade Res Grp, 445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Posso, A (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, Int Dev & Trade Res Grp, 445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",alberto.posso@rmit.edu.au,,"Posso, Alberto/0000-0003-4226-7072",,,,,37,10,12,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The main finding of the article is that a 10% increase in the outside options of a worker generates a 7% wage increase.","[Tschopp, Jeanne] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"Tschopp, J (通讯作者)，Ryerson Univ, Dept Econ, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",jtschopp@economics.ryerson.ca,,,Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"I thank Paul Beaudry, David Green, Benjamin Sand, anonymous referees, participants at the brown bag workshop at the University of British Columbia and Victoria and seminar participants at Copenhagen Business School, Dartmouth College, Ryerson University, Universite Laval, Universite de Sherbrooke, University of Leicester, University of Vienna, York University and participants at the 19th Meeting of the Society of Labor Economists 2014 in Arlington for helpful comments and discussions.

We estimate a model of career choice in a setting where we observe the income risk of chosen careers and the risk aversion of the people who choose them. The key parameter of interest representing the importance of idiosyncratic taste and skill in career choice is identified from the shift in the distribution of income risk with risk aversion. We document that those who self-identify as risk tolerant are more likely to have volatile incomes. However, this correlation is far from perfect. The model gives this weak correlation an economic interpretation: idiosyncratic fit is an important determinant of career choice. We separate idiosyncratic career taste from skill using the pay gap between high-and low-income-risk people with high and low risk aversion.","[Barth, Daniel] US Dept Treasury, Off Financial Res, Washington, DC 20220 USA; [Shore, Stephen H.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Jensen, Shane T.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Stat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Pennsylvania,"Barth, D (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Off Financial Res, Washington, DC 20220 USA.",daniel.barth@treasury.gov; sshore@gsu.edu; stjensen@wharton.upenn.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,44,2,3,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

A randomized strategy is optimal if it guarantees an expected payoff of at least 0 for a player independently of the strategy of the other player.

We re-assess this view using a metric of such a default premium (DP) that nests previous metrics and applying it to a much broader dataset. We find a sizeable and persistent DP: in 1870-1938, it averaged 250bps upon market re-entry, tapering to around 150bps five years out; in 1970-2014 the respective estimates are about 350 and 200bps. We also find that: (i) the DP accounts for between 30 and 60% of the sovereign spread within five years of market reentry, and its contribution to the spread remains non-negligible thereafter; (ii) The DP is higher for countries that take longer to settle with creditors and is on average higher for serial defaulters; (iii) our estimates are robust to many controls including realized haircuts. These findings help reconnect theory and evidence on why sovereigns default only infrequently and, when they do, why earlier debt settlements are typically sought.

In this paper, we propose a concise and analyzable model to study the effects of mass media modeled as an applied external field, and social networks on public opinions based on the multi-state voter model, and a tuned parameter can control the relative intensity of the effects of mass media and social networks. We consider a generalized scenario where there exist committed or stubborn agents in the networks whose opinions are not affected by their friends or mass media. We find that the fraction of each opinion will converge to a value which only relates to the fractions and degrees of stubborn agents, and the relative intensity between media and network effects. The final agents with media opinion, except the stubborn agents, also include the increment produced by the internal impact of social networks and that caused by the external impact of media. Interestingly the second increment is composed of two parts, one is from the media effect when there are no interactions between agents and the other is from the influence of media on agent opinions caused by social network structure. That is the interactions among agents within social networks can amplify media influence. Finally we also discuss several extensions to the dynamics model which consider more realistic scenarios.","[Hu, Haibo] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jonathan J.

In this paper we empirically test the theories of aspirations failure and formation articulated in Appadurai (2004), Ray (2006), and Genicot and Ray (2015) using a unique dataset from rural Nepal. We ask two questions: (1) What is the relationship between aspirations and future-oriented behavior? and (2) To what extent are an individual's aspirations associated with the observable characteristics of those around her? We find that aspirations correspond with future-oriented economic behavior as predicted by theory: investment in the future increases with aspirations up to a certain point, but if the gap between one's current status and aspirations becomes too large, investment subsequently declines. We also find that one's aspirations are associated with outcomes of those in her social network of higher, but not lower, status. Together these findings provide empirical evidence that aspirations, which may be a social phenomenon, can either stimulate development or reinforce poverty.

The algorithm that implements the new notation is between 3 and 55 times faster than Dynare++, depending on model size and solution order. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Two cases are studied: strategically sophisticated buyers who are rationally inattentive to exogenous information about quality and strategically naive buyers who are rationally inattentive to strategic information about quality. In both cases, there exists an equilibrium where high quality sellers price high and low quality sellers mimic them by pricing high with a positive probability. This mimicking rate is uniquely identified and determines the informativeness of prices. In general, a drop in the marginal cost of attention results in more informative prices, but I identify conditions for which a drop in the marginal cost of attention can result in less informative prices.

Given the great heterogeneity in delisting operations, we first consider the standard existing typology based on the initiator of the delisting (the stock market authorities, or the firm itself). Second, while managers often cite high compliance costs (especially due to Sarbanes-Oxley Act implementation) as the official reason for the voluntary delisting of their firm, we highlight that firms face different trade-offs in their delisting decision. We also examine the reasons for involuntary delisting, especially the delisting dilemma faced by stock market authorities when the firm violates the listing requirements. Next, we review the economic consequences of delisting in terms of value creation or value destruction for shareholders. Finally, noting gaps in the literature and other contrasting results, we propose suggestions for future research.","[Martinez, Isabelle] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Serve, Stephanie] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy, France",Universite de Toulouse; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Martinez, I (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse, France.",isabelle.martinez1@univ-tlse3.fr,,,,,,,109,20,22,12,84,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In conflicts about environmental justice, offers of monetary compensations for environmental damage can elicit apparently inconsistent responses. On the one hand, offers of monetary compensation for future environmentally harmful activity are the object of protests by those affected who claim that the wrongs to be committed are not open to monetary compensation. On the other hand, failures of compensation for environmental harms done in the past are regarded as a major injustice. This paper argues that these two responses are consistent. It rejects a standard economic view that backward- and forward-looking cases should be treated symmetrically since in each case a level of compensation should be computed that leaves the well-being of actually or potentially affected agents at least as high with the adverse change as it would have been without it. It shows this understanding of compensation is mistaken in both backward-and forward-looking cases. Monetary damages in the legal context are quite consistent with scepticism about monetary valuation of environmental and social goods and harms.","[O'Neill, John] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"O'Neill, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",john.f.o'neill@manchester.ac.uk,,"O'Neill, John/0000-0002-7558-0033",,,,,43,6,6,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Neo-Kaleckian models, which are more appropriately Robinsonian models, postulate an investment function dependent on profitability, and that is partly autonomous from income. Some of these models rely on the importance of profitability, captured by the profit share, to make the case for profit-led growth. For their part, Kaldorian models, which are in our view compatible with Sraffian models, place the emphasis on the accelerator in the determination of investment. More importantly, since investment is a derived demand, that is, ruled by the adjustment of capacity to autonomous demand, there is a tendency to a normal level of capacity utilization. These are supermultiplier models. In our view the Kaldorian approach is better equipped to deal with some of the issues relating income distribution to accumulation with effective demand in an open economy in the long run. We develop an open economy model to examine the conditions under which an increase in real wages can produce wage-led growth, showing that the limit to wage-led expansion is a binding external constraint. The model is unique in emphasizing the role of income distribution in affecting real exchange rates, and it is through this channel that the ambiguous effects of income distribution on growth arise. We also provide some evidence indicating that real wages are positively related to growth, investment, and capacity utilization, and we highlight the role of finance in sustaining expansions suggesting that debt-led growth should not be identified with profit-led growth.","[Perez Caldentey, Esteban] Econ Commiss Latin Amer & Caribbean ECLAC, Financing Unit Dev, Santiago, Chile; [Vernengo, Matias] Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Caldentey, EP (通讯作者)，Econ Commiss Latin Amer & Caribbean ECLAC, Financing Unit Dev, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,63,4,5,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We find a strong relationship between what happens inside the labor market (worker's performance) and what happens outside the labor market (long-term investment). Contrary to the theoretical predictions with selfish preferences, we find that the mere presence of long-term projects acts as an effort-enforcement device; this effect seems to be driven by an increase in long-term employment relationships. In the other direction, long-term labor relationships seem to provide a safer environment for undertaking successful long-term projects. This article also considers three different types of experimental labor contracts. We find that performance-based dismissal barriers, whereby firms are required to retain workers if they have satisfied the effort level required by firms, lead to more long-term employment relationships and higher overall productivity. As theory predicts, the presence of renewable dismissal barriers makes it likely that workers will provide the desired effort level. Firms appear to correctly anticipate this, leading to greater social efficiency.

Economic integration has proceeded on two simultaneous fronts - the market-driven proliferation of regional production networks and value chains and the FTA-driven trade and investment facilitation and liberalization. Economic cooperation and integration has been pursued with increasing intensity since the late 1970s. Much has been achieved as seen in the growing density of movements of goods, services, capital and investments and movements of labor and people well as schemes for closer and deeper cooperation. The still-incomplete AEC will be declared on 31 December 2015. But there is still much work in progress. The AEC Blueprint 2025 highlights the priorities for the AEC for the next decade, eschewing deeper integration through customs union (CU) or common market but taking due consideration of the challenges from globalization and digitization and the clarion call for inclusive and sustainable development.","[Chia, Siow Yue] Singapore Inst Int Affairs, Singapore, Singapore",,"Chia, SY (通讯作者)，Singapore Inst Int Affairs, Singapore, Singapore.",chiasy@singnet.com.sg,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Parents are altruistic but children are purely selfish, and neither side canmake credible commitments. The model is based on Becker's rotten kid specification except that it explicitly accounts for the sequence of decisions. In Becker's world, with a single good efficiency is achieved. We show that when family aid is introduced the outcome is likely to be inefficient. Still, the rotten kid mechanism is at work and ensures that a positive level of LTC is provided as long as the bequest motive is operative. We identify the inefficiencies by comparing the laissezfaire (subgame perfect) equilibrium to the first-best allocation. We first assume that families are identical ex ante and then consider the case where dynasties differ in wealth. We study how the provision of LTC can be improved by public policies. Interestingly, crowding out of private aid by public LTC is not a problem in this setting. With an operative bequest motive, public LTC will have no impact on private aid.

Enrollment in secondary education is used as a proxy for such investments. Controlling for a large number of other determinants of education, it finds that, over the sample period, economic freedom had a substantial positive effect. This is probably because more economic freedom increases the return on investing in human capital, enables people to keep a larger share of the return, and, by facilitating the operation of credit markets, makes it easier for them to undertake such investments in the first place.","[Feldmann, Horst] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Feldmann, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath, Avon, England.",h.feldmann@bath.ac.uk,,"Feldmann, Horst/0000-0002-9402-3996",,,,,75,33,33,0,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Specifically, after a thoughtful consideration of the existing studies, we discuss a number of empirical findings concerning the main determinants of terrorism. Based on previous research there is a belief that religions and especially fanatics is a very significant determinant of an attack. We show that the more democratic and developed countries are inclined to decrease the spread on the returns.

For this purpose, we use administrative data on IVF treated women in Denmark. Because observed chances of IVF success do not depend on labor market histories, IVF treatment success provides a plausible instrument for childbearing.

The interplay of the competition and consumer protection on such a market is subject to harmonization. The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive has been made in order to achieve a full harmonization in this respect in 2007. However, EU member states share different social, political, legal and economic traditions and their approaches to unfair competition, in particular if committed via parasitic commercial practices, are dramatically diverse. In such a context, is it feasible, effective and efficient to install a full harmonization? Purpose of the article: The primary purpose of this article is to describe and assess approaches to unfair competition, in particular if committed via parasitic commercial practices, by the EU law and EU member states law. The secondary purpose is to study and evaluate possibilities for the feasible, effective and efficient harmonization, or their lack. Methods: The cross-disciplinary and multi-jurisdictional nature of this article, and its dual purposes, implies the use of Meta-Analysis, of the critical comparison of laws and the impact of their application, to the holistic perception of historical and national contexts, and to case studies. The primary and secondary sources are explored and the yield knowledge and data are confronted with the status quo. The dominating qualitative research and data are complemented by the quantitative research and data. Findings & Value added: The EU opted for an ambitious challenge to install via the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive a full harmonization of the regime against unfair commercial practices, including parasitic ones. The exploration pursuant to the duo of purposes suggests that the challenge is perhaps too ambitious and that the EU underestimated the dramatic diversity of approaches to unfair commercial practices, especially parasitic ones.","[Pelikanova, Radka MacGregor] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10031 10, Czech Republic",Metropolitan University Prague,"Pelikánová, RM (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10031 10, Czech Republic.",radkamacgregor@yahoo.com,"MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018; MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019","MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146; MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880",GA CR [17-11867S],GA CR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This contribution was supported by GA CR No. 17-11867S Comparison of the interaction between the law against unfair competition and intellectual property law, and its consequences in the central European context.",,17,41,41,1,7,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Estimated carbon prices are higher in China due to differences in emission intensity and in the rate of deployment of new technologies in the models. Differences in carbon prices open up the possibility of carbon trading between the two countries to achieve mitigation objectives. Further, under assumptions about different exchange rate regimes and international fossil fuel prices, the effects of carbon pricing policies on the two economies are mostly similar in terms of direction but, expectedly, different in terms of magnitude. Terms of trade effects could exacerbate carbon pricing effects to a greater degree in China as the country is significantly more dependent than India on external trade and investment. Policymakers should factor in terms of trade effects while designing or evaluating carbon pricing policies in the two countries.","[Pradhan, Basanta K.] Inst Econ Growth, Dev Planning Ctr, Delhi 110007, India; [Ghosh, Joydeep] Inst Econ Modeling Studies, New Delhi, India; SINOPEC Res Inst Petr Engn SRIPE, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liang, Qiao-Mei] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Pradhan, BK (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Growth, Dev Planning Ctr, Delhi 110007, India.",basanta@iegindia.org; jghosh87@rediffmail.com; yaoyf.sripe@sinopec.com; lqmhl@hotmail.com,"Liang, Qiao-Mei/AAF-4556-2021",,,,,,35,24,25,2,50,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We first use the Flow of Funds Accounts to calculate the saving and investment rates (propensity) of the household, corporate and government sectors and to evaluate their relative contribution to the aggregate saving-investment surplus. The results indicate that the increase of saving-investment surplus can be attributed to the steady increase of saving by the household and government sectors and the short-term downsizing of investment by the corporate and government sectors. We then use more disaggregate supplementary datasets to explore the factors behind the evolution of the saving and investment rates for the three sectors. The rise of the household saving rate mainly sources from the urban sector. The corporate saving rate experienced a steady increase because of the rise of profitability. Government macroeconomic policies have had a strong influence on the saving and investment patterns of the corporate and government sectors.","[Xu, Jianwei] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Panpan] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guangrong] Renmin Univ China, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Renmin University of China,"Ma, GR (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",grma@ruc.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303021, 71403278, 71503263]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [14JGC100, 14JGC120]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Foundation,"The authors would like to thank Robert Hill (the editor) and the two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

J,"Gao, JW; Zhao, F",,,,"Gao, Jianwei; Zhao, Feng",,,A New Approach of Stochastic Dominance for Ranking Transformations on the Discrete Random Variable,ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Stochastic dominance; transformation; utility theory; insurance,,"This paper presents some new stochastic dominance (SD) criteria for ranking transformations on a random variable, which is the first time that this is done for transformations under the discrete framework. By using the expected utility theory, the authors first propose a sufficient condition for general transformations by first degree SD (FSD), and further develop it into the necessary and sufficient condition for monotonic transformations. For the second degree SD (SSD) case, they divide the monotonic transformations into increasing and decreasing categories, and further derive their necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively. For two different discrete random variables with the same possible states, the authors obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions for FSD and SSD, respectively. The new SD criteria have the following features: each FSD condition is represented by the transformation functions and each SSD condition is characterized by the transformation functions and the probability distributions of the random variable. This is different from the classical SD approach where FSD and SSD conditions are described by cumulative distribution functions.

For that purpose, we set up a two-stage framework in which two kinds of electricity generators, peak load and base load generators, choose their capacity investment levels first and then compete on the basis of bids in a centralized market to sell electricity to consumers. We use data from the Texas ERCOT to evaluate consumers' welfare. We find that the introduction of capacity payments has two countervailing effects. On the one hand, it increases the wholesale electricity price. On the other hand, it reduces price volatility and increases the reliability of the system. We find that capacity payments are more beneficial for consumers in a perfectly competitive market than in the presence of certain degree of market power. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

When the social planner may impose a compulsory license, optimal royalties either blockade imitation, facilitating unregulated monopoly, or yield an aggregate-zero-profit efficient duopoly. When duopoly is optimal, the optimal per-unit royalty pins the equilibrium price at the aggregate average cost and the optimal fixed royalty shifts surplus so the patentee and imitator break even. Efficient duopoly yields higher welfare than monopoly for sufficiently low invention cost, and may also yield higher welfare than a prize system. Interestingly, royalty payments may be negative. Because of this, efficient duopoly may not be feasible if the planner must instead direct the courts to use such royalties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Bertran, Fernando J.

Particularly, this empirical study evaluates risk aversion spillover dynamics as an uncertainty transmission mechanism for the period 2000-2015 to reveal if there has been a significant change in these dynamics when markets are going through turbulent periods. As a plausible proxy for risk aversion, variance risk premium (VRP) is computed through the difference between expected variances under risk-neutral and physical measures for seven markets studied: United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan. Effects of a shock to U.S. VRP on the other markets' VRPs are evaluated through Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition. Results show that risk aversion spillovers from U.S. to other markets are stronger while the U.S. is going through turbulent periods confirming the intuition that investors are more focused on incidents in the turbulent market. Markets become more connected in terms of sentiments when a country is unexpectedly hit by a major crisis, limiting diversification opportunities.","[Ceylan, Ozcan] Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Dept Business Admnistrat, TR-34217 Istanbul, Turkey",Altinbas University,"Ceylan, Ö (通讯作者)，Istanbul Kemerburgaz Univ, Dept Business Admnistrat, TR-34217 Istanbul, Turkey.",ozcan.ceylan@kemerbugaz.edu.tr,"Ceylan, Özcan/AAC-7225-2019","Ceylan, Ozcan/0000-0003-2924-2903",,,,,20,3,3,1,7,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Therefore, these factors need to be explicitly treated in the integrated assessment models (IAMs). This study improves the representation of curtailment and storage of VRE in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. With the data generated from an hourly power sector model, curtailment and storage of VRE electricity are treated as a function of the shares of solar and wind in the electricity mix. This relationship is incorporated into a CGE model and we also updated the VRE costs and resource potential. The results show that with such improvement, by 2100, in a 450 ppm atmospheric CO2 equivalent concentration (henceforth ppm) scenario, some electricity generated from VRE is either curtailed (2.1%) or needs to be stored (2.9%). In contrast, if VRE fluctuation is not considered, the long-term global economic cost of carbon mitigation is significantly underestimated (by 52%) in the same scenario. Conversely, updating the VRE costs and resource potential leads to a decrease in mitigation costs. Our simulation implies that the fluctuation of VRE cannot be ignored and needs to be incorporated into CGE models. Moreover, in addition to storage with batteries, many other options are available to reduce curtailment of VRE. The top-down type CGE model has limitations to fully incorporate all aspects due to its limited spatial, temporal, and technological resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The key finding is that while there is growth in the number of FTAs with a potentially larger membership than existing FTAs, firms tend to prioritise existing FTAs. Moreover, only a narrow range of products are involved in applications for FTA preferential schemes. As a result, only one-third of exports are covered by such arrangements. The key determinants of firms applying for preferential schemes include tariff margins, the ability to comply with rules of origins (ROOs) and the economic fundamentals influencing trade. Hence, it is less likely for FTAs to open up export opportunities for products that are either yet to be traded or of lowprospective trade volume. Estimates of the costs of complying with ROOs average 8.6 per cent of tariff equivalence. The cost approaches zero for developed countries but is substantially higher for developing nations. The key policy inference is that the export-enhancing effects of FTAs are passive at best, working only after economic fundamentals are established. For us to harness the trade-inducing effects of FTAs, reducing costs incurred from the presence of ROOs from both exporting and importing countries should be the prime focus.","[Jongwanich, Juthathip; Kohpaiboon, Archanun] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",Thammasat University,"Kohpaiboon, A (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",archanun@econ.tu.ac.th,,,Thailand Research Fund,Thailand Research Fund(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)),"The paper is an extension of work on a research project funded by the Thailand Research Fund.

Using a multi-period strategic rational expectations equilibrium framework, I demonstrate that the rule tends to reduce both the amount of insider trading and the amount of profit earned by an informed insider from information-based trades because the rule imposes a constraint on the insider's dynamic trading strategy.

Previous literature has proposed sufficient conditions for a trader to vanish, which depend on pairwise comparisons of traders' discounted beliefs. We propose a novel condition that focuses on the ratio of traders' discounted beliefs and (approximate) equilibrium prices. Unlike existing conditions, ours is both necessary and sufficient for a. trader to vanish and delivers the exact rate at which vanishing traders lose their consumption shares. As an application, we analyze the performance of two intuitive behavioral strategies: the Follow the Leader Strategy that prescribes mimicking the beliefs of the most successful trader, and the Follow the Market Strategy that prescribes to use beliefs which coincide with the state price density. Further, we show that the relative performance of vanishing traders cannot be studied in isolation. Our analysis highlights an intuitive point obscured by the existing conditions: trading in financial markets is qualitatively different from bilateral trading. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the complicated second-best rules are neither optimal nor feasible if informational and administrative costs are taken into account. The simple first-best rules are the optimal feasible in an important class of situations (Informational Poverty), implying that analyses based on first-best assumptions are still relevant for practical policy-making. This is so because, with a reasonable concavity assumption, staying with the first-best rules maximises expected benefit. With more (but not perfect) information, third-best policies are appropriate. Some informal illustrative applications of this third-best theory are provided. In particular, average-cost pricing for public utilities may not be far from the third-best optimum and the necessity to raise government revenue through non-lump-sum taxes need not impose any real distortion.","[Ng, Yew-Kwang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Ng, YK (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, HSS, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",ykng@ntu.edu.sg,"Ng, Yew-Kwang/AAM-1664-2021","Ng, Yew-Kwang/0000-0001-5669-9883",,,,,25,1,1,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The following research hypotheses are tested: /H1/ The relationship between financial sector development (stability) and economic growth is nonlinear; /H2/ An excessively large size of the financial system does not lead to more rapid economic growth: it may even negatively affect GDP dynamics; /H3/ The inclusion of the post-crisis period gives new insights of the nature of the relationship between financial system and economic growth. The analysis covers the 28 EU and 34 OECD economies and the 1993-2013 period. The following variables are used to measure the financial sector: domestic credit provided by financial sector, bank nonperforming loans, bank capital to assets ratio, market capitalization of listed companies, turnover ratio of stocks traded, and the monetization ratio. A new element of the empirical analysis is the application of the extended econometric and economic modelling, including testing nonlinear relationships, analyzing both levels and changes of the financial variables, as well as estimating the models on the basis of a moving panel with overlapping observations. The regression equations are estimated by Blundell and Bond's GMM system estimator.

The results strongly suggest that there exists a quantity-quality trade-off as renewed by Becker, and the trade-off is more pronounced in the economically less developed regions and among families with the same-sex children.

The case of Chile,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,English,Article,,,,,,debt maturity; information asymmetry; panel data,CAPITAL STRUCTURE; INVESTMENT; CHOICE; FIRMS,"Background: The aim of this article is to provide an empirical examination of the determinants of debt maturity over a one year term for Chile. The debt to be considered is that issued as fixed income by Chilean companies listed on the Santiago Stock Exchange. This research is conducted within a theoretical framework of agency costs, tax hypothesis, and debt signaling hypothesis. Methods: To carry out the analysis, we will employ a panel of data based on annual financial information for the period between 2002 and 2012 obtained from Bloomberg. With this, we perform a pooled regression, a model with fixed-effects, and another with random-effects. Results: After analyzing a sample of 434 observations for 50 companies with 52.8% of their debt having a maturity greater than one year, an asset maturity of 29.26 years, and an effective tax rate of 18.2%, we find the following results. The ratio between the market value and the book value is statistically significant and has the expected negative sign. We find that both size and regulation are statistically significant and have a positive sign. The results obtained for the tax variable indicate that it is not statistically significant, which is consistent with international evidence. Furthermore, the estimated coefficient for the maturity of assets is not statistically significant, which contradicts some of the ideas proposed by Myers (1977). The quality variable is statistically significant at the 5 percent level of significance in all of the regressions; however, it does not have the expected negative sign. Finally, most of the results are consistent with the international evidence; hence, the determinants of debt maturity in Chile are similar to those found in other countries, such as the US, the UK and Spain. Conclusions: Large firms (and/or those whose size is regulated) with low growth opportunities have a greater proportion of their debt with a maturity of more than one year. The evidence also suggests that firms exposed to high information asymmetries issue proportionally more short-term than long-term debt. Meanwhile, we found no conclusive evidence that firms seek to match the maturity of their assets with that of their debt, or that they seek to issue debt with a maturity of more than one year in order to take advantage of tax benefits.","[Castaneda Gonzalez, Francisco; Contreras Cortes, Franco] Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Adm & Econ, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"González, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile, Fac Adm & Econ, Santiago, Chile.",francisco.castaneda@usach.cl; franco.contreras1@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,1,1,15,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In this paper we use a Qual VAR, a conventional VAR system augmented with binary policy announcements, to extract a latent indicator of tightening and easing pressure, respectively, for China. The model acknowledges that policy announcements are endogenous and summarizes policy by a single indicator. The Qual VAR allows us to study the impact of monetary policy in terms of unexpected changes in these latent variables, which we identify using sign restrictions. We show that the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the rest of the economy is similar to the transmission process in advanced economies in terms of both output growth and inflation despite a very different monetary policy framework We find that bank loans are not sensitive to policy changes, which implies that window guidance is still a necessary policy tool. We also find that the impact of monetary policy shocks is asymmetric in terms of asset prices, that is, the asset price reactions differ in their sensitivity to tightening shocks and easing shocks, respectively. In particular, an easing of monetary conditions boosts stock prices while a tightening shock leaves stock prices unaffected. This shows that monetary policy is not a suitable tool to stabilize asset prices, which raises implications for financial stability and macroprudential policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The 113% one-semester tuition increase led to an 8% decrease in reenrollment and a similarly-sized reduction in credit accumulation. For students who had been enrolled at least a year prior to the policy change, the price hike caused them to leave college sooner but did not increase their probability of dropping out. Conversely, students who entered college the semester prior to the policy change experienced lasting reductions in attainment, including a 22% decrease in degree receipt compared to students with more college experience at the time of the price shock. Our results suggest that public subsidies that lower college prices can increase degree completion among resource-constrained students who have made the decision to enroll in college, with larger benefits accruing to those who are early in their college careers.

Three computationally heavy steps are involved: (i) simulating the model, (ii) estimating the likelihood and (iii) sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Computational complexity of AB models implies that efficient techniques have to be used with respect to points (ii) and (iii), possibly involving approximations. We first discuss non-parametric (kernel density) estimation of the likelihood, coupled with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. We then turn to parametric approximations of the likelihood, which can be derived by observing the distribution of the simulation outcomes around the statistical equilibria, or by assuming a specific form for the distribution of external deviations in the data. Finally, we introduce Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques for likelihood-free estimation. These allow embedding SMD methods in a Bayesian framework, and are particularly suited when robust estimation is needed. These techniques are first tested in a simple price discovery model with one parameter, and then employed to estimate the behavioural macroeconomic model of De Grauwe (2012), with nine unknown parameters.

Two forms of contractual commitment to a relationship are considered: a promise to trade in the future (contracted quantity); and a promise not to trade with anyone else (contracted exclusivity). A party is said to commit more to a relationship if it commits initially to trade a higher quantity and/or to a higher level of exclusivity. I characterize equilibrium contracts and therefore commitment. Both the ability to signal information through an exclusivity commitment and whether the informed party commits more to the relationship when the relationship is more likely to succeed depend on the source of the asymmetry of information.

Second, we examine the performance of hedging, when one uses a futures contract with time-to-maturity beyond the hedging horizon (i.e. a non-matching hedging strategy). Finally, we quantify the effect of accounting for cointegration and also the time varying volatility in the calculation of optimal hedge ratios. As a robustness check we conduct our analysis using both ex-ante (out of sample) and ex-post (in sample) methods. Our findings suggest that using longer maturity contracts may improve the hedging effectiveness. We also find that accounting for cointegration and time varying prices has minimal effect on the hedge ratio and hedging effectiveness for almost all physical prices.

This axiom requires that awards be additively decomposable with respect to the endowment whenever no agent's claim is filled. For two-claimant problems, restricted endowment additivity essentially characterizes weighted extensions of the proportional rule. With additional agents, however, the axiom is satisfied by a great variety of rules. Further imposing versions of continuity and consistency, we characterize a new family of rules which generalize the proportional rule. Defined by a priority relation and a weighting function, each rule aims, as nearly as possible, to assign awards within each priority class in proportion to these weights. We also identify important subfamilies and obtain new characterizations of the constrained equal awards and proportional rules based on restricted endowment additivity.","[Harless, Patrick] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Harless, P (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",pdharless@gmail.com,,"Harless, Patrick/0000-0002-1981-478X",,,,,42,9,9,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This paper investigates this notion by estimating the time varying relationship between portfolio flows to South Africa and two widely accepted determinants of such flows: the sovereign spread and global risk (measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, henceforth VIX). The results show that the time variation is highly significant and a constant parameter model will give biased estimates of the effects of risk on capital flows. The paper also gives important insights to South African policy makers and financial practitioners: Bond flows (non-resident purchases of South African bonds) have become more sensitive to the VIX after 2010. Share flows were particularly sensitive at the peak of the 2008 global financial crisis, but have at other times not responded in a statistically significant manner to changes in global risk. The relationships are estimated using a time varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP VAR) model with stochastic volatility.","[Kavli, Haakon; Viegi, Nicola] Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Viegi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.",viegin@gmail.com,,"viegi, nicola/0000-0002-7181-6686",Economic Research Southern Africa; South African Reserve Bank,Economic Research Southern Africa; South African Reserve Bank,"The Authors thank, without implicating, Lucrezia Reichlin, Shakill Hassan, Johannes Fedderke and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Two alternative specifications are considered with the shocks of interest being labelled as US (or EA) demand uncertainty and US (or EA) financial market uncertainty. We reach similar conclusions using both specifications: (i) US shocks have an effect on both the local and foreign labour markets while euro area shocks are much less influential; (ii) the US labour market tends to react and absorb shocks more quickly than the labour market in the euro area does.

In contrast, standard models have no role for competitors' ERs. Excluding the effects of competitors' exchange rates typically biases upwards estimates of bilateral exchange rate pass-through because competitors' ERs and bilateral ERs are positively correlated. A multi country version of Atkeson and Burstein's (2008) industry aggregation model is able to explain a sizable proportion of pass-through of competitors' exchange rates to import prices, and also predicts pass-through of foreign competitors' prices and pass-through of competitors' ERs to US producer prices both of which are supported in the data.

I build a model combining four forces in a common framework: (i) sector -biased technological progress, (ii) nonhomothetic tastes, (iii) international trade and (iv) changing wedges between factor costs across sectors. I calibrate the model using the data for 45 diverse countries over the period 1970-2005 and use counterfactual simulations of the model to systematically assess the relative importance of the four determinants of structural change. I find that sector -biased technological change is overall the most important mechanism and it is essential for understanding the decline of manufacturing labor share and the corresponding growth in services in developed countries. Nonhomothetic preferences are key to accounting for movement of labor out of agriculture, which matters primarily for poorer countries. International trade and changes in relative factor costs across sectors are important for individual countries but their impact on the relocation of labor is less systematic. I also show that a model with homothetic preferences would overstate the importance of agriculture in accounting for differences in aggregate productivity across countries and over time.

Using a detailed individual French dataset, we shed lights on the strong feminization of the immigrant workforce which coincides with a rise in the gender wage gap from 1990 to 2010. Our theoretical model predicts that a shift in the supply of female workers increases the gender wage gap when men and women are imperfect substitutes in production. Our structural estimate points to an imperfect substitutability between men and women workers of similar education, experience and occupation. Our econometric result indicates that a 10% increase in the relative supply of immigrant female workers lowers by 4% the relative wage of female native workers belonging to the same education experience group. Accounting for cross-group effects, our simulations show that the rise in the relative number of female immigrants decreases the relative wage of female native workers, thereby contributing to a widening native gender wage gap.","[Edo, Anthony] CEPII, Paris, France; [Toubal, Farid] CEPII, CREST, ENS Cachan, Paris, France",,"Toubal, F (通讯作者)，CEPII, CREST, ENS Cachan, Paris, France.",Anthony.Edo@cepii.fr; ftoubal@ens-cachan.fr,,"Toubal, Farid/0000-0002-9393-2303",iCODE Institute (Idex Paris-Saclay),iCODE Institute (Idex Paris-Saclay),"We wish to thank Michel Beine, Isabelle Bensidoun, Frederic Docquier, Gabriel Felbermayr, Lionel Fontagne, Sebastien Jean, Mariapia Mendola, Gianmarco Ottaviano, Hillel Rapoport as well as participants at the 2016 Royal Economic Society and the 6th International Conference on Economics and Global Interactions for helpful comments.

Tax instruments are simple in that they can only condition on current income. We provide a decomposition of labor income tax formulas into a redistribution and an insurance component. The latter is independent of the social welfare function and determined by the degree of income risk and risk aversion. The optimal linear capital tax is non-zero and trades off redistribution and insurance against savings distortions. Our quantitative results reveal that the insurance component contributes significantly to optimal labor income tax rates and provides a lower bound on optimal taxes.

The FITS-M categorize municipalities into groups of similar localities and provide them with the fiscal indices of their group members, enabling municipalities to use the tables to identify their neighbors (i.e., those in the same FITS-M group) and refer to their fiscal information as a yardstick for fiscal planning. We take advantage of this system to estimate municipal spending function. In particular, we examine whether the FITS-M help identify a defensible spatial weights matrix that properly describes municipal spending interactions. Our analysis shows that they do. In particular, geographical proximity is significant only between a pair of municipalities within a given FITS-M group, and it does not affect competition between pairs belonging to different groups even if they are located close to each other.

Focusing on the four largest euro-area countries, this paper investigates the role of uncertainty for investment dynamics. By doing so, we compare five prominent uncertainty proxies put forward in the recent literature: the (implied) stock market volatility, a survey-derived measure of expectations dispersion, a newspaper-based indicator of policy uncertainty, and two indicators taking up the concept of (econometric) unpredictability. Although all uncertainty measures show countercyclical behavior, we find uncertainty as measured by the conditional volatility of the unforecastable components of a broad set of time series to exhibit noticeable robust effects across different model specifications and countries. Based on this type of uncertainty proxy, we document pronounced negative investment responses to uncertainty shocks. We further show that these effects can explain a relevant portion of the decrease in investment in the course of the Great Recession.","[Meinen, Philipp; Roehe, Oke] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Roehe, O (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",philipp.meinen@bundesbank.de; oke.roehe@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,39,82,83,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

Several well-known parametric and non-parametric approaches are explored partly to shed light on the substantive question and partly to provide a comparative methodological perspective on these approaches. Several statements summarize the outcome of our explorations. First, the widely-used Barro-type regressions do not indicate beta-convergence during the entire period or any of several sub periods. Second, lack of sigma-convergence is also noted in terms of standard deviation of logarithms and coefficient of variation which do not show a decline between 1970 and 2013, but show slight upward trends. Third, kernel density function plots indicate some flattening of the distribution which is consistent with the results from sigma-convergence scenario. Fourth, intra-distribution mobility (gamma convergence) in terms of an index of rank concordance suggests a slow decline in the index. Fifth, the general impression from several types of panel and time-series unit-root tests is that of non-stationarity of the series and thus the lack of stochastic convergence during the period. Sixth, therefore, the overall impression seems to be that of the lack of convergence across states in per-capita energy consumption. The present interstate inequality in per-capita energy consumption may, therefore, reflect variations in structural factors and might not be expected to diminish. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from the Introduction of a Label in Korea,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Price premium; Energy efficiency; Eco-label,CONSUMER; BEHAVIOR,"This study examines the price premium from Korea's Energy Efficiency Grade Label. The Korean government recently began energy certification of televisions, providing a setting to analyze a possible price effect of the new label. Hedonic regression results seem to show that a price premium exists for products with the Energy Efficiency Grade Label. However, potential unobserved heterogeneity is a concern. Difference-indifference and fixed-effects models are used to capture the net effect of the label by controlling for time and product differences. The results suggest that any price premium does not result from the energy efficiency label itself. Instead, energy-efficient products already had higher prices before the introduction of the energy efficiency label. The finding turns our attention to the importance of careful design of labeling programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The novelty of this paper lies in the use of non-normalized cointegrating vectors for labour market analysis. Wages are the basis of labour market models, as well as the key factor for employees and employers; therefore, the central analytical axis is a classical wage bargaining process, where one side requires and the other side proposes a certain level of wages. Analysis is divided into two parts: foremost, a careful analysis of Lithuanian wages is conducted and a univariate model for the investigation of interactions between the minimum wage and the rest of the wages is proposed; only after the minimum wage model is drafted can the multivarate model for the whole economy be built up. Briefly, the methodology used in this article can be annotated as a synthesis of sequential theoretical and empirical considerations that combine the results of theoretical macroeconomics with data-generating patterns and stylized facts. The model is considered as the final one only if macro-theory preconditions, statistical prerequisites, and stylized real-world requirements are met and fulfilled. In addition, this article gives an example and a quantitatively, as well as qualitatively, motivated suggestion as to how to incorporate minimum wages into econometric models and puts forward an explanation for why it is necessary to include minimum wage dynamics into labour market analysis. The article is nothing but an empirical case study that demonstrates how many minor details have to be taken into account until a realistic labour market model is built up. Although the paper deals with the labour market, the suitable application of time series methods is the main subject of the analysis.","[Bartkus, Algirdas] Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Bartkus, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",algirdas.bartkus@ef.vu.lt,,,,,,,19,1,1,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

We first build a model in which workers use proximity to an award threshold to update their beliefs about their own ability, which informs their expected marginal return to effort. The model predicts that effort will be maximized at some point proximal to but above the award threshold in order to maximize the likelihood of winning an award when effort translates into value-added with noise. As the noise in the value-added measure increases, teacher effort becomes less responsive to prior value-added because the value-added score becomes a less reliable measure of ability. Using administrative teacher-student linked data from Houston, we test the central prediction of the model that there should be excess achievement gains near award thresholds. The data strongly reject the existence of such excess gains. We argue that a likely reason for this lack of responsiveness is that the value-added measures used to determine awards were too noisy to provide informative feedback about one's ability.","[Brehm, Margaret; Imberman, Scott A.] Michigan State Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall,486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Lovenheim, Michael F.] Dept Policy Anal & Management, 102 Martha Van Rensselaer Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Imberman, SA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall,486 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",orourk49@msu.edu; imberman@msu.edu; mfl55@cornell.edu,"Lovenheim, Michael F/K-7260-2012",,"National Academy of Education; Spencer Foundation; Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education [R305B090011]; MSU's doctoral training program in the economics of education","National Academy of Education; Spencer Foundation; Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education); MSU's doctoral training program in the economics of education","We would like to thank John Papay, Gary Solon, Jeffrey Wooldridge and seminar participants at CESifo Economics of Education Conference, Michigan State University, University of Arkansas, University of Michigan, the Association for Education Finance and Policy Annual Conference, and the APPAM Fall Conference for helpful comments and suggestions.

Finally, I emphasize the complementarities between these two bodies of work, and suggest some ways to exploit them in order to better understand the evolution of the moral economy of the common people over time.","[Brette, Olivier] Univ Lyon, INSA, Econ, Lyon, France; [Brette, Olivier] CNRS, Res Unit TRIANGLE, UMR 5206, Lyon, France",Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon - INSA Lyon; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite (INRETS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paul-Valery; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Brette, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lyon, INSA, Econ, Lyon, France.;Brette, O (通讯作者)，CNRS, Res Unit TRIANGLE, UMR 5206, Lyon, France.",,"Brette, olivier/HNR-7906-2023","Brette, olivier/0000-0003-4779-7486",,,,,24,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Statistical inference for big data often requires solving thousands or even millions of parallel inference problems simultaneously. This poses significant challenges and calls for new principles, theories, and methodologies. This review provides a selective survey of some recently developed methods and results for large-scale statistical inference, including detection, estimation, and multiple testing. We begin with the global testing problem, where the goal is to detect the existence of sparse signals in a data set, and then move to the problem of estimating the proportion of nonnull effects. Finally, we focus on multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control. The FDR provides a powerful and practical approach to large-scale multiple testing and has been successfully used in a wide range of applications. We discuss several effective data-driven procedures and also present efficient strategies to handle various grouping, hierarchical, and dependency structures in the data.","[Cai, T.

As a consequence, any model of the Galician labour market should include the following explanatory variables: gender, marital status, household size, age, and education level. Using binary logistic regression, we analyze the effect of each variable on probability of job activity in several years (2003, 2007 and 2013); in Galicia (the northwest region of Spain). We show that the probability of job activity increases especially in women during the economic crisis (2013). In addition, men decide to reduce their retirement age during economic growth, whereas they prolong their retirement age during economic crises. Hence sociodemographic changes and economic cycle affect the probability of job activity.","[Carmen Sanchez-Sellero, Maria; Manuel Martinez-Filgueira, Xose] Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain; [Sanchez-Sellero, Pedro] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Business Adm, Sch Engn, Zaragoza, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; University of Zaragoza,"Sánchez-Sellero, MC (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain.",,"Sánchez-Sellero, Pedro/H-4257-2015","Sánchez-Sellero, Pedro/0000-0002-6475-0578; Sanchez Sellero/0000-0003-3730-8415","AEI/FEDER, UE [ECO2016-77843-P, S125]","AEI/FEDER, UE","This research was supported by project ECO2016-77843-P (AEI/FEDER, UE) and S125: Compete Research Group (Government of Aragon/FEDER, UE).",,38,1,1,0,4,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We argue that big data should be perceived as a continuous, unstructured and unprocessed dynamics of primitives, rather than as points (snapshots) or summaries (aggregates) of an underlying phenomenon. Given this, we show that big data can be generated through agent-based models but not by equationbased models. Though statistical and machine learning tools can be used to analyse big data, they do not constitute a big data-generation mechanism. Furthermore, agentbased models can aid in evaluating the quality (interpreted as information aggregation efficiency) of big data. Based on this, we argue that agent-based modelling can serve as a possible foundation for big data. We substantiate this interpretation through some pioneering studies from the 1980s on swarm intelligence and several prototypical agentbased models developed around the 2000s.","[Chen, Shu-Heng] Natl Chengchi Univ, AI ECON Res Ctr, Dept Econ, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Venkatachalam, Ragupathy] Goldsmiths Univ London, Inst Management Studies, London, England",National Chengchi University; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, AI ECON Res Ctr, Dept Econ, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",chen.shuheng@gmail.com,,"Chen, Shu-Heng/0000-0003-4584-7646; Venkatachalam, Ragupathy/0000-0002-1190-6321","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) [MOST 106-240-2410-H-004-006-MY2, MOST 103-2410-H-004-009-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","This work was support for this research in the form of Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) [grant number MOST 106-240-2410-H-004-006-MY2], [grant number MOST 103-2410-H-004-009-MY3].",,80,8,8,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

There are two common problems with traditional DEA. First, traditional DEA fails to adequately distinguish the efficiency DMUs. Second, the DMUs within the same industry are non-homogeneous. This study aims to develop a system-ranking-efficiency model to solve the problems of non-homogeneity and efficiency ranking for DMUs in the same group. The proposed system-ranking efficiency model is based on the concept of boundary change and considers the efficiency DMUs with the greatest influence on the boundary as the most important and, thus, as the ones that should have the highest efficiency ranking. The model is applied in the Taiwan securities industry, in which it was found to successfully rank all the DMUs.","[Chen, Yu-Chuan] Chihlee Univ Technol, Dept Finance, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, Pin Ruei] Hontai Life Insurance Co Ltd, Mkt & Planning Dept, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chiu, Yung-Ho] Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Soochow University,"Chiu, YH (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",ycchen@mail.chihlee.edu.tw; leepin38@gmail.com; echiu@scu.edu.tw,"chiu, yung-ho/H-5231-2019; Zhang, Yi/KCY-9118-2024",,,,,,31,1,1,0,10,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,3,,,,,353,370,,10.2298/PAN130518032C,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FA0PL,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405137700006,0

The data are drawn from Australian cities and was collected during a severe drought. Structural equation modelling is employed to operationalize constructs taken from the theory of planned behaviour and to answer important policy questions related to compliance. The modelled data support the view that attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC) have a positive and significant influence on intentions to comply. PBC has the strongest influence on intentions, suggesting policy directed at assisting households to meet regulatory criteria might be at least as effective as advertising expenditures aimed at shaping attitudes and norms. Importantly, intentions to comply are also shown to have a positive and significant influence on reported compliance behaviour.","[Cooper, Bethany] La Trobe Univ, Sch Business, Ctr Water Policy & Management, Wodonga, Australia; [Cooper, Bethany] Univ South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia",La Trobe University; University of South Australia,"Cooper, B (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Sch Business, Ctr Water Policy & Management, Wodonga, Australia.;Cooper, B (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",b.cooper@latrobe.edu.au,"Cooper, Bethany/E-5425-2016","Cooper, Bethany/0000-0002-7484-1772",,,,,79,18,19,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Schumpeter himself constructed his theory on the basis of his (neglected) conception of conscious rationality, which considers the process of thinking as composed of conscious/deliberate and unconscious/automatic components. The prevalence of the deliberate over the automatic component can occur in different degrees; as a consequence, individuals exhibit different levels of conscious rationality. Schumpeter makes clear that an essential attribute of democracy is its being a system of government capable of working notwithstanding a low degree of conscious rationality among its citizens. Given this condition, the process of political communication and persuasion can lead to two very different outcomes: a fair social construction of the democratic institutions, in which the struggle for the vote is achieved through a critical debate among leaders and citizens; and an unfair construction, based on the prevalence of emotive forces of persuasion over rationality and on cheating of the leaders at the expense of their citizens. Schumpeter suggests that the main element that fosters a fair construction is the effectiveness of competition, which can advance the rational elements in the political debate and the self-determination of the citizens' will: a slow process that - he warns - may be effective only in the long run, and does not preserve democracy from the risk of decline.","[Egidi, Massimo] LUISS Guido Carli, Viale Pola 12, I-00198 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Egidi, M (通讯作者)，LUISS Guido Carli, Viale Pola 12, I-00198 Rome, Italy.",megidi@luiss.it,"Egidi, Massimo/AAI-3266-2021","Egidi, Massimo/0000-0003-4998-4138",,,,,39,1,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

On panel data estimations, we find that the evidence tends to support Schumpeterian explanations of productivity growth for a panel of countries including both developed and developing countries, and a panel of South African manufacturing sectors. By contrast, semi-endogenous productivity growth is supported for a panel of OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) manufacturing sectors. However, we also report evidence that suggests that sectors are not homogeneous. For this reason, time series evidence may be more reliable than panel data. Time series evidence for South Africa suggests that prospects for the sustained productivity growth associated with Schumpeterian innovation processes, is restricted to a narrow set of sectors. For the OECD manufacturing sectors, both semi-endogenous and Schumpeterian growth finds support. Schumpeterian growth is present for a larger number of sectors than for South Africa, and is most prevalent in the North American economies.","[Fedderke, Johannes W.] Penn State Univ, Econ Res Southern Africa, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Liu, Yang] Peking Univ, Ctr New Struct Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Peking University,"Fedderke, JW (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Econ Res Southern Africa, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jwf15@psu.edu; yangliu@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"Fedderke, Johannes/N-1411-2019","Fedderke, Johannes/0000-0003-4482-5939",,,,,42,2,3,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

To explain such seemingly contradictory observations, this study develops a simple model utilizing the 'keeping up with Joneses' effect regarding schooling decisions. The main result of this study is that the model can have multiple equilibria, which can explain the difference between the two groups of countries. Moreover, efficiency analysis reveals that changes in the strength of education reference and psychological cost parameters can alter the welfare ranking of multiple equilibria.

This especially concerns large-scale enterprises with diversified spatial structure. Currently, an enterprise localization analysis constitutes not only an element of strategic management of enterprises, but it should also be a subject of activity of regions willing to look for investors in an active manner. On the one side, business entities search for locations that meet their needs. On the other side, regions offer investment areas to accelerate regional development. Local authorities do not decide on an enterprise localizations, but they can create operating conditions to a certain extent (e.g. equipment with technical infrastructure or labor force for entrepreneur and investor's needs). Therefore, there is a need for application of new solutions or at least modification of localization management methods. Here, we present the study on an application of modified McKinsey matrix for spatial analysis using an original concept of regional strategic groups. The regional sfrategic groups constitute the cluster of regions with similar sector attractiveness, as well as competitive position or potential. The objective of the study was to create a new methodological model in an enterprise localization analysis, based on regional sfrategic groups. Also, we demonstrated application options of the proposed tool in management of enterprise sfrategic options for automotive sector in NUTS 2 level regions in the EU.","[Godlewska-Majkowska, Hanna] Warsaw Sch Econ, Niepodleglosci 162 St, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Komor, Agnieszka] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Akad 13 St, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Godlewska-Majkowska, H (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Niepodleglosci 162 St, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",hanna.godlewska@sgh.waw.pl; agnieszka.komor@up.lublin.pl,"Komor, Agnieszka/U-6054-2018","Komor, Agnieszka/0000-0002-7532-3141; /0000-0003-3841-1596",,,,,79,3,3,1,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The novelty of the design allows me to study the extent to which voting methods defeat the Condorcet loser and elect the Condorcet winner in a repeated-game, divided majority setting. I assess and compare the performance of three voting mechanisms, Approval Voting, Borda Count, and Plurality Voting under two information structures. Voters either know the preference structure in the electorate or hold no information regarding other voters' preferences. With enough experience, the number of elections won by the Condorcet loser is fairly low across voting methods and information structures. Approval Voting and Borda Count dissolve information imperfections efficiently and allow voters to implement the Condorcet winner, independently of the underlying information structure. The frequency with which the Condorcet winner is elected under Plurality Voting crucially depends on available information. When voters are uninformed about the preference structure in the electorate, Plurality Voting fails to implement the Condorcet winner. This is costly and decreases total welfare.

The late industrializers are deindustrializing at earlier stages of development than their predecessors, and the global trends in the gender composition of manufacturing and industrial employment are evolving. What is less well known is how these two trends are related to one another. Starting from the premise that industrial upgrading has been observed to have a male bias, we test the hypothesis that premature deindustrialization is likely to amplify that bias. For the empirical test and simulation, we use an economy's global competitive position as a proxy for the deindustrialization regime type. To get to this position, we bring together the work of Nicholas Kaldor, feminist scholarship, and structuralist critiques. The results for sixty-two countries, spanning the years from 1990 to 2013, support our hypothesis that premature deindustrialization is likely to amplify the male bias of industrial upgrading.","[Greenstein, Joshua] Hobart & William Smith Coll, Econ, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; [Anderson, Bret] Southern Oregon Univ, Econ, Ashland, OR USA",,"Greenstein, J (通讯作者)，Hobart & William Smith Coll, Econ, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.",,,,,,,,49,10,12,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We find that uncertainty about firm parameters decreases trading volume but increases bid-ask spreads and price bouncing in the cross-section and across time. In addition, the panel VAR results show that parameter uncertainty has negative forecasting power for future bond liquidity, with greater uncertainty in the current month leading to lower trading volume, higher bid-ask spreads and higher price fluctuations on subsequent months.

Findings - The settlement model out of four alternative models is the best fit model in both Korea and Indonesia. The nexus of experience-settlement is not similar between Korea and Indonesia. The nexus of cost-saving-settlement is similar between two countries. Practical implications - The field manager and policy maker get useful information from the findings. In particular, Korea and Indonesia belong to different cultural clusters. Originality/value - This study contributes to the mediation literature through the suggestion of hypothesized model of relationship maintenance intention in mediation.","[Ha, Hong-Youl] Dongguk Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jang-Gyem] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Malay Indonesian Interpretat & Translat, Yongin, South Korea; [Chung, Yongkyun] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Chunchon, South Korea",Dongguk University; Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Kangwon National University,"Chung, Y (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Chunchon, South Korea.",ykchung1204@gmail.com,"Ha, Hong-Youl/F-3445-2018",,,,,,102,1,1,0,2,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We enrich this model in three ways: (1) We compare estimates obtained using a broader definition of innovation spending to those that use R&D spending. (2) We assume that a firm simultaneously innovates and chooses among different appropriability methods to protect the innovation. (3) We estimate the impact of innovation output on firm productivity conditional on the choice of appropriability mechanism. We find that firms that innovate and rate formal methods for the protection of intellectual property highly are more productive than other firms, but that the same does not hold in the case of informal methods of protection, except possibly for large firms as opposed to SMEs. We also find that this result is strongest for firms in the services, trade, and utility sectors, and negative in the manufacturing sector.","[Hall, Bronwyn H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] IFS, London, England; [Hall, Bronwyn H.] NIESR, London, England; [Sena, Vania] Univ Essex, Essex Business Sch, Colchester, Essex, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Essex,"Hall, BH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Hall, BH (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Hall, BH (通讯作者)，IFS, London, England.;Hall, BH (通讯作者)，NIESR, London, England.",bhhall@berkeley.edu,"Hall, Bronwyn/JFK-7284-2023","Hall, Bronwyn Hughes/0000-0002-3802-5567",UK Intellectual Property Office,UK Intellectual Property Office,This work was funded by the UK Intellectual Property Office.,,44,54,55,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Further, results from independent evaluators suggest that a possibly dishonest action taken after it is announced is more likely to be perceived as dishonest than an equivalent action absent the announcement. Consequently, requiring announcements promotes honest actions among people who care about maintaining an honest self-image. Finally, a type-classification analysis shows that the mixture of maximum cheating and honest types best characterize the cheating behavior, suggesting that incomplete cheating reported in the literature is not an intrinsic preference for being honest, but may rather be due to a preference for appearing honest.

In our setting, substitutable preferences are sufficient to guarantee the existence of stable outcomes; moreover, in contrast to results for the setting of many to -one matching with contracts, if any agent's preferences are not substitutable, then the existence of a stable outcome can not be guaranteed. In many-to-many matching with contracts, a new market design issue arises: The design of the contract language can impact the set of stable outcomes. Bundling contractual primitives encourages substitutability of agents' preferences over contracts and makes stable outcomes more likely to exist; however, bundling also makes the contractual language less expressive. Consequently, in choosing contract language, market designers face a tradeoff between expressiveness and stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a new estimation strategy based on a two-part model to decompose behavioral differences between exiting and surviving firms. Young firms contribute most to net job creation, despite high relative exit rates, due to high growth rates among young surviving firms. Small firms have similar job creation rates conditional on survival as large firms. Small firms' contribution to job creation is, however, smaller due to higher exit rates. The up-or-out dynamics characterizing less regulated economies such as the US also apply to the more regulated Austrian economy. During the Great Recession both the relative net job creation rate conditional on survival and the relative survival probability of young firms decreased. The relative contribution of small firms to net job creation, by contrast, increased due to increased relative job creation rates of small firms conditional on survival.","[Huber, Peter; Oberhofer, Harald; Pfaffermayr, Michael] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Huber, Peter] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Brno, Czech Republic; [Oberhofer, Harald] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Pfaffermayr, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Pfaffermayr, Michael] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Mendel University in Brno; Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Innsbruck; Ifo Institut,"Oberhofer, H (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",huber@wifo.ac.at; harald.oberhofer@wu.ac.at; michael.pfaffermayr@uibk.ac.at,"Pfaffermayr, Michael/AAR-2786-2020","Pfaffermayr, Michael/0000-0002-8558-7757; Huber, Peter/0000-0001-6263-6395; Oberhofer, Harald/0000-0003-1575-7164","Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) [13370, 14383]",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"We are very grateful to Eric Leeper, an associated editor, three anonymous referees, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin and Javier Miranda for their excellent comments on earlier versions of this paper and valuable discussions.

Structural equation modelling is a statistical technique developed to fit the model to the survey data and can help by exploring direct and indirect relationships among more latent variables. Structural model, which was used by authors for questionnaire evaluation, is focused on the influence of university entrepreneurial education and personal attitude on the wish to become an entrepreneur. The results are based on the relevant part of questionnaires which were answered by the respondents at University of West Bohemia. The results confirmed the most of outputs assumptions but one of them is different. The university environment, supporting the students' entrepreneurial activities, is not important for students' decision to become an entrepreneur. The strongest dependency for this decision results from latent variable - attractiveness of the future career as entrepreneur which is subjective.","[Ircingova, Jarmila; Martincik, David; Vacek, Jiri] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Ircingová, J (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Univ 22, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",jircingo@kpm.zcu.cz; martinci@kem.zcu.cz; vacekj@kpm.zcu.cz,"Vacek, Jiri/AAO-9430-2021",,UWB grant [SGS-2016-034],UWB grant,This article was supported by UWB grant SGS-2016-034 Current trends in the management of organisations and in entrepreneurship.,,11,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,205,212,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500023,0

Once local incentive compatibility is satisfied, the problem of verifying global incentive compatibility is shown to be isomorphic to the problem of comparing two classes of distribution functions. Thus, tools from choice under uncertainty can be brought to bear on the problem. The approach allows classic justifications of the first-order approach (FOA) to be proven using the same unifying methodology. However, the approach is especially useful for analyzing higher-dimensional moral hazard problems. New and more tractable multi-signal justifications of the FOA are derived and implications for optimal monitoring are examined. The approach yields justifications of the FOA in certain settings where the action is multidimensional, as in the case when the agent is multitasking. Finally, a tractable multitasking model with richer predictions than the popular but simple linear-exponential-normal model is presented.","[Kirkegaard, Rene] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Guelph,"Kirkegaard, R (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON, Canada.",rkirkega@uoguelph.ca,,,Canada Research Chairs programme; SSHRC,Canada Research Chairs programme(Canada Research Chairs); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I thank the Canada Research Chairs programme and SSHRC for funding this research.

This was achieved using the Australian IELab, where data used in this study are available (https://ielab.info/resources/91). Four multi-regional, environmentally extended supply-use tables regionalised in different ways were produced to demonstrate the flexibility of tailoring input-output models to specific research or policy questions. Results for satellite coefficients are sensitive to the chosen regional grouping and method for regionalisation. We demonstrate the relevance of such purpose-built information to government and corporate decision-makers by analysing the indirect economic and employment consequences of a slowdown of the mining boom in Western Australia. The demonstrated innovations in flexibility and timeliness will help move past some of the limitations that have historically hindered the uptake and utility of applied input-output analysis.","[Lenzen, Manfred; Geschke, Arne; Malik, Arunima; Fry, Jacob; Wiedmann, Thomas] Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, ISA, Camperdown, NSW, Australia; [Wiedmann, Thomas] UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil Assessment Program SAP, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lane, Joe] Univ Queensland, Global Change Inst, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Lane, Joe] Univ Queensland, Dow Ctr Sustainable Engn Innovat, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Lane, Joe; Kenway, Steven] Univ Queensland, Sch Chem Engn, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Hoang, Khanh; Cadogan-Cowper, Andrew] Australian Bur Stat, Belconnen, ACT, Australia",University of Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Wiedmann, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Phys, ISA, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.;Wiedmann, T (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil Assessment Program SAP, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",t.wiedmann@unsw.edu.au,"Lenzen, Manfred/D-3161-2013; Malik, Arunima/IZE-7937-2023; Geschke, Arne/AAM-7434-2020; Fry, Jacob/AAD-2959-2021; Wiedmann, Thomas/C-9158-2011; Lane, Joe/G-8434-2011; Lane, Joe/AAU-7551-2020; Kenway, Steven/J-8031-2013","Malik, Arunima/0000-0002-4630-9869; Geschke, Arne/0000-0001-9193-5829; Fry, Jacob/0000-0002-2349-6745; Wiedmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6395-8887; Lane, Joe/0000-0001-9938-8030; Kenway, Steven/0000-0002-2095-9388","National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project (NeCTAR) through its Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory; Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP0985522, DP130101293]; ARC [LE160100066]",National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project (NeCTAR) through its Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory; Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); ARC(Australian Research Council),"This work was financially supported by the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources project (NeCTAR) through its Industrial Ecology Virtual Laboratory, and by the Australian Research Council (ARC) through its Discovery Projects DP0985522 and DP130101293.

We also compute the fiscal projections of several parametric pension reforms, including the reform which will start in 2017. To avoid a deficit without reform, pension benefits would have to be substantially reduced.

The subject of criticism has become the neoclassical concept of A. C. Pigou, which admits only voluntary unemployment. In the 1930s, Keynes rejected the claims of neoclassical economics and viewed unemployment as a result of a deficiency of aggregate demand. M. Friedman considered unemployment as the result of state interventions and social security system. The empirical analyzes show that unemployment varies with the real GDP changes during the economic cycle, as it was explained by A. Okun.

We provide a mechanism for regulators and investors to rank fund managers based on what they hide in positions.","[Malladi, Rama] Kubera Investments LLC, Irvine, CA USA; [Fabozzi, Frank J.] EDHEC Business Sch, Finance Dept, Nice, France",Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Fabozzi, FJ (通讯作者)，EDHEC Business Sch, Finance Dept, Nice, France.",FABOZZI321@aol.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A sign-restricted structural vector autoregression model with a penalty function is estimated to identify the four possible shocks. While positive global demand and globalization shocks are both expansionary, they have opposite effects on inflation. A positive commodity market specific shock dampens real GDP growth and is inflationary, suggesting a possible Dutch disease response. A negative global supply shock suppresses both output growth and inflation. All but the last shock leads to a significant declining interest rate. Monetary policy contraction is recommended for the first shock and expansion for the others.","[Mangadi, Kagiso; Sheen, Jeffrey] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University,"Mangadi, K; Sheen, J (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia.",kagiso.mangadi@mq.edu.au; jeffrey.sheen@mq.edu.au,,"Sheen, Jeffrey/0000-0001-6855-557X",,,,,26,2,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper analyzes the optimal design of thin capitalization rules in the presence of financial frictions when a host country, in the first stage, chooses the type of thin capitalization rule and then, in the second stage, decides about the strictness. We show that welfare under a safe haven rule is higher than under an earnings stripping rule if firms are not able to manipulate the interest rate on internal loans. Welfare, however, can be higher under an earnings stripping rule if firms are able to manipulate the interest rate on internal loans. We also show that the optimal level of internal interest deductions decreases with the financial development of the host country.

In the article, the situation is represented by macroeconomic factors such as final consumption expenditure of households and gross national savings in 2007-2014. All factors are firstly examined from the point of view of suitability - stability of statistical data based on a year-on-year growth or recession and average figures. These results are compared and further, the reliance of the consumption expenditures on gross domestic product is assessed by way of statistical apparatus (Pearson's Correlation Coefficients). The goal of the assessment is to discover reliance of the consumption expenditure of the households on productivity of the economy or the relation between savings and the productivity of the economy.","[Mares, David; Dlaskova, Gabriela] Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Mares, D (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",mares.dav@volny.cz; dlaskovag@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,970,980,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300097,0

Although this implies curtailment at high wind speeds, we show that over installing generation facilities can increase returns to investors and reduce system costs. A detailed model-based analysis is developed using British data, with variations in the range of over installation, the renewable policy support systems (fixed feed-in tariffs or green certificate premia to wholesale energy prices) and the extent of replacement of fossil generation in the technology mix with wind. In the cases of premia to market prices, we use agent-based, computational learning and risk simulation to model market prices. Not only is over installation beneficial under fixed feed-in tariffs, but is more so under premia to market prices and increasingly so as wind replaces fossil generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Amount of organizations who reported serious breach has also risen (from 9% in 2015 to 17% in 2016) (PricewaterhouseCoopers 2016). To achieve their goals criminals are using different techniques starting from Social engineering (phishing, whaling) and finishing with malware execution (such as ransomware) on target machines. Recent attacks (attack on Central Bank of Bangladesh, fraud attack on Mattel CEO and attack on Thailand state-run Government bank ATM) show, that criminals are very well organized, equipped and spend a lot of money and time to prepare their attacks. To protect themselves organizations are required to ensure security in depth principles and implement complex Security solutions, which are able to ensure the needed level of information security in appropriate costs. However, information security cost-benefits assessment is complicated, because of lack of structured cost-benefit methods and issues with comparing IT security solutions in light of prevailing uncertainties. Existing methods are oriented on processes, environment lifecycles or specific standard implementations. Because of that, existing methods do not cover all needed security areas and methods reusability is a complicated task. Trying to solve this issue, we have proposed a new method for information standards implementation costs evaluation, based on information security controls.","[Olifer, Dmitrij; Kaceniauskas, Arnas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Fundamental Sci, Dept Graph Syst, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Goranin, Nikolaj; Cenys, Antanas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Fundamental Sci, Dept Informat Syst, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Olifer, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Fundamental Sci, Dept Graph Syst, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",dmitrij.olifer@vgtu.lt,"Čenys, Antanas/ABC-1904-2021; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Cenys, Antanas/0000-0002-0208-7176; Goranin, Nikolaj/0000-0002-2263-3947; Kaceniauskas, Arnas/0000-0001-9264-4142",,,,,27,6,13,2,24,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We estimate a dynamic model of R&D choice using data for German firms in high-tech manufacturing industries. The model incorporates a measure of the firm's financial strength, derived from its credit rating, which is shown to lead to substantial differences in estimates of the costs and expected long-run benefits from R&D investment.

Averaging across all firms, the long-run benefit of investing in R&D equals 6.6% of firm value.

The framework assumes a single-good economy with fixed production coefficients. It differs from the contemporary Ricardian theory (i. e. Sraffa's) in three ways: (i) the real wage is depicted as the economic outcome of competition in the labour market; (ii) the allocation of the net product between wages and profits is determined with no obligation to fix exogenous variables of distribution; and (iii) the model suggests an innovative concept of surplus labour to define profit apart from the labour theory of value.

Within this setting, and following the recent entry of Lithuania in the European Monetary Union, the aim of the article is twofold. First, it studies how shocks are transmitted differently in the two regions, considering the recent common monetary policy. It then analyzes how Lithuanian macroprudential policies should be conducted in the context of the EMU. The proposed macroprudential tool is a decentralized Taylor-type rule for the LTV which responds to national deviations in output and house prices. Given the features of Lithuania's housing market, common shocks are found to be transmitted more strongly in this country than in the rest of the euro area. In terms of macroprudential policies, results show that the optimal policy in Lithuania with respect to the euro area may have a different intensity and that it delivers substantial benefits in terms of financial stability.","[Rubio, Margarita] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Comunale, Mariarosaria] Bank Lithuania, Div Res, Dept Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Nottingham; Bank of Lithuania,"Rubio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",margarita.rubio@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Rubio, Margarita/0000-0002-1525-9766",,,,,40,8,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We find evidence for export hysteresis and the presence of high sunk costs associated with exporting. However, the magnitude of this effect has become lower when controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity using a dynamic random effect probit model suggesting that not addressing the unobserved heterogeneity can lead to an overestimation of the coefficient of the sunk costs. Moreover, we find no evidence of self-selection into exporting when controlling unobserved firm heterogeneity and unlike to most previous studies. On the other hand, we find strong robust evidence in support of the learning-by-exporting.

A large literature on economic development has collected evidence on both directions. This paper discusses a class of general equilibrium models that deals with natural resource discoveries and evaluates its potential to accommodate both successful and unsuccessful resource-based industrialization experiences, under different model settings. Particularly, it analyzes the importance of disentangling price and quantity effects. It illustrates that in closed model economies (or large open economies), with vertical integration between manufacturing and energy sectors, the long-run effect on the production of manufacturing goods will depend mainly on the equilibrium price of the natural resource good. Moreover, the strength of the vertical integration, even for small open economies, determines the limits to accommodate blessing or curse type of theories. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Two research hypotheses concerning the quantity and structure of good practices introduced by Polish enterprises in the individual areas of the CSR have been postulated. A survey of Mazovian enterprises conducted in 2014-2016 and a national survey by the Responsible Business Forum have been used to verify the hypotheses. The analysis implies enterprises increasingly often implement good CSR practices. What is more, most actions taken are intended to improve working conditions of their staff and to improve quality of local communities where the enterprises operate. The theoretical section of the paper applies a critical review of CSR literature, whereas the empirical part utilises statistical analysis of data derived from the author's email survey and secondary research by the Responsible Business Forum.","[Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna] Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Econ & Legal Sci, Chrobrego31 St, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Wolak-Tuzimek, A (通讯作者)，Kazimierz Pulaski Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Econ & Legal Sci, Chrobrego31 St, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",awt@uthrad.pl,"Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna/AAK-6383-2021","Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna/0000-0002-2998-909X",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1863,1872,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300186,0

Based on counterfactual analysis, the model decomposes the gains from importing into a static revenue effect, resulting from improved quality and variety of available inputs, and a dynamic productivity effect, resulting from improved productivity. Empirical results from a Colombian plant-level dataset show that both the static and dynamic effects are important sources of gains from importing. It is also shown that the two types of trade liberalization, either by reducing the import tariff or by reducing sunk and fixed costs of import, both have a substantial impact on firm value.","[Zhang, Hongsong] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, 906 KK Leung Bldg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, HS (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, 906 KK Leung Bldg, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"li, bo/JJC-2664-2023; /H-8946-2013",/0000-0001-9787-6970,,,,,44,11,12,2,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

To manipulate implicit communication, we introduce random noise so that proposers cannot infer responders' decisions unless we disclose these. We find that responders reject low offers not only because they disapprove them but also because they want to demonstrate their disapproval. Proposers anticipate this effect and make higher offers to evade rejection. In a second study, proposers forward random offers rather than make their own offers. We thus exclude disapproval of the proposer's choice as a motive of rejection. Our results show that responders refrain from rejecting random offers as rejection might make them appear envious.

If adaptive (imitative) R&D is subject to the CIA constraint, then a decrease in the Southern nominal interest rate will reduce (raise) the rate of Northern innovation and the extent of FDI while raising (reducing) the rate of Southern imitation.

The underinvestment in mitigation actions depends on market and policy failures and the absence of price signals internalizing the economic losses due to climatic damage. This contributes to underestimating potential benefits from global action. In this paper we discuss how crucial is the assessment of the vulnerability of a country to climate change in defining the threat and action strategies. A dynamic climate-economy CGE model is developed that includes a monetary evaluation of regional damages associated with climate change. By considering alternative damage profiles, results show that internalizing climatic costs might change the bargaining position of countries in climate negotiations. Consequently, damage costs should be given greater importance when defining the implementation of a global climate agreement.","[Costantini, Valeria; Paglialunga, Elena; Sforna, Giorgia] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Via Silvio Amico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [Costantini, Valeria] CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France; [Markandya, Anil] Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Leioa, Spain",Roma Tre University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Costantini, V (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dept Econ, Via Silvio Amico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.;Costantini, V (通讯作者)，CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France.",valeria.costantini@uniroma3.it,"Paglialunga, Elena/ABD-4495-2020; Paglialunga, Elena/ISB-5979-2023; Markandya, Anil/K-9381-2013; Costantini, Valeria/I-8461-2016; COSTANTINI, VALERIA/AHA-2817-2022","Paglialunga, Elena/0000-0002-3874-0712; Costantini, Valeria/0000-0001-6249-3099; Sforna, Giorgia/0000-0003-3988-8839","EU D.G.

In contrast, this article develops five new and concrete proposals for effective strategies against terrorism: (i) strengthening decentralization; (ii) encouraging fighters to leave the terrorist camp; (iii) reducing the incentives to enter terrorist groups; (iv) negotiating with terrorist groups; and (v) reducing media attention. The advantages and disadvantages of these strategies for curbing terrorism are discussed. They certainly are no panacea to solve terrorist threats.

The results provide evidence that the text messaging programs reach the parents of traditionally less-resourced children and show that program design affects parent opt out.

Horizontal power originates from network centrality and is associated with resource access whereas vertical power originates from principal-principal agency conflicts and is associated with exploitation of minority shareholders. We highlight the impact of horizontal and vertical power through their interaction effects with transparency and disclosure (TD) practices on fixed investments and performance in Russian firms. We find that TD and horizontal power or connectedness are substitutes, while whereas TD and vertical power are complements in their effects on fixed investment and firm performance.

We use administrative data to motivate three approaches to causal inference. The marginal propensity to consume SNAP-eligible food (MPCF) out of SNAP benefits is 0.5 to 0.6. The MPCF out of cash is much smaller. These patterns obtain even for households for whom SNAP benefits are economically equivalent to cash because their benefits are below their food spending.

The result arises in the commitment equilibrium of a model with intergenerational altruism. By implication, the article offers a novel theory of deterrence and defence policy. It shows that in the absence of informational constraints, there is a unique army size that is sufficient for deterrence. Under informational restrictions, a pooling equilibrium may exist where a victim with strong intergenerational altruism overinvests in its army, while the victim with a more limited altruism free rides on the information gap of the predator and builds a smaller army. Conditions for the existence of a separating equilibrium are established in terms of the cost of war. It turns out that the optimal defence policy need not satisfy the deterrence requirement.

To this aim, we perform testing the unit root properties of this variable using both traditional unit root tests and the recently developed technique of the Fourier transformation function or simply known as the FADF test developed by Enders and Lee (2012), which not only takes into account for the existence of structural breaks but also that of non-linearity in the energy consumption series of these countries. The results from the traditional unit root tests fail to reject the null hypothesis of non-stationarity while that of the Fourier ADF unit root test which is more powerful has strongly rejected the null hypothesis of unit root for all the countries except Bahrain and Qatar. In sum, the results from this test indicate that the energy consumption variables of these countries are characterised by a stationary process and this has important policy implications. This suggests that these random shocks will have only a transitory effect on the energy consumption per capita of these countries.","[Osman, Mohamed; Gachino, Geoffrey] Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Hoque, Ariful] Murdoch Univ, Murdoch, WA, Australia",University of Dubai; Murdoch University,"Hoque, A (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Sch Business & Governance, Murdoch, WA, Australia.",a.hoque@murdoch.edu.au,"Hoque, Ariful/ABB-2497-2020","Hoque, Ariful/0000-0001-8369-6653",,,,,50,5,5,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Their application is effortless, selecting only few key inputs with the greatest informative power from the large list of possible indicators. Our paper identifies the financial distress predictors for 5 post-communist countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania) based on information collected from the Amadeus database for the period 2011-2013 using CHAID decision trees and neural networks. We propose a short list of indicators, which can offer a synthetic perspective on corporate distress risk, adapted for these countries. The best prediction models are substantially different from country to country: in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania the flow-approach indicators perform better, while in Bulgaria and Croatia - the stock-approach indicators. The results suggest that the extrapolation of such models from one country to another should be made cautiously.

The model generates a rich set of predictions including productivity cut-offs for formal and informal firms to operate within different industries. We allow fixed costs to vary across industries, resulting in overlapping productivity distributions between formal and informal firms in the aggregate, but strict duality within industries. In doing so, we are able to generate and test predictions with regard to heterogeneity in informality across industries for the case of Indian manufacturing establishments. Consistent with the model, we find that the overlap between formal and informal establishments in the aggregate is larger than the overlaps within industries. Informality tends to decrease with average industry productivity and establishment size. Finally, more productive industries have greater overlaps in productivity between formal and informal establishments.","[Allen, Jeffrey] Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, 185 Adamian Acad Ctr, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Nataraj, Shanthi] RAND Corp, 1776 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Schipper, Tyler C.] Univ St Thomas, Dept Econ, 2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Bentley University; RAND Corporation; University of St Thomas Minnesota,"Schipper, TC (通讯作者)，Univ St Thomas, Dept Econ, 2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",jeffallen19@gmail.com; snataraj@rand.org; schi0195@stthomas.edu,,"Schipper, Tyler/0000-0002-3987-0981",,,,,25,11,12,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We find evidence that government spending tends to be counter-cyclical conditional on temporary shocks and pro-cyclical conditional on permanent shocks. We also find no evidence that developing countries are systematically different from developed ones in terms of fiscal policy. We propose an extended dynamic and stochastic RBC model assuming a fiscal reaction function to the output gap and a measure of debt sustainability. The fiscal impulse response to a permanent (temporary) shock is positive (negative) as the effect on debt sustainability (current output gap) dominates.,"[Barhoumi, Karim; Cherif, Reda; Rebei, Nooman] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Rebei, N (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",KBARHOUMI@imf.org; ACHERIF@imf.org; NREBEI@imf.org,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We find evidence for two kinds of peer effects: being observed by a peer can postpone the decision to give up, while observing a peer can be informative and have more sustainable effects. In particular, we show that successful peers affect perseverance positively if they communicate their success in a motivating way and negatively otherwise. Our experimental results suggest that peers affect perseverance indirectly, via influencing self-confidence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by mounting evidence of the historical persistence of institutions and behavior, this paper studies the historical origins of this health variation. We examine the long-term consequences of the Protestant medical missionary enterprise that spread throughout India in the nineteenth century. Protestant mission medicine sought to place itself within non-European social and institutional milieus, contributing to the diffusion of Western medicine among the local population. We construct a novel fully geocoded dataset that combines contemporary individual-level data with historical information on missionary activities. We document a robust positive association between proximity to a Protestant medical mission and current individuals' health outcomes. Our analysis indicates that this long-run link is not driven by religious conversion or persistence of infrastructure, but possibly by improvements in individuals' health potential and changes in hygiene and health habits.","[Calvi, Rossella] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Mantovanelli, Federico G.] Anal Grp, Boston, MA USA",Rice University; Analysis Group Inc.,"Calvi, R (通讯作者)，Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA.",rossella.calvi@rice.edu; federico.mantovanelli@analysisgroup.com,,,,,,,94,24,25,0,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

This has forced many central banks in the developing world to adopt innovative policy measures to address concerns related to financial instability caused by the volatile nature of capital flows. In 2010 Turkish Central Bank included financial stability in addition to price stability as one of primary goals of its monetary policy. Several macro-prudential measures had been taken and corridor system' of setting the short-term policy rates had been introduced. In this paper, we have estimated an extended Taylor rule, using error correction model, to examine the impact of global financial factors in impacting the setting up of the policy rate in the pre and post 2010 periods in Turkey. It has been found that in the post-2010 period, global financial factors and monetary policy stance of the core economy, USA, have become major factor(s) in shaping up the monetary policy. Particularly our results of variance decomposition show that global financial indicators such as, VIX and EMBI have taken prominence in the setting of the short-term policy rate. This has not only made the domestic monetary more dependent on external factors but has also made pro-cyclical in nature.","[Daglaroglu, Tolga] Gazi Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Demirel, Baki] Gaziosmanpas Univ, Dept Econ, Tokat, Turkey; [Mahmud, Syed F.] Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Gazi University; Gaziosmanpasa University; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Mahmud, SF (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",syed@bilkent.edu.tr,"demirel, baki/AAD-7252-2020",,,,,,70,7,7,1,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2018,45.0,4,,,,,747,763,,10.1007/s10663-017-9388-0,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX1UO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447504200005,0

A number of studies have assessed whether the context, particularly the level of unemployment and immigration, impacts support for the extreme right and found contradictory results. We argue in this paper that these contradictions might simply result from differences in the scale used to assess the context. We systematically test the impact of immigration and unemployment, measured at various scales, on extreme right voting and attitudes towards immigrants and immigration, using two alternative approaches with data for Belgium. In the concentric approach, we measure the unemployment and the presence of migrants within various radii around each respondent's residence. In the polarized approach, we consider the actual polarization of space, using the very local scale (statistical district), the living pool (municipality), and the employment pool. We show that the scale choice changes the results and that the most significant impacts are generally found at intermediary scales.","[David, Quentin] Univ Lille Sci & Technol, CNRS, UMR 9221, LEM, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Pilet, Jean-Benoit] ULB, CEVIPOL, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,Cp 124, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Van Hamme, Gilles] ULB, IGEAT, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,Cp 246, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"David, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Lille Sci & Technol, CNRS, UMR 9221, LEM, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",quentin.david@univ-lille.fr; jpilet@ulb.ac.be; gvhamme@ulb.ac.be,"David, Quentin/AEN-1093-2022","David, Quentin/0000-0002-0543-1649",,,,,64,13,14,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,NOV,2018,71.0,4,,,,,509,536,,10.1111/kykl.12183,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW5QR,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446991700001,0

Accordingly, Chinese investors have more opportunities to hold foreign assets in US dollars and face currency risk in their portfolios. In this paper, we investigate the difference between fully hedged and unhedged portfolios consisting of 10 different risky asset datasets from 2006 to 2014 from the perspective of Chinese investors. The empirical results show that the fully hedged portfolios have significantly higher Sharpe ratios than the unhedged ones. In terms of economic benefit, a risk-averse investor would be willing to pay more per year to construct the fully hedged portfolio. For instance, using the equal-weighted portfolio strategy, investors are willing to pay more than 7.2% and 3.3% annually to eliminate the RMB currency risk in terms of CNY and CNH, respectively. Moreover, according to the outcomes in subperiods and time-varying rolling estimations, we conclude that currency hedging in portfolio management will become increasingly important during RMB internationalization.","[Du, Jiangze] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, 169 East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jying-Nan] Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, 2 Chongwen Rd, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Yuan-Teng] Shanghai Business Sch, Res Ctr Finance, 2271 West Zhong Shan Rd, Shanghai 200235, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Int Business Sch, 620 Changan Rd, Xian 710119, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Chongqing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Shanghai Business School; Shaanxi Normal University; University of Hong Kong,"Wang, JN (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, 2 Chongwen Rd, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China.",jiangzedu@jxufe.edu.cn; wangjn@cqupt.edu.cn; yuanteng.hsu@gmail.com; mskklai@outlook.com,"Wang, Jying-Nan/AAE-4984-2020; Hsu, Yuan-Teng/Q-3546-2019; Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022","Wang, Jying-Nan/0000-0002-2315-2520; Hsu, Yuan-Teng/0000-0001-8805-3964; Lai, Kin Keung/0000-0003-0014-2095","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71561012, 71471029, 71661011]; Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province [JD16063]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities & Social Science in Jiangxi Province,"The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the editor and the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions, which helped improve the quality of the paper tremendously.

The proposed methodology allows to take into account a firm's choice of both exporting and non-exporting a product to a destination and to consider different forms of product complementarity that can generate product combinations. The empirical analysis uses a panel of transactions level data for the universe of Italian and French firms and complements the existing evidence along a few dimensions. First, we show that there is a high level of sparsity: selection of products at destination is indeed very severe. Second, we document that firms export several different combinations of product vectors across markets. Relatedly a high level of diversity is detected also when considering the intensive margin, pointing to a substantial departure from a stable global product hierarchy. Finally, we provide evidence that at the same time there exists a stable component in firms' product vectors across destinations composed by products which are not necessarily the most important in terms of sales, suggesting rich form of complementarities across goods. Products belonging to this stable component are less likely to be discarded as a consequence of an exogenous shock such as the dismantling of the MFA quotas after accession of China to the WTO.

Covering the period 1991-2005, we find evidence that becoming an importer of foreign intermediates boosts energy efficiency, implying beneficial effects for the environment.","[Imbruno, Michele] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, Bd F Mitterrand 65, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Imbruno, Michele] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Ctr Res Globalisat & Econ Policy, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Ketterer, Tobias D.] European Commiss, Secretariat Gen, Brussels, Belgium",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); University of Nottingham,"Ketterer, TD (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Secretariat Gen, Brussels, Belgium.",michele.imbruno@uca.fr; tobias.ketterer@ec.europa.eu,"Imbruno, Michele/AAR-9387-2020",,Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; CrisisLab project - Italian government,Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the program Investissements d'avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); CrisisLab project - Italian government,"The authors are grateful to Nathan Nunn, the editor in charge, and to the anonymous referees for their stimulating suggestions to earlier version of this paper.

In addition to permanent damages to public and private capital, the disaster causes temporary losses of productivity, inefficiencies during the reconstruction process, and damages to the sovereign's creditworthiness. We use the model to study the debt sustainability concerns that arise from the need to fully rebuild public infrastructure over the medium term and analyze the feasibility of ex ante policies, such as building adaptation infrastructure and fiscal buffers, and contrast these policies with the post-disaster support provided by donors. Investing in resilient infrastructure may prove useful, in particular if it is viewed as complementary to standard infrastructure, because it raises the marginal product of private capital, crowding in private investment, while helping withstand the impact of the natural disaster. In an application to Vanuatu, we find that donors should provide an additional 50% of pre-cyclone GDP in grants to be spent over the following 15 years to ensure public debt remains sustainable following Cyclone Pam. Helping the government build resilience on the other hand, reduces the risk of debt distress and at lower cost for donors.","[Marto, Ricardo] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Papageorgiou, Chris; Klyuev, Vladimir] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",University of Pennsylvania; International Monetary Fund,"Marto, R (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Papageorgiou, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",rmarto@sas.upenn.edu; cpapageorgiou@imf.org; vklyuev@imf.org,,"Klyuev, Vladimir/0000-0002-0697-1444",U.K.'s Department for International Development (DFID),U.K.'s Department for International Development (DFID),"We thank the Editor Andrew Foster, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants in various conferences for their suggestions.

Based on a propensity score matching approach, we estimate that retailers that start to import have 8% greater sales, 6% greater profits, and 2% greater markups in the year of import initiation compared to non-importing retailers. These differences are quite persistent. For instance, we estimate that cumulative sales of import starters are up to 30% higher on average after three years than for comparable non-importers. We also find that imports are associated with a higher exit probability of small retailers and greater local retail market concentration. We argue that the observed adjustments may imply additional gains from trade absent from models lacking a distribution sector. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the theory to impartial general-sum two player games called bidding games, showing the existence of pure subgame-perfect equilibria (PSPE). In particular, we show that PSPEs form a semilattice, with a unique and natural Bottom Equilibrium. Our main result shows that if only two actions available to the players in each node, then the Bottom Equilibrium has additional properties: (a) utilities are monotone in budget; (b) every outcome is Pareto-efficient; and (c) any Pareto-efficient outcome is attained for some budget. In the context of combinatorial bargaining, we show that a player with a fraction of X% of the total budget prefers her allocation to X% of the possible allocations. In addition, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Bottom Equilibrium of a binary bidding game. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The seller seeks to implement a profit-maximizing non-linear pricing scheme, which includes the time at which the good is shipped to the consumer. If the buyer discounts future payoffs and the seller does not, then delayed shipments act as an almost-perfect substitute for complete information and the monopolist can extract almost all of the surplus from trade. Shipping policies thus serve as a powerful tool of enhancing price discrimination. However, if the seller is as patient as, or even only slightly more patient than, the buyer, then she cannot benefit from delaying allocations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In an egg production plant in rural Peru, workers produce output combining effort with inputs of heterogeneous quality. Exploiting variation in the productivity of inputs assigned to workers, we find evidence of a negative causal effect of an increase in coworkers' daily output on own output and its quality. We show theoretically and suggest empirically that the effect captures free riding among workers, which originates from the way the management informs its dismissal decisions. Our study and results show that input heterogeneity and information on input quality contribute to determine the shape of incentives and have implications for human resource management, production management, and the interaction between the two.

Both of these features may exert a greater labor market pressure on native workers to immigrant inflows in Hong Kong compared to other local markets. Moreover, over the past three decades, new immigrants in Hong Kong are disproportionately less educated youths from Mainland China who are admitted through the one-way permit scheme for family reunion. In this paper, we introduce an immigrant exposure measure capturing the extent of exposure of natives in a given skill group to immigrants in terms of occupational competition, and identify the effects of immigration on natives' employment and earnings by relating the changes in natives' employment and earnings across skill groups to their changes in the immigrant exposure measure. To address the potentially endogenous responses of workers to occupational demand shocks, we further construct the projected immigrant exposure measure applying the lagged skill-group specific occupational employment structure to the contemporary skill distribution and employ it as a Bartik-style instrument. We find that competition from immigrants reduces the employment prospect of native females but not that of native males. However, for native males competition from immigrants yields significant adverse earnings effects, whereas for native females such earnings effects - though still negative are smaller in magnitude and less often statistically significant.","[Cheng, Yuk-Shing; Zhang, Hongliang] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University,"Zhang, HL (通讯作者)，WLB 520,34 Renfrew Rd, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hongliang@hkbu.edu.hk,"Cheng, Yuk-shing/AAY-5469-2020","Cheng, Yuk-shing/0000-0002-6420-4411; Zhang, Hongliang/0000-0002-6159-5234",Natural Science Foundation of China [71403233],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors thank Pak Wai Liu, Kai Chung Mok, Xiangdong Wei, participants at the 8th International Symposium on Human Capital and Labor Markets, the editor and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and feedback.

If unimpeded, entry and exit of firms should restore profits to competitive levels. This dynamic process is influenced by regulations that temporarily or permanently impede competition. We study how product market regulations (PMR)as measured by the OECDaffect competition by their impact on the profit persistence (Wolfl et al. in Ten years of product market reform in OECD countries-insights from a revised PMR indicator, 2009, Product market regulation: extending the analysis beyond OECD countries, 2010). To examine profit dynamics, we follow the methodology developed by Mueller (Economica 44(176):369-380, 1977), which measures both the short run persistence of profits and the long run permanent rents. The method can be used to measure: (1) short run transitory rents; (2) long run permanent rents. To this end we use firm level data from 30 OECD countries over the period 1998-2013. Results show that PMR increase the permanent rents of firms but we find no significant effect on short run profit persistence. We conclude that PMR negatively influence competition and increase permanent rents, resulting in misallocation of resources.","[Eklund, Johan E.; Lappi, Emma] Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Grevgatan 34,3rd Floor, S-11453 Stockholm, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.] Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden; [Eklund, Johan E.; Lappi, Emma] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden",Blekinge Institute Technology; Jonkoping University,"Eklund, JE (通讯作者)，Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Grevgatan 34,3rd Floor, S-11453 Stockholm, Sweden.;Eklund, JE (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, Sweden.;Eklund, JE (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Jonkoping, Sweden.",johan.eklund@entreprenorskapsforum.se; emma.lappi@entreprenorskapsforum.se,"Lappi, Emma/AFS-7709-2022; Eklund, Johan/HPC-9141-2023","Lappi, Emma/0000-0002-3950-931X;",Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg foundation,Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg foundation,"We gratefully acknowledge support from Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg foundation and Rune Andersson, MellbyGardAB for research support.

AN EVALUATION USING BOUNDARY DISCONTINUITIES,JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CLASS SIZE; STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT; RESOURCES; QUALITY; DESIGN; MATTER,"This study exploits spatial anomalies in school funding policy in England to provide new evidence on the impact of resources on student achievement in urban areas. Anomalies arise because the funding allocated to Local Education Authorities (LEA) depends, through a funding formula, on the 'additional educational needs' of its population and prices in the district. However, the money each school receives from its LEA is not necessarily related to the school's own specific local conditions and constraints. This implies that neighbouring schools with similar intakes, operating in the same labour market, facing similar prices, but in different LEAs, can receive very different incomes. We find that these funding disparities give rise to sizeable differences in pupil attainment in national tests at the end of primary school, showing that school resources have an important role to play in improving educational attainment, especially for lower socio-economic groups. The design is geographical boundary discontinuity design which compares neighbouring schools, matched on a proxy for additional educational needs of its students (free school meal entitlement - FSM), in adjacent districts. The key identification requirement is one of conditional ignorability of the level of LEA grant, where conditioning is on geographical location of schools and their proportion of FSM children.

Early scholars of peer-to-peer networks posited the possibility of a total network collapse due to issues of free-riding. When these networks are used to distribute copyrighted material illegally, the increased risk of legal punishment adds a further disincentive to contribute. This paper uses Ostrom's (2005) framework to categorize the rules used in pirate communities to solve collective action problems, evidencing the applicability and robustness of Ostrom's framework for self-governance under less favorable conditions.

Multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis, which links producers and final consumers, is a widely-used method for quantifying the EEIT. However, the role of intermediate trade in driving changes in the EEIT is still not fully incorporated in MRIO analysis and as a result poorly understood. Here, we present a framework that separately identifies the drivers of the emissions embodied in the trade of final and intermediate products. We implement this framework in a case study in which we analyse the changes in CO2 emissions embodied in interprovincial trade in China from 2007 to 2012. We find that the largest changes are a rising final demand, which is associated with increased emissions that are to some extent offset by decreasing emissions intensity and changing interregional dependency. The rising imports and the growth in final demand in less developed regions in the north and central (e.g., Hebei and Henan) led to reductions in the CO2 emissions outsourced by central coastal regions. The framework enriches our understanding of the role played by intermediate trade in the relocation of emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

I use a machine learning approach to infer diagnosis from purchases of diabetes-related products. On average, households show significant, but relatively small, calorie reductions. These reductions are concentrated in unhealthy foods, suggesting they reflect real efforts to improve diet. There is some heterogeneity in calorie changes across households, although this heterogeneity is not well predicted by demographics or baseline diet, despite large correlations between these factors and diagnosis.

We use the model to construct indexes of firm-level demand, marginal cost, and fixed cost. The empirical results indicate substantial firm heterogeneity in all three dimension with demand being the most dispersed. The firm-specific demand and marginal cost components account for over 30% of market share variation, 40% of sales variation, and over 50% of price variation among exporters. The fixed cost index is the primary factor explaining differences in the pattern of destination markets across firms. The estimates are used to analyse the supply reallocation following the removal of the quota on Chinese footwear exports to the EU. This led to a rapid restructuring of export supply sources on both the intensive and extensive margins in favour of firms with high demand and low fixed costs indexes, with marginal cost differences not being important.","[Roberts, Mark J.] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Roberts, Mark J.; Xu, Daniel Yi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xu, Daniel Yi] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Fan, Xiaoyan] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shengxing] London Sch Econ, London, England",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Duke University; Fudan University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Roberts, MJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,NSF [SES-1125963]; ESRC [ES/P004237/1] Funding Source: UKRI,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Amit Khandelwal, Jan De Loecker, the editor Stephane Bonhomme, and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Friedman (seconded by Edmund Phelps) argued that the long run is determined by ` structural' forces, not demand, and his view swept the profession and dominated academic economics and macro policymaking for four decades. Friedman, tragically, put macroeconomics on the wrong track which led to disaster: secular stagnation, rising inequality, mounting indebtedness, financial fragility, a banking catastrophe and recession-and no free lunches. This is Friedman's legacy. We have to unlearn the wrong lessons and return macroeconomics to the right track. To do so, this paper shows that Friedman's (and Phelps's) conclusions break down in a general model of the long run in which productivity growth is endogenous aggregate demand is driving everything again, short and long.","[Storm, Servaas] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"Storm, S (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands.",,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO 1600007],Institute for New Economic Thinking,"The author is grateful to the Institute for New Economic Thinking for financial support (under individual grant #INO 1600007).

The results show that: (1) industrial activity was the largest stimulating factor in industrial CO2 emissions. Investment intensity and R&D intensity changes displayed overall positive effects in emissions growth but with some fluctuations in different periods and provinces. (2) Energy intensity was the prominent factor to facilitate emissions reduction, followed by the R&D efficiency. The two factors contributed to a considerable decrease in industrial CO2 emissions. (3) Among all factors, energy structure effect was the weakest, and showed alternative influencing directions in different periods and provinces. (4) The effects exerted from various factors were distinctly varied in different economic stages and provinces. And generally, the curbing effects cannot counteract the promoting effects. Finally, the empirical results show that continue to decrease energy intensity, facilitate the investment and R&D efforts aiming at energy-saving and emission-reduction, and reduce the reliance on coal while further raise the renewable energy utilization are beneficial to alleviate industrial CO2 emissions.

Correlations between wealth and employment are close to zero or moderately positive. However, incomplete markets models with a standard utility function counterfactually generate a strongly negative relationship between wealth and employment. Using a fairly standard incomplete markets model calibrated to match the distribution of wealth, I find that government transfers and capital income taxation increase the (non-targeted) correlations between wealth and employment substantially, bringing the model closer to the data. As the model's fit with the distribution of wealth and employment improves, I find that the precautionary motive of labor supply is mitigated, thereby raising aggregate labor supply elasticities substantially.

Volatile rates of emissions across sectors are further manifestations of this uneven structure. The purpose of this study is two-fold: first, we check for dynamic patterns of convergence of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions across sectors; and second, using evidence from panel data econometrics, we search for the determinants of these processes utilizing macroeconomic explanatory variables. We find that, based on various alternate criteria, CO2 emissions display conditional convergence mainly driven by the business cycle. Furthermore, across sectors, high technology activities display convergence over time; and yet, medium technology sectors that constitute the bulk of the aggregate value added display either poorly convergent or divergent trends. These results reveal that much of the emissions convergence is driven by the business cycle rather than the workings of discretionary mitigation policy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Sample size requirements when using artificial neural networks for discrete choice analysis,JOURNAL OF CHOICE MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODELS,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are increasingly used for discrete choice analysis. But, at present, it is unknown what sample size requirements are appropriate when using ANNs in this particular context. This paper fills this knowledge gap: we empirically establish a rule-of-thumb for ANN-based discrete choice analysis based on analyses of synthetic and real data. To investigate the effect of complexity of the data generating process on the minimum required sample size, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo analyses using a series of different model specifications with different levels of model complexity, including RUM and RRM models, with and without random taste parameters. Based on our analyses we advise to use a minimum sample size of fifty times the number of weights in the ANN; it should be noted, that the number of weights is generally much larger than the number of parameters in a discrete choice model. This rule-of-thumb is considerably more conservative than the rule-of-thumb that is most often used in the ANN community, which advises to use at least ten times the number of weights.","[Alwosheel, Ahmad; van Cranenburgh, Sander; Chorus, Caspar G.] Univ Technol, Dept Engn Syst & Serv, Transport & Logist Grp, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Alwosheel, A (通讯作者)，Univ Technol, Dept Engn Syst & Serv, Transport & Logist Grp, Delft, Netherlands.",a.s.alwosheel@tudelft.nl,"Chorus, Caspar/K-6667-2012",,King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST),King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST),The authors would like to thank King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) for supporting this work.,,53,177,193,4,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

We propose an original game in which patients may sue their physician for medical malpractice, and physicians have to choose between two alternative treatments, with different levels of benefits and risks. The safer treatment is also the less effective, therefore its provision corresponds, under the assumptions of our model, to practicing negative defensive medicine. We study the Nash equilibria, test their stability in the replicator dynamics, and analyze their welfare properties. We find that the accuracy of the judicial system plays an important role, with possible counter-intuitive effects related to legal reforms. If the court is not sufficiently accurate, defensive medicine can be favored, paradoxically, by an increase in the probability that defensive physicians are sanctioned by the court. A similar outcome can be generated also by an increase in the compensation paid to patients by physicians, when sanctioned for medical malpractice.","[Antoci, Angelo; Maccioni, Alessandro Fiori; Russu, Paolo] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSea, Via Muroni 25, I-07100 Sassari, SS, Italy",University of Sassari,"Maccioni, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSea, Via Muroni 25, I-07100 Sassari, SS, Italy.",antoci@uniss.it; alex.fiori.maccioni@gmail.com; russu@uniss.it,"Antoci, Angelo/AAG-2800-2021","Antoci, Angelo/0000-0003-3719-0437; Fiori Maccioni, Alessandro/0000-0002-2080-7405; russu, paolo/0000-0002-6999-7617",,,,,38,8,8,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Nevertheless, establishing and determining reference frames are not extensively analyzed in the literature; rather, in most applications, it is simply assumed that the reference frames can be represented through the status quo. This assumption, however, may lead to biased results, as not only the status quo affects reference frames, but also previous experiences or expectations, among many others. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to estimate the reference frame directly as an unobserved latent variable. Unfortunately, current utility functions utilized to depict this kind of behavior are not useful for this purpose, as they are defined piecewise. This work proposes a smooth twice-differentiable utility function that indeed allows estimating reference frames. Further, this function satisfies all major properties of prospect theory. Finally, the approach is tested relying on three case studies. They show that in the context of semi-compensatory loss-averted decision-making reference frames may diverge from the status quo.","[Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Cologne, Germany; [Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Deutsch Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Energy Transportat & Environm Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Technical University of Berlin,"Bahamonde-Birke, FJ (通讯作者)，Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Cologne, Germany.;Bahamonde-Birke, FJ (通讯作者)，Deutsch Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Energy Transportat & Environm Dept, Berlin, Germany.;Bahamonde-Birke, FJ (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",bahamondebirke@gmail.com,,"Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco/0000-0001-8325-8055",,,,,40,0,0,1,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

In fact, the results of the long-term model show that the growth has a significant and positive impact on CO2 emissions in the four countries. VECM Granger causality analysis offer conflicting evidence on the links between renewable energy use and economic growth which supported the feedback hypothesis. This finding has vital consequences regarding energy and economic policy, as it suggests that renewable energy use do not seem to damage economic growth and development in these countries.","[Ben Mbarek, Mounir; Saidi, Kais] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, St Airport,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia; [Feki, Rochdi] Commercial High Sch Sfax, Airport Rd Km 45 3018,BP 1081, Sfax, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax; Universite de Monastir; Universite de Sfax,"Ben Mbarek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, St Airport,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",mounirbenmbarek.fsegs@gmail.com; saidi.saidi2014@gmail.com; rochdi.feki@escs.rnu.tn,,,,,,,41,16,15,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

Using IMF de facto exchange rate regime classifications over the period 1980-2012 for up to 193 countries, it is shown that growth collapses are more frequent under less flexible exchange rate regimes, and particularly hard pegs. Amongst intermediate regimes, those with recent devaluations are less likely to experience a growth collapse, which confirms the role of exchange rate adjustment in reducing the output effects of a negative shock.

We borrow a set of centrality measures from Network Theory's tools to describe how the structure of the system has evolved over time and to identify which countries have been in the core or in the periphery of the network. Performing partitions on the different types of accounts and transactions characterizing the EU ETS, we investigate whether intermediaries have affected the overall structure of the system. From the analysis of the European Union Transaction Log data over the period 2005-2012, we find that some national registries (France, Denmark, Germany, United Kingdom, The Netherlands) were much more central than others in the network. Empirical evidence, moreover, shows that some account holders strategically opened additional accounts in the more central registries, thus reinforcing their centrality in the network. Finally, it turns out that Person Holding Accounts (PHAs) have played a prominent role in the transaction of permits, heavily influencing the configuration of the system. This motivates further research on the impact of non-regulated entities in the EU ETS design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This slowdown in the rate of decline is puzzling in light of evidence that the performance of microprocessor units (MPUs) has continued to improve at a rapid pace. Over the course of the 2000s, the MPU prices posted by Intel, the dominant producer of MPUs, became much stickier over the chips' life cycle. As a result of this change, we argue that the matched-model methodology used in the PPI for MPUs likely started to be biased after the early 2000s and that hedonic indexes can provide a more accurate measure of price change since then. MPU prices fell rapidly through 2004 on every price measure we present, with the PPI declining at an even quicker pace than the hedonic indexes. However, from 2004 to 2009, our preferred hedonic index fell faster than the PPI, and from 2009 to 2013 the gap widened further, with our preferred index falling at an average annual rate of 42 percent, while the PPI declined at only a 6 percent rate. Given that MPUs currently represent about half of U.S. shipments of semiconductors, this difference has important implications for gauging the rate of innovation in the semiconductor sector.","[Byrne, David M.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA; [Oliner, Stephen D.] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA; [Oliner, Stephen D.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Sichel, Daniel E.] Wellesley Coll, Wellesley, MA 02181 USA; [Sichel, Daniel E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Wellesley College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Byrne, DM (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board Governors, 21st & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",david.m.byrne@frb.gov,,"Byrne, David/0000-0001-8226-5181",,,,,41,11,12,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The team is hierarchical in that one player (the principal) retains the exclusive right to terminate the project while the other player (the agent) focuses strictly on implementing the project assigned. As a key departure from the existing literature, we assume that the principal may be privately informed about the project quality. In contrast to the literature, the belief in our model generally follows a non-monotonic path: while each failure makes the agent less confident in the project, the uninformed principal drops out gradually over time, which partially restores the agent's motivation. We derive explicit solutions for the agent's effort and the principal's exit decisions, which allow us to obtain a full characterization of the equilibrium.

We address the potential endogeneity concerns endemic in much of the existing literature by constructing an instrument for power outages based on the varying share of electricity produced by hydro-power as a result of variation in the local climate conditions. Using firm-level data for 14 countries from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, we find evidence of a negative relationship between an unreliable electricity supply and firms' sales, with a stronger effect for firms that do not own a generator. We find that reducing average outage levels to those of South Africa would increase overall sales of firms in Sub-Saharan Africa by 85.1%, rising to 117.4% for firms without a generator.","[Cole, Matthew A.; Elliott, Robert J.

Similar conclusions arise from a qualitative study of 7 sub-Saharan African countries in the sample that built resilience since the 1990s.","[Delechat, Corinne; Fuli, Ejona; Mulaj, Dafina; Ramirez, Gustavo] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Xu, Rui] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Xu, Rui] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; Stanford University; International Monetary Fund,"Deléchat, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",cdelechat@imf.org,,"Delechat, Corinne/0000-0002-5303-8454",,,,,58,5,5,4,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Our framework allows for incentives to be either rewards or punishments. For our basic model we obtain a unique equilibrium, which typically involves randomization by both principals. Greater similarity between principals leads to more aggressive competition. The principals weakly prefer punishment to rewards, sometimes strictly. With rewards an agent voluntarily joins both groups; with punishment it depends on whether severe punishments are feasible and cheap for the principals. We study whether introducing an attractive compromise reduces competition between principals. Our framework of imperfect monitoring offers a natural perturbation of the standard common agency model of menu auctions, which results in sharper equilibrium predictions. The limit equilibrium prediction provides support to both truthful equilibria and the competing notion of natural equilibria, which unlike the former may be inefficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, if all parties reject the agreement, then full investment is attainable via a gentlemen's agreement or memorandum of understanding (MOU).

Initially, the game consists of in-group players who enjoy an existing public good and out-group players who may subsequently enter the group. Motivated by different current migration flows and anti-immigration sentiments, our treatments are crafted to investigate how migrants' power of self-determination and public debate among in-group players shape immigration requirements. We employ the minimal group paradigm and immigration requirements are set by in-group voting. In order to immigrate, out-group players have to fulfill minimal contribution requirements. Public debate fosters coherence between the requirements and in-group players' contributions if migrants are free to reject requirements. Conversely, public debate among in-group players fosters economic exploitation of migrants with less bargaining power. Overall the study illustrates the novel potential of applying well-established tools from experimental economics to migration questions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using a panel regression approach that accounts for heterogeneity across industries, we estimate that between 1999 and 2011, the rise in China's import share of manufactured goods lowered UK import price inflation by around 0.5 percentage points per year-we call this the ` tailwind'. Rising imports from other EME country groups are not found to have any significant impact. Our approach allows us to decompose this effect: two-thirds arises from the direct impact of switching to lower-cost Chinese goods; the remaining third comes from other exporters lowering their prices in response to stronger competition from China. We find no evidence that higher inflation rates in EMEs has so far reduced or reversed the sign of this tailwind.","[Lewis, John; Saleheen, Jumana] Bank England, London, England",Bank of England,"Lewis, J (通讯作者)，Bank England, Res Hub, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",john.lewis@bankofengland.co.uk,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The difference between them is that the improvement of productivity of listed banks presents a typical technology-driven feature, and changes in scale efficiency negatively affect productivity. The productivity of non-listed banks shows scale efficiency driving features. The meta-frontier efficiency of listed banks is significantly higher than the others. After decomposing the technology gap ratio, we find that the current production technology of the listed banks is closer to the potential production technology frontiers, and there is space for the non-listed banks to improve their efficiency.

Emerging young VCs may have more incentives to grandstand through initial public offerings (IPOs) in the stock market. We examine grandstanding and IPOs on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 5 June 2006 and 10 May 2012 when deregulation allows explosive growth of VCs in China. We find that grandstanding is mainly by the private VCs and has noticeable impact on the two stock exchanges. Furthermore, private VCs heavily grandstand through speculation of newly listed stocks rather than through underpricing among early IPOs. Joint investment by private and non-private VCs may effectively inhibit the speculation of new stocks.

However, the state-led promotion of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in China is providing an innovative solution. This paper looks at financing innovations in China such as industrial funds and asset-backed securitisation for PPP projects. Particularly, this paper empirically studies the characteristics of project revenue bonds and PPP asset-backed securities (PPP-ABS) in China. The study finds that the majority of social investors remain state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and returns on whole business securitisation (WBS) of projects could vary with the volume issued and the credit of the company. Securitisation not only solves the problem of limited source of financing, but also improves the efficiency of management. While securitisation of PPP projects can succeed in tapping social capital to invest infrastructures, the banking system should handle with caution the credit risk and default risk caused by rising leverage of PPP special purpose vehicles (SPVs).","[Yu, Po Shan] Soochow Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zuo Zhang] Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Soochow University - China; Soochow University - China,"Chen, ZZ (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dongwu Business Sch, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",chenzuozhang@suda.edu.cn,"Yu, Poshan/ADZ-7706-2022","Yu, Poshan/0000-0003-1069-3675",,,,,57,5,5,0,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We apply this model to study Basel III countercyclical capital requirements and their implications for banking stability and household welfare. We introduce three different countercyclical capital rules. The first countercyclical capital rule responds to credit to output ratio. The second countercyclical rule reacts to deviations of credit to its steady state, and the third rule reacts to credit growth. The second rule proves to be the most effective tool in dampening credit supply, housing demand and household debt as well as in enhancing the banking stability by ensuring that banks have higher bank capital and capital to asset ratio. After conducting a welfare analysis we find that the second rule outranks the other ones followed by the first rule, the baseline and the third rule respectively in terms of welfare accumulation.

Complementing existing energy policy literature, this paper investigates the impact of conflict involvement of major oil suppliers on RD&D expenditures in biofuels among import dependent economies, i.e. geopolitically induced investments. Utilizing the recently released data set on Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS), our sample comprises information on 12 EU member states from 1997 to 2014. Among those we find that RD&D expenditures in biofuels are positively associated with the conflict involvement of the respective country's major oil supplier. The results are robust across different model specifications and measurements of conflict. We argue that joining arguments from political economy and conflict research can help to explain the heterogeneous pattern of investments in energy technology in resource-poor European countries. In addition, it increases our understanding of innovation activities within the energy sector. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Output gap estimation techniques have flourished accordingly, although there is no consensus on a best-performing methodology, as the selection criteria often imply important trade-offs. This paper presents a novel approach putting the focus on the specification of the model rather than on a prior selection of the methodology itself. Ideally, an agreeable method should achieve three necessary conditions: economic soundness, statistical goodness and transparency. On top of this, consistency with the business cycle narrative, as often implemented by policymakers, is also a critical condition. In practice, fulfilling these conditions can prove to be challenging. The main issues in practice are related to the specification of the model, the selection of the relevant variables, the stability and uncertainty of the estimates and its use on a real-time basis. This paper presents a methodological approach based on a structural multivariate time series model and Kalman filtering. The method fulfils the necessary criteria and allows for enough flexibility in order to get a country-specific approximation to the sufficient criterion as it could accommodate specific cycles (financial, external, investment, fiscal, etc.). The method is put to the test with an illustration for the Spanish economy, assessing its merits as well as its limitations.","[Cuerpo, Carlos; Cuevas, Angel; Quilis, Enrique M.] Spanish Independent Author Fiscal Responsibil AIR, Econ Res Div, Madrid, Spain",,"Cuerpo, C (通讯作者)，Spanish Independent Author Fiscal Responsibil AIR, Econ Res Div, Madrid, Spain.",carlos.cuerpo@airef.es; angel.cuevas@airef.es; enrique.quilis@airef.es,,,,,,,27,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

However, our understanding of those markets is still limited. I characterize the Bertrand equilibrium in a discriminatory-price electricity auction when suppliers submit a single offer price for their entire production capacity and they face transmission constraints and linear tariffs for the injection of electricity into the grid. With point of connection tariffs, which are used in the majority of the European countries, suppliers pay a tariff for the total electricity injected into the grid. In contrast, with transmission tariffs, suppliers only pay a tariff for the electricity sold in the other market. Transmission tariffs outperform point of connection tariffs by maximizing consumers' welfare and transmission efficiency. The consequences of an increase in transmission capacity differ considerably depending on the tariff. If the transmission tariffs are zero, an increase in transmission capacity is pro-competitive. In contrast, if the transmission tariffs are positive, an increase in transmission capacity is pro-competitive only when the transmission capacity is low. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, a retailer might raise the retail price of an item just before a sale and then promote the product by listing the initial price as the sales price. This paper addresses the question under what conditions would a firm give such a 'false' promotion and with what regularity? with an analytical model composed of two competing retailers and two segments of consumers. The duopoly firms sell substitutable products in a finite number of periods to consumers. In each period, each firm can choose to offer a real promotion, a false promotion, or no promotion. One segment of consumers is sophisticated and is able to discern false promotions based on the two firms' promotional offerings. The other segment of consumers is naive and trusts each firm's claimed promotional offering. Sophisticated consumers pass information on the existence of false promotions via word-of-mouth (WOM) to a fraction of naive consumers. We find that the possibility of offering false promotions can improve the payoffs for both firms, especially when the market is more competitive. Moreover, even when consumers can identify that a firm is offering a false promotion and pass this information to others, a firm still finds it optimal to offer such promotions from time to time. In general, the firm is more likely to offer false promotions in an environment with lower competition, fewer sophisticated consumers, and weaker WOM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model suggests that large changes in the tax code may be easier to enact than marginal reforms. The tax base faces a tipping point where even the beneficiaries from tax exemptions support reform. At this tipping point, tax reform is Pareto improving. Politically feasible tax reform occurs when fiscal needs are large, but may nonetheless involve reductions in marginal tax rates. There is strategic complementarity in lobbying for tax exemptions, resulting in multiple equilibria. The model's main predictions are consistent with recent tax reforms in OECD countries.

With Nash bargaining or if wage contracts are long-term, this net present value is affected by wages of new hires. Yet data on wages of new hires are rare and, in the few papers that distinguish between new hires from unemployment and job changers, the findings vary. For the U.S., two influential papers reach the opposite conclusions, and the findings for the few European countries are mixed. We combine administrative tax data on earnings with the Household Finance and Consumption Survey for Ireland and find that earnings of new hires from non-employment are substantially more flexible compared to earnings of incumbent workers or job changers. The findings are robust. Earnings of new hires from non-employment are more procyclical for workers with less valuable outside options.","[Lydon, Reamonn; Lozej, Matija] Cent Bank Ireland, New Wapping St,North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland,"Lydon, R (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, New Wapping St,North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland.",reamonn.lydon@centralbank.ie; matija.lozej@centralbank.ie,"Lozej, Matija/AAN-5255-2021","Lozej, Matija/0000-0002-8073-0497",,,,,39,3,3,0,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,AUG,2018,53.0,,,,,,112,127,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.05.013,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,GT6VX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444660100008,0

Our identifying assumption is that unexpected changes in interest rates in a 30-minute window surrounding scheduled Federal Reserve announcements arise from news about monetary policy. In response to an interest rate hike, nominal and real interest rates increase roughly one-for-one, several years out into the term structure, while the response of expected inflation is small. At the same time, forecasts about output growth also increase-the opposite of what standard models imply about a monetary tightening. To explain these facts, we build a model in which Fed announcements affect beliefs not only about monetary policy but also about other economic fundamentals. Our model implies that these information effects play an important role in the overall causal effect of monetary policy shocks on output.","[Nakamura, Emi] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Nakamura, E (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation [SES-1056107]; Alfred P.

Our results show that (i) the final participation of traders in the CM is much higher, (ii) the PO can coexist with the CM, (iii) the DM unravels when competing against CM and (iv) the DM can coexist with the PO, depending on the initial participation conditions.

In a data-driven approach, we analyze two large-scale data sets, extracting unique information about 7500 R&D alliances and 5200 patent portfolios of firms. These data are used to calibrate the model parameters for network formation and knowledge exchange. We obtain probabilities for incumbent and newcomer firms to link to other incumbents or newcomers able to reproduce the topology of the empirical R&D network. The position of firms in a knowledge space is obtained from their patents using two different classification schemes, IPC in eight dimensions and ISI-OST-INPI in 35 dimensions. Our dynamics of knowledge exchange assumes that collaborating firms approach each other in knowledge space at a rate mu for an alliance duration tau. Both parameters are obtained in two different ways, by comparing knowledge distances from simulations and empirics and by analyzing the collaboration efficiency . This is a new measure that takes in account the effort of firms to maintain concurrent alliances, and is evaluated via extensive computer simulations. We find that R&D alliances have a duration of around two years and that the subsequent knowledge exchange occurs at a very low rate. Hence, a firm's position in the knowledge space is rather a determinant than a consequence of its R&D alliances. From our data-driven approach we also find model configurations that can be both realistic and optimized with respect to the collaboration efficiency . Effective policies, as suggested by our model, would incentivize shorter R&D alliances and higher knowledge exchange rates.","[Vaccario, Giacomo; Tomasello, Mario V.; Tessone, Claudio J.; Schweitzer, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Syst Design, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tomasello, Mario V.] Ernst & Young, Maagpl 1, CH-8005 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, URPP Social Networks, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich,"Schweitzer, F (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Syst Design, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",fschweitzer@ethz.ch,"Schweitzer, Frank/B-2127-2012","Vaccario, Giacomo/0000-0001-8290-2742; Tessone, Claudio J./0000-0001-7733-6221","Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) [C14.0036]; EU COST Action [TD1210 KNOWeSCAPE]; Seed Project Performance and resilience of collaboration networks - ETH Zurich Risk Center [SP-RC 01-15]; University Research Priority Program on Social Network, University of Zurich","Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI); EU COST Action(European Union (EU)European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); Seed Project Performance and resilience of collaboration networks - ETH Zurich Risk Center; University Research Priority Program on Social Network, University of Zurich","GV acknowledges support from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), Grant No. C14.0036 as well as from EU COST Action TD1210 KNOWeSCAPE.

His payoff is increasing in the outcome and in an observer's expectation of the outcome. With some probability, the agent will be able to disclose some information about the true outcome to the observer. We show that choice is inefficient in general. We illustrate this point with a characterization of the inefficiencies that result when the agent can perfectly disclose the outcome with some probability and can disclose nothing otherwise as in Dye (1985a). In this case, the agent favours riskier projects even with lower expected returns. On the other hand, if information can also be disclosed by a challenger who prefers lower beliefs of the observer, the chosen project is excessively risky when the agent has better access to information, excessively risk-averse when the challenger has better access, and efficient otherwise. We also characterize the agent's worst-case equilibrium payoff. We give examples of alternative disclosure technologies illustrating other forms the inefficiencies can take. For example, in a two-dimensional setting, we demonstrate a hitting for the fences effect where the agent systematically focuses on the harder dimension at the expense of success on the easier.","[Ben-Porath, Elchanan] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Dekel, Eddie] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Dekel, Eddie] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lipman, Barton L.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Northwestern University; Tel Aviv University; Boston University,"Ben-Porath, E (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.",,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0820333]; US-Israel Binational Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); US-Israel Binational Science Foundation(US-Israel Binational Science Foundation),"We thank Rick Green, Mark Machina, Phil Reny, various seminar audiences, and Botond Koszegi and three anonymous referees for helpful comments and the National Science Foundation, grant SES-0820333 (Dekel), and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation for support for this research.",,39,19,23,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The model captures the dynamic interactions of agents in the financial system extending from the suppliers of funding through the intermediation and transformation functions of the bank/dealers to the financial institutions that use the funds to trade in the asset markets. The model replicates the key finding that it is the reaction to initial losses, rather than the losses themselves, that determine the extent of a crisis. By building on a detailed mapping of the transformations and dynamics of the financial system, the agent-based model provides an avenue toward risk management that can illuminate the pathways for the propagation of key crisis dynamics such as fire sales and funding runs.","[Bookstaber, Richard; Paddrik, Mark] US Dept Treasury, Off Financial Res, Washington, DC 20226 USA; [Tivnan, Brian] Mitre Corp, Mclean, VA USA",United States Department of the Treasury; MITRE Corporation,"Paddrik, M (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Off Financial Res, Washington, DC 20226 USA.",Richard.Bookstaber@ofr.treasury.gov; Mark.Paddrik@ofr.treasury.gov; btivnan@mitre.org,,,,,,,48,22,25,4,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Whereas the price level effect, which is positive in sign, is universally recognized, the nominal exchange rate effect, which is negative in sign, is routinely ignored. We calculate to which extent real exchange rate changes are accounted for by traded good prices and other components of the real exchange rate. We find that the nominal exchange rate effect neutralizes the price level effect entirely, suggesting that, contrary to popular belief, good market arbitrage is not conducive to purchasing power parity (the purchasing power parity fallacy). Rather than traded or non-traded good prices, the main driving force behind the real exchange rate is currency market pressure, a variable that, as we argue, is largely determined by the cumulative trade and capital flows of a country.","[Eleftheriou, Maria; Mueller-Plantenberg, Nikolas A.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ Theory & Econ Hist, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Müller-Plantenberg, N (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Econ Theory & Econ Hist, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",maria.eleftheriou@uam.es; nikolas.mullerpl@uam.es,"/P-5153-2019; Eleftheriou, Maria/R-7295-2018","/0000-0003-1071-2901; Eleftheriou, Maria/0000-0002-8331-0252",,,,,44,4,4,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The longitudinal nature of the data enables us to investigate the potential effects of the last global financial crisis. Results confirm the strong positive relationship between the entrepreneurial choice and wealth as well as the negative effect that stems from the increase in start-up costs. Interestingly, although there is no strong evidence that wealth in itself played a bigger role during the crisis, we find that the negative impact of start-up costs on the entrepreneurship-wealth relationship proved to be significantly pronounced during the last crisis.","[Elitcha, Koffi; Fonseca, Raquel] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Econ, 320 Ste Catherine St East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1L7, Canada; [Fonseca, Raquel] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Fonseca, Raquel] RAND, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal; RAND Corporation,"Fonseca, R (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Econ, 320 Ste Catherine St East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1L7, Canada.;Fonseca, R (通讯作者)，CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Fonseca, R (通讯作者)，RAND, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",elitcha.koffi_aseye@courrier.uqam.ca; fonseca.raquel@uqam.ca,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Our data indicate an implied labour productivity gap of 13 percentage points in 2011 relative to the productivity level on pre-recession trends. We find that: (a)the labour productivity puzzle is a TFP puzzle, since it is not explained by the contributions of labour or capital services; (b)the reallocation of labour between industries deepens rather than explains the puzzle (i.e. there has been a reallocation of hours away from low-productivity industries and toward high productivity industries); (c)capitalization of R&D does not explain the productivity puzzle; (d)assuming increased scrapping rates since the recession, a 25% (50%) increase in depreciation rates post-2009 can potentially explain 15% (31%) of the productivity puzzle; (e)industry data show that 35% of the TFP puzzle can be explained by weak TFP growth in the oil & gas and finance sectors; and (f)cyclical effects via factor utilization could potentially explain 17% of the productivity puzzle.

Religious organizations in those countries sometimes choose to operate both legally and illegally. The model proposed here shows that such behavior may increase the consumer welfare of religionists compared to solely legal or illegal provision of religious services. It assumes that religious organizations maximize the consumer surplus of their adherents. The choice of a religious organization between legal and illegal provision of religious services depends on the costs of religious participation imposed by the government and the set-up costs of dual operation. As an illustration, the paper accounts for the different response of the Catholic Church to restrictions imposed by the communists in Poland and Czechoslovakia.","[Minarik, Pavol] Univ JE Purkyne, Moskevska 54, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Minarik, P (通讯作者)，Univ JE Purkyne, Moskevska 54, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic.",pavol.minarik@ujep.cz,"Minarik, Pavol/Q-5977-2019","Minarik, Pavol/0000-0002-3913-2006",,,,,30,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We conduct a case study of environmental policy in India, focusing on unprecedented Supreme Court rulings that targeted industrial pollution in the Ganga River. In a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the rulings precipitated reductions in river pollution and one-month infant mortality, both of which persist for more than a decade. We then estimate a pollution-mortality dose-response function across twenty-nine rivers in the Ganga Basin, instrumenting for pollution with its upstream counterpart. The estimation reveals a significant external health burden of river pollution, not just in the district of measurement, but also on downstream communities. It further provides suggestive evidence that reducing pollution was an important driver behind declines in infant mortality observed after the rulings.","[Quy-Toan Do] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Joshi, Shareen] Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Stolper, Samuel] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",The World Bank; Georgetown University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Do, QT (通讯作者)，World Bank, Res Dept, MSN MC3-306 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Stolper, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Dana Bldg,Room 3006,440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",Qdo@worldbank.org; shareen.joshi@georgetown.edu; samuel.stolper@gmail.com,,"Stolper, Samuel/0000-0001-7250-8039",,,,,51,28,32,3,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Our result implies that policy-makers can effectively improve risk sharing between households by adopting policies that increase the network connectivity of individuals in the periphery of the social network.","[Yang, Ou] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, 111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Jiang, Bin; Kim, Jun Sung; Li, Chuhui] Monash Univ, Econometr & Business Stat, 20 Chancellors Walk, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of Melbourne; Monash University,"Yang, O (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, 111 Barry St, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia.",ou.yang@unimelb.edu.au,"Kim, Jun Sung/ITV-9063-2023; Kim, Jun Sung/AAI-1673-2020; Yang, Ou/I-2631-2019","Kim, Jun Sung/0000-0002-4088-9495; Yang, Ou/0000-0003-0457-7029",,,,,14,3,4,3,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We show that if aggregate consumption is concentrated on high (low) priority goods in the early (later) stages of the economy's development and spread out more evenly in an intermediate stage, then the diversification of the economy over the development path is inversely U-shaped: a result that is consistent with the empirical evidence in Imbs and Wacziarg 2003 Stages of Diversification.","[Andergassen, Rainer; Ricottilli, Massimo] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Pzza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Nardini, Franco] Univ Bologna, Dept Math, Viale Filopanti 5, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Nardini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Math, Viale Filopanti 5, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",franco.nardini@unibo.it,"Andergassen, Rainer/AAM-7061-2021",,,,,,47,2,2,1,15,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

On a mixed market price takers are always better off than price makers, though the profits of both types decline in the number of price takers. We investigate and confront two possibilities of firms' decisions about their types: forward-looking equilibrium reasoning and backward-looking individual learning. We find that the Cournot outcome is the only equilibrium prediction and it is learnable if firms are sufficiently sensitive to profit differences. However, with a larger number of firms, a unilateral deviation from Cournot behavior becomes profitable. Under learning this incentive creates a space for permanent oscillations over different markets with a positive but low number of price takers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to address this question by estimating the causal effects of English language skills on education, health and fertility outcomes of immigrants in England and Wales. We construct an instrument for language skills using age at arrival in the United Kingdom, exploiting the phenomenon that young children learn languages more easily than older children. Using a unique individual-level dataset that links the 2011 Census data to life event records, we find that better English language skills significantly improve educational attainment and adult health, and affect fertility behaviour, but do not affect child health. Supplementary analysis suggests that a higher educational attainment as a result of better English language skills is a possibly important channel though which English proficiency affects immigrant health.

These methods involve new techniques that make use of geographic information system (GIS) routing software or application programming interfaces provided by third-party developers. This article provides (i) a brief survey of the small but emerging literature that uses geocoded register data to calculate different commuting measures, (ii) an example on how register-based commuting measures can be constructed along with descriptive evidence on how different commuting measures compare for different socio-economic groups using rich Swedish register data, (iii) a discussion of the pros and cons of different methods and measures, and (iv) a discussion of the potential of using mobile phone data to further improve registerbased commuting measures.","[Blind, Ina] Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res IBF, POB 514, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Dahlberg, Matz] Uppsala Univ, IBF, POB 514, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Dahlberg, Matz] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, POB 514, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Dahlberg, Matz] Univ Barcelona, IEB, CESifo, Barcelona, Spain; [Dahlberg, Matz] VATT, Helsinki, Finland; [Engstrom, Gustav] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst, POB 50005, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Engstrom, Gustav] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, POB 50005, SE-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Osth, John] Uppsala Univ, Dept Social & Econ Geog, POB 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University; Uppsala University; Uppsala University; University of Barcelona; VATT Institute for Economic Research; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Global Economic Dynamics & Biosphere - The Erling-Persson Family Academy Program; Uppsala University,"Blind, I (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Inst Housing & Urban Res IBF, POB 514, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",ina.blind@ibf.uu.se; matz.dahlberg@ibf.uu.se; gustav.engstrom@beijer.kva.se; john.osth@kultgeog.uu.se,"Engström, Gustav/F-2240-2016","Osth, John/0000-0002-4536-9229",Handelsbankens Forskningsstiftelser; Ragnar Soderberg foundation,Handelsbankens Forskningsstiftelser; Ragnar Soderberg foundation,"The authors are grateful to participants at the CESifo Economic Studies Conference 'On the Use of Geo-coded Data in Economic Research' in Munich in November 2016, especially to their discussants, Stephan Heblich and Rosa Sanchis-Guarner, and to an anonymous referee for helpful comments.

The model is designed for situations where the choice behavior at a particular level is of interest but only broader level data are available. For example, consider analyzing a household's choice for a vehicle at the make-model-trim level but only choice data at the make-model level are observed. The proposed model is a generalization of the multinomial logit model and collapses to it when there is full observability of the exact choices. We show that the parameters in the model are at least locally identified, but for certain configurations of the data, they are only weakly identified. Methods to address weak identification are proposed when there are data available on the overall market shares of all alternatives, and both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation methods are explored.","[Brownstone, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Li, Phillip] US Dept Treasury, Off Financial Res, 717 14th St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; United States Department of the Treasury,"Brownstone, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",dbrownst@uci.edu; phillip.li@ofr.treasury.gov,,"Li, Phillip/0000-0002-1729-4012","University of California, Irvine through the Department of Economics, Institute of Transportation Studies, School of Social Sciences; Center for Economics and Public Policy; University of California Center for Energy and Environmental Economics; University of California Multi-Campus Research Program in Sustainable Transport: Technology, Mobility and Infrastructure; University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation","University of California, Irvine through the Department of Economics, Institute of Transportation Studies, School of Social Sciences; Center for Economics and Public Policy; University of California Center for Energy and Environmental Economics; University of California Multi-Campus Research Program in Sustainable Transport: Technology, Mobility and Infrastructure; University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation","We appreciate the thorough and thoughtful comments and references from an anonymous referee.

Developing countries rely also on natural capital, which may generate possible conflicts between environment and development targets. Taking the case of land-use and deforestation, this paper revisits the links between man-made and natural capital. Relying on a model of income maximization, we theoretically assess how better access to man-made capital through public spending and credit, influences forest cover loss. Econometric investigations, over the period 2001-2012, show that forest cover loss is positively influenced by credit and public spending. A better access to capital is thus detrimental to the forest.

This paper studies the effects of different types of technology-oriented cohesion policies, aiming at the reduction of regional differences, on the convergence of regions and the dynamics of income inequality within regions. In particular, policies are analyzed using a two-region agent based macroeconomic model - the Eurace@Unibi model - where firms in the lagging region receive subsidies for investment in physical capital. It is demonstrated that the short-, medium- and long-term effects of the policies on per-capita output and between-as well as within-regional inequality differ substantially. Effects depend on how successful the policy is in incentivizing firms to choose best available capital vintages and on how flexible labor markets are in the targeted region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This contribution focuses on the effects of the composition of public spending on growth with reference to France for the period 1870-2010. Using a new database we show that the only functional component of expenditure that clearly contributes to the growth of French output is the expenditure which is aimed at the protection of property rights. Public interventions in support of the economy, on the other hand, have no impact on growth. In the area of social spending, only health expenditure contributes to output growth. In the case of France the empirical evidence therefore seems to confirm not only the crucial importance of the protection of property rights highlighted by neo-institutional theory, but also Smith's minimal state hypothesis: the restriction of the size of the state and the delimitation to its essential functions tends to favour output growth.","[Facchini, Francois] Univ Paris 01, Paris, France; [Facchini, Francois] Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris 1, France; [Seghezza, Elena] Univ Genoa, Genoa, Italy",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; University of Genoa,"Seghezza, E (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Genoa, Italy.",francois.facchini@univ-paris1.fr; seghezza@unige.it,"Facchini, Francois/AAD-9399-2019","Facchini, Francois/0000-0001-9471-0385",,,,,74,17,17,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Thus, we adopt a fully disaggregated approach - by asset types and sectors - to estimate the responsiveness of investment to the tax-adjusted user cost of capital. Once all the sources of heterogeneity are accounted for, we find that capital accumulation is significantly affected by changes in the user cost, although the size of the impact is smaller than the unit benchmark. We do not find robust evidence that the long run substitution elasticities are statistically different across asset types.","[Fatica, Serena] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, BLDG 36 01-114,Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Fatica, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, BLDG 36 01-114,Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",serena.fatica@ec.europa.eu,,"fatica, serena/0000-0002-9990-4354",,,,,38,5,5,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

However, empirical tests tend to ignore that the two levels are often nested in a hierarchy. Building on hierarchical growth curve modelling, we propose an approach to convergence analysis that allows contemporaneous inference on macro and micro-convergence. Compared to the classic linear convergence analysis, the suggested methodology provides a more flexible alternative to model heterogeneity and validate the results for possible Galton's fallacy. We illustrate the approach in two empirical examples, one considering convergence across European regions and countries and the other across Italian firms and regions. In the European case, we find that the evidence of convergence depends on the choice of cross-sectional sample. Evidence on convergence in Italy applies only to part of the temporal sample and, therefore, is not robust to Galton's fallacy. Our analysis returns more robust results on the convergence process and allows better inference for policy intervention. We can envisage that this approach will find increasing applications in the future, as disaggregated data becomes available and heterogeneity becomes an increasingly prominent feature in economic modelling.","[Fazio, Giorgio] Newcastle Univ, Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Fazio, Giorgio; Piacentino, Davide] Univ Palermo, SEAS, Edificio 13, ITA-90128 Palermo, Italy",Newcastle University - UK; University of Palermo,"Fazio, G (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Business Sch, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",giorgio.fazio@ncl.ac.uk; davide.piacentino@unipa.it,,"PIACENTINO, Davide/0000-0001-6252-1264",,,,,57,4,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Specifically, what effects does introducing electricity and rate-mass allowance trade between differently-regulated regions have on emissions and ultimately welfare? We explore these questions first with a simple theoretical model and then with a sophisticated numerical model of the electricity sector. The theoretical model isolates the policy effects by assuming that two otherwise identical regions are regulated differently. With fixed demand, their autarky marginal abatement costs are identical, but electricity prices are lower in the rate-limited region. Adding electricity trade shifts generation to the rate limited region, expanding its allowance allocation, while emissions remain capped in the mass-capped region. Adding rate-mass allowance trade exacerbates this shift in generation and expansion of emissions. The increase of emission damage could make the net welfare effects negative. However, if the mass cap is sufficiently more stringent than the rate limit, allowing rate-mass allowance trade in the presence of electricity trade can lower emissions. The numerical model of the eastern US illustrates the effects predicted in the theoretical model, and projects their magnitudes. In our simulation that is loosely based on the US Clean Power Plan, the estimated CO2 damage makes the estimated net benefits of allowing rate-mass trading negative. Our results also illustrate that linking can shift the geographic distribution of SO2 and NOx emissions, which can counteract the effect of the CO2 damage on estimated total welfare.

The analysis was undertaken for the full sample as well as for several sub-samples, using the Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) approach. The empirical results for the full sample suggest that when a country reduces the aforementioned gap, it experiences, over the short to medium term, a rise in non-resource tax revenue.

Baseline estimation of a meta-regression model that employs a total of 2,894 estimates drawn from 121 previous studies indicated the superior impact of foreign ownership on firm performance in comparison with state and domestic private entities. Furthermore, the estimation of an extended meta-regression model that explicitly controls for the idiosyncrasies of transition economies and privatization policies strongly suggested that differences between countries in location, privatization method, and speed of policy implementation strongly influence the link between post-privatization ownership structure and firm performance. We also found that these factors not only cause a remarkable gap between countries in terms of ex post improvement in firm performance but also significantly affect the interrelationship between foreign investors, domestic outsider owners, and firm managers, and the relative superiority of various domestic outsiders. Conclusive evidence of the harm caused to ex post firm performance by voucher privatization is one of the most noteworthy empirical findings in this paper.","[Iwasaki, Ichiro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Mizobata, Satoshi] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; Kyoto University,"Iwasaki, I (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",iiwasaki@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan [26245034]; Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University [FY2015-16]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26245034] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research work was financially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for scientific research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (No. 26245034) and the Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University (FY2015-16).",,53,17,17,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

In addition, we consider three different approaches for bias-correction for the OLS estimator: (i) bootstrap, (ii) jackknife and (iii) indirect inference. The estimators are evaluated in terms of bias and root mean squared errors (RMSE) in a variety of practically relevant settings. Our findings suggest that the indirect inference method clearly performs best in terms of RMSE for all considered levels of persistence. In terms of bias-correction, the jackknife works best for stationary and unit root processes, but with a typically large variance. For the explosive case, the indirect inference method is recommended. As an empirical illustration, we reconsider the dot-com bubble in the NASDAQ index and explore the usefulness of the indirect inference estimator in terms of testing, date stamping and calculations on overvaluation.","[Kruse, Robinson] Univ Cologne, Fac Management Econ & Social Sci, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Kruse, Robinson] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, CREATES, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Kaufmann, Hendrik] Quoniam Asset Management, Westhafen Tower,Westhafenpl 1, D-60327 Frankfurt, Germany; [Wegener, Christoph] IPAG Business Sch, 184 Blvd St Germain, F-75006 Paris, France",University of Cologne; Aarhus University; CREATES; IPAG Business School,"Kruse, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Fac Management Econ & Social Sci, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",kruse-becher@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Wegener, Christoph/I-7018-2019","Wegener, Christoph/0000-0002-9508-7131",CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78],CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation,"This paper is a substantial revision of Kaufmann and Kruse (2013).

Similar linear aggregates are used in classical physics for description of wave interference effects. In contrast to regular techniques of probability estimation in social-economic research (such as logistic regression, multinomial-logit (MNL), discrete choice modeling (DCM), conjoint, best-worst scaling (BWS), and other methods), the proposed approach of probability amplitude modeling permits finding choice probabilities themselves and demonstrates possible interference phenomena of entanglement of different choices. Particularly, a BWS example evaluated by complex utility MNL demonstrates how a choice of each item is composed from its pure-state and mix-state probabilities. The obtained numerical results are supportive of theoretical considerations and practical applications of the probability amplitude modeling, and can serve for better understanding and evaluation of choice decisions.","[Lipovetsky, Stan] GfK North Amer, 8401 Golden Valley Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55427 USA",,"Lipovetsky, S (通讯作者)，GfK North Amer, 8401 Golden Valley Rd, Minneapolis, MN 55427 USA.",stan.lipovetsky@gfk.com,"Lipovetsky, Stan/AAG-1420-2019",,,,,,57,11,11,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Of particular interest is the post-study probability', the probability that a reported research finding represents a true relationship. This probability is inherently unknowable. However, a number of insightful results emerge if we are willing to make some conjectures about reasonable parameter values. Among other things, this analysis demonstrates the important role that replication can play in improving the signal value of empirical research.","[Reed, W.

As the main conclusion of this analysis, transnational entrepreneurship (TE) is an example of how international KS can be beneficial for both the incumbent and recipient economies.

We develop a dynamic general equilibrium in which parents choose the quantity of children, transfer a preschool ability to their children, determine the quality of children by choosing private expenditures on basic education (in addition to public expenditures), and leave a bequest that could be used to finance college education. We find that incorporating fertility behavior, especially differential fertility is crucial to capture human capital formation in the U.S. economy. We also analyze the impact of basic education subsidies and college subsidies on welfare, inequality, and intergenerational mobility.","[Yilmaz, Kuzey] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University,"Yilmaz, K (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",k.yilmaz@csuohio.edu,,,,,,,47,2,2,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

The aim is to form clusters that will group the analysed countries according to their performances achieved under three basic flexicurity dimensions: external numerical flexibility, income security, and employment security. The results show that the C.E.E. countries have adopted different flexicurity models and associated measures, some focusing on improving flexibility by softening the employment protection legislation or designing flexible working arrangements, while others are concentrating more on employee protection with tight employment regulations (associated with relatively high degrees of income security) with different performances in terms of flexicurity output (states and effects) and labour market outcomes. The impact of various flexicurity measures upon labour productivity in C.E.E. countries is also extremely significant, being largely discussed within the paper.","[Noja, Gratiela Georgiana] West Univ Timisoara, East European Ctr Res Econ & Business, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Noja, GG (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, East European Ctr Res Econ & Business, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania.",gratiela.noja@e-uvt.ro,"Noja, Gratiela/X-2471-2019","Noja, Gratiela/0000-0002-9201-3057",,,,,35,8,8,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The data treatments used for the secondary data are unit root and co- integration tests using Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillip-Perron model. Weighted least square was used to test the sample of 37-year annual time series using vector error correction model. For the primary data, a sample of 242 respondents is utilised for the study. Statistical random sampling was used for the sample selection. The data analysis was done with descriptive statistics. Findings from the study indicate that government spending on transport and communication, education and health infrastructure has significant effects on economic growth; spending on agriculture and natural resources infrastructure recorded a significant inverse effect on economic growth in Nigeria. An element of fiscal illusion was observed in the government spending on agriculture and natural resources indicating that government is not contributing as much as the private sector in spending on agriculture and natural resources infrastructure in Nigeria.","[Babatunde, Shakirat Adepeju] Univ Lagos, Sch Postgrad Studies, Dept Accounting, Lagos, Nigeria",University of Lagos,"Babatunde, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Lagos, Sch Postgrad Studies, Dept Accounting, Lagos, Nigeria.",pejubabs_saki@yahoo.com,"BABATUNDE, SHAKIRAT ADEPEJU/AAU-8504-2020",,,,,,40,21,26,5,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Within a general stochastic learning-by-doing model, there is a potential inefficiency in the market provision of firm-specific training. In order to determine whether this inefficiency is in fact present, we analyze two special cases of the model: the accelerated productivity-enhancement model and the accelerated learning model. In both models, the inefficiency is indeed present. However, the nature of the inefficiency depends on the balance between the two key components of training, namely productivity enhancement and employee evaluation. In the accelerated productivity-enhancement model, training results in an increase in productivity enhancement but no change in employee evaluation, and training is overprovided by the market. In the accelerated learning model, training results in a proportionate increase in both productivity enhancement and employee evaluation, and training is underprovided by the market. In both cases, turnover is inefficiently low. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper proposes that differences in fecundity between men and women play a role in accounting for this fact. Men are more likely to have more children after a divorce because they are fertile for more years than women. This acts as an incentive for couples to agree on mothers' sole custody. I build a general equilibrium model of endogenous marriage, divorce and remarriage with differential fecundity between women and men where couples choose custody allocation. Custody depends on the fecundity differential and father's time spent with children. I calibrate my model to be consistent with observed U.S. child custody arrangements and marriage statistics and using changes over time in assisted reproductive technology (ART) and father's time spent with children I quantify the effect of the fecundity differential on child custody. Results show that if assisted reproductive technology was not available, the current share of couples with joint custody would be 15.67% lower. Considering that fathers' time with children has also changed over time, I find that a reduction in the fecundity differential accounts for an increase in the share of couples with joint custody of 4%.

This paper aims to construct a simple three-country trade and geography model with different market sizes and non-constant wage rates. The large country fosters industrial agglomeration (geographical concentration) in the early stage of globalization, but loses manufacturing in the later stage of globalization. When losing manufacturing, the large country might be worse off. Thus, the large country might have an incentive to implement welfare-maintaining policies to prevent a loss of manufacturing. All of these results can be explained by market sizes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In matching models, most wage mechanisms do not ensure efficiency, so tightness is generally inefficient.

Using Korean data, we estimate a simple permanent income model augmented with model uncertainty, find a structural break at the point of the Asian Financial Crisis, and identify a rise in concern for model misspecification which is distinct from an increase in income volatility. The post-crisis concern for model misspecification implies a reasonable detection error probability.

We examine how the value of the collateral affects the borrower's incentives and the lender's returns. In some scenarios moral hazard is avoided without the collateral but the introduction of the collateral may generate negative incentives. The borrower attempts to save his collateral asset by gambling for resurrection with the project output or by gambling with the value of the collateral. These negative incentives make credit rationing optimal. The findings provide recommendations on the optimal use of collateral. (C) 2017 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Rising relative wage rate is shown to have had strong-and negative-effects on the trade balance/GDP ratio for the EU-14, at least in the longer run. It follows that external rebalancing may be achieved through a sufficiently strong fall in the relative wage rates, without productivity changes having a role to play. This is not to claim that the EU-14 (and its members suffering trade deficits in particular) ought to attempt the devastating policy of 'internal devaluation'. A constructive alternative would be to achieve the fall in the relative wage rates through faster growth of German nominal wage rates. Whether that alternative is practicable is another matter. But it can be argued that without that alternative being followed the European Union will remain a stagnant area plagued by recurrent crises caused by imbalanced trade among its Member States.","[Podkaminer, Leon] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Rahlgasse 3, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Podkaminer, L (通讯作者)，Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies, Rahlgasse 3, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",podkaminer@wiiw.ac.at,,,,,,,16,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2018,45.0,2,,,,,395,408,,10.1007/s10663-016-9365-z,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GD0FR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430176500008,0

The margin of tariff preferences is adopted as a proxy for the degree of trade liberalisation and a gravity model is used to assess the impacts of the tariff preferences under the AFTA and ASEAN+1 FTAs on Vietnam's major exports. The results show that the effects of tariff preferences differ between the types of preferences and products.

Individuals differ with respect to their managerial ability, and choose to become entrepreneurs or workers depending on profit opportunities and labor market conditions. The model generates three groups: low-income workers facing the prospect of unemployment, middle-income entrepreneurs producing domestically, and high-income entrepreneurs off shoring some tasks abroad. Lowering financial frictions induces more individuals to become entrepreneurs, increases the masses of offshoring firms and tasks, and improves personal income and welfare distribution. It reduces unemployment when tasks are less substitutable and labor share in production is high. The paper also investigates the impact of reducing offshoring costs and labor market frictions on the mass of entrepreneurs, decision to offshore, income distribution, and unemployment.

We combine new data on oil and gas endowments with Census of Manufactures microdata to estimate how oil and gas booms affect local economies in the U.S. Local wages rise during oil and gas booms, but manufacturing is not crowded out-in fact, the sector grows overall, driven by upstream and locally-traded subsectors. Tradable manufacturing subsectors do contract during resource booms, but their productivity is unaffected, so there is no evidence of foregone local learning-by-doing effects. Over the full 1969-2014 sample, a county with one standard deviation additional oil and gas endowment averaged about 1% higher real wages.

To do so we consider a frictional environment where buyers and sellers play price-posting and bargaining games infinitely many times. Sellers switch from one market to the other at a rate that is proportional to their payoff differentials. Given the different informational requirements associated with these two trading mechanisms, we examine their possible co-existence in the context of informal and formal markets. Other than having different trading protocols, we also consider other distinguishing features. We find a unique stable equilibrium where price-posting (formal markets) and bargaining (informal markets) co-exist. In a richer environment where both sellers and buyers can move across markets, we show that there exists a unique stable dynamic equilibrium where formal and informal activities also co-exist whenever sellers' and buyers' net costs of trading in the formal market have opposite signs.","[Anbarci, Nejat; Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Pivato, Marcus] Trent Univ, Dept Math, 1600 West Bank Dr, Peterborough, ON K9J 7B8, Canada; [Pivato, Marcus] Univ Cergy Pontoise, THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France",Deakin University; Trent University; CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Gomis-Porqueras, P (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, 70 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",peregomis@gmail.com,"Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/AAS-6934-2020; Pivato, Marcus/AAE-4495-2020","Gomis-Porqueras, Pedro/0000-0002-3637-9142; Pivato, Marcus/0000-0001-9833-6175; Anbarci, Nejat/0000-0001-5952-8086",NSERC [262620-2008]; Labex MME-DII [ANR11-LBX-0023-01],NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Labex MME-DII,"We would like to thank Nick Feltovich, Lawrence Uren and the participants of the 2012 Australasian Economic Theory Workshop and of the 2012 Australasian Public Choice Conference as well as the seminar participants at Australian National University, Deakin University, La Trobe University, Virginia Tech and anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

Ordered probit regression analysis of well-being reveals large influence of gender, rural residency, and household income. After controlling for demographic attributes, health status, unemployment status, number of children, agricultural hukou (household registration identity) and educational attainment, household assets, the influence of past and future income, and province dummies, we find that women, urban residents, and people with higher income are happier in China. More schooling, better health, and being employed are positively and significantly correlated with well-being. Sub-sample analysis reveals that the rich only care about relative income whereas the effect of absolute income dominates in case of the poorer section. The influence of absolute income is larger among women compared to men and in turn explains why women, despite being poorer, are happier in China, conditional on socioeconomic differences. On the other hand, rural residents are poorer than urban residents so that conditional on having the same income, there is no rural-urban happiness gap. Our results suggest that while further decline in poverty will enhance well-being in China, policies that reduce rural-urban and gender inequalities are also likely to boost well-being.

This study scrutinizes effects of early retirement disincentives on retirement behavior, individual welfare, pensions and public budget. We employ administrative pension data and a detailed model of the German tax and social security system to estimate a structural dynamic retirement model. We find that retirement behavior is strongly influenced by the level of disincentives. Further, disincentives come at the cost of increasing inequality and individual welfare losses. Still, net public returns are about three times as high as monetarized individual welfare losses. Our estimates also suggest that similar levels of net public returns, if achieved by indiscriminating pension cuts, are associated with individual welfare losses that are more than twice as high.

Then, the seller pays the menu cost and resets the real value of its nominal price to a point randomly drawn from a distribution with support [S, Q], where s< S < Q. A (Q, S, s) equilibrium differs with respect to a standard (S, s) equilibrium: (1) in a (Q,S,s) equilibrium, sellers sometimes keep their nominal price constant to avoid paying the menu cost, other times because they are indifferent to changes in the real value of their price. An exploratory calibration reveals that menu costs account less than half of the observed duration of nominal prices. (2) in a (Q,S,s) equilibrium, higher inflation leads to higher real prices, as sellers pass onto buyers the cost of more frequent price adjustments, and to lower welfare.","[Burdett, Kenneth; Menzio, Guido] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Menzio, Guido] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Burdett, K (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",,,,,,,,33,12,16,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In this paper, we investigate the relevance of context and task involvement on these inconsistencies. Our analysis is based on a sample of 244 German agricultural sciences students, which were performing an iterative multiple price list (iMPL) and a simple self-assessment question on risk preferences. We find that using a real life and subject context specific (here, agricultural) framing of the iMPL is leading to fewer within-and between-method inconsistencies. This is due to the fact that contextual framing has an increasing effect on task involvement (proxied with the time spent in the iMPL). Additionally, we find that contextual framing triggers the role of subjects' context involvement (proxied using an indicator for students' involvement in the agricultural domain). More specifically, both higher task and context involvement are found to decrease within-method inconsistency in the iMPL task. While also between-method inconsistency is decreasing in subjects' task involvement, we found no effect of context involvement. In conclusion, our results suggest that by framing a risk elicitation method according to the subjects' specific context, involvement can be triggered and inconsistencies and misspecifications can be reduced.","[Meraner, Manuela; Finger, Robert] ETH, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Meraner, Manuela] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Meckenheimer Allee 174, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Bonn; University of Gottingen,"Finger, R (通讯作者)，ETH, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Sonneggstr 33, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rofinger@ethz.ch,"Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011; Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742; Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,44,10,12,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

This paper argues that consensus is dangerously wrong, resting on flawed theory and flawed policy assessment. Regarding theory, NIRP draws on fallacious pre-Keynesian classical economic logic that asserts there is a natural rate of interest which can ensure full employment:that prcKeynesian logic has been augmented by zero lower bound economics which claims the natural rate may be negative in times of severe demand shortage, so that policy must deliver it since the market cannot. In contrast, Keynes argued investment could become saturated so lower interest rates cannot increase aggregate demand (AD) and no natural interest rate exists. Regarding policy assessment, NIRP turns a blind eye to the possibility that negative interest rates may reduce AD, cause financial fragility, create a macroeconomics of whiplash owing to contradictions between policy today and tomorrow, promote currency wars that undermine the international economy, and foster a political economy that spawn's toxic politics. Worst of all, NIRP maintains and encourages the flawed model of growth, based on debt and asset price inflation, which has already done such harm.",,,,mail@thomaspalley.com,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,9,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

In my theoretical framework, taxpayers manipulate the money paid to the tax authority through avoidance and evasion activities. When taxpayers face the prospect of owing the tax authority money on tax day, loss aversion generates the perception of a greater marginal utility of tax reduction and therefore motivates greater pursuit of tax reduction activities. Applying a bunching-based identification strategy to U.S. tax return data, I estimate that taxpayers facing a payment on tax day reduce their tax liability by $34 more than taxpayers owed a refund.","[Rees-Jones, Alex] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rees-Jones, Alex] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Rees-Jones, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Rees-Jones, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,Cornell Institute for the Social Sciences; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Institute on Aging [T32-AG00186],Cornell Institute for the Social Sciences; National Bureau of Economic Research; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"An earlier draft of this article circulated as Loss Aversion Motivates Tax Sheltering: Evidence from U.S. Tax Returns.

Nevertheless, we observe an increasing number of unilateral efforts at different administrative levels and in different parts of the world. Previous academic literature described various individual mechanisms where emissions abroad may increase or decrease as a reaction to unilateral emission reductions. In this paper, we collect a comprehensive set of both positive and negative reactions and analyze them in stylized models. This allows us to identify the most important characteristics that determine the potential of a leader to boost mitigation efforts abroad. We find that this potential depends on (i) a strong ability to generate knowledge through leadership, (ii) a high degree of credibility in the international community, and (iii) a similar economic structure to the most important emitters.

Such institutional copying is likely to fail, if formal institutions alone are copied without the informal institutions on which they rest in the originating country. This paper investigates the role of human actors in copying informal institutions. At independence, all British African colonies imported the same institution intended to safeguard the political neutrality of their civil services. While the necessary formal provisions were copied into the constitutions of all African colonies, the extent to which they were put into practice varies. The paper investigates the connection between the variation in the legal practice and the presence of British colonial officers after independence. A natural experiment around compensation payments to British officers explains the variation in the number of officers who remained in service after independence. Interviews with retired officers suggest that the extended presence of British personnel promoted the acceptance of imported British institutions among local colleagues.","[Seidler, Valentin] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Seidler, V (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",valentin.seidler@univie.ac.at,"Seidler, Valentin/AAF-8885-2019","Seidler, Valentin/0000-0001-7076-7424",Austrian Science Found [J 3848-G28]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J 3848] Funding Source: researchfish; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J3848] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Found(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This research was supported by the Austrian Science Found (Project J 3848-G28).

To this end, we conduct a repeated public goods experiment with and without punishment using samples from the laboratory and the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We chose to replicate this experiment because it is long and logistically complex. It therefore provides a good case study for discussing the methodological and practical challenges of online interactive experimentation. We find that basic behavioral patterns of cooperation and punishment in the laboratory are replicable online. The most important challenge of online interactive experiments is participant dropout. We discuss measures for reducing dropout and show that, for our case study, dropouts are exogenous to the experiment.

The phenomenon known as the Country of Origin Effect (COE) refers to the influence of a country's image on consumer product evaluations and the perception of brands originating from specific countries. The COE describes consumer attitudes towards certain product categories and is connected with the perception of quality of such products manufactured in particular markets. The changing market conditions and proliferation of hybrid products cause certain problems for consumers who find it increasingly difficult to identify the country of origin of specific products and face a dilemma whether a product manufactured in China is of equal quality as a product of the same brand, but manufactured in France. Purpose of the article: The main purpose of the paper is to identify the young Europeans' attitudes towards the country of origin of purchased products. An attempt has been made to answer two research questions: firstly, whether are young Europeans guided by stereotypes associated with the country of origin of specific product categories in their conscious buying decisions? Secondly, do young European consumers attach higher value to a product's brand than its county of origin? Methods: The analysis has been based on literature studies and empirical data collected in MO different period of time 2008 and 2015 among 1362 respondents (in 2008) and 1125 respondents (in 2015) from eight European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Great Britain). In the exploratory empirical study, the author of the paper used two research methods: PAPI in 2008 (Riper and Pen Personal Interview) and CAWI in 2015 (Computer Assisted Web Interview). Findings & Value added: The study results reveal that in some commies. namely Poland and the Czech Republic, young consumers are guided in their deliberate buying choices by certain mental schematics perpetuated. tOr example, in the mass media (the best wine comes Ilona France, best watches are male in Switzerland, and superior quality cars originate from Germany). Respondents representing other nationalities showed more support for domestic products. By far, the most ethnocentric in their choices turned out to be the French who in almost all product categories showed preferences for products originating from their country. Furthermore, the empirical study showed that with respect to different product categories young European consumers attach more importance to a product's brand than its country of origin.","[Bartosik-Purgat, Malgorzata] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Bartosik-Purgat, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",,"Bartosik-Purgat, Malgorzata/C-4026-2014","Bartosik-Purgat, Malgorzata/0000-0003-3517-3617",,,,,47,14,14,4,28,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Without a source of quasi-experimental variation in local crime, we develop an identification strategy that leverages a recently developed test of exogeneity (Caetano (2015)) to select a feasible regression model for causal inference. Using a detailed incident-based data set of all reported crimes in Dallas from 2000 to 2007, we find some evidence of dynamic spillovers within certain types of crimes, but no evidence that lighter crimes cause more severe crimes. This suggests that a range of crime reduction policies that target lighter crimes (prescribed, for instance, by the broken windows theory of crime) should not be credited with reducing the violent crime rate. Our strategy involves a systematic investigation of endogeneity concerns and is particularly useful when rich data allow for the estimation of many regression models, none of which is agreed upon as causal ex ante.","[Caetano, Gregorio] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Maheshri, Vikram] Univ Houston, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Rochester; University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Caetano, G (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",gregorio.caetano@gmail.com; vmaheshri@uh.edu,"Caetano, Gregorio S/A-6526-2019",,,,,,51,10,11,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We call this action the conflicting strategy and conduct laboratory experiments to explore the problem. We argue that colleges' prestige and students' uncertainty about admissions outcomes are two important factors. Our model and experimental results demonstrate that when uncertainty is high and the prestige difference is low, a lower-ranked college can obtain more desired students through the conflicting strategy. Moreover, through this strategy, students with stronger preferences for a higher-ranked college have a higher chance to be accepted, which could result in an increase of students' aggregate welfare.

A monopoly setup is adopted in which the firm sells in two markets but price controls are introduced in just one. The regulator's objective is to increase consumer welfare through this price discriminatory practice, with the firm operating under a profit constraint. We consider cases where consumer welfare in the two markets is weighted both equally and unequally and also cases where the cost of supplying the two retail markets is determined in a monopsonistic input market. The results suggest that in certain situations controlling prices in only one market could be a desirable option from a welfare perspective. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Trade was further bolstered by China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. We examine several aspects of China's international trade that might help to explain its surprisingly fast growth and its ever-growing role in the global economy. A large number of studies have analyzed how trade liberalization, the WTO accession in particular, has profoundly changed the Chinese economy. We survey notable contributions to this literature that analyze the effects of trade liberalization on Chinese firms, individuals and households. Meanwhile, China's exports have had various effects on importing countries and the enormous growth of China's exports is seen by some observers as posing a threat to China's trading partners. Therefore, we discuss the emerging literature on the effects of China's spectacular export growth on consumers, labor markets, innovation, media and politics in foreign countries. Given the new domestic and external circumstances, the Chinese Government is determined to push for the formation of a new trade structure characterized by broad opening up to transform China into a strong trading powerhouse.","[Du, Yan] Sichuan Agr Univ, Sch Business, Yaan, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Tsinghua University,"Lu, Y (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yandu_swufe@126.com; luyi@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Lu, Yi/A-4448-2010","Lu, Yi/0000-0002-3544-7131",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703130],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China for financial support through research No. 71703130.,,60,7,7,8,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2018,26.0,2,,,SI,,68,93,,10.1111/cwe.12237,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ3EJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427468900004,0

To address this important policy question, we formulate a sequential game where a superintendent is tasked with closing down a certain percentage of student capacity; parents respond to these school closings by sorting into the remaining schools. We estimate parents' preferences for each school in their choice set using 4 years of student-level data from a mid-sized district with declining enrollments. We show that consideration of student sorting is vital to the assessment of any school closing policy. We next consider a superintendent tasked with closing excess school capacity, recognizing that students will sort into the remaining schools. Some students will inevitably respond to school closings by exiting the public school system; it is especially difficult to retain higher achieving students when closing public schools. We find that superintendents confront a difficult dilemma: pursuing an equity objective, such as limiting demographic stratification across schools, results in the exit of many more students than are lost by an objective explicitly based on student retention.","[Epple, Dennis] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Epple, Dennis; Sieg, Holger] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jha, Akshaya] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Sieg, Holger] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Carnegie Mellon University; University of Pennsylvania,"Epple, D (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;Epple, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",epple@andrew.cmu.edu; akshayaj@andrew.cmu.edu; holgers@econ.upenn.edu,,"Epple, Dennis/0000-0002-7354-5728",Institute of Education Sciences [IES R305A070117],Institute of Education Sciences(US Department of EducationInstitute of Education Sciences (IES)),"We would like to thank the editor of the journal, three anonymous referees, Lanier Benkard, Eric Bettinger, Flavio Cunha, John Engberg, Kirill Evdokimov, David Figlio, Eric Hanushek, Dave Marcotte, Francois Margot, Mark Rosenzweig, Petra Todd, Frank Wolak, and seminar participants at various universities and conferences for comments.

The paper looks at structural reforms as a way to provide economic stimulus for an economy at the LB. We focus on the euro area and carry out a comprehensive analysis within a multi-country structural model of the euro area within the world. Main results show structural reforms have positive short-run effects that reduce the size of a recession and in some cases can drive the euro area out of the LB. The labor reform accentuates deflation which implies that interest rates remain at the LB for the same number of periods, while the services reform pushes the euro area out of the LB if implemented in the largest part of the union. The latter result hinges on the assumption of a gradual implementation of reforms. Reforms have significantly different effects across different types of households and thus the share of these households is important in the transmission. Unilateral reforms in a large bloc have positive spillover effects within the euro area. Unilateral reforms in a small bloc are deflationary but the small size of the bloc leads to very limited impact of national developments on monetary policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Even if the news never materializes, economic activity falls below steady state for several periods, followed by a recovery. The portfolio adjustment induced by the capital sufficiency requirements leads to a rise in loan rates and tighter credit conditions, which trigger the fall in activity. We contribute to the news-shock literature by showing that imperfect signals about future financial returns can create business cycles without relying on the usual suspects-shocks to technology, preferences, or fiscal policy-and to the emerging economy business cycle literature in that disturbances in world financial markets can cause domestic business cycles without shocks to the world interest rate or to country spreads.","[Gunn, Christopher M.] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Johri, Alok] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Carleton University; McMaster University,"Gunn, CM (通讯作者)，Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",chris.gunn@carleton.ca,,,McMaster University,McMaster University,"The authors thank referees and seminar and conference participants at ICRIER, New Delhi, the University of Ottawa, the Conference on Growth and Development, the Asian Meetings of the Econometric Society, and the 2013 meetings of the Society for Computational Economics (CEF 2013).

To this end, we geographically match a new geo-referenced dataset on the subnational allocation of Chinese development finance projects to Africa over the 2000-2012 period with 98,449 respondents from four Afrobarometer survey waves across 29 African countries. By comparing the corruption experiences of individuals who live near a site where a Chinese project is being implemented at the time of the interview to those of individuals living close to a site where a Chinese project will be initiated but where implementation had not yet started at the time of the interview, we control for un-observable time-invariant characteristics that may influence the selection of project sites. The empirical results consistently indicate more widespread local corruption around active Chinese project sites. The effect is seemingly not driven by an increase in economic activity, but rather seems to signify that the Chinese presence impacts norms. Moreover, Chinese aid stands out from World Bank aid in this respect. In particular, whereas the results indicate that Chinese aid projects fuel local corruption but have no observable impact on short term local economic activity, they suggest that World Bank aid projects stimulate local economic activity without any consistent evidence of it fuelling local corruption.","[Isaksson, Ann-Sofie] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 600, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Kotsadam, Andreas] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Frisch Ctr, Oslo, Norway; [Isaksson, Ann-Sofie] Orebro Univ, Dept Econ, Orebro, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; University of Oslo; Orebro University,"Isaksson, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 600, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.;Isaksson, AS (通讯作者)，Orebro Univ, Dept Econ, Orebro, Sweden.",ann-sofie.isaksson@economics.gu.se; andreas.kotsadam@frisch.uio.no,,"Isaksson, Ann-Sofie/0000-0003-2447-3665",Swedish Research Council; Norwegian Research Council [ES548591],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"Ann-Sofie Isaksson discloses that funding for her participation in writing this paper comes from the Swedish Research Council under the project Impacts of new forms of aid: Governance challenges and distributional consequences.

If market power is ignored and increases with size, it gets counted as additional cost efficiencies which leads to an over-prediction. I address this limitation by developing a model of the demand for consumer deposits at the geographic market level and cost efficiencies at the firm level. Incorporating the network structure of banks in the analysis increases dimensionality of the bank's choice set and also the possibility of multiple equilibria. To address these issues, I use moment inequality methods to estimate the cost parameters. Using a panel data from the U.S. banking industry, I find that the evidence of cost efficiencies is weak, at best, for all the banks. Using the estimated parameters, I simulate six mergers between banks of different sizes. In the short run, all the simulated mergers show dis-economies of scale on average. However, most of them show an increase in consumer welfare as the market power (or oligopoly) effect is dominated by an increase in the local branch density. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from a policy experiment in China,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Health insurance; Job lock; Entrepreneurship; China; Healthcare reform,BASIC MEDICAL INSURANCE; PROPENSITY SCORE; SELF-EMPLOYMENT; COVERAGE,"Previous researchers have shown that employment-based health insurance lowers job mobility and deters entrepreneurship. The Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) program, piloted in 2007 in China and fully established in 2009, offers health insurance to about 271 million urban residents without formal employment. Before the implementation of URBMI, most urban residents obtained health insurance through their employers, and therefore a large number of unemployed and self-employed individuals were uninsured. Thus, URBMI creates a new insurance option that does not depend on formal employment and may promote entrepreneurship. We take advantage of this policy change to evaluate the effect of URBMI on self-employment. Using 2000-2011 data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey and a difference-in-differences approach with propensity score weighting, we found that URBMI increased self-employment rate by at least 8.73% for the overall population. The result was mainly driven by the URBMI's impact on unhealthy workers, individuals with 12 years of schooling or less, and workers above 30 years old.

To gauge the economic consequences of these demographic trends, we implement an overlapping generations model with heterogeneity by level of education in which individuals optimally decide their consumption of market- and home-produced goods as well as the time spent on paid and unpaid work. We find that around 17 of the observed increase in per-capita income growth from 1850 to 2000 was due to the demographic transition. Around 50 of the demographic contribution is explained by the increase in the average productivity per worker (productivity component), which arises from the change in the population's age structure and the rise in households' saving rate. The remaining 50 is explained by the higher growth rate of workers relative to the total population (translation component).","[Sanchez-Romero, Miguel] WU, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, VID OAW, Vienna, Austria; [Abio, Gemma; Patxot, Concepcio] UB, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Souto, Guadalupe] UAB, Dept Econ Aplicada, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Sánchez-Romero, M (通讯作者)，WU, Wittgenstein Ctr Demog & Global Human Capital IIA, VID OAW, Vienna, Austria.",miguel.sanchez@oeaw.ac.at; abio@ub.edu; cio.patxot@ub.edu; guadalupe.souto@uab.cat,"Souto, Guadalupe/H-5977-2015; Patxot, Concepcio/M-9142-2014; Abio, Gemma/H-9797-2015","Souto, Guadalupe/0000-0002-8056-9330; Patxot, Concepcio/0000-0002-4382-0119; Abio, Gemma/0000-0003-4823-524X; Sanchez-Romero, Miguel/0000-0002-5999-6522","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (AGENTA project) [613247]","European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (AGENTA project)(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions)","This project has received institutional support from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (AGENTA project, grant agreement No: 613247).",,68,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

Based on the World Bank's definition of the poverty line, China has already eliminated abject poverty, even though the poverty rate was as high as 88.3 percent in 1981. The remarkable record in poverty reduction is predominantly attributable to growth. The effect of inequality varied in different periods. In addition, the impact of growth on poverty reduction is found to be diminishing over time, a phenomenon worth further research and policy attention.","[Wan, Guanghua; Zhang, Yan] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yin, Hua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Shanghai Dev, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",guanghuawan@yahoo.com; wang.chen@mail.shufe.edu.cn; yin.hua@mail.shufe.edu.cn; phd09010@grips.ac.jp,,,Natural Science Foundation of China [71703088]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [17PJC045],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71703088) and Shanghai Pujiang Program (No. 17PJC045).,,22,11,12,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAR-APR,2018,26.0,2,,,SI,,50,67,,10.1111/cwe.12236,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ3EJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427468900003,0

Imagine difference-in-differences analysis (DD)-a before-and-after comparison of the income-level difference-shows that the handicap has risen. Most observers would conclude to the policy's inefficiency. But second thoughts are needed, because DD rests heavily on the validity of a key assumption: parallel paths in the absence of treatment; an assumption that is often violated. To cope with this problem, economists traditionally include polynomial (linear, quadratic.) trends among the regressors, and estimate the treatment effect as a once-in-a-time trend shift. In practice that strategy does not work very well, because inter alia the estimation of the trend uses post-treatment data. What is needed is a method that i) uses pre-treatment observations to capture linear or non-linear trend differences, and ii) extrapolates these to compute the treatment effect. This paper shows how this can be achieved using a fully-flexible version of the canonical DD equation. It also contains an illustration using data on a 1994-2006 EU programme that was implemented in the Belgian province of Hainaut.","[Vandenberghe, Vincent] IRES UCL, Econ Sch Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",,"Vandenberghe, V (通讯作者)，IRES UCL, Econ Sch Louvain, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",vincent.vandenberghe@uclouvain.be,"Vandenberghe, V./L-9544-2013","Vandenberghe, V./0000-0002-1645-1127",,,,,19,1,1,0,0,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,FEB 27,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-9,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ2WC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427443400001,0

Absent a central authority, voluntary arrangements must replace coercive ones, and significant under-provision must be expected. International public goods are particularly challenging due to the substantial asymmetries among nations. Small-interest nations have strong incentives to ride cheaply. Our empirical results reveal cheap riding intentions in providing for climate change mitigation, a critical international public good. The evidence is provided by individual nations' Intended Nationally Determined Contributions voluntarily pledged for the Paris Climate Change Conference. We find that larger nations made much larger pledges in proportion to both their Gross National Incomes and their historical emissions. Implications for the Nordhaus Climate Club and carbon-tax proposals are discussed. To achieve Pareto optimality despite disparate cheap riding incentives, we propose the Cheap-Riding Efficient equilibrium. That solution takes the Nash equilibrium as a base point, and then applies the principles of either the Nash Bargaining solution or the Lindahl equilibrium to proceed to the Pareto frontier.","[Chen, Cuicui; Zeckhauser, Richard] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Zeckhauser, R (通讯作者)，79 JFK St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cuicuichen@fas.harvard.edu; richard_zeckhauser@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,47,14,16,2,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Shareholder value orientation is, in particular, identified as a characteristic of the post-1970 U.S. economy associated with a statistically and economically significant decline in NFC investment rates. The stock of financial assets, conversely, is found to be a positive correlate of firm investment. The analysis also highlights key differences by firm size. In particular, shareholder value norms are found to primarily influence the investment behavior of large NFCs, while rising volatility most substantially impacts small firms.","[Davis, Leila E.] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, 402 Warner Hall, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Davis, LE (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, 402 Warner Hall, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",ldavis@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,41,83,91,14,103,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2018,69.0,1,,,,,270,307,,10.1111/meca.12179,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FR5HG,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419096900015,0

The relationship between food and fuel prices can remarkably affect production strategies. These prices are subject to high uncertainty and producers must adopt hedging and storage strategies in order to avoid financial losses. This study investigates the effect of uncertainty on production, storage and hedging of ethanol and sugar in Brazilian mills. A robust optimization model to define production, storage and hedging strategies is proposed. Uncertainty sets on returns are constructed based on a state space model (Kalman Filter). The presented model was applied to Brazilian ethanol and sugar markets in different economic scenarios.

The hypothesis is tested through estimation of relationship between charges for the use of intellectual property and 1) gross domestic product, 2) GDP growth, 3) unemployment, 4) exports of high-tech products, 5) FDI outflow, and 6) expenses on research and development in a panel dataset of 146 countries in years 2005-2014 based Arellano-Bond estimator for dynamic panel models.

We examine both effective exchange rates and bilateral rates, the latter typically measured against the Swiss franc because Switzerland has had the longest period of negative nominal rates. We examine exchange rate volatility, exchange rate changes, deviations from uncovered interest parity, and profits from the carry trade.

Private provision of such goods might then be used if it succeeds in overcoming three main problems: high organization costs, the assurance problem, and the free-rider problem. We argue that technologies that enable crowdfunding - the method of funding projects by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people via the internet - have enabled these problems to be overcome more readily. Such technology has lowered organization costs and enabled the employment of more efficient mechanisms to reduce the assurance and free-rider problems.

The FREIPP method integrates risk-explicit interval linear programming and fuzzy theory within a general framework. It can tackle fuzzy and interval uncertainties in terms of various cost coefficients, forecasted load demand, decision maker's risk attitude and other uncertainties in microgrid system management. Compared with traditional interval parameter programming, the proposed method has distinct advantages in minimizing the system cost and risk simultaneously and providing more risk explicit solutions with the regard of obscure risk preference of decision maker. The FREIPP approach was successfully applied in a microgrid system with combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) generation for three types of decision maker (i.e. defensive, neutral and aggressive). The obtained results indicated that the proposed FREIPP approach could provide optimal operation strategies with explicit cost-risk tradeoff information for decision maker when facing multiple complex uncertainties. Furthermore, it could help decision maker with different risk tolerance select desired optimal risk-aversion strategies, which is more realistic in real-world decision making process.

By making reference to existing literature, we first differentiate repugnant from tasteful/distasteful transactions and bring up the additional consideration of the latter. There is a key difference between the two types of proscribed exchanges: repugnancy and distastefulness. The repugnancy of a transaction is determined by a single factor: tastes (preferences). The distastefulness of a transaction is determined by two factors: the true intention of the actor and the context of the transaction. We characterize tastefulness/distastefulness as a judgment: does the context of the transaction, which expresses declared intention, match the true intention of the actor? We identify four different kinds of intentions and their matching contexts of exchange. This allows us to classify four different kinds of tasteful transactions, i.e. when true intentions correspond to declared onesi.e., to their context. It also allows us to classify twelve different kinds of distasteful transactions.","[Khalil, Elias L.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Marciano, Alain] Univ Montpelier, Dept Econ, Montpellier, France",Monash University; Universite de Montpellier,"Khalil, EL (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",elias.khalil@monash.edu; alain.marciano@umontpellier.fr,"Khalil, Elias L/I-7075-2012; Khalil, Elias/ABA-3606-2021","Khalil, Elias/0000-0002-0510-447X",,,,,57,12,13,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2018,71.0,1,,,,,110,131,,10.1111/kykl.12164,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS5GQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419822700005,0

Motivated by EMU experience, this paper lays out a parsimonious model of fiscal-monetary policy interaction between national fiscal authorities and a common central bank. It is well known that the structure of this interaction changes fundamentally when the central bank is constrained by a binding zero lower bound on the interest rate. This paper demonstrates that decentralized fiscal policies suffer from a systematic procyclical bias in a monetary union, both when the zero lower bound bites and when it does not. Whereas the existing literature on fiscal policy coordination knows locomotive games and discipline games, in which fiscal policies are too tight or too loose, respectively, the analysis in this paper identifies a more general stabilization game in which coordination can play a useful role by strengthening the countercyclical thrust of fiscal policies.","[Landmann, Oliver] Univ Freiburg, Inst Wirtschaftswissensch, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Baden Wurttembe, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Landmann, O (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Inst Wirtschaftswissensch, Pl Alten Synagoge, D-79085 Freiburg, Baden Wurttembe, Germany.",oliver.landmann@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,"Landmann, Oliver/0000-0003-3136-7692",,,,,37,5,6,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This study tests the long-term and short-term effects of real gross domestic product (GDP), interest rate and rate of stock market return on the prices of different lines of non-life insurance, i.e., property-liability insurance and personal accident insurance. The results indicate that the price dynamics of property-liability insurance are generally similar to those of developed countries, except for the effect of GDP, while price determination of personal accident insurance seems to be affected by a wider range of economic and institutional variables and has its own features. The price dynamics of non-life insurance in China have been identified as being connected to the country-specific economic and institutional environments.","[Tian, Ling; Jiang, Shi-Jie; Pan, Guochen] Wuhan Univ, Dept Insurance & Actuarial Sci, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ning] Hunan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Hunan University,"Zhang, N (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhangning1231@126.com,"pan, guochen/D-3056-2013",,,,,,34,4,4,5,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We analyse the sluggish recovery in business investment in the euro area and the role of monetary policy in three steps. We investigate the main factors that have impeded business investment since the Global Financial Crisis. We empirically analyse how business investment has developed compared to typical patterns during other financial crises. Based on these results, we then discuss how effective monetary policy has been in stimulating business investment since the Global Financial Crisis. We conclude that business investment in the euro area has developed broadly in line with typical post-crisis patterns. Monetary policy significantly contributed to stabilize business investment at the beginning of the crises. In the aftermath of the crises, however, there seems to be little scope for monetary policy to further stimulate investment.","[Ademmer, Martin; Jannsen, Nils] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Jannsen, N (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",nils.jannsen@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,44,7,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this article, the authors develop a more general and comprehensive critique, both from a theoretical and from an empirical perspective. They first present a short-run model that formally describes the theoretical background of specific policy measures advocated by expansionary austerity supporters. They show how these measures might only have expansionary outcomes under extreme and unrealistic conditions. The authors then move to the data and provide an econometric analysis of the key variables that leave the results of our theoretical model undetermined; their findings reinforce the validity of our theoretical critique. Since 2007, when an important opportunity to test expansionary austerity presented itself with the recession, the core mechanisms of expansionary austerity theory seem to not have been working, to say the least. In fact, austerity measures delivered perverse results precisely in the countries where they were expected to be most effective.","[Botta, Alberto] Univ Greenwich London, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England; [Tori, Daniele] Open Univ Milton Keynes, Dept Accounting & Finance, London, England",,"Botta, A (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich London, Dept Int Business & Econ, London, England.",,"Tori, Daniele/H-9013-2019; Botta, Alberto/ABT-2795-2022","Tori, Daniele/0000-0003-2947-8481; BOTTA, Alberto/0000-0001-9464-8251",,,,,33,8,9,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Our estimator based on the second-order approximation resembles the GMM estimator proposed by Kelejian and Prucha in 1999. Hence, we provide an intuitive interpretation of their estimator. Additionally, we provide a convenient framework for computing the weighting matrix of the optimal GMM estimator. Heteroskedasticity robust versions of our estimators are also proposed.

In this article, we investigate whether UGPA predicts graduate student performance in order to discuss its usefulness as an admission criterion.

Having data from a cohort of students whose selection was in clear conflict with the legal requirement, we empirically confirm our theoretical predictions by exploiting a unique opportunity for assessing educational policies.

This article shows that mafia-owned legal enterprises establish a lasting, unproductive, and even destructive entrepreneurship. The mafia strives to create an artificial scarcity that affects only its non-members, and thus the mafia manages to dominate markets and other entrepreneurs. The mafia then turns from its initial appropriative functions into a rule-producing function in order to shape markets. More specifically, the mafia asserts itself as a competing sovereign thanks to its power to withhold resources obtained through property over productive entities.","[Champeyrache, Clotilde] Univ Paris 08, Paris, France",Universite Paris-VIII,"Champeyrache, C (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,31,9,9,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Due to the small scale and poor financial information transparency and structure of SMEs, they rely greatly on bank loans and credit guarantee in fund sources. The effect to bank efficiency from loans to SMEs and credit guarantee, therefore, is an important topic. In addition, banks in Taiwan have been undergoing consolidation in more than one decade. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bank M&A, SME lending, credit guarantee and efficiency from Taiwan commercial bank point of view. Based on our empirical results, the SME lending has a positive effect on the cost and profit efficiency. When banks increase credit guarantee for SMEs, the profit efficiency of banks would increase, but cost efficiency decreases instead. The result shows that credit guarantee scheme can reduce the expected loss generated from bad debts and increase expected return derived from lending. In M&A, foreign M&A or foreign capital invested banks have relatively better profit efficiency underwent to merge.","[Chih, Shu-Hwa] Soochow Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liang, Lien-Wen] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Huang, Bor-Yi] Shih Chien Univ, Dept Finance & Banking, Taipei, Taiwan",Soochow University; Chinese Culture University; Shih Chien University,"Chih, SH (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan.",shchih@scu.edu.tw; llw@faculty.pccu.edu.tw; hby-1688@g2.usc.edu.tw,"Liang, Lien-Wen/HMD-1375-2023",,,,,,40,2,3,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Using survey data for a representative sample of Italian individuals, we find that social interactions play a dual role. On the one hand, the well-being of people who spend more time with their friends or go out more often is less sensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations. On the other hand, social interactions are negatively affected by worsening macroeconomic conditions, thus playing a relevant role in the transmission of macroeconomic shocks to subjective well-being. More specifically, the negative impact of downturns on the frequency of going out and active participation in associations significantly contributes to the adverse effects of recessions on satisfaction with life and with individual life domains.","[Colombo, Emilio] Univ Cattolica S Cuore, DISEIS, Milan, Italy; [Rotondi, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Stanca, Luca] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ & NeuroMI, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Bocconi University; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Stanca, L (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ & NeuroMI, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, Milan, Italy.",luca.stanca@unimib.it,"Rotondi, Valentina/AAS-1937-2020; Rotondi, Valentina/ABB-2333-2021","Rotondi, Valentina/0000-0003-0879-7635; COLOMBO, EMILIO/0000-0002-0646-5680",,,,,50,5,5,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Could an energy labeling requirement for residential real estate help? We propose that the salient color-letter grades on the English Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) served as targets, motivating vendors to invest in energy efficiency. To test our hypothesis we look to a random sample of over 16,000 homes in England. In the post-EPC data we find a cluster of homes with energy efficiency scores just above the D-grade threshold. This cluster was not present prior to the requirement, replicates in an independently-drawn random sample and is significantly larger amongst properties that can be identified as treated by the EPC requirement. We conclude that the EPC requirement induced investment, and hence that energy efficiency labels have potential to green the housing stock. We infer from our analysis how the design of the EPC could be altered to motivate greater investment in energy efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas introducing each assumption without the other one does not produce novel insights, combining them together does if the wage rate is sufficiently high. For top earners, work has a positive marginal utility at the optimum and above a critical wage level it converts into a pure consumption good. Their labor supply curve is first backward bending and then vertical. This can justify an optimal marginal tax rate on top incomes equal to 100%. Top earners in the vertical half-line of the labor supply curve optimally refrain from spending their entire income. At the macroeconomic level, this can generate a lack of effective demand. With some qualifications, these findings carry over to models that include savings and philanthropy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that in countries that have successfully industrialised, there is a strong positive correlation between labour productivity growth in agriculture and the manufacturing employment share up until the point at which the manufacturing employment share peaks. Since 1996, there is also a positive correlation between labour productivity in agriculture and the manufacturing employment share in Africa.

This paper investigates whether this is the case for 60 Vietnamese provinces for the time-period 1999-2010, using a system-GMM estimator and a Solow growth model augmented with human and physical capital and spatial-lag covariates. We report that spatial dependence is a significant determinant of growth and conditional convergence in Vietnamese provinces. We also demonstrate that the rate of convergence decreases as the distance between neighbouring provinces increases. Given these findings, we recommend testing for spatial dependence in growth models for Vietnam and beyond to avoid omitted variable bias and inform evidence-based regional policies that take account of spatial externalities.","[Esiyok, Bulent] Baskent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Ugur, Mehmet] Univ Greenwich, Business Sch, Greenwich Polit Econ Res Ctr, London, England",Baskent University; University of Greenwich,"Esiyok, B (通讯作者)，Baskent Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",besiyok@baskent.edu.tr,"EŞİYOK, BÜLENT/HTR-6588-2023; Ugur, Mehmet/AAG-5018-2019","Ugur, Mehmet/0000-0003-3891-3641; Esiyok, Bulent/0000-0001-7469-5309",,,,,27,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

It shows that the so-called transfer and trust effects, defined by each country's position in the international mergers and acquisitions network, have a positive influence on foreign investment inflows. Social network analysis is used to quantify both transfer and trust effects, and models with panel data are applied to estimate the influence of such variables on the receipt of financial flows. The results confirm that both trust and transfer effects have positive influences on FDI inflows. The models also identify groups of countries with clear differences in this relationship.","[Galaso, Pablo] Univ Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Sanchez Diez, Angeles; Garcia Gamez, Sofia] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Olivas, Cesar] Univ Autonoma Ciudad Juarez, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad Juarez","Galaso, P (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Montevideo, Uruguay.",pgalaso@iecon.ccee.edu.uy; angeles.sanchez@uam.es; sofia.garcia@uam.es; olivas@uacj.mx,"Galaso, Pablo/Z-3250-2019","Galaso, Pablo/0000-0002-7639-8225",,,,,58,0,0,1,10,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

While they share many characteristics, they are also diverse in term of specialization and destination markets. Italy has a productive structure largely based on labour intensive sectors, while Germany is mainly specialized in high-tech goods. We study whether these characteristics make the two countries vulnerable in different ways to the competitive pressure by emerging economies, especially China, which experienced the strongest increase in export market share during the last decades. We discuss the impact of China on the export performance of Italy and Germany on OECD markets. Using data for the period 1995-2009, we implement a novel model to account for two important data characteristics: their hierarchical hidden structure (captured by a multilevel model) and the heterogeneity of the export shares (captured by a quantile approach). Results show that Chinese competition on Italy's and Germany's market shares differ by sectors, but, on average, Italy is not more vulnerable than Germany. These results are relevant for policy implications and for an ex-post analysis of the best response' to the Chinese competition.","[Giovannetti, Giorgia] Univ Florence, Dept Econ, Florence, Italy; [Giovannetti, Giorgia] European Univ Inst, Fiesole, Italy; [Sanfilippo, Marco] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Sci Polit, Bari, Italy; [Sanfilippo, Marco] Univ Antwerp, IOB, Antwerp, Belgium; [Velucchi, Margherita] Univ Europea Roma, Sci Umane, Rome, Italy",University of Florence; European University Institute; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Antwerp; European University of Rome,"Velucchi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Europea Roma, Sci Umane, Rome, Italy.",margherita.velucchi@unier.it,,"giovannetti, giorgia/0000-0001-6322-2696; VELUCCHI, Margherita/0000-0002-1841-0484; Sanfilippo, Marco/0000-0001-8062-3352",,,,,37,2,2,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Spatial Economic Analysis. When estimating regional inequality, many economists use inequality indices weighted by regions' proportion of the national population. Although this approach is widespread, its adequacy has not received attention in the regional science literature. This paper proves that such an approach is conceptually inconsistent, yielding an estimate of interpersonal inequality among the whole population of the country rather than an estimate of regional inequality. Nevertheless, as a measure of interpersonal inequality, such an estimate is very rough (even misleading) and does not always have an intuitive interpretation. Moreover, population-weighted inequality indices do not meet the requirements for an adequate measure of inequality.","[Gluschenko, Konstantin] Novosibirsk State Univ, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Gluschenko, Konstantin] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia",Novosibirsk State University; Institute of Economics & Industrial Engineering of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Gluschenko, K (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Univ, Novosibirsk, Russia.;Gluschenko, K (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ & Ind Engn, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia.",glu@nsu.ru,"Gluschenko, Konstantin/H-1138-2013","Gluschenko, Konstantin/0000-0003-1209-3809",,,,,36,26,27,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

The study was conducted based on a large dataset available from 1995 to 2010 and comprising 81 countries. As for the Technological dimension, more patents by residents increases piracy losses while the effect of R&D is the opposite (decreases piracy losses). In terms of the Educational dimension, the results show that more spending on education increase the piracy losses but, at the same time, more schooling years have the contrary effect. Concerning the Institutional dimension, nations with less corruption have lower piracy levels. Regarding the Access to Information, it seems that access to Internet diminishes the losses while the share of Internet broadband subscriptions has no effect. The results also show that, regarding the Labor dimension, employment in services has a deterrent effect while labor force with higher education and youth unemployment increases piracy losses.","[Gomes, Nicolas Dias; Alcada-Almeida, Luis] Coimbra Univ, Fac Econ, INESCC, Coimbra, Portugal; [Cerqueira, Pedro Andre] Coimbra Univ, Fac Econ, GEMF, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Gomes, ND (通讯作者)，Coimbra Univ, Fac Econ, INESCC, Coimbra, Portugal.",nicolasdiasgomes@gmail.com,"Cerqueira, Pedro/K-6899-2019; Alcada-Almeida, Luis/F-6052-2014","Cerqueira, Pedro/0000-0002-3155-188X; Alcada-Almeida, Luis/0000-0003-1272-9053",,,,,33,2,3,2,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We use a difference in-difference approach to estimate the causal effect of the release of information about high-quality and low-quality schools relative to medium-quality schools in the neighborhood and find that the release of information about high-quality schools increases property prices by 3.6 percent, whereas the release of information about low-quality schools has no significant effect. The findings indicate that many buyers are unaware of the relevance of school quality information and that real estate agents pursue a strategy of disclosing information about high-quality schools to increase the sales price.

We find that overall matching efficiency declined smoothly over the period from 2001 through 2013. Measures of matching efficiency that neglect heterogeneity among the unemployed and also neglect job-seekers other than the unemployed suggest a large 28 percent decline in efficiency between 2007 and 2009.

This paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of citizens' responsibility attribution by analyzing the Spanish case. A novel methodological approach is used by separately analyzing those citizens who fail to identify the competent level of government and those who did not even give an answer. Besides, two novel hypotheses are tested regarding the process by which information is transmitted to and absorbed by citizens: the impact of regional media and the territorial group bias. After confirming that the methodological strategy is correct, we find strong evidence that the existence of regional media helps responsibility attribution, thus fostering accountability; while co-official languages, used as a proxy of a group bias, hamper the process by which citizens identify the competent level of government.","[Herrero-Alcalde, Ana; Tranchez Martin, Jose Manuel] Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain; [Rltiz de Zuazu, Maria Goenaga] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Complutense University of Madrid,"Herrero-Alcalde, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Educ Distancia, Madrid, Spain.",,"Goenaga, María/AAQ-3018-2020; Herrero-Alcalde, Ana/F-2881-2018","Goenaga, María/0000-0002-2276-770X; Herrero-Alcalde, Ana/0000-0002-9594-1967",,,,,43,1,1,0,3,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2018,,226,,,,,37,58,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.18.3.2,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF2BO,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454041300002,0

When writing a long-term contract the parties have to rely on renegotiation in order to ensure materially efficient trade ex post. We show that if the buyer expects renegotiation to occur, the seller can opportunistically exploit the buyer's attachment to the expected outcome of renegotiation. In other words, incomplete contracts create a new type of hold-up problem. If credible, the buyer prefers to expect not to renegotiate, which gives rise to ex post inefficiencies. In a next step, we allow the buyer to undertake a non-contractible investment. We find that loss aversion can mitigate the traditional hold-up problem. (C) 2017 Elsevier.B.V.

We show that the imposition of the tariff and nontariff barriers associated with Brexit triggers the significant contraction of bilateral trade between the UK and the remaining 27 members of the European Union (EU27), exacerbated by firm exit from export markets. Given the imposition of these trade barriers, budget savings, migrants returning to the EU27 from the UK, and intra-EU27 integration and free trade agreements with the US and Japan, the IRS model predicts a total export loss of 5.1-5.8% of UK GDP and a total welfare loss of 1.1-1.5%. This is 60% greater than the CRS model predictions. However, the impact on output would vary between industries, whereby the UK chemical and automobile industries would contract, but its food and beverage sector and the business and information and communication technology service sectors would expand. In contrast, the EU27 would gain substantially from other integration programs, but lose very little from the stronger UK EU27 border barriers. This suggests that the EU27 should have little interest in negotiations aimed at avoiding a hard Brexit (the surrendering by the UK of full access to the single market) and that it would be more productive for it to focus on integration programs with trade partners other than the UK.","[Hosoe, Nobuhiro] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Hosoe, N (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",nhosoe@grips.ac.jp,"Hosoe, Nobuhiro/AAG-7206-2020; Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023","Hosoe, Nobuhiro/0000-0001-7265-3455;",JSPS KAKENHI [16K03613]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03613] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author thanks Tomoki Ishikura and the anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions and gratefully acknowledges that this work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant (No. 16K03613).

Carefully designed marketing investments may contribute to substantial growth of Korean firm's brand value and competitive strength in the global market. Brand equity is one of the most valuable assets of a firm and is considered to be a growth engine with the potential of lasting effects on the firm's performance and value. This study assesses the relationship between the firms' branding investments and their financial performance for the validation of marketing accountability. The authors examine Korean firm's brand equity from seventeen industries, using Simon and Sullivan's framework with the firm-level financial performance metrics based on firms' accounting and financial data. A sample 514 firms on the Korean Stock Exchange listing (i.e. KOSPI and KOSDAQ) from 17 different industries for the period of global financial crisis (2005-2010) are selected to evaluate comparable brand equity among the selected industries. Findings reveal that Korea Corporate's investments in marketing activities have a positive impact on brand equity and their financial performance. The study confirms the benefits of branding investments in Korea Corporate's financial performance.","[Kim, Renee B.] Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, 608,222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoon, Dong Hyun] Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Korea Inst Sustainable Econ, 608,222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University; Hanyang University,"Kim, RB (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, 608,222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",kimrby@gmail.com; midane2000@gmail.com,"KIM, BOYOUNG RENEE/B-9861-2018",,Research Fund of Hanyang University [HY 2018]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2924243],"Research Fund of Hanyang University; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Research Fund of Hanyang University (HY 2018).; This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2016S1A3A2924243),,41,2,3,1,17,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

According to the mainstream monetary theory, these dynamics should make the exports cheaper and at the same time make the imports more expensive. Has real depreciation of the euro helped in the improvement of European countries' trade balances? Following the main methodologies in the recent literature, our study analyses the effects of this depreciation both for Italy and Germany towards the US. We use industry-level data at monthly frequency. The results are different from each bilateral relationship. We find that 11 industries register a long-run improvement (8 for Italy and 3 for Germany). The J-curve effect is proven just in six cases, always for Italy. The inverted J-curve effect is proven in eight cases, four for Germany, and four for Italy. These results seem to be an indirect demonstration of the structural asymmetries between German and Italian economies: German economic system is more able to be competitive with a strong currency, than Italy.","[Lucarelli, Stefano; Andrini, Filippo Umberto; Bianchi, Annamaria] Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Sci Aziendali Econ & Metodi Quantita, Bergamo, Italy",University of Bergamo,"Lucarelli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Dipartimento Sci Aziendali Econ & Metodi Quantita, Bergamo, Italy.",stefano.lucarelli@unibg.it,"Lucarelli, Stefano/B-5253-2016","Lucarelli, Stefano/0000-0003-1971-3265",,,,,30,18,18,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This claim is supported in the literature on social capital. However, the empirical evidence in this field remains ambiguous. While the literature recognizes that 'connections' help finding any job at all, it remains unclear if long-term benefits exist. In contrast to other industries, collaborations between performers in adult films are easily observed. Consequently, a collaborative network can be constructed which serves as an input in order to estimate the effect of a person's centrality on individual success. Unfortunately, success is not easily observed either. Hence, in this manuscript, the survival in the industry is used as a proxy for professional success. This assumption is justified by the economic argument that, in the absence of lock-in effects, performers will remain in the industry as long as it remains profitable. The profitability does not only depend on monetary aspects but also includes costs from social stigma and adverse effects on health and mental wellbeing. Using a combination of network analysis and duration models, the results indicate that there is a strong correlation between network centrality and survival in the adult film industry.","[Luedering, Jochen] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res ZEU, Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Lüdering, J (通讯作者)，Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Ctr Int Dev & Environm Res ZEU, Giessen, Germany.",jochen.luedering@zeu.uni-giessen.de,,,,,,,58,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The aim of this work is to analyse how these reforms affect two important features of a pension system: fiscal sustainability and adequacy. For this purpose, the real internal rate of return (IRR) of the lifetime contributions and benefits and the prospective gross theoretical replacement rate (TRR), both before and after the reforms, have been computed. The calculations are case-study based, for a few hypothetical workers who are sufficiently representative of the earnings and retirement patterns in Spain. The results show that the real IRR is 0.7 p.p. lower and the prospective gross TRR is 18 p.p. lower after the reform process for the base case of a man with an uninterrupted career of 40years with average earnings and a retirement age of 65.

As a novel approach to measuring risk in networks, this paper proposes RiskRank as a general-purpose aggregation operator of risk in nodes and links. RiskRank relies on a system represented as a hierarchical network, where node values and linkages represent individual risk levels and interconnectedness, respectively. The measure is used to aggregate risk in the vein of a novel network centrality measure, allowing for the integration of the interrelations of different entities in the network with any other measure of node risk. The use of RiskRank is illustrated through a real-world case on systemic risk in Europe, in which we show that it improves performance in out-of-sample analysis. We provide an estimation of systemic risk from country-level risk indicators and combine it with cross-border linkages to illustrate the practical benefit of the proposed approach. From a policy perspective, our results strengthen the results of previous research and underline the importance of integrating a network perspective in macro-prudential analysis.","[Sarlin, Peter] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helsinki, Finland; [Sarlin, Peter] Arcada Univ Appl Sci, RiskLab Finland, Helsinki, Finland; [Mezei, Jozsef] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland",Hanken School of Economics; Arcada University of Applied Sciences; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Sarlin, P (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helsinki, Finland.",peter@risklab.fi,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,16,16,1,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Based on the research of Baele et al., which insists that well-diversified bank portfolios increase systematic risk, the study aims at determining whether South Korean banks reduce their loan portfolio risk by flexibly adjusting their loan portfolios to mitigate risk from the GDP shock. The generalized method of moments with panel data drawn from 17 South Korean banks is used in this empirical study. The main results show that South Korean banks exhibit lending behavior related to adjustment to portfolio weight in their loan assets and that this behavior is sensitive to the GDP shock. Moreover, this study examines whether the effect of the GDP shock on changes to loan portfolio weight can be differentially attributed to the differences in bank ownership and location.","[Moon, Gyu-Hyen] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Seo, Ji-Yong] Sangmyung Univ, Div Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Kyonggi University; Sangmyung University,"Seo, JY (通讯作者)，Sangmyung Univ, Div Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea.",jyseo@smu.ac.kr,,,,,,,52,2,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

According to the estimation results, investment demand shocks are more important than investment supply shocks in driving aggregate fluctuations. Furthermore, sticky investment prices are important to capture the effects of sector-specific technology shocks, in particular recessionary investment supply shocks. Finally, the model suggests that the relative price of investment provides a poor indicator of relative technology in short to medium horizons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach Both the OLI paradigm and the imbalance theory are linked to the diamond model in order to compare the effects of conventional and unconventional FDI on the host country. This methodology is then applied to the real world as a case study, FDI toward the Korean automobile industry. Findings Conventional FDI is often said to be more beneficial to the host country than the unconventional type. However, the actual effect of unconventional FDI is shown to be more positive with better management and is often larger than perceived. Therefore, unconventional FDI emerges as important as conventional FDI for sustainable economic development. Practical implications In general, unconventional FDI has often been criticized severely because of misperceptions derived from the dominance of conventional FDI on theoretical aspects, incomprehensive perspectives toward assessing the effects of FDI, and negative political views. Therefore, rigorous and holistic case study analyses based on solid analytical tools are needed in order to better understand the effects of unconventional FDI and to draw up effective and proper FDI promotion policies. Originality/value This paper provides a way to better understand the effect of unconventional FDI on the host country comprehensively and systematically by expanding and deepening existing theories. Based on this, the effects of conventional and unconventional FDI on the host country are compared theoretically and empirically, particularly with the case of the Korean automobile industry.","[Parc, Jimmyn] Sci Po, PSIA, Paris, France; [Parc, Jimmyn] Seoul Natl Univ, EU Ctr, GSIS, Seoul, South Korea; [Jung, Jin Sup] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Int Business, Cheongju, South Korea",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Seoul National University (SNU); Chungbuk National University,"Jung, JS (通讯作者)，Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Int Business, Cheongju, South Korea.",jsjung@chungbuk.ac.kr,"Parc, Jimmyn/AAD-4706-2020","Parc, Jimmyn/0000-0002-4836-460X",,,,,70,1,3,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The interventions were applied to a sample of high-income households and included a set of text message reminders advising participants to reduce electricity use during peak hours. One group of participants received accompanying intra-day increases in peak-hour kWh rates, while another group of participants did not receive any price incentives. We find that intra-day price increases, though small in absolute magnitude, produced significant reductions in peak energy use. Reductions in use, as compared to a control group, were significantly higher among the pricing group compared to the group only receiving text messages, suggesting that pricing played a central role in influencing behaviour.

The ANC implemented policies that made South Africa more open to international trade and financial flows along with privatization and austerity, other than a modest increase in social expenditures. After twenty-three years of such policies, we can judge their effectiveness. Unfortunately, neoliberalism worsened the inequality created under apartheid and failed to stimulate significant growth and development. This article documents the extent to which the maintenance of key apartheid-era institutions, under the guise of market friendly policies,undermined the prospects for long-term economic and human development in South Africa. This post- apartheid development debacle should go down in history as one of the great failures of mainstream economics and its neoliberal policy recommendations. Breaking the cycle of uneven development in South Africa will require fundamental changes in institutions, including changes in democracy, ownership structures, and the very nature of the economic system. This article offers some ideas for how an adjusted institutional structure might reconfigure the social provisioning process in South Africa to address racial divisions and lingering inequality.","[Schneider, Geoffrey E.] Bucknell Univ, Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Schneider, GE (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Econ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",,"Schneider, Geoffrey/ABB-6945-2021",,,,,,29,8,12,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Recently, a strong increase of non -recourse project finance (as compared to corporate finance on a project sponsor's balance sheets) could be observed for power generation projects. Classical economic motivations for project finance are the prevention of contamination risk, and agency conflicts - however, these reasons do not apply for comparably small projects in low-risk environments, such as many renewable energy projects being realized today. This paper therefore assesses the importance of project finance for renewable energy projects in investment-grade countries, and the underlying drivers to use this kind of finance. Eight potential reasons for using project finance are distilled from economic and finance theory, and then empirically evaluated using a novel dataset for new power plant investments in Germany 2010-2015. Results show that in this extreme case with particularly low investment risks, project finance has much larger importance for renewables than for fossil fuel-based power plants. It is not used to reduce contamination risk or agency conflicts, but, instead driven by the debt overhang of non-utility sponsors such as independent project developers. We discuss implications for policy makers, the financial sector, as well as energy scholars concerned with power generation investment decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Carrier I has a fleet of vehicles with known capacities which can be used in the TSP-style (Travelling Salesman Problem, i.e., a vehicle can serve a sequence of nodes and returns to City 1) and the price of the delivery is proportional to the total distance traveled by all vehicles. Carrier II works in a similar way, with the exception that he has a single vehicle with an unlimited capacity and that the price is proportional to the distance traveled and weight transported. Carrier III is a kind of 'post-office' - the costs are proportional to the weight transported only. The question is how to assign the batches to the carriers in order to minimize overall shipping costs. We design two heuristic algorithms for the problem. We compare their performance to the exact approach: we formulate a natural Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and use CPLEX to solve it.","[Stourac, Petr; Cerny, Michal; Rada, Miroslav] Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam W Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Stourac, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Econometr, Fac Informat & Stat, Nam W Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",stop02@vse.cz; cernym@vse.cz; miroslav.rada@vse.cz,"Stourac, Petr/J-3610-2012",,Czech Science Foundation [16-00408S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation under grant 16-00408S.,,8,1,1,0,1,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,332,339,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500045,0

These hypotheses are based on the opportunity and willingness framework and describe how fish values and production can drive fishermen to engage in illegal activities, and the mechanisms that their capabilities and choices make available to them stipulate the forms that piracy takes when facing a declining fishing economy. The hypotheses are tested with the Maritime Piracy Data (MPD) using the negative binomial regression and the bivariate Poisson model. This study uses the instrumental variable approach to deal with endogeneity through two instruments: chlorophyll concentrations and temperature. The statistical analysis shows that unsophisticated piracy attacks are sensitive to fish production, but sophisticated attacks can be affected by both fish production and fish values and depend on the opportunity cost of existing fisheries and finding work in other industries.","[Tominaga, Yasutaka] Waseda Univ, Inst Adv Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Tominaga, Y (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Inst Adv Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",y-tominaga@hotmail.co.jp,,"Tominaga, Yasutaka/0000-0001-6339-1334",Konosuke Matsushita Memorial Foundation,Konosuke Matsushita Memorial Foundation,"This work was supported by the Konosuke Matsushita Memorial Foundation.

Results from our system generalized method of moments reveal differential effects of finance on trade. In particular, we notice that, private credit does not promote trade while domestic credit positively affects trade. These effects are robust to measures of trade. Thus, improving the level of private (domestic) credit dampens (amplifies) exports and trade openness. However, we also find a U-shaped relationship between private credit and trade measures suggesting that financial sector development may be detrimental (helpful) to trade for economies with low (high) level of private credit.","[Yakubu, Awudu Sare] Univ Dev Studies, Sch Business & Law, Dept Banking & Finance, Tamale, Upper West Regi, Ghana; [Aboagye, Anthony Q.

The former determines the markup and profits of firms, whereas the latter determines the degree to which a patent blocks the subsequent invention. Elastic labor supply and subsidies for intermediate goods and research are also considered. The main results are as follows. First, patents and subsidies are substitutable in eliminating the distortions of this model. Second. given the limited use of subsidies in practice, we study optimal patent protection with exogenous subsidies and derive the coordination of patent instruments attaining the social optimum. Third, optimizing only the profit-division rule retains the first-best R&D level and growth rate, but optimizing only patent breadth could lead to under- or over-investment in R&D: either of these cases is less welfare-enhancing than optimizing their mix. Finally, the model is calibrated to quantify the welfare gains from the decentralized equilibrium to the outcomes with the optimal patent instrument(s), and these welfare improvements can be substantially large. Hence, this study sheds some light on the optimal design and welfare implications of a patent system that is multidimensional and blocks future innovations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our results show that using a measure based on gross exports, rather than TiVA, causes relatively large overestimation of the impact of the RMB exchange rate on China's bilateral trade balance. This overestimation is mainly because that the increasing production of exports may require increasing intermediate imports as a consequence of international fragmentation of production in global value chains. In addition, our results also show that the impact of FDI inflows on China's bilateral trade balances depends on the position and role of China and its trading partners in GVCs.","[Zhang, Hongsheng; Ma, Shuzhong] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Meng, Bo] JETRO, Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan",Zhejiang University,"Ma, SZ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",mashuzhong@zju.edu.cn,"Meng, Bo/AAP-5042-2020","Meng, Bo/0000-0003-1179-5390",Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Zhejiang University (NCET) [NCET-12-0496]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473217]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; IDE-JETRO; Fudan University,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Zhejiang University (NCET); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); IDE-JETRO; Fudan University,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [grant number NCET-12-0496]; The National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71473217]; BRICs Economy and Global Value Chains co-funded by IDE-JETRO and Fudan University; the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,,46,8,8,7,56,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We motivate this reformulation with five shortcomings largely drawn from the 2015 findings of the African Gerome Variation Project, notably: limitations in the conception of space, an African dummy in genetic diversity, linearity in migratory patterns, migratory origins and underpinnings of genetic diversity in Africa. Ashraf and Galor have concluded that cross-country differences in development can be explained by genetic diversity in a Kuznets or inverted U-shaped pattern. Our results from an exclusive African perspective partially confirm the underlying hypothesis in a contemporary context, but not in the historical analysis. From a historical context, the nexus is U-shaped for migratory distance, mobility index and predicted diversity while for the contemporary analysis; it is hump shaped for ancestry-adjusted predicted diversity. Hence from a within-Africa comparative standpoint, poverty is not in the African gene.","[Asongu, Simplice A.] African Governance & Dev Inst, POB 8413, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Asongu, Simplice A.] Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa; [Kodila-Tedika, Oasis] Univ Kinshasa, Dept Econ, RDC, Kinshasa, DEM REP CONGO",African Governance & Development Institute; University of South Africa; Universite de Kinshasa,"Asongu, SA (通讯作者)，African Governance & Dev Inst, POB 8413, Yaounde, Cameroon.;Asongu, SA (通讯作者)，Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa.",asongusimplice@yahoo.com,"Simplice, Asongu/K-3436-2014","Simplice, Asongu/0000-0001-5227-5135",,,,,73,46,46,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Based on tradition and computational reasons, such indicators are still predominantly treated as continuous outcomes in practice. This usually neglects their nature (as respondents are normally asked to state their preferences, or level of agreement with a set of statements, using a discrete scale) and may induce bias. We conducted an analysis based on simulated data and real information (two case studies) and were able to find that the distribution of the indicators (especially when associated with nonuniformly spaced thresholds) may lead to a clear deterioration of the model's overall predictive capacity, when assuming continuous indicators. This, however, does not translate to the goodness-of- fit of the discrete-choice component of the HDC model. Along the same line, a higher relative variability of the latent variables increases the differences between both approaches (ordinal and continuous outcomes), especially concerning the goodness-of-fit of the discrete-choice component of the model. It was not possible to identify a relation between the predictive capacity of both approaches and the amount of available information. Considering more indicators tend to reduce the gap between both approaches, but the effect is significantly smaller than the effect of the relative variability. Finally, two case studies using real data confirmed that no major differences, regarding the predictability of the discrete choices can be observed when the relative variability of the latent variables is low. Thus, we recommend analyzing this relative variability in order to decide on the suitability of the continuous assumption as a suitable alternative to the more onerous but correct ordinal treatment.","[Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Cologne, Germany; [Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Deutsch Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Energy Transportat & Environm Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco J.] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [de Dios Ortuzar, de Dios OrtuzarJuan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Transport Engn & Logist, Santiago, Chile",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Technical University of Berlin; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Bahamonde-Birke, FJ (通讯作者)，Deutsch Zentrum Luft & Raumfahrt DLR, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Cologne, Germany.",bahamondebirke@gmail.com; jos@ing.puc.cl,"Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/F-8277-2013","Ortúzar, Juan de Dios/0000-0003-3452-3574; Bahamonde-Birke, Francisco/0000-0001-8325-8055","Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (Austria); Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure; National Centre for Research and Development (Poland); Millennium Institute in Complex Engineering Systems [ICM: P05-004F, FONDECYT: FB8016]; Volvo Research and Educational Foundations; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, CEDEUS [Conicyt/Fondap/15110020]","Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology (Austria); Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure; National Centre for Research and Development (Poland)(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland); Millennium Institute in Complex Engineering Systems; Volvo Research and Educational Foundations; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation); Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, CEDEUS","This paper is partially based on scientific work done in the DEFINE project (Development of an Evaluation Framework for the Introduction of Electromobility).

To do so, we examine a quasi-experimental policy reform occurring in Chile in 2008. Using vital statistics covering all births and foetal deaths over the period 2006-12, we show that the availability of the emergency contraceptive pill reduces pregnancy and early gestation foetal death, which we argue proxies for illegal abortion.

Global value chains reflect specialization and labour division of companies, mostly multinational enterprises - MNEs. MNEs can be considered flagships of some industries. Such flagships influence suppliers and purchasers. MNEs are a part of networks or have got access to such networks that combine dispersion of the value chain, the boundaries of the firm and across national borders. Purpose of the article: The impetus for this work was to look at the position of Slovak cities (Bratislava, Zilina) in order to look for sectors that can help to develop the city and its adjacent regions, particularly cross-border regions. The paper discussed how the attribute of the cross-border regions gives the cities more advantageous position in GVCs. Methodology: Applying the method of location quotient allowed to shed a light on the GVCs, which cities participate in. Some cities were in a position to take advantage of participation in GVCs. Findings & Value added: Examined cities are located in the western part of the Slovak Republic. Discussion about the attribute of the cross-border regions can stimulate new ideas for finding causalities in city sprawl or in specialization patterns in the industrial structure of the city. Discussion further fosters the comparison of two cities strengths and weaknesses of each of them that were summarized in terms of employment and industrial exploitation of GVCs. This is the first finding and value added of the paper. The second one is that the method of location quotient is simple but provides clear evidence of the regional development or decline in particular industries and at the time of observation.","[Kolvekova, Gabriela; Palascakova, Daniela] Tech Univ Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Kolveková, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, B Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",gabriela.kolvekova@tuke.sk,"Kolvekova, Gabriela/C-3881-2018; Palaščáková, Daniela/AAA-4267-2020","Kolvekova, Gabriela/0000-0003-0931-6813",project VEGA [1/0961/16]; Ministry of Education's scheme,project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)); Ministry of Education's scheme,This paper was written in connection with scientific project VEGA no. 1/0961/16.

These results indicate that mixed duopolies yield the same results as private duopolies under a significant negative externality, which is in sharp contrast to the results in mixed duopolies without a negative externality. Unless the negative externality is insignificant, public leadership yields greater welfare than private leadership, and public leadership is more robust than the private leadership as equilibrium.

Assuming that the redistribution comes at a cost (because only a fraction of a taxed income can be transferred), we find that there exists a critical level of beta below which different isoelastic social planners choose different optimal allocations of incomes.

In addition, liquidity support mechanisms, whether bilateral, global, or regional can make a crucial difference in times of stress.

Special attention is also paid to the evaluation of convergence towards a common upper-bounded steady state (absolute beta convergence) or to specific steady states conditioned by their country's specific determinants (conditional beta convergence). We estimate a panel error-correction version of an autoregressive distributed lag model to identify the long-term relationships between social expenditure and its determinants. Generalised methods of moments estimators are used to control the endogeneity of the regressors. Results indicate that Latin American social spending follows a conditional beta convergence process over the Washington consensus period that was mainly driven by structural differences in fiscal burdens and external debt, while during the second period it was explained by conjunctural differences in the fiscal burden, GDP per capita and the growth of trade and capital openness.","[Martin-Mayoral, Fernando; Fernandez Sastre, Juan] FLACSO Ecuador, Dept Desarrollo Ambiente & Terr, La Pradera E7-174 & Ave Diego Almagro, Quito, Ecuador",,"Martín-Mayoral, F (通讯作者)，FLACSO Ecuador, Dept Desarrollo Ambiente & Terr, La Pradera E7-174 & Ave Diego Almagro, Quito, Ecuador.",fmartin@flacso.edu.ec; jfernandez@flacso.edu.ec,"mayoral, fermin/C-2652-2013","Martin-Mayoral, Fernando/0000-0002-8553-5770",FLACSO Ecuador,FLACSO Ecuador,We are grateful to FLACSO Ecuador for funding the project and to Markus Navernegg for comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.

This suggests that remittances often escape the income tax but can be taxed via consumption. We further show that tax policy is responsive to shocks in incoming remittances; they lead to a decrease in VAT-rates and increase the likelihood for a VAT introduction.

Our empirical strategy is to exploit within GP variation in the fee schedule due to specialisation in general medicine that implies a higher consultation fee, and to use only a narrow time window around the date of the fee change to identify the GPs' supply responses. Making use of detailed administrative claims data covering all GPs in Norway over a six-year period (2006-2011), we find that a higher consultation fee increases the number of visits (with an elasticity of 0.2), but reduces the treatment intensity per visit (and per patient). This is a pure substitution effect where GPs respond to the fee increase by seeing more patients but spending less time with each, without changing the total amount of time spent per month treating patients. Thus, our analysis suggests that fee-for-service is a powerful policy instrument that needs to be carefully designed in order to ensure optimal provision of care.","[Brekke, Kurt R.] Norwegian Sch Econ NHH, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Holmas, Tor Helge; Monstad, Karin] Uni Res Rokkan Ctr, Nygardsgaten 112, N-5008 Bergen, Norway; [Holmas, Tor Helge; Monstad, Karin] HEB, Bergen, Norway; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Straume, Odd Rune] Univ Minho, NIPE, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Bergen; Universidade do Minho,"Straume, OR (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, NIPE, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",kurt.brekke@nhh.no; tor.holmas@uni.no; karin.monstad@uni.no; o.r.straume@eeg.uminho.pt,"Straume, Odd Rune/B-6090-2009","Straume, Odd Rune/0000-0002-6889-2717",Research Council of Norway [189498]; COMPETE [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-006683]; FCT/MEC's; ERDF under the PT2020 Partnership Agreement,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); COMPETE; FCT/MEC's; ERDF under the PT2020 Partnership Agreement,"We thank two anonymous referees for very helpful suggestions.

This paper uses city-level data to estimate the range of house price overvaluation across city-tiers and assesses the main risks of a sharp housing market slowdown. If house prices rise further beyond fundamental levels and the bubble expands to smaller cities, it would increase the likelihood and costs of a sharp correction, which would weaken growth, undermine financial stability, reduce local government spending room, and spur capital outflows. Empirical analysis suggests that the increasing intensity of macro-prudential policies tailored to local conditions is appropriate. The government should expand its toolkit to include additional macro-prudential measures and push forward reforms to address the fundamental imbalances in the residential housing market.","[Ding, Ding; Lam, Waikei Raphael] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Huang, Xiaoyu] Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Tao] Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",International Monetary Fund; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Huang, XY (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, PBC Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",huangxy.13@pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20151080450]; National Natural Science Foundation of China Research Fund [71673166],Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China Research Fund,"We would like to thank James Daniel, Sonali Jain-Chandra, Mingming Pan, Markus Rodlauer, and participants at the IMF-People's Bank of China Seminar for helpful comments, and Yuchen Wu, Xin Xu, and Tlek Zeinullayev for excellent research assistance.

The results showed that there was as small but significant correlation between sports and cultural participation. Thus, both can be described as complementary and competing activities.

This technique is very general: it works for a broad class of approximating functions, including piecewise polynomials; it can be applied to both Bellman and Euler equations; and it is compatible with both continuous-state and discrete-state shocks. In the case of normally distributed shocks, the integrals can be constructed in a closed form. After the integrals are precomputed, we can solve stochastic models as if they were deterministic. We illustrate this technique using one- and multi-agent growth models with continuous-state shocks (and up to 60 state variables), as well as Aiyagari's (1994) model with discrete-state shocks. Precomputation of integrals saves programming efforts, reduces computational burden, and increases the accuracy of solutions. It is of special value in computationally intense applications.

It first canvasses the operation of monetary policy. Using different econometric techniques, it next examines how well excess money supply growth, measured in terms of currency and M3, explains Australia's inflation over the long term from 1970-2015, and then more specifically before and after the adoption of inflation targeting. Its key result is that excess money growth has been the main determinant of Australia's inflation, although became less important during the inflation targeting era. This implies the velocity of currency, the sine qua non of the Quantity Theory of Money, has been remarkably stable. Given the role excess currency plays in generating Australian inflation, it should be afforded greater prominence in monetary policy deliberations.","[Makin, Anthony J.; Robson, Alex; Ratnasiri, Shyama] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University,"Makin, AJ (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ, Nathan, Qld 4222, Australia.",t.makin@griffith.edu.au,"Ratnasiri, Shyama/AAP-9863-2021; Makin, Anthony/C-6738-2017","Ratnasiri, Shyama/0000-0002-9295-4076; Makin, Anthony/0000-0002-5556-9590",,,,,35,6,6,0,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A strategy profile is called an agent subgame perfect equilibrium if there is no profitable one-shot deviation by any player at any history. We study strongly symmetric agent subgame perfect equilibria for repeated games with a symmetric stage game. We find that the worst punishment equilibrium takes different forms for different types of bias. When players are future-biased or have quasi-hyperbolic discounting, the worst punishment payoff can be achieved by a version of stick-and-carrot strategies. When players are present-biased, the worst punishment path may fluctuate over time forever. We also find that the stage-game minmax payoff does not serve as a tight lower bound for the limit equilibrium payoff set. The worst punishment payoff can be below the minmax payoff with future bias and above the minmax payoff with present bias, even when players are very patient. Lastly, we compare the effect of making players interact more frequently and the effect of making them more patient for a given intertemporal bias structure defined on continuous time.

First, we account for possible nonlinearities in the relationship in order to quantify the asymmetric response of stock prices of these two categories to positive and negative oil price changes. Secondly, in order to capture within group differences, we allow for heterogeneity effect in the cross-sections by formulating a nonlinear Panel ARDL model which is the panel data representation of the Shin et al. (2014) model and also analogous to the non-stationary heterogenous panel data model. Thirdly, we evaluate the relative predictability of the linear (symmetric) and nonlinear (asymmetric) Panel ARDL models using the Campbell and Thompson (2008) test. Our results depict that stock prices of both oil exporting and oil importing groups respond asymmetrically to changes in oil price although the response is stronger in the latter than the former. This finding is further corroborated by the out-of-sample forecast results suggesting that the inclusion of positive and negative oil price changes in the predictive model for stock prices will produce better forecast results only for the oil importing countries. Our results are robust to different oil price proxies, lag structure and in-sample periods. Overall, the dichotomy between oil exporting and oil importing countries has implications on oil price-stock nexus.","[Salisu, Afees A.; Isah, Kazeem O.] Univ Ibadan, Ctr Econometr & Allied Res, Ibadan, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Salisu, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Ctr Econometr & Allied Res, Ibadan, Nigeria.",aa.salisu@cear.org.ng,"salisu, afees/N-1304-2018","salisu, afees/0000-0003-0619-6545; Isah, Kazeem/0000-0003-1652-8582",,,,,59,197,199,0,45,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We show how trade costs and productivity levels affect technology choices by the firms in each country, where the fixed cost of adopting high technology differs between the two countries. This depends on the productivity level of the high technology. In particular, if the productivity of high technology is medium and trade costs are not too low, then a technology gap between countries arises. In this case, improving the productivity of the high technology country reduces the welfare level of consumers in the country in which low technology is adopted. To compensate for the welfare loss of the country from the technological improvement, trade costs should be reduced.","[Sawada, Yukiko] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Suita, Osaka, Japan",Osaka University,"Sawada, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Suita, Osaka, Japan.",nge012sy@student.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS),"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) through a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows.

After the auction, the winning bidder decides whether to make follow-up investments in the acquired asset and makes the equity payment out of the revenue from it according to the auction outcome. Before the auction, the seller holds private information about the possible returns on that investment and must decide whether to disclose it. Larger equity payments undermine incentives to invest, reducing the impact of information revealed by the seller on expected values of the asset to a winning bidder. Thus, information disclosure makes bids less aggressive in expectation. Expected seller revenues may be higher when she does not disclose her private information than when she commits to publicly announcing it regardless of whether it is good or bad.

As an organisational form that can be insulated from national political pressures, and committed to the Union interest, agencies proliferated in the financial sector ushering the agencification trend in finance. In this sense, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) - as part of the European Supervisory Authorities - practically embodies this trend. ESMA presents a radical shift in financial markets' governance due to the nature of its soft law regulations and the direct impact it exerts on addressees' behaviour in emergency circumstances. But ESMA's success in optimising financial sector governance largely depends on its legitimacy, which is centred on independence. At the same time independence demands wider participation and inclusiveness of the decision-making process. This is not easy to achieve in a complex system with multiple stakeholders as is the governance of the EU financial sector (e.g., EU institutions, national actors, private sector). This paper examines ESMA's interinstitutional relations and independence in light of publicly voiced criticism. We find that ESMA's main executive bodies are still susceptible to influences by Member States as well as EU institutions (i.e., Commission), which undermines its operational independence.","[Bajakic, Ivana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb, Croatia; [Beros, Marta Bozina] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Beros, MB (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia.",mbozina@unipu.hr,,,EACEA Jean Monnet [561175-EPP-1-2015-1-HR-EPPJMO-MODULE],EACEA Jean Monnet,Marta Bozina Beros' work was supported by the EACEA Jean Monnet [Grant Project No. 561175-EPP-1-2015-1-HR-EPPJMO-MODULE].,,61,7,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

At the beginning of the turmoil, the exchange rate movements generally take the lead over the interest rates for the first month, but the monetary authorities take the lead afterwards. Our results reveal that in a small open emerging economy with a direct inflation targeting monetary policy regime, the relationship between exchange rates and interest rate is fundamentally different from that in an advanced economy.

We define a novel value-added real effective exchange rate (REER), which aggregates bilateral value-added price changes. Spillovers via input linkages lower the sensitivity of the value-added REER to price changes by supply chain partners because they counterbalance demand-side expenditure switching. Input linkages also raise the price elasticity of demand relative to the conventional REER framework, making demand more sensitive to REER changes.

We present evidence from two original surveys - one of central bank governors, the other of academic specialists. We find that central banks in crisis countries are more likely to have resorted to new policies, to have had discussions about changing mandates, and to have communicated more extensively. But thinking has changed more broadly. For instance, many central banks in non-crisis countries also report implementing macro-prudential measures. Looking forward, we expect central banks to have broader mandates, use macro-prudential tools more widely, and communicate more actively than before the crisis. While there is no consensus yet about the usefulness of unconventional monetary policies, we expect most of them will remain in central banks' toolkits, as governors who gain experience with a particular tool are more likely to assess that tool positively. Finally, the relationship between central banks and their governments might well have changed, with central banks crossing the line into the political realm more often than in the past.","[Ehrmann, Michael] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany; Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; CESifo, Munich, Germany",Princeton University; European Central Bank; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; University of Groningen; Ifo Institut,"Ehrmann, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",michael.ehrmann@ecb.int,,"Jansen, David-Jan/0000-0002-6397-6460",,,,,91,55,57,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Nevertheless, at each point in time there may exist a median voter whose preferred instantaneous consumption rate is supported by a majority of agents. Based on this observation, we propose an institutional setup (intertemporal majority voting) in a Ramsey-type growth model with common consumption and heterogeneous agents, and show that it provides a microfoundation of the choice of the optimal consumption stream of the median agent. While the corresponding intertem-poral consumption stream is in general not a Condorcet winner among all feasible paths, its induced instantaneous consumption rates receive a majority at each point in time in the proposed intertemporal majority voting procedure. We also provide a characterization of stationary voting equilibria in the case where agents may differ not only in their time preferences, but also in their felicity functions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, by the end of the 2000s, their share of the industry's total revenues was only 35% while controlling more than 70% of the oil reserves and 65% of the gas reserves. Conventional financial theory prescribes that the proper management of an enterprise should seek the maximization of the NOCs' profits. However, maximization of profits is not their only objective. Their targets often include non-commercial objectives, such as domestic fuel subsidies and employment. This paper develops a model to assess the impact of domestic fuel subsidies and employment on NOCs' performance, which clarifies the trade-offs among non-commercial objectives and NOCs' market value, production, and reinvestment. The model is applied and calibrated to the Colombian NOC to find the financial and operative effects of these non-commercial objectives for different scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, in countries characterized by weak legal protection of the investors' rights and ownership structures highly concentrated, like in Chile, majority shareholders could use this policy to extract wealth from minority shareholders. Methods: Using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), this paper analyzes a panel of 133 nonfinancial companies listed on the Santiago de Chile Stock Exchange between 2008 and 2013. Results: The results indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between the amount of derivatives used and the company value. However, this evidence is conditioned when the majority shareholder (s) keep the control of the company. If the main shareholder or the three major shareholders hold more than 67% of the outstanding shares, then the relationship between the amount of derivatives used and firm value is negative. Conclusion: In analyzing the dynamics between the ownership concentration and the use of derivatives, we findout that when the majority shareholders and the three largest shareholders majority quorum to vote, then they use derivatives to protect their own wealth. Such strategy is negatively assessed by market, providing evidence of the wealth redistribution hypothesis between the controllers and the minority shareholders.","[Cid Aranda, Carlos; San Martin Mosqueira, Pablo] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile; [Jara Bertin, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Maquieira Villanueva, Carlos] Univ Pacifico, Acad Escuela Posgrad, Lima, Peru",Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion; Universidad de Chile; Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Aranda, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile.",carloscid@ucsc.cl; mjarab@fen.uchile.cl; carpat.villa@gmail.com; psanmartin@ucsc.cl,"Cid, Carlos/CAG-1839-2022; Cid, Carlos/AAH-6318-2020; San Martín Mosqueira, Pablo/T-7977-2019; San Martin, Pablo/AGP-8502-2022; Jara, Mauricio/HHN-5573-2022","Cid, Carlos/0000-0002-7597-1173;",,,,,71,1,1,2,14,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Larger government size mitigates volatility arising from technology, preference, mark-up and monetary policy shocks, but amplifies that emanating from expenditure shocks. The degree of mitigation-amplification varies with the size of government, which opens up the possibility of a non-monotone relationship between volatility and government size. When we estimate the model on US data we find that the relationship is negative around the current US size, but it could eventually turn positive as the ratio of government spending to GDP increased. The location of the turning point in this relationship depends mainly on the type of private expenditure crowded out by higher government spending and on the degree of price stickiness.","[Collard, Fabrice; Dellas, Harris] Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Dellas, Harris] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Tavlas, George] Bank Greece, Athens, Greece",University of Bern; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); European Central Bank; Bank of Greece,"Collard, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,11,6,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2017,84.0,336,,,,,797,819,,10.1111/ecca.12223,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FF3OI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408815800010,0

Whereas the distributor trades in the spot market at area prices, the financial contracts used for hedging are settled against the system price. Area and system prices are correlated with electricity load, as are price differences. In practice, however, this is often disregarded. Here, we develop a joint model for the area price, the system price and the load, accounting for correlations, and we suggest various strategies for hedging in the presence of local volume risk. We benchmark against a strategy that ignores correlation and hedges at expected load, as is common practice in the industry. Using data from 2013 and 2014 for two Danish bidding areas, we show that our best hedging strategy reduces gross loss by 5.8% and 13.6% and increases gross profit by 3.8% and 9.5%, respectively. Although this is partly due to the inclusion of correlation, we show that performance improvement is mainly driven by the choice of risk measure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper tackles this issue through the estimation of a structural threshold vector autoregressive (TVAR) model on a sample of 19 commodity markets. We aim at (i) assessing whether the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty shocks on commodity price returns depends on the degree of uncertainty, and (ii) investigating the transfer from macroeconomic uncertainty to price uncertainty using a newly developed measure of commodity price uncertainty. Our findings show that both agricultural and industrial markets are highly sensitive to the variability and the level of macroeconomic uncertainty, while the impact on precious metals is more parsimonious given their well-identified safe-haven role in time of economic turmoil. In addition, we find evidence that the recent 2007-09 recession has generated an unprecedented episode of high uncertainty in numerous commodity prices. Interestingly, our analysis further reveals that volatility and uncertainty in prices can be disconnected. This is especially true for the oil market as most important shocks in the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s that lead to price volatility do not generate price uncertainty, highlighting the relevance of our uncertainty measure in linking uncertainty to predictability rather than to volatility.

Human capital accumulation is a puzzle; in addition to the broadly recognized positive spillover of human capital, educated human capital productivity occasionally shows a decreasing trend in the economic growth process (Jones in Q J Econ 110:495-525, 1995; Pritchett in World Bank Econ Rev 15(3):367-391, 2001). Incorporating these phenomena as educational externalities into the Uzawa-Lucas model, we analyze the properties of endogenous growth and stagnation. The model yields multiple steady states under intertemporal substitution elasticity larger than 1.

We focus on a sample of higher education graduates and shape the decision of accepting an overducated job in a dynamic treatment framework. We distinguish between apparent overeducation (i.e. overeducated only) and genuine overeducation (i.e. both overeducated and skills mismatch) and investigate the causal effect of both types of overeducation of future job outcomes. We find evidence that over education at the beginning of a career leads to a greater likelihood of being overeducated later on, with no real differences between apparent or genuine overeducation. Nonetheless, interesting national heterogeneities emerge, with Southern, Eastern and Continental graduates facing systematic trap into overeducation (genuine and apparent), while their UK peers are trapped only if they accept their first job immediately after graduation. For Scandinavian graduates, larger negative effects are found if they are apparently overeducated for their first job. (C) 2017 The Authors.

While both sellers and buyers have a demand for certification, its role differs fundamentally: sellers use it for signalling, buyers use it for inspection. Seller-induced certification leads to more transparency, because it is informative-even if unused. By contrast, buyer-induced certification incentivizes certifiers to limit transparency, as this raises demand for inspection. Whenever transparency is socially beneficial, seller certification is preferable. It also yields certifiers larger profits, so that regulating the mode of certification is redundant.","[Stahl, Konrad] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Strausz, Roland] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",University of Mannheim; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Stahl, K (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.",,,"Stahl, Konrad/0000-0003-4439-4040",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB-TR 15]; DFG grant [SFB-TR190],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DFG grant(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This Research was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SFB-TR 15).

The firms conduct R&D programmes with different degrees of risk but an identical expected outcome and they compete or cooperate in R&D. Findings indicate that, in equilibrium, the R&D risk level decreases in the spill over rate under noncooperative R&D, while it may increase under cooperative R&D. Firms are more likely to engage in higher R&D risks under cooperative R&D than they are under non-cooperative R&D. Moreover, the equilibrium R&D risk level both under competition and cooperation R&D is always too low from the perspective of social welfare, and the extent of this inefficiency increases with the spill over rate if the size of the spill over is large, but the opposite may occur if the size of the spill over is small.","[Xing, Mingqing] Weifang Univ, Weifang, Peoples R China",Weifang University,"Xing, MQ (通讯作者)，Weifang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Weifang 261061, Peoples R China.",mqxing1979@163.com,"Xing, Mingqing/R-1065-2019","Xing, Mingqing/0000-0003-3962-7727","Social Science Planning Research Project of Shandong Province [12CJRJ17, 14DJJJ11]; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2013GL005]; Shandong Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences [J13WF11]",Social Science Planning Research Project of Shandong Province; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Shandong Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences,"We thank two anonymous referees and Shaodong Li for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Stakeholder protection is not irrelevant for the market for corporate control, and its effects on the price paid by the bidder, the success or failure of takeovers, and their frequency depend crucially on the types of stakeholder protection.","[At, Christian] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"At, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.",christian.at@univ-fcomte.fr,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

Time pressure increases honesty in one-shot deception games,ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Lying aversion; Honesty; Time pressure; Deception game,COOPERATION; INTUITION; FAIRNESS; MATTER; STAKES; LIES; SLOW,"Many situations require people to act quickly and are characterized by asymmetric information. Since asymmetric information makes people tempted to misreport their private information for their own benefit, it is of primary importance to understand whether time pressure affects honest behavior. A theory of social heuristics (the Social Heuristics Hypothesis, SHH), predicts that, in case of one-shot interactions, such an effect exists and it is positive. The SHH proposes that when people have no time to evaluate all available alternatives, they tend to rely on heuristics, choices that are optimal in everyday, repeated interactions and that have been internalized over time; and then, after deliberation, people shift their behavior towards the one that is optimal in the given interaction. Thus, the SHH predicts that time pressure increases honesty in one-shot interactions (because honesty may be optimal in repeated interactions, while dishonesty is always optimal in the short run). However, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies have tested this prediction. Here, I report a large (N = 1013) study aimed at filling this gap. In this study, participants were given a private information and were asked to report it within 5 s vs after 30 s. The interaction was one-shot, and payoffs were such that subjects had an incentive to lie. As predicted by the SHH, I find that time pressure increases honest behavior. In doing so, these results provide new insights on the role of time pressure on honesty, and provide one more piece of evidence in support of the Social Heuristics Hypothesis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We concentrate on the impact of new railways and port infrastructures on bilateral trade. Our analysis suggests that the development of new railway connections will benefit most of the Northern and Central European countries. Some industries like automotive and electronics that have a higher value to weight ratio will benefit more than others. However, due to higher costs, railway services will never reach a high percentage of total import/export flows. Investment in new port facilities, although less new compared with railways, may be a bigger game changer. The development of the Port of Piraeus has already increased the importance of the Mediterranean Sea as an import/export hub for China. If the other planned investments in Egypt and Algeria are completed, this phenomenon will be magnified. This presents a huge challenge for Italy. The Italian port in the high Adriatic Sea could be displaced by Piraeus capacity, especially if this port is linked through railways with the center of Europe. Italy needs to coordinate its ports together with its railway network to take advantage of Belt and Road Initiative opportunities.","[Fardella, Enrico] Peking Univ, Dept Hist, Ctr Mediterranean Area Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Prodi, Giorgio] Ferrara Univ, Dept Econ & Management, Ferrara, Italy",Peking University; University of Ferrara; Arcispedale Sant'Anna,"Fardella, E (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Dept Hist, Ctr Mediterranean Area Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",enricofardella@gmail.com; giorgio.prodi@unife.it,"prodi, giorgio/AAE-4838-2020",,,,,,19,36,37,7,86,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2017,25.0,5,,,SI,,125,138,,10.1111/cwe.12217,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FH3YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411087300008,0

We focus on the impact of previous work characteristics (including work security and flexibility) on subsequent care provision decisions and distinguish between care that is provided to people who cohabit and people who reside elsewhere, as well as between the provision of care as the primary caregiver and provision in a secondary caring role. Our dynamic framework of informal care provision accounts for state dependence, unobserved heterogeneity and initial conditions. For both males and females, we find the existence of positive state dependence in all care states in both the short and medium term. Furthermore, the inertia in care provision appears to be stronger for more intensive care. We also find previous employment status has a significant deterrent effect on current care provision decisions. The effects on employment, however, differ according to the type of previous work, the type of care currently provided, and the gender of the caregiver. We also find that workers with perceptions of greater job security are nevertheless less likely to provide subsequent care. Our results suggest that workers' perceptions about work flexibility and their stated overall satisfaction with work actually have no impact on their subsequent decisions to provide care in any capacity.","[Ha Trong Nguyen] Curtin Univ, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, Perth, WA, Australia; [Connelly, Luke B.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Business & Econ Hlth, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",Curtin University; University of Queensland,"Nguyen, HT (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",ha.nguyen@curtin.edu.au,"Nguyen, Ha/GWQ-7088-2022; Connelly, Luke B/F-6578-2010","Nguyen, Ha/0000-0002-2240-8942; Connelly, Luke/0000-0002-1734-4809",Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"We thank the editor, Garry Barrett, and two anonymous referees for their suggestions.

Like Keynes, he also assumed, with Ricardo, that trade was between different firms in different countries rather than recognising that capital already was multinational and that this could qualify both exchange rate changes such as that of the sterling in 1967 and his regional employment premium and selective employment tax.","[Holland, Stuart] Inst Adv Studies Koszeg, Koszeg, Hungary; [Holland, Stuart] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Holland, S (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies Koszeg, Koszeg, Hungary.;Holland, S (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, Coimbra, Portugal.",sholland@fe.uc.pt,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,5,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

New insights into trip chaining can be gained from real-time GPS travel data. This research introduces a framework that considers two-destination choice in the context of home-based trip chains. We propose and empirically compare three alternatives of building choice sets where we consider various relationships of the two destinations (such as majorminor destinations, selecting one first, and selecting two concurrently). Our choice set formation alternatives use survival models to determine the selection probability of a destination. Our results reveal that trip chaining behavior is shaped by the features of retail clusters, spatial patterns of clusters, transportation networks, and the axis of travel. This research reveals that not only the spatial relationship but also the land use relationship of the destinations in a trip chain affect the decision making process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Employing propensity score matching and the difference-in-difference approach, we show significant LBE effects for older firms, especially those engaging in R&D activities, having large-scale production, and under private ownership.

The following asymmetries are studied: news items by geographical location, no-news vs. surprise news announcements and positive vs. negative news announcements. We make the following findings in our empirical study: (i) After the release of a news announcement, the level of foreign exchange volatility rises. This is independent of whether the news item surprised the market or not. (ii) Both South African and US news items significantly impact USD/ZAR volatility, suggesting that the news items are being used to formulate investor expectations regarding the future prospects of the currency pair. (iii) Negative news appears to have a greater impact on exchange rate volatility relative to positive news. This result is also state dependent, as investors tend to behave differently to news depending on the economic climate at that point in time. Investor cognitive biases give rise to the asymmetric news effects on exchange rate volatility. Finally, investors do not always act in rational manner, especially when faced with multiple news items that are contradictory to each other.","[Maserumule, Tseke; Alagidede, Paul] Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Alagidede, P (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.",paul.alagidede@wits.ac.za,"Alagidede, Prof Imhotep Paul/JDD-3340-2023","Alagidede, Prof Imhotep Paul/0000-0003-1571-0227",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),We Acknowledge Research Funding from the Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA) in Conducting this Research.

Liberalization in one destination market induces redistribution of this global burden across multiple export destinations, thereby lowering the entry threshold in each of them. The empirical analysis exploits reduced US tariff uncertainty upon China's WTO accession, and examines its effect on China's EU exports. The main results reveal that: (i) the structure of China's export boom to the EU conforms to patterns of US tariff uncertainty; (ii) the adjustment takes place at the extensive margin; and (iii) the effect phases out after a few years. Evidence in support of a fixed-cost redistribution is also presented.

Furthermore, the model is built to relate growth, the real exchange rate and sectoral heterogeneity. From a cumulative causation perspective, we thus demonstrate the effect of the level of real exchange rates on the generation of technological progress, and how these rates also impact the growth of the whole economy via a balance-of-payments constrained approach.

We simulate stepwise increases in the value-added tax (VAT) rate, which are compensated by revenue-neutral reductions in income-related taxes. We differentiate between the personal income tax (PIT) and social security contributions (SSC). Based on a dual data base and a microsimulation model of household labor supply behavior, we find a regressive impact of such a tax shift in the short run. When accounting for labor supply adjustments, the adverse distributional impact persists for PIT reductions, while the overall effects on inequality and progressivity become lower when payroll taxes are reduced.

The present paper investigates the relationship between individualistic values and personal attitudes toward government intervention. We consider two key components of an individualistic culture to be particularly relevant for attitude formation: self-direction ('social' individualism) and self-determination ('economic' individualism). Results indicate that both are negatively associated with interventionist attitudes. Effects of self-direction are much weaker though, than self-determination. Moreover, the effects of self-direction are mitigated through higher trust in the state and lower confidence in companies, while that is not the case for self-determination values. We conclude that especially economic individualism supports attitudes conducive to the formation of formal market-friendly institutions.","[Pitlik, Hans] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria; [Rode, Martin] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Univ, Pamplona 31009, Spain",University of Navarra,"Pitlik, H (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Vienna, Austria.",hans.pitlik@wifo.ac.at; martinrode@unav.es,"Rode, Martin/AAK-7286-2020; Rode, Martin/T-4775-2017","Rode, Martin/0000-0002-8795-7838; Rode, Martin/0000-0002-8795-7838; Pitlik, Hans/0000-0001-8124-1110",,,,,80,51,53,2,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This study employs in contrast a non-parametric causality-inquantiles test to analyse the causal relation between trading volume and Bitcoin returns and volatility, over the whole of their respective conditional distributions. The nonparametric characteristics of our test control for misspecification due to nonlinearity and structural breaks, two features of our data that cover 19th December 2011 to 25th April 2016. The causality-in-quantiles test reveals that volume can predict returns - except in Bitcoin bear and bull market regimes. This result highlights the importance of modelling nonlinearity and accounting for the tail behaviour when analysing causal relationships between Bitcoin returns and trading volume. We show, however, that volume cannot help predict the volatility of Bitcoin returns at any point of the conditional distribution.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Roubaud, David] Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34080 Montpellier, France; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Bouri, Elie] Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, USEK Business Sch, POB 446, Jounieh, Lebanon",Eastern Mediterranean University; Montpellier Business School; University of Pretoria,"Bouri, E (通讯作者)，Holy Spirit Univ Kaslik, USEK Business Sch, POB 446, Jounieh, Lebanon.",mehmet@mbalcilar.net; eliebouri@usek.edu.lb; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za; d.roubaud@Montpellier-BS.com,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019; Bouri, Elie/N-1368-2015; ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; Bouri, Elie/ABC-4197-2020","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027; ROUBAUD, DAVID/0000-0003-3827-6187; Bouri, Elie/0000-0003-2628-5027",,,,,52,372,390,12,158,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In particular, the largest depressions are likely to be accompanied by stock-market crashes. This study investigates the behavior of the U.S. stock market before, during and after deep downturns, focusing particularly on the tails of the return distribution. We develop two automatic procedures to identify multiple change-points in the tail of financial time series as well as in the co-crash and co-boom probabilities of different markets. We then apply our methodology to twelve time series representative of the sectors of the U.S. economy. We find that regime shifts in the lower tail of the distribution tend to co-occur before deep downturns. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the origin and systemic nature of large scale events to make policy interventions more timely and effective. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The econometric approach is based on a dynamic random effects probit model that takes account of the unobserved individual heterogeneity and the state dependence that surrounds unemployment transitions. The estimation results show that the risk of unemployment depends positively on Agreeableness and External LOC, and negatively on Conscientiousness and Positive Reciprocity. These findings apply to men and women alike. Moreover, we find that the extent of unemployment state dependence also depends on specific traits, namely Openness, Positive reciprocity and External LOC. These results suggest that public policies aimed at preventing unemployment should give more importance to the moderating role of non-cognitive skills. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our main objective is :to show that the optimal consumption subsidy to healthcare, if solely judged from the standpoint of economic growth, is strictly positive (zero) when the production technology of the healthcare sector is of the variable (fixed) coefficient type. However, in the variable coefficient case, the optimal per capita expenditure on healthcare crucially hinges on the degree of labour market imperfection and the quality of services provided by the healthcare sector. The latter result can possibly be considered as a theoretical justification why the magnitude of per capita public spending on healthcare services is significantly lower in the developing countries compared to that in the developed nations. Besides, using the Sen's (1974) index of social welfare that takes into consideration both the growth and income inequality aspects, we have proved that the optimal health subsidy is positive irrespective of the nature of production technology of the healthcare sector. Furthermore, most of these results are found to be valid even in the presence of Harris-Todaro type unemployment. Finally, the results lead to a few important policy implications in the context of the developing countries.","[Chaudhuri, Sarbajit] Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Dwibedi, Jayanta Kumar] BKC Coll, Dept Econ, Kolkata, India; [Biswas, Anindya] Spring Hill Coll, Div Business, Mobile, AL USA",University of Calcutta,"Chaudhuri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",sarbajitch19@gmail.com; jayantadw@rediffmail.com; abiswas@shc.edu,"CHAUDHURI, Sarbajit/AAE-6343-2019","Chaudhuri, Sarbajit/0000-0003-1471-0460",,,,,29,5,5,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Our results provide strong evidence in support of an inverted U-shaped relationship between intelligence and corruption, which shed new light on the intelligence-corruption nexus. This finding is robust to various estimation techniques and alternatives measures of corruption and intelligence.

Several cures for the externality are analysed: less communication among scientists, markets for the right to undertake follow-up projects and the pursuit of citations rather than expected value as a goal for scientists.","[Mandler, Michael] Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, Egham, Surrey, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Mandler, M (通讯作者)，Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",m.mandler@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Protest voting reacts negatively to expectations about others' enthusiasm for the protest issue, more so if the candidate learns from the protest and responds endogenously. I find that electoral support for single-issue protest parties can be negatively related to the true underlying enthusiasm for their causes.

We analyze industry-oriented research joint ventures supported by the Fifth European Framework Programme between 1998 and 2002. A key feature of this Programme is that funding is available to the firms based on social and economic concerns instead of pure performance criteria, which guarantees that financial support is not granted conditional on technological opportunities. This allows us to identify the causal effect of the programme on firms' performance using the funding available to the firms in their respective industries as a source of exogenous variation in the decision to participate in the programme.

Economically stagnant areas, however, may be deprived of talent through emigration. This may harm dynamism and political and economic change. Between 2010 and 2014, Italy experienced a large wave of emigration and two deep recessions and significant political change. Combining administrative data on Italian expatriates and data on characteristics of municipal councils, mayors and on local elections, we analyse whether emigration affected political change. Economic pull factors from foreign countries, interacted with the pre-existing networks of emigration from Italian municipalities allow us to construct a proxy for emigration that is municipality-specific and, as we show, independent of pre-existing political and economic trends. Using this proxy as an instrument, we find that municipalities with larger emigration rates had slower growth in the share of young, college educated and women among local elected officials. They were also more likely to have their municipal council dismissed and experienced lower political participation and a lower share of votes to anti-status-quo parties.","[Anelli, Massimo] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, I-20136 Milan, Italy; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA USA; [Peri, Giovanni] IZA, Davis, CA USA",Bocconi University; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Peri, G (通讯作者)，IZA, Davis, CA USA.",massimo.anelli@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,32,17,21,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

We estimate the effect of such infrastructure on the pattern of bilateral trade flows. We find that a standard deviation increase in the number of mines over the mean biases a country's pattern of trade flows in favor of overseas trade, to the extent that these mining countries import 56% less from neighboring countries (relative to overseas countries), than do countries with an average number of mines. However, this effect is reversed for mining landlocked countries, who import relatively more from neighbors. We rationalize this finding through the unequal effect that mines have on a country's network of infrastructure: because the mine related transport infrastructure connects the coast rather than neighboring countries, it lowers the cost of trading with overseas countries more than with neighbors. In contrast, for landlocked countries trade costs are also lowered with some neighbors through which infrastructure is built to reach the coast. The effect is specific to mines and not to oil and gas fields, because pipelines cannot be used to trade other commodities. The effect is robust to measuring the stock of mine-related infrastructure by distance along roads between mines and ports, and to taking into account their relative position to routes used for trade between ports and main cities. We discuss the welfare implications of our results for development, and relate these to the recent surge of Chinese infrastructure investment in Africa.","[Bonfatti, Roberto] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Poelhekke, Steven] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Poelhekke, Steven] Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Nottingham; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Poelhekke, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",steven.poelhekke@vu.nl,,"Bonfatti, Roberto/0000-0003-0713-9219; Poelhekke, Steven/0000-0001-9256-7853",,,,,39,23,28,3,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Extending Tullock's (1980) contest-theory framework with endogenous returns, we first find that competition for better-paying jobs can result in social inefficiency in the form of excessive educational efforts. Second, a widening wage gap intensifies the effort competition, which induces inefficiency with higher likelihood when the returns to education effort diminish too quickly. Third, when one player's productivity improves relative to the other's, the benefitting player is encouraged to exert more effort, while his opponent tends to be discouraged to do so. The larger share of social inefficiency is carried by the less productive player. Fourth, when educational effort becomes more affordable to one player compared to the other, competition increases efficiency only if the change favors the more productive player. In the opposite case, social inefficiency increases. In both cases, the less productive player again bears the larger share of social inefficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using panel data of 98 commercial banks, we explore productivity growth using Malmquist indices complemented with bootstrapping technique to provide measures of the statistical precision of the results. The Malmquist index measures total factor productivity, efficiency change and technological change. Results show that productivity improves moderately and appears to be less volatile towards the end of the period.

We provide a new method for accurately discretizing general Markov processes by matching low order moments of the conditional distributions using maximum entropy. In contrast to existing methods, our approach is not limited to linear Gaussian autoregressive processes. We apply our method to numerically solve asset pricing models with various underlying stochastic processes for the fundamentals, including a rare disasters model. Our method outperforms the solution accuracy of existing methods by orders of magnitude, while drastically simplifying the solution algorithm. The performance of our method is robust to parameters such as the number of grid points and the persistence of the process.","[Farmer, Leland E.; Toda, Alexis Akira] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Farmer, LE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.",lefarmer@ucsd.edu; atoda@ucsd.edu,,"Toda, Alexis Akira/0000-0001-5965-7806",,,,,54,18,22,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7331,,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Focusing on university-industry collaborations, the study examines whether and how different axes of alignment of university and industry motivations are integrated in projects with specific technological objectives and organizational structures, benefitting from the presence of specific institutions designed to facilitate collaboration. Empirically, the study relies on in-depth data on 30 university-industry collaborations in the Netherlands, and provides preliminary evidence that the technological objective and organizational structure of collaboration are malleable variables allowing the integration of both partners' objectives and expectations. Different institutional incentives for university-industry collaboration favor specific axes of alignment of motivations and certain types of collaborative projects' design. Hence, our exploratory results suggest that specific organizational and technological structures tend to prevail in the presence of specific institutions.","[Freitas, Isabel Maria Bodas] Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard BP,127, F-38000 Grenoble 01, France; [Verspagen, Bart] UNU Merit, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Grenoble Ecole Management; Maastricht University,"Verspagen, B (通讯作者)，UNU Merit, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",Isabel-Maria.BODAS-FREITAS@grenoble-em.com; b.verspagen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This project was awarded a grant from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

We experimentally examine the game theoretic prediction of last stand behavior in a multi-battle contest with a winning prize and losing penalty, as well as the contrasting prediction of surrendering in the corresponding contest with no penalty. We find varied evidence in support of these hypotheses in the aggregate data, but more conclusive evidence when scrutinizing individual player behavior. Players' realized strategies tend to conform to one of several types. We develop a taxonomy to classify player types and study how types interact and how their incidence varies across treatments. Although last stand and surrendering behaviors arise at rates responsive to the importance of losing penalties, the most prominent behavior is escalation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

I find that while there was much in Carl Menger's economics with which Weber agreed, his achievement was to provide an improved foundation for the historicist approach. I discuss the important differences between Weber's approach and the methodology advocated by Ludwig von Mises, the central figure in the later Austrian school. I argue that Weber broadened the scope for economics by integrating the empirical facts of history and the contemporary world, while Mises narrowed it by attempting to establish an economics purified of contingent empirical reality. Finally, I discuss Mises' influence on Lionel Robbins and Robbins' contribution to the eclipse of Weber's methodological insights.","[Maclachlan, Fiona] Manhattan Coll, Riverdale, NY USA",Manhattan College,"Maclachlan, F (通讯作者)，Manhattan Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Riverdale, NY 10471 USA.",fiona.maclachlan@manhattan.edu,,,,,,,44,5,5,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Building on standard assumptions of social welfare functions, it also defines and characterizes a parameterized family of indices that satisfy those properties. In particular, the indices are equal to zero when either the group has no segregation or all occupations have the same wage, and the indices increase when individuals of the group move into occupations that have higher wages than those left behind. In addition, ceteris paribus, the indices increase more the lower the wage is of the occupation left behind, and consider small improvements for many people to be more important than large improvements for a few.","[Alonso-Villar, Olga; Del Rio, Coral] Univ Vigo, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Alonso-Villar, O (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac CC Econ & Empresariais, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, Vigo 36310, Spain.",ovillar@uvigo.es,"del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; Alonso-Villar, Olga/K-4348-2014","del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; Alonso-Villar, Olga/0000-0002-7355-0279","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2010-21668-C03-03, ECO2011-23460, ECO2013-46516-C4-2-R, ECO2014-52616-R]; Xunta de Galicia [CN 2012/178, GRC 2015/014]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2010-21668-C03-03, ECO2011-23460, ECO2013-46516-C4-2-R, and ECO2014-52616-R) and Xunta de Galicia (CN 2012/178 and GRC 2015/014).

Conventional flat feed-in-tariffs ignore the heterogeneity of these sources. Taking into account the degree of substitutability or complementarity of these sources with respect to each other and with respect to stochastic demand variations, this paper derives optimal pricing instruments composed of a feed-in-tariff (FIT) and a capacity-augmentation-tariff (CAT). An empirical analysis looks at wind and solar farms operating in Ontario in order to determine the optimal use of FIT-CAT pricing.

In this paper we present a theoretical framework that can generate such a pattern due to cumulative causation through positive feedback. The growth process is then investigated using cointegration analysis. We are able to establish the existence of positive feedback which is at the centre of cumulative causation. We are also able to date the onset of this mechanism which has driven growth in India for close to half a century by now. This leads us to conclude that the internal dynamics are at least as important as the policy regimes to understand growth over the long term in this country. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We apply our model to Alberta's wholesale electricity market. Firms have an incentive to reduce their forward contract coverage in the more concentrated post-merger equilibrium. We demonstrate that endogenous forward contracting magnifies the price increasing impacts of mergers, resulting in larger reductions in consumer surplus. Current market screening procedures used to analyze electricity mergers consider firms' pre-existing forward commitments. We illustrate that ignoring the endogenous nature of firms' forward commitments can yield biased conclusions regarding the impacts of market structure changes such as mergers. In particular, we show that the price effects of mergers can be largely underestimated when forward contract quantities are held at pre-merger levels. Whether the profits of the merged firm are greater with fixed or endogenous forward quantities is ambiguous.","[Brown, David P.; Eckert, Andrew] Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada",University of Alberta,"Brown, DP (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H4, Canada.",dpbrown@ualberta.ca; aeckert@ualberta.ca,"Gebhardt, Judith/JQV-4417-2023",,,,,,54,14,14,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

A theoretical model is developed where output and credit shocks are treated separately, though these shocks may be highly correlated. The estimation procedure utilizes a panel vector autoregression (VAR) in order to empirically identify the role of credit market shocks separately from the output shocks more commonly studied in the existing literature. The primary empirical findings can be summarized as follows: (1) R&D responds pro-cyclically to output shocks at the macroeconomic level, and (2) R&D co-moves positively with credit. More concretely, the results indicate that negative output shocks induce a simultaneous and subsequent contraction in credit and R&D consistent with a model where credit constraints drive cyclical adjustments to R&D. The impact of output and credit shocks on R&D are economically significant and a simulation exercise suggests the shocks associated with the global financial crisis have reduced US R&D by 10% relative to the pre-crisis path.","[Burger, John D.; Sedgley, Norman; Tan, Kerry M.] Loyola Univ Maryland Econ, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",,"Sedgley, N (通讯作者)，Loyola Univ Maryland Econ, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",nsedgley@loyola.edu,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Two firms compete in a primary good market, and a monopolistic firm offers a value-adding good. The primary good can be consumed alone, while the value-adding good must be consumed with the primary good. The monopolistic firm forms an exclusivity partnership with one of the primary good providers. Buyers are able to consume the value-adding good only if they patronize the monopolistic firm's exclusive partner. This practice allows the monopolistic firm to extract surplus from the primary good market. Surprisingly, consumers benefit from the exclusivity arrangement.

A theoretical measure of misallocation is adopted to gauge the distortions that exacerbate the inefficiency of resource allocations across geographic innovation units; these units' usage of innovative inputs reveals the level of misallocations prevalent within the Chinese economy. The measure of innovation misallocation is computed by utilizing a micro dataset based on information from the China Statistical Yearbook for Science and Technology (CSYST) from 1999 to 2012. In addition, this paper probes the factors that co-move with China's innovation resource misallocations. We find that, although an advanced financial market is beneficial to innovation efficiency in China, both the government's extensive development of transportation infrastructure and the preferential treatment given to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) negatively correlate with innovation efficiency. We conclude that emerging economies that are experiencing R&D input expansion, such as China, should be cautious in ensuring efficient resource allocations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Over the past three decades, the Mexican economy has gone through a structural change and experienced a successful insertion into global markets. Yet productivity growth has been modest, leading to low and volatile economic growth. To examine the weak association between structural change and productivity growth, two features are studied: inter- and intra-industry transformations, and the contribution of production factors to value added growth. The paper shows that despite a significant reallocation of hours worked across industries, its aggregate impact has been hindered by the prevalence of flows from sectors with high labor productivity growth towards those with lower or declining productivity growth.

A relevant characteristic of this market is its negligible marginal cost on bet volume. Taxation can be on gross profit (Gross Profit Tax) or on volume (General Betting Duty). We model the two most popular online sport betting bets: fixed-odds and spread, as compared with another traditional sport betting: parimutuel. We characterize the odds and the bookmaker's payoff in (strong) subgame perfect equilibrium for each of the three types of bets under both taxation schemes. The results show that taxation on gross profit maximizes the utilitarian social welfare. Moreover, the three types of bets are equivalent when the market is symmetric.","[Vidal-Puga, Juan] Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariais, Dept Estat & IO & ECOSOT Econ Soc & Terr, Campus As Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Vidal-Puga, J (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariais, Dept Estat & IO & ECOSOT Econ Soc & Terr, Campus As Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain.",vidalpuga@uvigo.es,"Vidal-Puga, Juan/K-3992-2014","Vidal-Puga, Juan/0000-0001-5640-1653",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-52616-R]; Xunta de Galicia [GRC 2015/014],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),Financial support by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2014-52616-R) and Xunta de Galicia (GRC 2015/014) is gratefully acknowledged.,,18,1,2,2,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

We find a statistically significant 11.8% increase in aggregate bidding when moving from the small to large auction. The impact is heterogeneous: as the auction size increases, low-types decrease effort but high-types increase effort. Additionally, the larger auction provides a stronger rank correlation between effort and ability, awarding more prizes to the higher-skilled and improving the efficiency of prize allocation.

Our measure uses newly collected data on patents issued to U.S. firms in the 1926 to 2010 period, combined with the stock market response to news about patents. Our patent-level estimates of private economic value are positively related to the scientific value of these patents, as measured by the number of citations the patent receives in the future. Our new measure is associated with substantial growth, reallocation, and creative destruction, consistent with the predictions of Schumpeterian growth models. Aggregating our measure suggests that technological innovation accounts for significant medium-run fluctuations in aggregate economic growth and TFP. Our measure contains additional information relative to citation-weighted patent counts; the relation between our measure and firm growth is considerably stronger. Importantly, the degree of creative destruction that is associated with our measure is higher than previous estimates, confirming that it is a useful proxy for the private valuation of patents.","[Kogan, Leonid] MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA; Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL USA; Kelly Sch Business, Bloomington, IN USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research; Northwestern University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"Kogan, L (通讯作者)，MIT Sloan, Cambridge, MA USA.",,", CONTRACT_ADMIN/KCX-9603-2024",", CONTRACT_ADMIN/0000-0002-4337-5705",Fama-Miller Center at University of Chicago; Zell Center; Jerome Kenney Fund,Fama-Miller Center at University of Chicago; Zell Center; Jerome Kenney Fund,"We thank Hal Varian for helping us in extracting information on Patents from Google Patents database.

Firms exert effort and the resulting quality of innovation is ex ante uncertain. Given this uncertainty, there is a trade-off regarding tile number of participating firms in the contest: increasing the number of firms reduces each firm's chance of winning the auction, leading the firms to reduce effort level; meanwhile, the chance of obtaining a high quality of innovation increases with the number of firms due to the randomness of the quality. Thus, the procurer faces a nontrivial problem of how many firms to invite. We show that in the high level of randomness, it is optimal for the procurer to invite many firms. As the randomness vanishes, however, inviting only two firms is optimal. We also show that a fixed-prize tournament may outperform the auction when the randomness is large. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The aim is twofold: propose a groundbreaking analysis that allows us to control both for the effectiveness of the Regulation (EC) No. 1080/2006, by a Difference in differences equation (DID), and the Regions' efficiency in the separate collection process, by a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). Specifically, the SFA allows us to model the DID equation in order to take account the regions' efficiency in the separate collection process in terms of institutional quality. In particular, we use a panel with two dimensions: temporal-9 yearly observations from 2004 to 2012; and cross-sectional-20 regions.

Using new data on U.S. firms' decisions to contract for manufacturing services from domestic or foreign suppliers, I show that a firm's adoption of communication technology between 2002 and 2007 is associated with a 3.1 point increase in its probability of fragmentation. The effect of firm technology also differs significantly across industries; in 2007, it is 20% higher, relative to the mean, in industries with production specifications that are easier to codify in an electronic format. These patterns suggest that technology lowers coordination costs, though its effect is disproportionately higher for domestic rather than foreign sourcing. The larger impact on domestic fragmentation highlights its importance as an alternative to offshoring, and can be explained by complementarities between technology and worker skill. High technology firms and industries are more likely to source from high human capital countries, and the differential impact of technology across industries is strongly increasing in country human capital.","[Fort, Teresa C.] Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Fort, Teresa C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Fort, TC (通讯作者)，Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Fort, TC (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,54,55,68,14,71,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

To this end, we have created a micro database that compiles 248 surveys from 53 countries between 1967 and 2014, covering a wide range of per capita income levels. There is large convergence in the earnings of men and women over the path of development, driven by female labour force participation and wage rates. We argue that the single most important factor behind this convergence is demographic transition: the effects of children on gender gaps (child penalties') are large at both low and high levels of development, but fertility declines drastically over the growth process and thus reduces the aggregate implications of children. We also document gender convergence in educational attainment and consider its effects on earnings inequality, arguing that these are significant but less dramatic than the effects of fertility. Finally, we document striking changes in the values or norms surrounding the role of women with children, implying that such changes could serve as a reinforcing mechanism for gender convergence.","[Kleven, Henrik; Landais, Camille] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kleven, H (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,33,46,51,2,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2017,84.0,334,,,SI,,180,209,,10.1111/ecca.12230,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER1VL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398583000003,0

The model economy is populated by a large number of risk-averse households who can invest in risk-free physical capital and risky human capital. Expected human capital returns are age-dependent and calibrated to match the observed life-cycle profile of median labor income. Households have access to a complete set of credit and insurance contracts, but their ability to use the available financial instruments is limited by the possibility of default (limited contract enforcement). According to the baseline calibration, young households are severely under-insured against human capital (labor income) risk and the welfare losses due to the lack of insurance are substantial. These results are robust to realistic variations in parameter values.

It provides an empirical assessment of the impact of macroeconomic imbalances, as monitored by the European Commission by the scoreboard indicators since 2011, on BCS in the Euozone. We use a quarterly data set covering the period 2002-2012 and estimate the direct and indirect effects of macroeconomic imbalances in the pre- and post-crisis period in a simultaneous equations model. Business cycle correlation between EA members is measured by the recently proposed dynamic conditional correlation of Engle (2002) which can better identify synchronous and asynchronous behaviour of BC than the commonly used measures. We find that appearing differences between EA members in current account, in government deficit and public debt, in private debt and unit labor cost developments have reduced BCS in the EA, even more in the post-crisis period than before. Moreover, these explanatory factors of BCS, generally reinforce each other and are also influenced by other critical macro imbalances. Since BCS is essential in a monetary union, this paper provides clear support that a stronger, common economic governance would be important for the functioning and survival of the Eurozone.","[Lukmanova, Elizaveta; Tondl, Gabriele] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Int Econ, Dept Econ, Welthandelsplatz 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Tondl, G (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Int Econ, Dept Econ, Welthandelsplatz 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",,"Lukmanova, Elizaveta/HKM-9338-2023","Lukmanova, Elizaveta/0000-0002-2374-5457",Anniversary Fund of the Oesterreichische National bank [15798],Anniversary Fund of the Oesterreichische National bank,This paper was elaborated under the project Business Cycles in Europe financed by the Anniversary Fund of the Oesterreichische National bank (project no. 15798).

This paper traces the development of property rights in Poland and Ukraine and explores their divergence over the past three centuries using North's framework of economic calculation. In each country, the distribution of political power and political institutions had a profound impact on property rights. Indeed, while it was the Polish polity that defined the evolution of property rights from 1386 to 1795 and then from 1989 onward, due to diffusion of power, it was Ukrainian politicians that controlled the destiny of property rights for most of Ukraine's history. This situation has not changed despite the Maidan revolution in Ukraine, and recent moves in Poland show how tenuous property rights are in the face of political opposition.","[Hartwell, Christopher A.] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland; [Hartwell, Christopher A.] Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Hartwell, CA (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.;Hartwell, CA (通讯作者)，Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland.",chartwell@kozminski.edu.pl,"Hartwell, Christopher A./J-1542-2019","Hartwell, Christopher A./0000-0003-3340-1276",,,,,86,1,1,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The technology is developed in and transferred by a foreign country to the domestic country. It is free but each firm must expend some fixed set-up cost for education of its staff to adopt and use it. Assuming that each firm maximizes the weighted average of absolute and relative profits, we examine the relationship between competitiveness and subsidy or tax policies for technology adoption, and show that when firm behavior is not competitive (the weight on the relative profit is small), the optimal policy of the government may be taxation; when firm behavior is competitive (the weight on the relative profit is large), the optimal policy is subsidization or inaction and not taxation. However, if firm behavior is extremely competitive (close to perfect competition), taxation case re-emerges.","[Hattori, Masahiko; Tanaka, Yasuhito] Doshisha Univ, Fac Econ, Kyoto, Japan",Doshisha University,"Tanaka, Y (通讯作者)，Doshisha Univ, Fac Econ, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028580, Japan.",yasuhito@mail.doshisha.ac.jp,"Tanaka, Yasuhito/AAA-3842-2021",,"JSPS KAKENHI [15K03481]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03481, 16J06191] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 15K03481].,,30,1,1,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

North to economic history and institutional economics, as it developed from the 1960s until his death in 2015. It sketches the evolution of his arguments concerning the roles of institutions, organizations and human agency. North's conception of the economic actor became progressively more sophisticated, by acknowledging the role of ideology and adopting insights from cognitive science. Eventually, he abandoned the proposition that institutions are generally efficient, to propose instead that sub-optimal institutional forms could persist. A few noted criticisms of North's work are also considered here, ranging from those which are arguably off the mark, to others that retain some force. The contributions to this memorial issue are outlined at the end of this introduction.","[Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield, Herts, England.",g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,87,9,10,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Based on findings obtained in a controlled laboratory experiment, we suggest that express damage stipulations trigger negative reciprocity and moral hazard, reducing performance by contract promisors. Such negative effects are absent when damages are exogenously imposed. Moreover, our results indicate that when stipulating damages, contract parties attain less cooperative surplus than when they are subject to an exogenously imposed remedy.

After replicating the finding in the cheating game literature that lying does not increase with incentives, we show that this insensitivity is not a characteristic of the intrinsic lying cost, but rather a result of concern about being exposed as a liar. In a modified mind game in which this concern is eliminated, we find that people lie more, and in particular lie more when the incentives to do so increase. Thus, our results show that for many participants, the decision to lie follows a simple cost-benefit analysis: they compare the intrinsic cost of lying with the incentives to lie; once the incentives are higher than the cost, they switch from telling the truth to lying.

Data uncertainty relates to both revisions and other measurement problems that imply that data are subject to a degree of ` noise'. Model uncertainty relates to the imperfect knowledge we have on the structure of the economy, including the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and the effect of macroeconomic shocks. Unexpected events or shocks contribute to uncertainty about the future, along with the potential for the structure of the economy to evolve over time, which makes the past a poor guide to the future. The article discusses how these different dimensions of uncertainty can influence monetary policy decisions.","[Kent, Christopher] Reserve Bank Australia, Econ Grp, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",Reserve Bank of Australia,"Kent, C (通讯作者)，Reserve Bank Australia, Econ Grp, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",KentC@rba.gov.au,,,,,,,6,4,4,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

The few existing studies have generated surprising results: no impact of selective recognition on future productivity for those workers who receive recognition, but increases in productivity for those who do not. We confirm those results for recognition in the form of a Thank you message and show that the same patterns hold true with unexpected financial recognition. Low-performing workers do better when others are recognized but they are left out. Previous studies have all argued that the pure relative performance information that is revealed through recognition drives these effects. We test this hypothesis with a treatment that has relative rank information only and show that this is indeed the case: financial or verbal recognition are not necessary to induce low performers to increase subsequent performance.

Second, it allows model selection based on a strong statistical framework, characteristics that are not easily introduced using a Frequentist approach.

We first provide suggestive evidence from the field and then use a laboratory experiment to show this result in a tightly controlled environment. In the lab, subjects with lower cognitive abilities are more likely to violate fungibility. The findings lend support to behavioral models of narrow bracketing and mental accounting.

We find that government consumption and investment yield the highest GDP multipliers in the short-run, whereas capital income tax and public investment have dominating effect on GDP in the long-run. When nominal interest rate is at the zero lower bound, consumption taxes and public consumption and investment are found to be the most effective fiscal instruments throughout the analysed horizon, and capital and labour income taxes are established to be the least effective. The paper also shows that the effectiveness of fiscal policy decreases in a small open-economy scenario and that nominal rigidities improve effectiveness of public spending and consumption taxes, whereas decrease that of income taxes.","[Bhattarai, Keshab] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Trzeciakiewicz, Dawid] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England",University of Hull; University of Bradford,"Trzeciakiewicz, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England.",Bhattarai@hull.ac.uk; D.Trzeciakiewicz@bradford.ac.uk,"Bhattarai, Keshab/AAM-8733-2020; Bhattarai, Keshab/AFH-7332-2022","Bhattarai, Keshab/0000-0002-5398-984X",,,,,66,28,31,1,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Subjects perform an effort task to earn money and can choose to donate to their selected charity. We find evidence that subjects' choice of charity is impacted by third-party evaluations but, somewhat surprisingly, there are no obvious preferences for local charities.

To understand why, this article analyzes socioeconomic and socio-political characteristics of the countries where women have chaired Central Banks. Then, it suggests that gender differences in preferences as regards monetary policy goals may have some influence. This hypothesis is based on an empirical analysis showing that female Central Bank chairs focus more than their male counterparts on achieving the price stability goal. This means, then, that women are more resistant than men to political pressures. Finally, it concludes that gender differences in degree of conservatism may be an explanatory factor in female underrepresentation in the Central Bank chairs.","[Diouf, Ibrahima; Pepin, Dominique] Univ Poitiers, Ctr Rech Integrat Econ & Financiere, Batiment A1 2 Rue Jean Carbonnier,TSA 81 100, F-86073 Poitiers 9, France",Universite de Poitiers,"Diouf, I (通讯作者)，Univ Poitiers, Ctr Rech Integrat Econ & Financiere, Batiment A1 2 Rue Jean Carbonnier,TSA 81 100, F-86073 Poitiers 9, France.",ibrahima.diouf@univ-poitiers.fr; dominique.pepin@univ-poitiers.fr,,,,,,,38,13,14,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The idea behind this measure is that individuals have stable risk preferences when making decisions under risk. We show that having repeated experiences with the Holt-Laury task can move individuals from exhibiting risk aversion to displaying risk neutrality. This finding suggests that either risk preferences are not robust to a few experiences or that responses to the tasks indicate something else.

This study is among the first to examine how both cognitive and noncognitive skills measured in childhood predict educational attainment and early labor market outcomes in a developing country setting. Analyzing longitudinal data on rural children from one of China's poorest provinces, we find that both cognitive and noncognitive skills, measured when children are 9-12,13-16, and 17-21 years old, are important predictors of whether they remain in school or enter the work force at age 17-21.

Using high frequency data and dynamic forecasting techniques, we find that the new Stock Connect does contribute to the increasing importance of the Chinese mainland stock market and economic activity. A weak and unstable cointegration relationship is found after this event. Additionally, the Stock Connect has also increased the conditional variance of both stock markets. We observe a leading role of the Shanghai stock market to the Hong Kong stock market in terms of both mean and volatility spillover effects after the Stock Connect. Our study indicates that the opening up of stock markets in China could enhance the leading power, influence the risk level and improve the market efficiency of the Chinese mainland stock market, since the volatility spillover effect from Shanghai to Hong Kong is strengthened. Besides, our results have important policy implications, especially on how policy makers should deal with the increased market interconnectedness and for portfolio managers in choosing potential hedging instruments.

Our estimation results support the S-shaped curve hypothesis relating GDP per capita to inequality with different starting points for the four economies. For the reverse relationship, we find a positive causal relationship for China, Japan, and the United States, indicating that increased income inequality spurred economic growth. In addition, we find mixed results on the effect of trade openness on inequality and growth. Trade openness reduced inequality in the United States and Japan, worsened it in China and had no significant effect in South Korea. In the inequality-GDP per capita relationship, exports provided an impetus to economic growth for Japan. As for redistribution, although fiscal redistributive measures reduced inequality in Japan, they played no major role in the other three countries. With regard to the inequality-GDP per capita relationship, all countries except for China show a negative effect of fiscal redistribution on GDP per capita. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Morley, S",,,,"Morley, Samuel",,,Changes in rural poverty in Peru 2004-2012,LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Peru; Rural poverty reduction; Rural urban migration; Mobility; Equivalent cohorts,,"This paper disaggregates the various sources of rural income growth in Peru between 2004 and 2012 and shows that about 80% of the increase came from rising earnings and only 15% from transfer programs. This increase in rural earnings was not led by agriculture. It was mainly because of a general rise in wages across industrial and services activities within the rural population, coupled with a massive movement of the better educated from the rural to the urban areas of the Sierra and Selva. Rapid overall growth rate of the economy permitted an increase in average wages both in the urban receiving areas and for the smaller labor force left behind in the rural sector. In analyzing changes in poverty over time, it is important to distinguish what happens to a given age cohort from changes in the income of different deciles of the distribution. The paper creates a quasi-panel by equivalent cohort. The panel shows that first, there was tremendous progress made in rural poverty reduction among those who were poor in 2004. That is true in both the rural and urban sectors. There were 6.3 million rural poor in 2004. 46% of them or almost three million got out of poverty over the period. Second, it is instructive that 62% of the group that got out of poverty stayed in the rural sector. In other words, almost two thirds of rural poverty reduction was due to increases in rural family income not rural-urban migration. Third, among the rural poor, it was the young who migrated-64% of total rural-urban migration of the poor came from the 0-25 cohort even though it comprised less than 60% of the rural poverty population in 2004.","[Morley, Samuel] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Morley, S (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",s.morley@cgiar.org,,,,,,,8,8,10,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

A systematic approach is adopted to classify countries using a non-hierarchical clustering method. Three macro-scenarios are considered classical, modern and extended which contrast information regarding inequality, poverty and the quality of employment with the role of education, health, institutions and environmental sustainability. Our approach is based on new estimates of inequality and poverty that are derived from Atkinson's Pareto interpolation, which bridges the discrepancy between national income accounts and household surveys. This may serve to offset the statistical bias in the estimates of income inequality and poverty, and to better interpret national and regional socioeconomic performance. The analysis is carried out in a comparative framework between the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region and the European Union (EU).","[Aguilar, Rogelio Madrueno] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Aguilar, RM (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",rmadrueno@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,3,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

We use a database with information on Spanish municipalities with more than 1000 inhabitants for the period 2002-2011. Our results reveal that incumbents adopt an opportunistic behaviour, increasing spending on waste in the preelection year and reducing it in the election and post-election years. Therefore, we confirm an electoral budget cycle on waste collection expenditures in Spain. Additionally, we find that the levels of income, unemployment and upper-level governments' transfers have a positive impact on waste collection spending. Finally, population density, level of urbanization, average age of the population of the municipality and less fragmented governments negatively influence waste collection spending.","[Benito, Bernardino] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Guillamon, Maria-Dolores] Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting, Murcia, Spain; [Rios, Ana-Maria] MDE UPCT, Spanish Air Force Acad, Univ Ctr Def, Dept Econ & Jurid Sci, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia; University of Murcia,"Benito, B (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",benitobl@um.es,"Ríos-Martínez, Ana María/L-1920-2014; Benito, Bernardino/K-9416-2014; Guillamon, Maria-Dolores/K-9689-2014","Ríos-Martínez, Ana María/0000-0002-7783-288X; Benito, Bernardino/0000-0003-2165-994X; Guillamon, Maria-Dolores/0000-0001-7331-5167",,,,,94,7,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Statistical analysis of the wage distribution also forms the basis for government social policy, taxation, budgetary and other decisions. Moreover, the direct connection between wages and the purchasing power of the population brings tracking the level, structure and development of the wage distribution to the foreground when identifying sales opportunities for the products of both long- and short-term consumption. The present paper deals with a comparison of wage levels of fourteen regions in the Czech Republic. Similar wage-level clusters were created using the methods of cluster analysis. Three regions with the highest and lowest wage levels, respectively, were selected.

Innovation is thus, in fact, enhanced by digital literacy from both producers and consumers.","[Borowiecki, Karol J.; Navarrete, Trilce] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Borowiecki, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Business & Econ, Odense, Denmark.",kjb@sam.sdu.dk,"Borowiecki, Karol J./ABE-1387-2021; Navarrete, Trilce/AAH-8156-2019","Borowiecki, Karol J./0000-0003-4959-181X; Navarrete, Trilce/0000-0001-5297-5190",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"This project is part of the FP7 EU-funded project RICHES: Renewal, Innovation and Change: Heritage and European Society taking place from 2013 until 2016.",,45,35,35,4,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Multifactorial because it considers economic and socio-demographic aspects in the decision to migrate in the two regions concerned by migration (origin and destination), and multidimensional because it integrates micro and macroeconomic analysis levels according to their economic, social and political dimensions. We use an agent-based model (ABM) that allows us to consider several parameters simultaneously unlike conventional methods. It also offers the opportunity to study the interactions at the micro economic level and simulate the emerging macroeconomic behavior. ABM also facilates testing multiple configurations of the studied process quickly, unlake intuitively or analytically methods. Two types of agents are considered: regions and individuals. Their behavior is controlled by a set of evolution's rules and constraints and is formulated by mathematical equations.","[Boulahbel-Bachari, Samira] Natl Ctr Res Appl Econ Dev, CREAD, Rue Djamel Eddine El Afghani,El Hammadia BP 197, Rostomia, Bouzareah Algie, Algeria; [Boulahbel-Bachari, Samira; El Saadi, Nadjia] Higher Natl Sch Stat & Appl Econ, ENSSEA, Tipasa, Algeria",Centre de Recherche en Economie Appliquee pour le Developement; ENSSEA,"Boulahbel-Bachari, S (通讯作者)，Natl Ctr Res Appl Econ Dev, CREAD, Rue Djamel Eddine El Afghani,El Hammadia BP 197, Rostomia, Bouzareah Algie, Algeria.;Boulahbel-Bachari, S (通讯作者)，Higher Natl Sch Stat & Appl Econ, ENSSEA, Tipasa, Algeria.",boulahbelsamira@gmail.com; enadjia@gmail.com,"Saadi, Nadjia El/AAE-7052-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,195,204,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300019,0

However, as the minimum wage directly affects nonlabor income of families in some countries (in the Brazilian case via the benefits of the pension system and of certain social programs), this article extends the empirical analysis by studying the effects of the minimum wage on the level of inequality of household income as a whole. To accomplish that we employ a decomposition method that gauges the contribution of the increases in the minimum wage that occurred in recent decades in Brazil through the labor and nonlabor sources of household income. The results show that the minimum wage had a contribution of 64 percent to the observed fall in income inequality between 1995 and 2014 and that pensions were the most relevant channel over this period.","[Brito, Alessandra] IBGE, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Foguel, Miguel] IPEA, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Kerstenetzky, Celia] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Econ Inst, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (IPEA); Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Brito, A (通讯作者)，IBGE, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",,,"Foguel, Miguel/0000-0003-4931-3676",,,,,75,8,12,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The aim of the research was to determine consumer preferences for honey and their attitudes towards the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) label. Also, in the article is presented the current situation regarding the honey market and legislation of the PDO label at the EU and national levels. The result of the empirical research carried out on a sample of 1008 respondents showed that they mostly prefer a mild flavour and brighter colour of honey. According to the type, most of the respondents prefer acacia rather than floral and meadow honeys or other types of honey. The most common method of honey purchase is directly from the producers (75%). The results of the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the most important attributes are the intrinsic attributes of the honey and that the most common reasons for purchasing and consuming honey are for its health and medical benefits. The obtained results fill the gap in knowledge regarding consumer preferences for honey in the Croatian market and can be useful for the creation of new honey-marketing strategies for local beekeepers.","[Brscic, Kristina; Sugar, Tina] Inst Agr & Tourism, Dept Tourism, Porec, Croatia; [Poljuha, Danijela] Inst Agr & Tourism, Dept Agr & Nutr, Porec, Croatia",Institute of Agriculture & Tourism Porec; Institute of Agriculture & Tourism Porec,"Brscic, K (通讯作者)，Inst Agr & Tourism, Dept Tourism, Porec, Croatia.",kristina@iptpo.hr,,,"Beekeeping Association 'Lipa' from Pazin; Administrative Department for Agriculture, Forestry, Hunting and Water Management of Istria County; Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Croatia","Beekeeping Association 'Lipa' from Pazin; Administrative Department for Agriculture, Forestry, Hunting and Water Management of Istria County; Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Croatia","This work was supported by the Beekeeping Association 'Lipa' from Pazin, the Administrative Department for Agriculture, Forestry, Hunting and Water Management of Istria County and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Croatia.
