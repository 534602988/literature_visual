The increasing share of OCP generation workers in the Chinese workforce has created diversity in the group that requires examining whether intergenerational gap exists in the personality that can affect the level of cooperation in the group. We provide evidence that workers from the OCP generation are no less cooperative than the workers from the pre-OCP generation. We argue that strong Chinese culture influenced by the Confucius roots makes OCP generation workers cooperative although this generation is self-centric in the daily life.,"[Kadoya, Yoshihiko] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Econ, Higashihiroshima, Japan; [Khan, Mostafa Saidur Rahim; Sano, Yoshio] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Dept Ind Adm Syst, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Hiroshima University; Nagoya University,"Kadoya, Y (通讯作者)，Hiroshima Univ, Dept Econ, Higashihiroshima, Japan.",ykadoya@hiroshima-u.ac.jp,"Kadoya, Yoshihiko/AAN-4905-2021; Khan, Mostafa Saidur Rahim/V-1355-2018; Kadoya, Yoshihiko/W-1530-2017","Kadoya, Yoshihiko/0000-0003-3530-164X; Khan, Mostafa Saidur Rahim/0000-0003-2632-3580; Kadoya, Yoshihiko/0000-0003-3530-164X","JSPS KAKENHI [15K17075, 15KK0083]; RISTEX, JST; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15KK0083, 15K17075] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); RISTEX, JST(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 15K17075], [grant number 15KK0083]; RISTEX, JST.",,31,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This article uses over 30 years of accounting data and stock returns to examine how publicly traded firms respond to increasing inflation expectations. We first examine whether firms make balance sheet adjustments in response to expected inflation. We then examine whether these activities have a positive effect on stock prices. We find that firms increase inventory, increase capital expenditures and reduce long-term debt when there is an increased expectation of inflation. We then find that firms that increase inventory in this economic regime are rewarded in the market. Markets also reward firms that increase their cash positions and reduce long-term debt possibly suggesting investor flight to safety.","[Kemper, Kristopher J.; Gatzlaff, Kevin] Ball State Univ, Miller Coll Business, Dept Finance & Insurance, Muncie, IN 47306 USA; [Nesson, Erik] Ball State Univ, Miller Coll Business, Dept Econ, Muncie, IN 47306 USA",Ball State University; Ball State University,"Kemper, KJ (通讯作者)，Ball State Univ, Miller Coll Business, Dept Finance & Insurance, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",kjkemper@bsu.edu,,"Nesson, Erik/0000-0002-4714-0495",,,,,22,1,1,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The psychology literature, on the other hand, provides well-established evidence that consumers are often uncertain about the true value of alternatives. This is particularly so when alternatives have several attributes and focusing on different attributes shifts a decision maker's ranking of alternatives. In this paper, we propose and behaviorally characterize a new model of boundedly rational choice that formalizes these insights from psychology into a choice procedure. Simply put, our approach introduces menu dependence into the idea of lexicographic preferences. We study some of its properties and highlight how this procedure exacerbates any welfare judgments.","[Kops, Christopher] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Kops, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",ckops@uni-koeln.de,"Kops, Christopher/JMP-8309-2023","Kops, Christopher/0000-0002-6673-175X",DFG [AL-1169/1-2],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This research is based on part of my PhD thesis at Goethe University Frankfurt, for the revision of this article I gratefully acknowledge funding by the DFG (AL-1169/1-2).",,27,3,4,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

This framework also serves as additional objective of verifying whether public sector investment crowds out or crowds in private investment in India and whether real interest rate as a monetary policy channel variable is effective in influencing the private investment. From our empirical estimation, we observed that crude oil price, public investment, and real interest rate have detrimental effects on the growth of domestic private investment, whereas financial sector development, economic growth, and globalization help to boost up private investment. From a policy perspective, the study suggests that India should intensively shift its focus towards both the production and consumption of renewable energies and tap other alternative potential sources of energy in order to offset the risks arising on account of India's heavy reliance on imports of crude oil from other oil exporting countries. This study further urges that the role of international crude oil price, public sector investment, and real interest rate can't be under-emphasized while designing a comprehensive growth-oriented energy policy strategy for India in order to achieve a sustainable economic development of the economy.

The results confirmed the importance of CEFTA integration, which made a significant contribution to imports and exports within this sector in most SEE countries. Additionally, the results showed that the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU had limited effects on the import and export of agri-food products in SEE countries.","[Matkovski, Bojan; Zekic, Stanislav] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Segedinski Put 9-13, Subotica 24000, Serbia; [Radovanov, Boris] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Dept Business Informat & Quantitat Methods, Segedinski Put 9-13, Subotica 24000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Matkovski, B (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Segedinski Put 9-13, Subotica 24000, Serbia.",bojan.matkovski@ef.uns.ac.rs; radovanovb@ef.uns.ac.rs; zekics@ef.uns.ac.rs,"Matkovski, Bojan/ABF-8436-2021","Matkovski, Bojan/0000-0003-2563-3843; Zekic, Stanislav/0000-0003-3872-1332","Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III 46006]","Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","The paper presents part of the research conducted as part of the project: Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development in terms of the Republic of Serbia's Strategic Goals Implementation within the Danube Region (III 46006), which is financed by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.",,36,10,11,0,3,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Internal sources of finance, such as cash balance and its equivalent as well as operating cash flow, may alleviate concerns on liquidity shocks and finance shorter-term variable costs but long-term secured loans are likely to be required to finance fixed costs related to investments in plant, machinery and other fixed assets that complement exporting activities. Exporting activities may involve hysteresis such that the likelihood of a firm to participate in exporting activities is influenced by the accumulation of long-term secured loans in the period prior to the export transactions. Even though the availability of internal sources of finance and the capital structure of a firm has greater economic significance, we observe that lagged long-term secured loans influences participation in exporting activities. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of one-year lagged long-term secured loans on the participation of firms in exporting activities based on the financial characteristics at the industry-level. This relationship holds for firms within industries with higher levels of long-term secured loans, higher levels of finance leverage, higher levels of asset tangibility and lower levels of total assets.","[Nakhoda, Aadil] Inst Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Karachi, Pakistan","Institute of Business Administration, Karachi","Nakhoda, A (通讯作者)，Inst Business Adm, Dept Econ & Finance, Karachi, Pakistan.",anakhoda@iba.edu.pk,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

It makes 5 points. First, in the short run, the role of autonomous expenditure can be appreciated within a standard post Keynesian framework (Kaleckian, Kaldorian, Robinsonian, etc.). Second, and related to the first, the SSM model is a model of the long run and has to be evaluated as such. Third, in the long run, one way that capacity adjusts to demand is through an endogenous adjustment of the rate of utilization. Fourth, the SSM model is a peculiar way to reach what Garegnani called the second Keynesian position. Although, it respects the letter of the Keynesian hypothesis, it makes investment quasi-endogenous and subjects it to the growth of autonomous expenditure. Fifth, in the long run it is unlikely that autonomous expenditures is really autonomous. From a stock-flow consistent point of view this implies unrealistic adjustments after periods of changes in stock-flow ratios. Moreover, if we were to take this kind of adjustment at face value, there would be no space for Minskyan financial cycles. This also creates serious problems for the empirical validation of the model.","[Nikiforos, Michalis] Blithewood Bard Coll, Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12571 USA",,"Nikiforos, M (通讯作者)，Blithewood Bard Coll, Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12571 USA.",,,"Nikiforos, Michalis/0000-0003-1477-7593",,,,,56,32,33,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Also, the relation between the Web site dialogic potential and the amount of organizational revenue was scrutinized. The revenue was analyzed on two levels: total revenue acquired during the tax year and the amount of the annual 1 % of personal income tax. The results of the study indicate that Web sites of analyzed organizations fail to fully implement the dialogic communication principles. The statistical correlation between the sum of annual revenue and 1 % of personal income tax and the utilization of dialogic principles was partially supported. Non-profits appeared to show their greatest strengths in providing basic information to online users, such as a mission statement, organization logo and history, short loading time, general contact information on the homepage and major links on the homepage to subpages. Organizational division into three clusters highlighted quite significant differences in the utilization of dialogic principles.

In the current study, we investigate the effects of this relationship on the Chinese economy, which is the fastest growing and largest emerging economy in the world. The methodology incudes unit root testing in the presence of structural breaks and the Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. The results of the analysis showed that the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2012 had a significant impact on both the real sector and the financial sector in China. Our findings also suggest that the Shanghai A share market has had a long-run negative association with the real sector of the economy; however, the magnitude of impact has been miniscule. These findings indicate that this negative relationship is proof of the so-called existence of irrational prosperity in the stock market and the economic bubble in China's financial sector. The findings did not show any evidence of a relationship between the stock market and the real economy in the short run. Toda Yamamoto causality test showed that economic growth has spurred the development of the Shenzhen B share market. Furthermore, the equally weighted index showed that stock market liquidity and stock market sectoral indices were alternative measures of stock market activities. The results were robust to the alternative measures of stock market activities. The results also indicate that state-owned monopolies play an important role in China's economic performance because they stimulate the economy in the short run.","[Pan, Lei; Mishra, Vinod] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Mishra, V (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",Lei.Pan@monash.edu; Vinod.Mishra@monash.edu,"Mishra, Vinod/D-1221-2011","Mishra, Vinod/0000-0002-4686-5195; Pan, Lei/0000-0002-1054-981X",,,,,58,78,84,4,42,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

By ignoring this important aspect, it avoids one of the important ethical questions of fairness and social justice. Mainstream ideology of capitalist societies, neoclassical economics, assumes a fair distribution and flow of resources across society, and ostracizes and intimidates those who are critical about this assumption. The most puzzling aspect of neoclassical theory is that in perfectly competitive markets there can be no profit. As we all know, competition eliminates the profit margin by reducing the unit sales price to the level of unit costs. Thus a key epistemological axiom of neoclassical economics, perfectly competitive markets, is at odds with another axiom, namely that profits drive investment and entrepreneurship.","[Pogatsa, Zoltan] Univ West Hungary, Sopron, Hungary",,"Pogátsa, Z (通讯作者)，Univ West Hungary, Sopron, Hungary.",pogatsa.zoltan@uni-sopron.hu,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2520-1794,2520-1808,978-3-319-94529-3; 978-3-319-94528-6,VIRTUES ECON,Virtues Econ.,,2018,3.0,,,,,,163,167,,10.1007/978-3-319-94529-3_12,0.0,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL9EL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457322400012,0

The first order condition can be differentiated with respect to an interval boundary to yield a second order differential equation for the optimal income tax that can be solved to yield specific solutions. Application of an optimal income tax to a broader income range in general reduces tax revenues and requires greater subsidies at low-income levels.

Design/methodology/approach This study followed the five-stage procedure and methods. In the first stage, measurement items were developed in four performance factors: leaning and growth, internal process, customer and finance. In the second stage, data were collected by conducting two types of surveys: first, for Korean export companies that have adopted Radio frequency identification (RFID) to test the proposed model and analyze the performance and second, for RFID experts of industry-university R&D cooperation to measure the relative importance of factors and items. In the third stage, the model was verified with structural equation modeling. In the fourth stage, AHP was used to analyze the relative importance of factors and items. In the fifth stage, post-RFID adoption performance in Korean export companies was measured by a formula for the performance index. Through these five-stage procedure and methods, the final performance improvement strategies and practical implications are presented in the conclusion. Findings The framework finds that the total score of RFID post-adoption on company performance proved relatively low, which indicates that the effect of this technology on export companies' performance is still unsatisfactory. And financial performance proved to be top priority' area, which requires the most urgent effort for improvement since its importance was higher than learning and growth, internal process and customer performancebut nonetheless its performance index was the lowest. This study finds that strategic decision making is required for adopting smart technology in the perspective of technology convergence to improve the performance of companies among heterogeneous industries. Research limitations/implications Despite the significant results of this study alone, it also has limitations. Therefore, the direction of the future study is as follows: future research should focus on finding specific impact factors enhancing post-adoption of smart technologies including RFID performance by conducting empirical studies that identify the factors affecting post adoption of smart technologies rate directly or indirectly. Originality/value In the current global market environment, not only technological convergence in the same kind of industry but also industrial convergence in the different kinds of industries are essential to manufacturing and service companies including to export companies with perspective of Innovation. This study has the value as an interdisciplinary study to actually measure the performance of a company by industrial convergence through the theme of adoption of smart technology in export companies.","[Sawng, Yeong-Wha] Konkuk Univ, Management Technol, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Yongjae] Korea Inst Ceram Engn & Technol, Jinju, South Korea; [Jo, Seok-Hong] Korea Railrd Corp, Daejeon, South Korea; [Park, Seung-Lak] Cheongju Univ, Int Trade, Cheongju, South Korea",Konkuk University; Korea Institute of Ceramic Engineering & Technology; Cheongju University,"Park, SL (通讯作者)，Cheongju Univ, Int Trade, Cheongju, South Korea.",slpark@cju.ac.kr,"Sawng, Yeong-Wha/IAL-9778-2023","Sawng, Yeong-Wha/0000-0002-6152-2625",Konkuk University,Konkuk University,This paper was supported by Konkuk University in 2015.,,78,0,0,3,35,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Attention of economic theory focuses mainly on the positive benefits of education both for individuals and for society. However, there are only few studies focusing on the wider approach to education as a factor that can affect not only paid work and income, but also unpaid work. The main purpose of the contribution is to reveal a relationship between the education and unpaid work. Contribution is based on the data from the original field research, which was conducted in 2016 in Slovakia. Within the field research, we questioned 1743 households and 4818 individuals. Using the correlation analysis, we analysed relationship between the unpaid work and education, paid work, income, age groups and status of activity (employed/ unemployed). Results prove that unpaid work, its structure, and extent, are strongly influenced by economic factors as well as by non-economic motives. It seems to be necessary to consider unpaid work as a part of informal education. Our findings try to help policymakers to understand importance of the unpaid work for increasing preparedness of human capital for labour market.","[Uramova, Maria; Knapkova, Miroslava; Hronec, Martin] Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Uramová, M (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",maria.uramova@umb.sk; miroslava.knapkova@umb.sk; martin.hronec@umb.sk,"knapkova, miroslava/E-3963-2017","knapkova, miroslava/0000-0002-1602-5398","Grant Agency VEGA at the Faculty of Economics, Matej Bel University in Slovakia [1/0621/17]","Grant Agency VEGA at the Faculty of Economics, Matej Bel University in Slovakia","This paper is an output of scientific project of Grant Agency VEGA no.

We employ a unique longitudinal data base providing information on start-up motive and earnings for 7902 entrepreneurs in the EU-15 countries, where 12 different start-up motives are distinguished. We classify these 12 motives in three broad categories of opportunity, necessity and other start-up motives. Our analysis shows that, first, earnings of necessity entrepreneurs are significantly lower than those of opportunity entrepreneurs, irrespective of the type of necessity motive. Second, these differences remain rather stable over the course of the entrepreneur's business tenure, i.e., these differences are of a permanent nature.

Based on the neoclassical theory and the behavioral theory, this paper explores the driving factors of M&A among Chinese ChiNext companies. Two hypotheses were put forward: one based on IPO over-financing and the other based on the market value overvaluation. IPO over-financing is specific to the Chinese capital market while market value overestimation is driven by the continuous upsurge in the ChiNext Market. Our study found that both factors account for enterprises' mergers and acquisitions. They have far-reaching influences on such fields as acquisition probability, the size of the transaction, transaction frequency, M&A payment method and market reaction. Due to IPO over-financing, enterprises tend to carry out M&A via cash payment or cash and stock mixed payment method. Heavier IPO over-financing will increase the chance of M&A and leads to larger transaction size and higher transaction frequency. Market value overvaluation will lead to more uses of stock or cash and stock mixed payment on M&A transactions. When the company's stock is overvalued, the company will use the overvalued equity to acquire other companies. Greater overvaluation of the market value also increases the chance of M&A and leads to a larger transaction size and higher frequency of M&A. In China, IPO over-financing rather than market value overvaluation, is the major driving factor for China's corporate mergers and acquisitions. Further study found that the market reaction to different payment methods in mergers and acquisitions varies: it has the minimum reaction on cash payment, a larger reaction on stock payment and the greatest reaction on mixed payment. Also, the mixed payment method has the largest cumulative abnormal returns. This is different from the empirical findings in the United States and Europe. This paper provides a theoretical basis and empirical evidence for an in-depth understanding of the wave of mergers and acquisitions of Chinese ChiNext companies, and provides a basis for decision-making and policy recommendations for the government regulators and investors.","[Xu, Xin; Liang, Yong-jin] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Accounting, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Song, Shun-lin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accountancy, Beijing, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Xu, X (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Accounting, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xuxinfeiji@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402189]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education [2014116]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education,This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71402189) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the Chinese Ministry of Education (Project No. 2014116).

Design/methodology/approach - This paper develops a two-sector endogenous growth model which allows for the observed characteristics of digitally empowered structural changes. Specifically, the driving force of economic growth is the expanding variety of intermediate services as a consequence of innovation in services. The introduction of new intermediate services specifically contributes to total factor productivity in the production of service sector, and thus an uneven growth path with skill premium toward a service economy generally exists. Findings - The principal finding of this paper is that the digitally empowered expanding variety of intermediate services due to innovation contributes significantly to total factor productivity in the production of service sector, and thus a servicization with skill premium generally exists along a steady-state path. In addition, this paper derives an optimal innovation policy to rule out the market failures due to innovation externality and market power in monopolistic competition conditions, and shows the Rybczynski effects of exogenous endowment changes in the evolving digital economy. Originality/value - The principal contribution of this paper is to determine how unbalanced endogenous growth along a steady-state path is linked with a service economy with skill premium in the evolving digital economy. In addition to this analysis, this paper provides policy implications - namely, that a positive but finite innovation subsidy can achieve the social optimum in the digital economy, and that an exogenous increase in high-skilled labor can speed up a digitally empowered economic growth.","[Yoon, Sang-Chul] Dankook Univ, Dept Int Trade, Yongin, South Korea",Dankook University,"Yoon, SC (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Dept Int Trade, Yongin, South Korea.",syoon@dankook.ac.kr,"Yoon, Sang-Chul/P-8129-2016",,,,,,37,7,7,1,45,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The results show that, initially, a fiscal stimulus implemented under the condition of returning to a balanced budget leads to a higher increase in per capita output and consumption compared to a fiscal expansion with permanently higher public debt. However, in the medium run, the strict fiscal discipline case leads to an output recession despite the increase in private per capita consumption whereas a loosening of the fiscal discipline helps avoid the recession at the cost of higher public debt. The overlapping-generations framework shows also the demographic impact on the fiscal policy effectiveness under different degrees offiscal discipline.","[Zeyneloglu, Irem] Galatasaray Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, 36 Ciragan Ave, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey",Galatasaray University,"Zeyneloglu, I (通讯作者)，Galatasaray Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econ, 36 Ciragan Ave, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey.",izeyneloglu@gsu.edu.tr,"ZEYNELOGLU, IREM/AAC-2480-2020","ZEYNELOGLU, IREM/0000-0001-5637-1992",,,,,14,0,0,0,3,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Based on P-HFSs, we propose the concept of probability-hesitant fuzzy preference relation (P-HFPR) to collect the preferences. We then develop a consensus index to measure the consensus degrees of P-HFPR, and a stochastic method to improve the consensus degrees.

However, conditional on seeing any clients, college-educated prostitutes see more clients and provide longer client sessions. We demonstrate that these results are consistent with a model in which college-educated prostitutes have better outside options to prostitution, but are also able to reduce the marginal disutility of prostitution work by attracting fewer unpleasant clients and by combining sexual services with non-sexual services such as companionship, where college education may be productive.","[Cunningham, Scott] Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Kendall, Todd D.] Compass Lexecon, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Baylor University,"Cunningham, S (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Waco, TX 76798 USA.;Kendall, TD (通讯作者)，Compass Lexecon, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",scott_cunningham@baylor.edu; tkendall@compasslexecon.com,,,,,,,19,7,8,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We present a stylized model of a two-country economy where governments are endowed with political preferences over the consumption of domestic content and enact import barriers and subsidies to protect it. We introduce peer-to-peer file sharing as a distinct distribution channel enabled by the Internet that provides access to all media products at a low cost. We report two main findings. First, the Internet renders legacy cultural policy inefficient, and the elimination of import barriers and the reduction of subsidized production can be desirable even when governments exhibit paternalistic preferences favoring the consumption of domestic content. And second, even though the Internet increases cultural diversity within countries, it can also reduce diversity across them. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, these studies have ignored the role of financial development while examining the impact of exchange rate volatility on capital flows. This study aims to analyze the impact of exchange rate volatility on capital inflows towards developing countries by incorporating the role of financial development over the time period 1980-2013. In this regard, the behavior of two types of capital flows is examined: physical capital inflows measured as foreign direct investment, and financial inflows quantified through remittance inflows. The empirical investigation comprises the direct as well as indirect effect of exchange rate volatility on capital inflows. The study employs dynamic system GMM estimation technique to empirically estimate the effect of exchange rate volatility on capital inflows. The empirical results of the study identify that exchange rate volatility dampens both physical and financial inflows towards developing countries. The indirect impact of exchange rate volatility through financial development, however, turns out positive and statistically significant. This finding reflects that financial development helps in reducing the harmful impact of exchange rate volatility on capital inflows. Hence, the study concludes that a developed financial system is an important channel through which developing countries may improve capital inflows in the long run.","[Jehan, Zainab; Hamid, Azooba] Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan",,"Jehan, Z (通讯作者)，Fatima Jinnah Women Univ, Dept Econ, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.",zainabjehan.fjwu@gmail.com,"N, A/JUF-6197-2023",,,,,,57,6,7,5,28,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

A natural question is then: Do sophisticated international financial markets obviate the need for such an active union-wide authority? We argue that they do. Specifically, we show that in a benchmark economy with no international financial markets, an activist union-wide authority is necessary to achieve desirable outcomes. With sophisticated international financial markets, however, such an authority is unnecessary if its only goal is to provide cross-country insurance. Since restricting the set of policy instruments available to member countries does not create a fiscal externality across them, this result holds in a wide variety of settings. Finally, we establish that an activist union-wide authority concerned just with providing insurance to member countries is optimal only when individual countries are either unable or unwilling to pursue desirable policies.","[Kehoe, Patrick J.; Pastorino, Elena] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kehoe, Patrick J.] UCL, London, England; [Kehoe, Patrick J.; Pastorino, Elena] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kehoe, Patrick J.; Pastorino, Elena] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of London; University College London; Stanford University; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Kehoe, PJ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Kehoe, PJ (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Kehoe, PJ (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Kehoe, PJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA.",patrickjameskehoe@gmail.com,,"Kehoe, Patrick/0000-0001-5738-1236",ADEMU project; European Commission [649396]; National Science Foundation,ADEMU project; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor, the referees, Eugenia Gonzalez Aguado, Zefeng Chen, and Sergio Salgado Ibanez for helpful comments.

Despite this, the literature studying driver behavior has produced mixed evidence of which labor supply model best applies to driver labor supply. Using a novel analysis and large datasets of taxi trips from two different cities, this paper provides a unifying analysis which reconciles previous inconsistencies in evidence for reference dependence in taxi drivers. By testing for a particular non-linear relationship between shift income and drivers' hazard of stopping, I identify behavior that is consistent with Prospect theoretic (S-shaped) reference dependence as opposed to the more extensively examined loss aversion model of reference dependence. This particular model of reference dependence in this setting allows me to estimate individual driver reference points without an explicit functional form or ex-ante assumptions about the existence of a reference point.

Yet, most of the empirical micro- and macro-research on the link between climate change and migration fails to find much evidence of this migration happening. We focus on Tuvalu, a small South Pacific atoll nation that can serve as the canary in the mine for climate change research. If migration driven by climate change is not happening, Tuvalu may explain why. One plausible reason is the desire by Tuvaluans to Voice. 'Voicing', a concept we borrow from Hirschman's Exit, Voice, and Loyalty, is the advocacy of expressing wish for change. We argue that Tuvaluans have decided that their preferred policy is to stay and Voice. This present choice to Voice may explain why the evidence on climate-induced migration is so fragile. Tuvalu may be using Voice to attempt to avert dire outcomes, or to strengthen its bargaining position for the discussions about compensation. The risk may be that the equilibrium choice between Voice and Exit is unstable and that the transition from one strategy to the other may be abrupt-in response to a catastrophic disaster. Advance planning and funding for climate-induced migration are therefore necessary through the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage.","[Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington 6012, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Noy, I (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington 6012, New Zealand.",ilan.noy@vuw.ac.nz,,"Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",,,,,48,23,23,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

We challenged empirical investigations to explore this issue by focusing on social engagement in the post-disaster period of the Great East Japan Earthquake, March 2011. Two main research topics are addressed: the influence of natural disasters on social engagement and that of social engagement on post-disaster subjective well-being. Crucial findings of our analysis include that daily interactions with neighbors, friends, and acquaintances are lower among those who suffered less damage than those who suffered the most. On the other hand, formal participation in local collective groups is higher among those who were most devastated by the disaster.

While critics accuse international students of displacing American students, university administrators have argued that they provide much needed tuition revenue. This paper examines how international students impact domestic enrollment, focusing on a unique boom and bust in international matriculation into U.S. graduate programs from 1995 to 2005. Overall foreign students appear to increase domestic enrollment. This positive effect is linked to cross-subsidization, whereby high net tuition payments from foreign students help subsidize the cost of enrolling additional domestic students.","[Shih, Kevin] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"Shih, K (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, 110 8th St, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",shihk2@rpi.edu,,"Shih, Kevin/0000-0003-3604-629X",National Bureau of Economic Research Predoctoral Fellowship,National Bureau of Economic Research Predoctoral Fellowship,"I thank Giovanni Peri, Hilary Hoynes, Chad Sparber, Petra Moser, Brian Cadena, Norman Matloff, and Yury Yatsynovich, the anonymous referees, and the seminar participants at UC Davis, Williams College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for their useful suggestions and discussions.

But, as the literature review shows, there is not an accepted methodology for the empirical evaluation of these effects. The authors suggest a simple but rigorous empirical approach to quantify the catalytic effect of conditioned transfers for investment and their asymmetric impact across regions in Spain. To identify this behaviour, they have applied different empirical approaches with frontier techniques that let them consider the frontier as a proxy for potential investment. The results show that the conditioned transfers received by the regions from higher levels of government have a stimulus effect for investments, especially in the poor regions. The authors identify several factors explaining this unbalanced catalytic effect: the political cost of tax collection, political factors, inadequate management of debt, and other variables such as the level of economic development, population density, and the economic cycle.","[Valles-Gimenez, Jaime; Zarate-Marco, Anabel] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Zárate-Marco, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",azarate@unizar.es,"Vallés-Giménez, Jaime/AAK-5749-2020; Valles-Gimenez, Jaime/R-5073-2018","Vallés-Giménez, Jaime/0000-0002-2542-4956; Valles-Gimenez, Jaime/0000-0002-2542-4956; Zarate Marco, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-5525-4556",Regional Government of Aragon; European Regional Development Fund (Public Economics Research Group),Regional Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Regional Development Fund (Public Economics Research Group),We gratefully acknowledge the funding support of the Regional Government of Aragon and the European Regional Development Fund (Public Economics Research Group).

This paper contributes to this debate by studying the shock-absorbing capacity of capital controls. Using a recently developed capital control dataset for a panel of 33 emerging market economies, I show that output in economies with stricter capital inflow controls responds significantly less to global credit supply shocks, whereas capital outflow controls have no significant shock-absorbing capacity. Leverage is significantly lower in economies enacting stricter capital inflow controls, suggesting that financial frictions play a role in driving the shock-absorbing capacity of inflow controls.

We develop a theoretical framework to examine this question, and conduct an experiment with 147 3-5 year-old children and their parents, using dictator games to measure generosity. We find (1) evidence of parental teaching/modeling in the case of fathers and in that of parents of relatively generous children, and (2) an emulation effect such that children who initially share less than half of their endowment subsequently share more the more they see a parent or other adult share.

The level and distribution of management quality is similar to that found in other low and middle-income countries (India and Brazil). I combine this data with individual student panel data, and demonstrate that differences in school management quality matter for student value-added-a standard deviation difference in management is associated with a 0.06 standard deviation difference in test scores. Finally, I contribute to understanding the role of the private sector in education in a low-income setting. Contrary to common perception, I find no difference between the quality of school management in government, private or public-private partnership (PPP) schools (despite the higher level of autonomy available to them).

We use data for manufacturing firms in Spain between 1999 and 2012 to document a significant increase in the dispersion of the return to capital across firms, a stable dispersion of the return to labor, and a significant increase in productivity losses from capital misallocation over time. We develop a model with size-dependent financial frictions that is consistent with important aspects of firms' behavior in production and balance sheet data. We illustrate how the decline in the real interest rate, often attributed to the euro convergence process, leads to a significant decline in sectoral total factor productivity as capital inflows are misallocated toward firms that have higher net worth but are not necessarily more productive.

In municipalities with weak political competition, the public spending reaches a peak in election years. If parties face politically strong opponents, they do not initiate a political budget cycle.

In our experiment, we find that subjects do not act according to theoretical equilibrium, and their frequencies of making the socially beneficial choice in herding and shirking games are inversely influenced by the number of network neighbors they have. Moreover, the observed local network effect is stronger in shirking games, while the global network effect is more significantly present in herding games. We explain the behavioral regularities through a hybrid learning model, which extends SEWA learning into a network context. As such, our learning model provides a foundation for the observed dynamics, disequilibrium behavior, as well as the local and global network effects.

The estimation of an estimation method based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters with a view to reducing numerical redundancy. The asset allocation problem is then discussed in a market with complete information using the standard Bellman's principle and recursive formulas are derived. Numerical results reveal that the HO-HMMAR model may have a slightly better out-of-sample forecasting accuracy than the HMMAR model over a short horizon.

In our model the energy mix is based on the conversion of heterogeneous energy sources. Markups over marginal costs are endogenous so that the marginal revenue product of capital becomes non-monotonic in capital. We derive multiple steady states and identify regions in which initial conditions are insufficient as a selection criterion for development. In these situations, pure expectations determine the equilibrium selection process which is crucial for long-run performance. Energy policy affects the interplay between history and expectations by shifting the region where expectations matter and by affecting the location of the equilibria in the dirty and the clean economy. We find that taxes and subsidies should be used simultaneously to guide an energy transition. We argue that expectations and momentum effects are important for the energy transition because they decrease policy costs and thus raise political acceptance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The paper tests the implications of the model using a cross-sectional dataset including about 100 countries. Both theoretical and empirical results suggest that to move the economy into a productive equilibrium, complementarity matters: reforms to improve the business environment tend to be more effective in creating productive firms when accompanied by narrowing skill gaps. Similarly, more conducive business regulations amplify the positive impact on firm creation of better education and reduced skill mismatches.

This paper considers decreasing and possibly negative population growth rates in two two-sector growth models. As long as preferences are homothetic, neither a decrease in population growth rates nor an actual population decline does induce migration in either direction. Introducing quasi-linear preferences implies that a decline in population growth leads to migration from the rural to the industrial region. A complete depopulation of the rural region takes place if the population growth rate falls short of minus the rate of physical capital depreciation. These results reinforce pessimistic expectations about a rural exodus.","[Christiaans, Thomas] FOM Univ Appl Sci, Dept Econ, Birlenbacher Str 18, D-57078 Siegen, Germany",,"Christiaans, T (通讯作者)，FOM Univ Appl Sci, Dept Econ, Birlenbacher Str 18, D-57078 Siegen, Germany.",thomas.christiaans@fom.de,,,,,,,32,5,5,1,23,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Parents differ in income and in the ability of their unique child. They vote over the minimum ability level required to attend public universities, which are tuition free and financed by proportional income taxation. Parents can invest in private tutoring to help their child pass the admission test. A university participation gap emerges endogenously with richer parents investing more in tutoring. A unique majority voting equilibrium exists, which can be either classical or ends-against the-middle (in which case parents of both low-and high-ability children favor a smaller university). Four factors increase the university size (larger skill premium enjoyed by university graduates, smaller tutoring costs, smaller university cost per student, larger minimum ability of students), but only the former two also increase the participation gap. A more unequal parental income distribution also increases the participation gap, but barely affects the university size. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Savage [Savage, Leonard J. (1954). The Foundation of Statistics. Wiley, New York] provides axioms on preference over acts that are equivalent to the existence of a subjective expected utility representation, and further establishes that such a representation is essentially unique. We show that there is a continuum of other  expected utility representations in which the probability distributions over states used to evaluate acts depend on the set of possible outcomes of the act and suggest that these alternate representations can capture pessimism or optimism. A consequence of the multiplicity of alternative representations of preferences that satisfy Savage's axioms is that existing analyses of agents' market behavior in the face of uncertainty have a broader interpretation than would appear at first glance. Extending the decision maker's (DM) choice domain to include both subjective acts and objective lotteries, we consider a DM who behaves in accordance with expected utility on each subdomain, applies the same Bernoulli utility function over prizes regardless of their source, but may be optimistic or pessimistic with regard to subjective acts. This model can accommodate, for instance, the behavior in Ellsberg's two-urn experiment, and provides a framework within which optimism, pessimism, and standard Savage agents can be distinguished.","[Dillenberger, David; Postlewaite, Andrew] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Rozen, Kareen] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Brown University,"Dillenberger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ddill@sas.upenn.edu; apostlew@upenn.edu; kareen_rozen@brown.edu,,,National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation [SES-0919955],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Eddie Dekel, Itzhak Gilboa, Edi Karni, Mark Machina, Larry Samuelson, Tomasz Strzalecki, and Peter Wakker for helpful discussions and suggestions.

Lobbying is divided between direct representation by special interests to policymakers, and indirect representation where special interests employ professional intermediaries called commercial lobbyists to lobby policymakers on their behalf. Our analytical structure allows us to explain several trends in lobbying. For example, using the observation that in the United States over the last 20 years, policymakers have spent an increasing amount of their time fundraising as opposed to legislating, we are able to explain why the share of commercial lobbyist activity in total lobbying has risen dramatically and now constitutes over 60% of the total. The key scarce resource in our analysis is policymakers' time. Policymakers allocate this resource via implicit repeated agency contracts that are used to incent special interests and commercial lobbyists to provide a mix of financial contributions and information on policy proposals. These implicit agency contracts solve both an information problem in the presence of unverifiable policy information and a contracting problem in the absence of legal enforcement. These repeated relationships, that are often described using the pejorative term cronyism in the popular press, may in certain circumstances be welfare improving.","[Groll, Thomas] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Discipline, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Ellis, Christopher J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Columbia University; University of Oregon,"Groll, T (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Discipline, New York, NY 10027 USA.",tgroll@columbia.edu; cjellis@uoregon.edu,,,,,,,59,12,15,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We show, by means of an example, that the policy functions obtained by this approach may differ from both the solution of a properly reduced system and the solution obtained from solving the system of nonlinear equations that arises from applying the implicit function theorem to the model's equilibrium conditions. As a consequence, simulation results may depend on the specific algorithm used and on the numerical values of parameters that are theoretically irrelevant. The sources of this inaccuracy are ill-conditioned matrices as they emerge, e.g., in models with strong habits.

A stock-flow based dynamic model of credit creation process is developed in which the commercial bank supplies loans to the firm. The change of credit is governed by the bank lending and the repayment of the existing loans, where the equilibrium stock of credit could be attained once the lending is exactly equal to the repayment. However, the supply of bank loans is restricted by both the reserve requirement set by the central bank and the LCR prescribed by the banking authority; and, as a result, money creation must be affected by all these regulations. The bank loan supply under the constraint of the required liquidity buffer might have different prescriptions under different economic scenarios, and would eventually result in an equilibrium monetary stock correspondingly. The final formula of money multiplier is derived respectively as the rational response of the bank to the corresponding regulation. When the reserve requirement is tighter than the LCR, the money multiplier has the same expression of that in the prevailing fractional reserve regime. Yet when the situation departs from this regime, the determinants of the money multiplier are found to be associated with the parameters that characterize the behavior of banks subject to the regulation and of the private sector rather than those monetary structural factors. It is noteworthy that there may be a credit contraction and even a significant reduction in money multiplier when the bank is regulated by the LCR.

We apply a formal test for time variation and proceed to extract time varying cointegration relationships. Both formal and graphical evidence points to a break in the relationship(s) of gold and official inflation in the mid 1990s in the USA but to less clear results for the UK and Japan. However, gold seems to have offered a protection against an increase in money supply throughout nearly the entire past 40 year period in the US and the UK but failed to do so in Japan. Supporting previous findings we find evidence for a time-varying relationship in cointegration between gold and both predicted and realized inflation in nearly all cases.

We studied the saving behavior of a large cross-section of adults to investigate age differences in motivations to save across adulthood. Our investigation revealed that both a future oriented mindset as well as adequate financial knowledge may be necessary for younger adults to engage in saving for their retirement. This finding is consistent with a theoretical account in which younger adults who have long time horizons prioritize preparatory goals and knowledge seeking. As time horizons shorten, motivations to realize goals replace motivations to gather knowledge. Accordingly, future oriented attitudes were more directly associated with saving with advancing age, such that future oriented adults who were approaching retirement saved regardless of their level of financial knowledge. Our findings reveal a dynamic character of saving tendencies across adulthood and imply age differences in the psychological factors that motivate saving behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It turns out that if there is asymmetric information, then ownership matters for investment incentives and for the expected total surplus.

This results in different effective tax rates depending on the way in which goods and services are purchased and the characteristics of both the products and the sellers. We discuss the arguments for the destination principle as the appropriate place-of-taxation rule for consumption taxation of cross-border trade. We analyze various recent reforms to the value-added tax in the European Union in response to e-commerce. We then examine various policy options in the USA-maintaining the status quo, changing nexus rules, states adopting information reporting, and national reforms that require firms to remit taxes regardless of physical presence-and relate them to the recent European reforms. We conclude based on our analysis and the recent European Union experience that reforms at the national level appear to be the important next step to enforcing commodity taxes at destination in the USA.","[Agrawal, David R.] Univ Kentucky, Martin Sch Publ Policy, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Agrawal, David R.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Fox, William F.] Univ Tennessee, Boyd Ctr Business & Econ Res, Stokely Management Ctr 715, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Kentucky; Ifo Institut; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Agrawal, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Martin Sch Publ Policy, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.;Agrawal, DR (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",dragrawal@uky.edu; BillFox@utk.edu,"Agrawal, David R/C-1945-2013",,,,,,50,25,26,7,148,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

FLEXIBILITY; STOCHASTIC MECHANISMS; BURNED MONEY; CHEAP TALK; COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION; ORGANIZATIONS; BUREAUCRATS; AUTHORITY; ECONOMICS,"In many contracting settings, actions costly to one party but with no direct benefits to the other (money burning) may be part of the explicit or implicit contract. A leading example is bureaucratic procedures in an employer employee relationship. We study a model of delegation with an informed agent, where the principal may impose money-burning on the agent as a function of the agent's choice of action, and show that money-burning may be part of the optimal contract. This result holds even if action-contingent monetary transfers are possible, as long as transfers from the principal to the agent are bounded from below (as in limited liability or minimal wage requirements). In fact, the optimal contract can involve a combination of both efficient monetary incentives and inefficient nonmonetary incentives through money burning. Our model delivers some results novel to the delegation literature. First, money-burning is more likely if the principal is more sensitive to the choice of action than the agent. This is consistent with the perception that there is more bureaucratization in large organizations. Second, money -burning is more likely if the agent's limited liability constraint is tighter relative to his participation constraint. This implies that a higher minimum wage distorts employment contracts towards using socially wasteful nonmonetary incentives, leading to a Pareto inferior outcome as the agent is still held down to his reservation value through increased money burning.(C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The direct impact of the rebate is associated with a reduction of an exporting firm's variable costs, while the indirect impact manifests itself through higher regional wages as a result of increased demand for local labor. First, the empirical results imply that a 1 percent rise in the export tax rebate rate increases the export sales among continuing exporters by 0.2 percent through the direct channel. Second, through the indirect channel, a 1 percent difference in the regional rebate causes a 0.02 percent difference in exporters' sales growth.

Crisis in this structure is rooted in the role played by dynamic terms of trade rather than informational imperfections as generally found in the existing literature.

The widely held view is that transparency benefits organizational performance, because it reduces employee uncertainty. However, causal empirical evidence on the value of transparency and its motivating mechanism is still scarce. In this paper, we report the findings from an experiment, in which an agent has only probabilistic beliefs about the true state of nature and needs to choose costly effort that benefits the principal. The true state relates to his fixed-wage, which can either be high or low. The principal needs to decide whether to create Informative Transparency by disclosing the true state to the agent via a costly, fixed-form message. Our results show a considerable value of transparency: even if transparency involves the disclosure of 'bad news' (the low state), effort almost doubles relative to non-disclosure. Looking at the motivating mechanism, we do not find that transparency motivates primarily because it reduces uncertainty for the agent. Instead, we find that Uninformative Transparency that merely involves communication of already known facts is equally effective. Many principals, however, misperceive the value of transparency and disclose information too restrictively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The findings show that Chinese supply shocks are more important than its demand shocks. Supply shocks produce positive and significant output responses in all BRIS countries. And while these supply shocks have a permanent impact on the BRIS countries, the effects of demand shocks are short-lived. Both supply and demand shocks are transmitted through trade rather than financial linkages.

Here, we use econometric methods to evaluate the relationship between county-level socio-economic indicators and hydropower development for 56 Brazilian hydropower plants built between 1991 and 2010. We find that counties that built hydropower plants had greater GDP and tax revenues during their first few years of development than a control group that consisted of counties with hydropower projects planned but not yet built. However, those positive economic effects were short lived (< 15 years). We also find that social indicators (e.g. average income, life expectancy, educational level, access to piped water and public electricity, teenage pregnancy levels, and HIV cases) in counties that built hydropower did not statistically differ from those in the control counties. The results suggest that, for Brazil, justifications for hydropower projects based on local long-term economic and social development should be questioned, and that more effective mechanisms for turning local short-term economic growth into long-term development are needed.

Using a standard VAR, we empirically show that a temperature shock has a sizable, negative and statistically significant impact on TFP, output, and labor productivity. We rationalize these findings within a production economy featuring long-run temperature risk. In the model, macro-aggregates drop in response to a temperature shock, consistent with the novel evidence in the data. Such adverse effects are long-lasting. Over a 50-year horizon, a one-standard deviation temperature shock lowers both cumulative output and labor productivity growth by 1.4 percentage points. Based on the model, we also show that temperature risk is associated with non-negligible welfare costs which amount to 18.4% of the agent's lifetime utility and grow exponentially with the size of the impact of temperature on TFP. Finally, we show that faster adaptation to temperature shocks results in lower welfare costs. These welfare benefits become substantially higher in the presence of permanent improvements in the speed of adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that the use of low-frequency data introduces an aggregation bias because the cycle of moderate political shocks is much shorter (measured in weeks). Using monthly data from 1990 through 2013 for China, we estimate a model of political relations and conclude that political shocks are short-lived. Narrative evidence from two case studies illustrates the transitory nature of these shocks. A VAR model shows that although political shocks influence exports to China, the effects largely vanish within two months.

Prior work had focused on one particular equilibrium. However, there may be other equilibria. To address this issue, we introduce a new and intuitive measure for the proximity to the all-pay auction. This allows, in particular, to provide simple conditions under which actually any equilibrium of the contest is both payoff equivalent and revenue equivalent to the unique equilibrium of the corresponding all-pay auction. The results are shown to have powerful implications for monopoly licensing, political lobbying, electoral competition, optimally biased contests, the empirical analysis of rent-seeking, and dynamic contests.

In our experiment, a contribution phase is followed by a network phase: individuals first decide whether to contribute and then decide with whom to form a link. An exchange of contributions between individuals occurs only if a bilateral link is established. We identify the effect of revealing one's name on the probability of link formation by letting individuals choose to signal - at the linking stage - their willingness to later reveal their name. Our results indicate that this decision significantly affects partner selection and the consequent structure of the network. Individuals who reveal their name build up smaller individual networks but attain higher profits. Incurring privacy costs by revealing personal information is compensated with a higher probability to establish mutual links with contributors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that these farm households are willing to adopt improved biomass cookstove innovations if this leads to economic savings. Moreover, results suggest significant positive environmental externalities. On a per household basis, we found that adopters collect about 70 kg less wood and about 20 kg less dung each month. The adoption of improved biomass cookstoves reduces harvest pressure on local forest stands: assuming an average of 120 metric tons of biomass per ha, we find the potential reduction in deforestation amounts to some 1400 ha per year - an important saving. Further, the reduced use of dung as a fuel has a positive impact on soil productivity in agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Focusing on the dominant role of Germany as the leading economy in the EMU, we test the presence of real exchange rate equilibrium between Germany and selected EMU countries. For comparison reasons, we examine the same research question between Germany and selected non-EMU countries. Our main finding is that, under the framework of the monetary union, the examined adjustment mechanisms cannot restore equilibrium between Germany and deficit countries. Although the loss of nominal exchange rate fluctuation could explain this failure, policy makers should focus on national fiscal policies and on the structure of national markets. Besides the implementation of structural reforms, the way out of the crisis requires a symmetric adjustment process, in which the European Central Bank has a crucial role to play.

Our study deployed a Stated Preference survey to measure consumers' potential responses towards price changes and the introduction of promotions, as well as the resulting effects on demand. A series of econometric models were developed, ranging from simple selection models to advanced multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) models, to capture the discrete and continuous feature of alcohol purchasing choice behaviour. The model results were compared and then extrapolated to a series of policy scenario tests, to enable the evaluation of factors that underpin consumers' alcohol purchasing behaviour. This research contributes to evidence on the role of multi-buy promotions on alcohol purchasing behaviour, as well as adding to recent developments in the choice modelling literature by providing a comparison of results across a range of different model structures suitable for the analysis of data such as used here.

In contrast to the previous evidence, the synthetic control analyses find that the influx had a significant adverse effect on labor market outcomes.

Under positive or weakly negative correlations, however, the threat of collusion forces the principal to distort allocation away from the first-best level obtained without collusion. We also show that, in contrast to the result of Laffont and Martimort (Econometrica 68:309-342, 2000), when the correlation is almost perfectly positive, the possibility of arbitrage prevents the principal from approaching the first-best efficiency.","[Meng, Dawen; Yang, Zhe] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Meng, Dawen; Yang, Zhe] Key Lab Math Econ SHUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tian, Guoqiang] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Meng, DW; Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Meng, DW; Yang, Z (通讯作者)，Key Lab Math Econ SHUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",devinmeng@hotmail.com; gtian@tamu.edu; zheyang211@163.com,,,"National Science Foundation of China [NSFC-71301094, NSFC-71371117, NSFC-11501349]; Key Laboratory of Mathematical Economics (SUFE) at Ministry of Education of China","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Mathematical Economics (SUFE) at Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",D.

In the real world, individuals are members of groups and want to reward or punish those groups whose members have been kind or unkind to members of their own. In this paper, we extend Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger's model of sequential reciprocity (Games Econ Behav 47(2):268-298, 2004) to groups of individuals and define a new sequential group reciprocity equilibrium for which we prove its existence. We study the case of two games with two players in each game, where each player belongs to the same group as a player in the other game. We show that when the payoffs of one game are much higher than the payoffs of the other, the outcome of the game with higher payoffs determines the outcome of the other game. We also find that when the payoffs are very asymmetric, the outcome where the sum of the payoffs is maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium.","[Moreno-Okuno, Alejandro T.; Mosino, Alejandro] Univ Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico",Universidad de Guanajuato,"Moreno-Okuno, AT (通讯作者)，Univ Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico.",atatsuo@hotmail.com,"Mosiño, Alejandro/HKN-4135-2023; Mosiño, Alejandro/AAR-6834-2021","Mosiño, Alejandro/0000-0001-5989-8538; Mosiño, Alejandro/0000-0001-5989-8538",,,,,33,3,3,0,12,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

When the nominal interest rate is the central bank's operating instrument, the LM equation is endogenous and, it is argued, can be ignored. The modern theoretical and quantitative debate on the importance of money for monetary policy conduct, however, overlooks firms' money demand. Working in an otherwise canonical New Keynesian setup, we show that macroeconomic dynamics are critically affected by the firms' money demand choice. Under the conventional Taylor-rule framework, we prove that equilibrium determinacy may require either an active interest rate policy, overreacting to inflation, or a passive interest rate policy, underreacting to inflation, depending on the elasticity of production with respect to cash balances. We then develop a numerical analysis to evaluate our theoretical results. We find that macroeconomic stability is more likely to occur under an active, but not overly aggressive, monetary policy stance. We also examine the dynamic effects of forward-looking feedback rules. We show that, in this policy regime, indeterminacy is likely to be induced by both active and passive rules, even for relatively low productivity effects of money.","[Bafile, Romina] Univ Aquila, Rome, Italy; [Piergallini, Alessandro] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of L'Aquila; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Piergallini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ & Finance, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",alessandro.piergallini@uniroma2.it,,,"MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca)","MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We thank the editor, Nelson C.

Using a panel vector autoregressive model with exogenous factors, it traces the mean responses of output, terms of trade, extensive and intensive margins to real and nominal shocks in 22 developed economies over the period 1988-2011. We find remarkable differences in the transmission of shocks across exchange rate regimes. Adjustment takes place mainly at the extensive margin in fixed regimes, and implies a crowding out of intensive margins that is not present among floaters. Large movements at the extensive margin are associated with a weaker performance in terms of output stabilization. Our findings are robust to alternative sample selections and identification of the shocks. The evidence in the paper stresses a novel advantage of flexible exchange rates based on their ability to smooth the fluctuations in trade of new products.","[Cavallari, Lilia] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Via Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy; [D'Addona, Stefano] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Via G Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University; Roma Tre University,"D'Addona, S (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Via G Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",lilia.cavallari@uniroma3.it; daddona@uniroma3.it,"Cavallari, Lilia/A-6266-2012","Cavallari, Lilia/0000-0003-1351-3561",,,,,36,3,3,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The use of the Phillips et al. (2015 a,b) recursive explosive-root test enables us to detect and date speculative episodes in both markets. We then implement the Greenaway-McGrevy and Phillips (2016) methodology to detect the presence of migration between the two types of bubbles.

We show that a country can gain from dividing itself into two regions with different factor ratios (and preclude the cross-region factor mobility). Allowing a region in a country to have a comparative advantage different from the country as a whole can generate a welfare-improving terms-of-trade effect, which is reminiscent of immiserizing growth in reverse. Our simple model can provide a justification for self-sufficiency programs or special industry zone policies in some developing countries. We also show that subnational regionalization can reduce the volume of trade and or even reverse countries' trade patterns. This finding could provide an alternative explanation for the missing trade problem and the paradox between trade patterns predicted by the standard Heckscher-Ohlin comparative advantage model and those found empirically.","[Dong, Baomin] Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng 475000, Peoples R China; [Wong, Siu-kee] United Int Coll, Div Business & Management, 28 Jinfeng Rd, Zhuhai 519085, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Henan University; Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College,"Dong, BM (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Sch Econ, Kaifeng 475000, Peoples R China.",baomindong@vip.163.com,"Dong, Baomin/AAV-7741-2021","Dong, Baomin/0000-0002-4787-021X",MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities [14JJD790012],MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities,The financial support of the MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities (14JJD790012) An Analysis on the Evolution of Yellow River Civilization in Terms of the Public Economy is appreciated.

The proposed models decompose China's economic growth into five components: the technological change effect, the industrial structure effect, the regional balance development effect, the management effect, and the production factors effect. The empirical results show that during the sample period, the production factors effect increased from approximately 70% in 2001 to nearly 99% in 2010, indicating that economic growth in Mainland China relied heavily on factor accumulation, which was not sustainable. Fortunately, this situation has gradually improved since 2011 because of technological progress and industrial structure optimization. However, the current total factor productivity in Mainland China remains relatively low because of an inefficient industrial structure, regional balance development, and management inefficiency. In other words, there is a great deal of room for further industrial structural optimization, regional balance development, and management improvement to realize further sustainable economic growth. Because the causes of total-factor production inefficiency and the distribution of economic growth potential show a distinct spatial difference, the focuses for the Chinese provinces to achieve sustainable economic growth should be quite different in the future. Based on the results of this study, recommendations have been made for the Chinese provinces to realize further sustainable economic growth.","[Feng, Chao; Wang, Miao; Huang, Jian-Bai] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Feng, Chao; Wang, Miao; Huang, Jian-Bai] Cent S Univ, Inst Met Resources Strategy, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guan-Chun] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Central South University; Central South University; Fudan University,"Feng, C (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",littlefc@126.com,"Feng, Chao/A-6705-2019","Feng, Chao/0000-0002-3568-7418; Wang, Miao/0000-0003-3903-2643","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373283, 71373287, 71403298, 71573282, 71633006]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13 ZD024, 13 ZD169, 14ZDB136]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71373283, 71373287, 71403298, 71573282, and 71633006) and the National Social Science Foundation of China (Nos. 13 & ZD024, 13 & ZD169, and 14ZDB136).",,67,64,66,1,87,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the absence of habit formation, an impatient individual would prefer a decreasing consumption path over life. However, because of habit formation, a high initial consumption would lead to high required consumption in the future. To cover the future required consumption, wealth is set aside, but the necessary amount decreases with age which allows consumption to increase in the early part of life. At some age, the impatience outweighs the habit concerns so that consumption starts to decrease. We derive the optimal consumption strategy in closed form, deduce sufficient conditions for the presence of a consumption hump, and characterize the age at which the hump occurs. Numerical examples illustrate our findings. We show that our model can quantitatively reproduce the hump observed in US consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey.","[Kraft, Holger; Wagner, Sebastian] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Frankfurt, Germany; [Munk, Claus] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Finance, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Seifried, Frank Thomas] Univ Trier, Dept Math 4, Trier, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Copenhagen Business School; Universitat Trier,"Munk, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Finance, Copenhagen, Denmark.",holgerkraft@finance.uni-frankfurt.de; cm.fi@cbs.dk; seifried@uni-trier.de; Sebastian.Wagner@hof.uni-frankfurt.de,,,Center of Excellence SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Center of Excellence SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We appreciate comments from James Feigenbaum, Nicola Fuchs-Schundeln, Michael Haliassos, Tim Kehoe, Natalia Khorunzhina, Christian Laux, Mirko Wiederholt, and participants at presentations at the Swiss Society for Financial Market Research, the University of York, the Vienna University of Economics and Business, and the Copenhagen Business School.

A vast literature exists on the design of incentives to modify the behavior of firms and consumers, but not much is known about incentives offered to adolescents and young adults to affect their cultural consumption behavior. Students in the first treatment receive a flier with basic information and opening hours of a main museum in Florence, Italy-Palazzo Vecchio. Students in the second treatment receive the flier and a short presentation conducted by an art expert about the exhibit; students in the third treatment, in addition to the flier and the presentation, receive also a non-financial reward in the form of extra-credit points toward their school grade. The analysis yields two main findings. First, non-financial reward is more effective at inducing the students to undertake the encouraged visit than either the simple presentation or the basic information with the flier.

Considering negative demographic trends and an acute problem of population aging in Ukraine the article presents an empirical research of the dynamics of labour force participation and unemployment rate, as well as the correlation relationship between them in various periods of time. On the basis of threshold-disturbance moving average and threshold-disturbance autoregressive models there are elicited significant asymmetric reactions of labour force participation rate, unemployment rate and productivity to positive and negative macroeconomic shocks. For modelling the asymmetric behaviour of economic activity of population there is developed a nonlinear logistic smooth transition autoregressive model. In the result of econometric analysis there is received large estimated value of slope parameter which characterizes the smoothness of transition. This indicates that the economic activity of the population in Ukraine quickly reacts to the previous changes that took place in the labour market. In times of crisis Ukrainian households increase labour supply and show increased activity in job search in order to prevent the decline of their income.","[Lukianenko, Iryna] Natl Univ Kyiv Mohyla Acad, Dept Finance, Kiev, Ukraine; [Oliskevych, Marianna] Ivan Franko Natl Univ Lviv, Dept Math Econ & Econometr, Lvov, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ivan Franko National University Lviv,"Lukianenko, I (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kyiv Mohyla Acad, Dept Finance, Kiev, Ukraine.",luk@kse.org.ua; olisk@ukr.net,"Lukianenko, Iryna/I-3725-2018; oliskevych, marianna/S-3701-2017","Lukianenko, Iryna/0000-0002-4128-5909; oliskevych, marianna/0000-0003-1264-1684",,,,,51,3,3,0,17,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using an experimental approach, we examine the empirical relevance of the nonlinear equilibriain a two-player common property resource game. We found, extraction behavior in response to evolving stock deviates significantly from the equilibrium strategies. However, long-term outcomes, in terms of steady states, predicted by both linear and nonlinear Markovian strategies are attained in significant proportions by the actual play. While 19% of participants' play resulted in a steady state that coincides with the stable steady state supported by the linear Markov-perfect equilibrium strategy, 41.5% of all games resulted in steady states within the range supported by nonlinear Markovian strategies. Our results indicate that nonlinear equilibria cannot be ruled out as irrelevant on behavioral grounds. We also found evidence for the use of simple rule-of-thumb strategies, which consist of refraining from extraction until a threshold stock is reached and extracting at a positive constant rate after the threshold is reached.

This class of model is used widely in theoretical analysis of retail pricing. We quantify cross-category pricing effects and find that internalizing them substantially reduces market power. We find that consumers inclined to one-stop (rather than multi-stop) shopping have a greater pro-competitive impact because they generate relatively large cross-category effects.

The mean squared predictive error reduction over the benchmark of no-change forecast is as high as 17% and the directional accuracy as high as 0.645. A combination with TVP models is found to generate more accurate forecasts than the same combination with constant coefficient models because the forecast errors of individual TVP models are correlated at a lower degree.

In this paper, we first discuss the theoretical properties of the GCARR model and then compare its empirical performance with the WCARR. Empirical studies are performed on a broad set of stock indices in different countries over different time horizons. Consistent with the conjecture, we find that the GCARR model can reduce not only the inlier problem but also the outlier problem of the WCARR model.

Our empirical strategy combines a boundary discontinuity design with controls for time-invariant effects and arbitrary macroeconomic shocks at a very local level to identify the causal effect of broadband speed on property prices from variation that is plausibly exogenous. Applying this strategy to a micro data set from England between 1995 and 2010 we find a significantly positive effect, but diminishing returns to speed. Our results imply that disconnecting an average property from a high-speed first-generation broadband connection (offering Internet speed up to 8 Mbit/s) would depreciate its value by 2.8%. In contrast, upgrading such a property to a faster connection (offering speeds up to 24 Mbit/s) would increase its value by no more than 1%. We decompose this effect by income and urbanization, finding considerable heterogeneity. These estimates are used to evaluate proposed plans to deliver fast broadband universally. We find that increasing speed and connecting unserved households pass a cost-benefit test in urban and some suburban areas, whereas the case for universal delivery in rural areas is not as strong.","[Ahlfeldt, Gabriel] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Koutroumpis, Pantelis; Valletti, Tommaso] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Imperial College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ahlfeldt, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",g.ahlfeldt@lse.ac.uk; p.koutroumpis@imperial.ac.uk; t.valletti@imperial.ac.uk,,"Koutroumpis, Pantelis/0000-0002-2398-0027; Ahlfeldt, Gabriel/0000-0001-5664-3230","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N023242/1, EP/K039504/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/N023242/1, EP/K039504/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,39,31,33,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

We use two sets of data, daily realized volatility (RV) estimates taken from the Oxford-Man RV library, for the S&P500 and the FTSE, plus 10 years of daily returns series for the New York Stock Exchange Index and the FTSE 100 index. Both data sets capture both the global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the subsequent European Sovereign Debt Crisis (ESDC). The spillover index captures the transmission of volatility to and from markets, plus net spillovers. The Volatility Impulse Responses (VIRF) have to be calibrated to conditional volatility estimated at a particular point in time. We explore the impact of three different shocks, the onset of the GFC, the height of the GFC, and the impact of the ESDC. Our modelling includes leverage and asymmetric effects applying a multivariate GARCH model, and further analysis using both BEKK and diagonal BEKK (DBEKK) models. We find the impact of negative shocks is larger, but shorter in duration, in this case a difference between 3 and 6 months.","[Allen, David E.] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Coll Technol Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Erasmus Univ, Inst Econometr, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [McAleer, Michael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Quantitat Econ, Madrid, Spain; [McAleer, Michael] Yokohama Natl Univ, Inst Adv Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Powell, Robert; Singh, Abhay K.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA, Australia",University of Sydney; University of South Australia; National Tsing Hua University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Complutense University of Madrid; Yokohama National University; Edith Cowan University,"Allen, DE (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Allen, DE (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",profallen2007@gmail.com,"Allen, David/AAM-9744-2021; Allen, David/JTV-4098-2023; Singh, Abhay/AAG-9813-2021","Singh, Abhay/0000-0002-3783-6325; Powell, Robert/0000-0003-3634-1264","Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Taiwan","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (funds awarded to first author) and Australian Research Council and National Science Council, Taiwan (funds awarded to second author).",,30,14,15,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Identifying potential output with non-inflationary output is too restrictive given that growing financial imbalances can place output on an unsustainable path even if inflation is low and stable. We propose a simple and transparent framework to accommodate information about the financial cycle in constructing output gap estimates. Applied to US data, our approach yields measures of potential output that are not only estimated more precisely, but also much more robust in real time.

A close examination of the public rental housing program in Shanghai helps to show that the recent revival of public housing in Chinese cities is mostly driven by the desire for economic growth.

Instead of a comparison between the actual results and the proposed targets, an evaluation of the quality of the programme forecast is made, showing that errors could have been avoided if the productive (input-output) structure of the economy and also the unemployment rate/external deficit trade-off had been taken into account. The main conclusion of this assessment is that a large underestimation of the unemployment rate was made, amounting to about four percentage points, which illustrates the technical flaw of this adjustment programme and the huge economic and social costs it unnecessarily caused.

We demonstrate that misspecifying the pricing rule can lead to biased estimates of the latent valuation distribution, and then explore identification and estimation of a model with a correctly specified pricing rule. A further challenge to econometricians is that only a lower bound on the number of participants at each auction is observed. From this bound, however, we establish nonparametric identification of the arrival process of bidders-the process that matches potential buyers to auction listings-which then allows us to identify the latent valuation distribution without imposing functional-form assumptions. We propose a computationally tractable, sieve-type estimator of the latent valuation distribution based on B-splines, and then compare two parametric models of bidder participation, finding that a generalized Poisson model cannot be rejected by the empirical distribution of observables. Our structural estimates enable us to explore information rents and optimal reserve prices on eBay.","[Hickman, Brent R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hubbard, Timothy P.] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA; [Paarsch, Harry J.] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Econ, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",University of Chicago; Colby College; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Hickman, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",hickmanbr@gmail.com; timothy.hubbard@colby.edu; hjpaarsch@gmail.com,,"Hubbard, Timothy/0000-0002-9290-0246",,,,,30,11,13,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7331,,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

By blending regime switching models and Markov chain approximation techniques in the Fourier domain, we provide a unified approach to price Bermudan, American options and barrier options under general stochastic volatility models with jumps. The models considered include Heston, Hull-White, Stein-Stein, Scott, the 3/2 model, and the recently proposed 4/2 model and the alpha-Hypergeometric model with general jump amplitude distributions in the return process.

In order to fight against it, international development agencies have fostered decentralization reforms that have been applied throughout the world. This means that, the analysis of the effects of fiscal decentralization on poverty has become a research area of extraordinary academic interest, but one that has produced conflicting findings. This paper aims to analyse the effect on poverty of fiscal decentralization of spending in education, health, housing, and social protection. Methods: We estimate a fixed effect model by Feasible Generalized Least Square (FGLS) using unbalanced panel data of countries. Results: The decentralization of spending has a differentiated effect on poverty: the decentralization of health and housing policies contributes to reduce poverty, while the decentralization of social protection spending stimulates an increase in poverty. Conclusions: the hypothesis of the classical theory on decentralization is endorsed in the areas of health and housing. On the other hand, the prediction of the normative theory of the public economy is ratified in the area of the social protection. So, for each country, which social policies to decentralize and the allocation of resources among jurisdictions should be analysed with great detail to avoid problems of targeting strategy, accountability and responsibility assignments.","[Llorca-Rodriguez, Carmen M.; Saez-Lozano, Jose L.] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ Int & Espana, Campus Univ Cartuja, Granada, Spain; [Garcia-Fernandez, Rosa M.] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Metodos Cuantitat Econ & Empresa, Campus Univ Cartuja, Granada, Spain; [Saez-Lozano, Jose L.] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, GIADE UGR, Grp Invest Avanzada Direcc Empresarial, Granada, Spain",University of Granada; University of Granada; University of Granada,"Llorca-Rodríguez, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ Int & Espana, Campus Univ Cartuja, Granada, Spain.",cmllorca@ugr.es; rosamgf@ugr.es; josaez@ugr.es,,"Llorca Rodriguez, Carmen Maria/0000-0002-0343-9479",,,,,93,6,6,0,26,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We incorporate a simple definition of college reputation-graduates' mean admission scores-into a competitive labor market model. This generates a clear prediction: if employers use reputation to set wages, then the introduction of a new measure of individual skill will decrease the return to reputation. Administrative data and a natural experiment from the country of Colombia confirm this. Finally, we show that college reputation is positively correlated with graduates' earnings growth, suggesting that reputation matters beyond signaling individual skill.","[MacLeod, W.

We propose a model which explains differences in expected matching behavior, marriage rates, non-child-friendly activities, and fertility, based on different costs of procreation and complementarities between marriage and children. The model predicts that the biological traits of same-sex couples, unlike those of heterosexual couples, should not be correlated-holding constant other household production characteristics. In addition, the model predicts that heterosexuals have a higher probability of having children and getting married, and that childless heterosexuals are less likely to engage in behaviors not complementary with children than childless gays and lesbians. Using two nationally representative probability samples that self-identify sexual orientation, these predictions are confirmed.","[Allen, Douglas W.; Lu, Shih En] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Allen, DW (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",allen@sfu.ca; shihenl@sfu.ca,,,Social Sciences and Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This research and analysis are based on CCHS and Census data from Statistics Canada, and the opinions expressed do not represent the views of Statistics Canada.

In this paper, we open a new path in the literature by arguing that indeed the effects of exchange rate volatility on trade flows could be asymmetric. The asymmetric effects are mostly due to the change in expectations of traders when a currency depreciates as compared to a case when that currency appreciates. We demonstrate the asymmetric effects by using monthly data from 54 Malaysian industries that export to the U.S. and from 63 Malaysian industries that import from the U.S. The application of the nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach of Shin et al. (2014) supports short-run as well as long-run asymmetric effects in almost 1/3rd of the industries. The approach identifies industries that are affected when volatility increases versus those that are affected when volatility declines.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Aftab, Muhammad] Univ Malaya, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Universiti Malaya,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.;Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu; maftab@siswa.um.edu.my,"KHAN, MUHAMMAD ZIA AFTAB/AAD-2172-2019; Aftab, Muhammad/ACZ-3714-2022","KHAN, MUHAMMAD ZIA AFTAB/0000-0003-2926-3229; Aftab, Muhammad/0000-0003-4164-4147; Aftab, Muhammad/0000-0003-1013-4849",,,,,23,102,103,3,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Similarly, state and local government wage shocks lead to increases in consumption and output, while shocks to federal government wages induce significant contractionary effects.

We study market interaction under two types of direct advertising: opt-in advertising, where firms ask consumers for their consent to send them ads with information about new products, and direct advertising without permission, where sellers use consumer contact information without their explicit consent. We show that, compared to the case where firms only use mass media, the use of direct ads (with or without permission) results in an intertemporal reallocation of market power from the first to the second period and that, compared to opt-in advertising, direct advertising without permission results in lower or equal prices. We also evaluate the impact of a regulatory policy aimed at protecting consumer privacy by banning the use of direct advertising without permission in favor of opt-in advertising. We find that this policy lowers social welfare and, if the degree of product differentiation is sufficiently high (vs. low), it does not affect (vs. lowers) firm profits and lowers (vs. increases) consumer surplus.

Quality sorting models are considered to a large extent as a quality interpretation of the Melitz (2003) model: While firm-level prices decrease monotonically in production efficiency, firm-level prices increase monotonically with quality. Using firm level information on technology and quality upgrading investments, this paper discusses the isomorphism of heterogeneous firms models.

Before each game we provide subjects with the rank-order of their partner (relative to all subjects in the session) on one of the personality traits of the Big Five Inventory. Using a within-subjects design we find that subjects are more cooperative when informed that their partner is more 'Agreeable' or 'Open to Experience'.

The four types of measures are a procyclical measure, a weakly procyclical measure, an acyclical measure and a countercyclical measure. Motivated by the fact that the U.S. markup has shifted up dramatically since the early 2000s, the paper also presents both empirical dynamics and a new Keynesian model featuring nonstationary markups. After inspecting empirical dynamics of key macroeconomic variables and the performance of the model, it points out that weakly procyclical or acyclical markups are more consistent with the purely forward -looking NKPC. Moreover, a major shortcoming of standard new Keynesian models is their inability to trace the actual behavior of the markup in response to a demand shock.","[Kim, Bae-Geun] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Kim, BG (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Econ, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",kimbg@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,32,0,0,2,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

A theoretical model is derived based on the traditions of rural Malawi, where men often supplement farm income with wage labor. As wage labor is not observed by the wife, this creates moral hazard: husbands may not make enough effort to bring home wages. The model predicts that women overcome this by using domestic labor as an incentive device: they increase their domestic labor and reduce their leisure in response to good consumption outcomes, but only if they cannot rely on divorce threat as an alternative source of incentives. This prediction is confirmed using survey data from Malawi. Identification is based on the fact that Malawi's kinship traditions exogenously determine women's accessibility to divorce. Where divorce is not an option, women make inefficient labor choices in order to provide incentives.","[Walther, Selma] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Walther, Selma] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Walther, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England.;Walther, S (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England.",selma.walther@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,6,6,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Based on the hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curve, the analyses include survey measures from Consensus Economics to compare inflation dynamics across Euro Area member countries. Particular focus is set on the choice of suitable measures of real marginal cost. In addition to the well-known output gap, the role of finance-neutral output gaps and unemployment gaps is examined. Throughout the analyses, price setting is found to be largely backward-looking, but with a decreasing trend over time. Countries' varying sensitivity to the different measures of real marginal cost is highlighted, which may indicate persistent heterogeneity in Euro Area inflation dynamics. With the onset of the financial crisis, finance-neutral output gaps outperform alternative measures of real marginal cost.","[Amberger, Johanna; Fendel, Ralf] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dept Econ, Vallendar, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Fendel, R (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Dept Econ, Vallendar, Germany.",Johanna.Amberger@whu.edu; Ralf.Fendel@whu.edu,,,,,,,58,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2017,44.0,2,,,,,261,293,,10.1007/s10663-016-9322-x,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ES6WW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399692300004,0

Bearing in mind the planning of a more reliable electricity mix, the main contribution of this paper is to consider parameter uncertainties on the electricity portfolio optimization problem. We assume that the expected and the covariance matrix of the costs for the different energy technologies, such as gas, coal, nuclear, oil, biomass, wind, large and small hydropower, are not exactly known. We consider that these parameters belong to some uncertainty sets (box, ellipsoidal, lower and upper bounds, and convex polytopic). Three problems are analyzed: (i) finding a energy portfolio of minimum worst case volatility with guaranteed fixed maximum expected energy cost; (ii) finding an energy portfolio of minimum worst case expected cost with guaranteed fixed maximum volatility of the energy cost; (iii) finding a combination of the expected and variance of the cost, weighted by a risk aversion parameter. These problems are written as quadratic, second order cone programming (SOCP), and semidefinite programming (SDP), so that robust optimization tools can be applied. These results are illustrated by analyzing the efficient Brazilian electricity energy mix considered in Losekann et al. (2013) assuming possible uncertainties in the vector of expected costs and covariance matrix. The results suggest that the robust approach, being by nature more conservative, can be useful in providing a reasonable electricity energy mix conciliating CO2 emission, risk and costs under uncertainties on the parameters of the model.

Variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as wind and solar power, are currently showing rapid growth rates in power systems worldwide, and could also be important in future mitigation strategies. It is therefore important that the electricity sector and the integration of VRE are correctly represented in energy models. This paper presents an improved methodology for representing the electricity sector in the long-term energy simulation model TIMER using a heuristic approach to find cost optimal paths given system requirements and scenario assumptions. Regional residual load duration curves have been included to simulate curtailments, storage use, backup requirements and system load factor decline as the VRE share increases. The results show that for the USA and Western Europe at lower VRE penetration levels, backup costs form the major VRE cost markup. When solar power supplies more than 30% of the electricity demand, the costs of storage and energy curtailments become increasingly important. Storage and curtailments have less influence on wind power cost markups in these regions, as wind power supply is better correlated with electricity demand. Mitigation scenarios show an increasing VRE share in the electricity mix implying also increasing contribution of VRE for peak and mid load capacity. In the current scenarios, this can be achieved by at the same time installing less capital intensive gas fired power plants. Sensitivity analysis showed that greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector in the updated model are particularly sensitive to the availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power and the costs of VRE.

There are two sides to it, namely a cognitive side, involving the beliefs and interpretative frameworks by which the organization categorizes the states of the world and its own internal states, and an operational one, including routines and procedures that store the knowledge of how to do things. We formalize both types of memory by means of evolving systems of condition-action rules and investigate their performance in different environments characterized by varying degrees of complexity and non-stationarity. Broadly speaking, in simple and stable environments memory does not matter, provided it satisfies some minimal requirements. In more complex and gradually changing ones, having more memory provides an advantage. However, there is some critical level of environmental instability above which forgetfulness is evolutionary superior from the point of view of long-term performance. Moreover, above some (modest) complexity threshold, stable and robust cognitive categorizations and routinized behaviour emerge.","[Marengo, Luigi] Univ LUISS, Dipartimento Impresa & Management, Rome, Italy; Scuola Super Sant Anna, Ist Econ, LEM, Pisa, Italy; Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ Empresa, Madrid, Spain; Univ Aquila, Sch Econ, Laquila, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of L'Aquila,"Marengo, L (通讯作者)，Univ LUISS, Dipartimento Impresa & Management, Rome, Italy.",lmarengo@luiss.it,"Paraskevopoulou, Evita/K-8396-2017; PARASKEVOPOULOU, EVITA/ABF-9805-2021; Valente, Marco/G-8781-2012","PARASKEVOPOULOU, EVITA/0000-0001-7820-524X; Valente, Marco/0000-0001-5378-4898",Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) [IN 01100022]; European Union [603416]; Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation grant [649186]; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2013-45864-P]; Community of Madrid [S2015/HUM-3417]; European Social Fund; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649186] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); European Union(European Union (EU)); Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation grant; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Community of Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"LEM, Istituto di Economia, Scuola Superiore Sant' Anna, Pisa; Dipartimento di Impresa e Management, Universita LUISS, Roma; Departamento de Economia de la Empresa, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; and School of Economics, Universita de L'Aquila, respectively.

Determination of the number and the location of knots is central to spline regression. In this paper, we initially propose a method based on the coefficient of determination R-2 related to the estimation of knots in spline regression. This proposed method as applied to export-import ratio distributions in Turkey for the years 1923-2010 determines the knots, and linear, quadratic, and cubic spline regression models are established accordingly. Results reveal that spline regression models offer better results than polynomial regression models, and that the quadratic spline regression model is the best explanatory model for export-import ratio distributions in the smoothest spline regression models.","[Alkan, Omer; Oktay, Erkan; Celik, Kemal] Ataturk Univ, Dept Econometr, Erzurum, Turkey; [Genc, Asir] Selcuk Univ, Dept Stat, Konya, Turkey",Ataturk University; Selcuk University,"Alkan, Ö (通讯作者)，Ataturk Univ, Dept Econometr, Erzurum, Turkey.",oalkan@atauni.edu.tr,"Çelik, Ali Kemal/L-1990-2016; GENÇ, AŞIR/AAG-9074-2020; Alkan, Ömer/Y-4330-2019","Çelik, Ali Kemal/0000-0002-2605-6526; GENÇ, AŞIR/0000-0002-0339-6050; Alkan, Omer/0000-0002-3814-3539",,,,,46,2,2,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Competition for the market generates multiple equilibria that differ in the firms' investment levels, relative size, and profitability. We show that monopolization that affects competition in the market can act as an equilibrium selection device in competition for the market. In particular, it eliminates equilibria that are undesirable for the monopolizing firm, while not generating new equilibria. This result complicates the task of determining whether a firm's dominance in a given market is the result of fair competition or unlawful monopolization.

The Chamber of Commerce of Bogota (CCB) conducts workshops for prospective formal-sector entrants and arranges personalized meetings for them with CCB agents. The CCB's decision to significantly reduce the transaction costs of registration and the entry into force of Act No. 1429 of 2010, which eliminated the costs of the initial procedure for registering as a formal enterprise and provided tax exemptions during the first years after formalization, provided us with an ideal natural experiment for studying how the elimination of the initial fixed costs of formalization would influence firms' decision to operate formally or not. We obtained two important results. First, while a workshop treatment had no effect on firms' formalization decisions, meetings at the firm with CCB agents raised the likelihood that a business would begin to operate formally by 5.5 percentage points for all the firms that were invited, at random, to participate in this segment of the intervention and by 32 percentage points for the firms that accepted the invitation. Second, the effect on the treated firms did not persist over time. In fact, after a year of formal operation, the effect disappeared. These results indicate that substantial reductions in the fixed costs of operating formally are not an effective means of influencing formalization choices, since such reductions had no lasting effect on formalization decisions.","[Galiani, Sebastian] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Galiani, Sebastian] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Melendez, Marcela] ECON ESTUDIO, Bogota, Colombia; [Melendez, Marcela] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia; [Ahumada, Camila Navajas] Univ Calif San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Galiani, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,Inter-American Development Bank [AEARCTR-0000725],Inter-American Development Bank,ECON ESTUDIO gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Inter-American Development Bank (AEARCTR-0000725).,,21,16,17,3,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,APR,2017,45.0,,,,SI,,143,157,,10.1016/j.labeco.2016.11.011,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,EU9XV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401393900012,0

We develop and estimate a model in which individuals face uninsured human capital risks and invest in education, acquire work experience, accumulate assets, and smooth consumption. Agents can borrow from the private lending market and from government student loan programs. The private market credit limit is explicitly derived by extending the natural borrowing limit of Aiyagari (1994) to incorporate endogenous labor supply, human capital accumulation, psychic costs of working, and age. We quantify the effects of cognitive ability, noncognitive ability, parental education, and parental wealth on educational attainment, wages, and consumption. We conduct counterfactual experiments with respect to tuition subsidies and enhanced student loan limits and evaluate their effects on educational attainment and inequality. We compare the performance of our model with that of an influential ad hoc model in the literature with education-specific fixed loan limits. We find evidence of substantial life cycle credit constraints that affect human capital accumulation and inequality. The constrained fall into two groups: those who are permanently poor over their lifetimes and a group of well-endowed individuals with rising high levels of acquired skills who are constrained early in their life.cycles. Equalizing cognitive and noncognitive ability has dramatic effects on inequality. Equalizing parental backgrounds has much weaker effects. Tuition costs have weak effects on inequality.

We conduct a field experiment using teams of children (aged 11 or 12) that are participating in an entrepreneurship education program in the last grade of primary school in the Netherlands. Schools participating in this program are randomly assigned to one of three treatments: the first is purely financially oriented, the second promotes sustainable behavior and the third also induces sustainability by (monetary) incentives. Comparing the first two groups we find that solely promoting sustainability does not lead to a change in sustainable behavior.

While fiscal decentralization offers significant advantages regarding public expenditure efficiency, a potentially large disadvantage is that it may lead to increased regional inequality. In this paper, in line with our theoretical hypotheses, we find that while fiscal decentralization at the sub-provincial level in China leads to larger intra-provincial inequality, fiscal equalization efforts performed by provincial governments tend to mitigate the detrimental effect of fiscal decentralization on intra-provincial inequality. Our results also indicate that the quantitative effects of fiscal decentralization on regional inequality tend to be larger when they are measured from the expenditure side, which is consistent with the fact that expenditure decentralization is a much more meaningful measure of decentralization in China. Overall, we provide evidence on the potential inequality costs of using fiscal decentralization as a development strategy. At the same time, we emphasize the importance of implementing a fiscal equalization program to ensure the overall success of decentralization policy.","[Liu, Yongzheng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Martinez-Vazquez, Jorge] Georgia State Univ, Int Ctr Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Wu, Alfred M.] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Policy Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),"Liu, YZ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yongzheng.liu@ruc.edu.cn,"WU, Alfred Muluan/AAG-1033-2019","WU, Alfred Muluan/0000-0002-2689-6285","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403276, 71533006]; Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation [151085]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of the Ministry of Education of China [NCET-13-0573]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of the Ministry of Education of China(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)),"We would like to thank Guangrong Ma for providing some of the data used in this paper.

I demonstrate that in a dynamic setting, additional welfare gains can improve the prospects of cooperation. In the model, intertemporal efficiency gains result from abatement costs that are convex in each period. While non-cooperative countries tend to postpone their abatement efforts until the last minute as a result of the free-rider incentive, cooperation allows countries to allocate their abatement efforts efficiently over time. I show that cooperation often improves the outcome substantially, and arises endogenously in the model. In some cases, a 'threshold-equilibrium' emerges, where the stable coalition size is just large enough for the signatories to invest in avoiding the catastrophe.","[Schmidt, Robert C.] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Schmidt, RC (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",robert.schmidt.1@wiwi.hu-berlin.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Education and Research [FKZ01LA1121C],German Federal Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research [FKZ01LA1121C].,,12,6,6,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Four types of infrastructure are considered: electricity generating capacity, roadway, railway, and telecommunications. Using a vector error correction model, we find mixed support across time period and region for the contribution of infrastructure investment to economic development. With regard to road construction in lagging regions in particular, the impact appears to have become negative under a program of ramped up efforts. The results resonate with the theoretical literature on the inverse U- shaped relationship between infrastructure investment and growth which posits a crowding-out effect of private capital when infrastructure investment becomes too dominant.

At the same time, various government policies favor large cities. We conjecture that larger cities in China offer a better quality of life and more opportunities. We thus predict that a typical rural-urban migrant is willing to give up some income in order to live in a larger city. We present a simple model in which rural-urban migrants choose destination cities to maximize utilities from consumption and urban amenities. Drawing data from a large-scale population survey conducted in 2005, we first estimate each migrant's expected earnings in each possible destination city using a semi-parametric method to correct for potential selection bias. We then estimate the typical migrant's preference for city population size, instrumenting population size with its lagged values to control for potential omitted-variables bias. From these estimation results, we calculate the typical migrant's willingness to pay to live in larger cities. Our results show that indeed rural-urban migrants strongly prefer cities with larger populations. We explore possible explanations for this preference and discuss the implications of these findings.

Furthermore, since the residential sector in industrialised countries requires around one third of the end-use electricity, it is important for policy makers to estimate the scope for electricity saving in households to reduce electricity consumption by using appropriate steering mechanisms. We estimate the level of technical efficiency in the use of electricity using data from a Swiss household survey. We find an average inefficiency in electricity use by Swiss households of around 20 to 25%. Bottom-up economic-engineering models estimate the potential in Switzerland to be around 15%. In this paper we use a sub-vector input distance frontier function based on economic foundations. Our estimates lie at the upper end of the electricity saving potential estimated by the afore-mentioned economic-engineering approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We assume that the utilitarian government, which aims at redistributing lifetime utility across dynasties, has a single policy instrument, a stationary income tax schedule function of current income.

Internationalization variables are represented by outward and inward foreign direct investment, and by imports and exports; innovation is proxied with triadic patent applications. We take account of the influence of absorptive capacity-in both a linear and non-linear form-in the relationship between internationalization and innovation. Our results suggest that outward FDI is positively associated with patenting. Countries with high absorptive capacity benefit more, though there are diminishing returns. We find there is a negative association between inward FDI and patenting in countries with low absorptive capacity where FDI may displace local infant activities and stun further development of related local knowledge. We find support for the view that the innovation performance of countries with low absorptive capacity benefits from imports as well as from exports.","[Frenz, Marion] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Filippetti, Andrea; Frenz, Marion; Ietto-Gillies, Grazia] Birkbeck Univ London, Ctr Innovat Management Res, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Filippetti, Andrea] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Reg Studies, Rome, Italy; [Filippetti, Andrea] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England; [Ietto-Gillies, Grazia] London South Bank Univ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London; University of London; Birkbeck University London; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; London South Bank University,"Frenz, M (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.;Frenz, M (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Ctr Innovat Management Res, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",m.frenz@bbk.ac.uk,,"FILIPPETTI, ANDREA/0000-0002-1182-852X","Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship under the EC Grant [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IEF-298167-REGIO_SPIN, PIEF-GA-2011-298167]",Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship under the EC Grant(European Union (EU)),"This research has been partially carried out within a Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship project FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IEF-298167-REGIO_SPIN, under the EC Grant Agreement No: PIEF-GA-2011-298167.",,84,46,49,6,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Buyers are searching for high-quality drugs, but they determine drugs' quality (i.e., their purity) only after consuming them. Hence, sellers can rip off first-time buyers or can offer-higher-quality drugs to induce buyers to purchase from them again. In equilibrium, a distribution of qualities persists. The estimated model implies that if drugs were legalized, in which case purity could be regulated and hence observable, the average purity of drugs would increase by approximately 20 percent and the dispersion would decrease by approximately 80 percent. Moreover, increasing penalties may raise the purity and affordability of the drugs traded by increasing sellers' relative profitability of targeting loyal buyers versus first-time buyers.","[Galenianos, Manolis] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England; [Gavazza, Alessandro] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Galenianos, M (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, Egham TW20 0EX, Surrey, England.",manolis.galenianos@gmail.com; a.gavazza@lse.ac.uk,"Gavazza, Alessandro/AAC-3188-2022","Gavazza, Alessandro/0000-0001-9236-5813",ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,35,16,24,21,87,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Evidence from post-secondary education reform. Spatial Economic Analysis. This paper examines the causal impact of the level of education on within-country migration. To account for biases resulting from selection into post-secondary education, it uses a large-scale reform within the higher education system that gradually transformed former vocational colleges into polytechnics in Finland in the 1990s. This reform created quasi-exogenous variation in the supply of higher education over time and across regions. The results based on multinomial treatment effects models and population register data show that, overall, polytechnic graduates have a significantly higher probability of migrating than vocational college graduates, although the estimates vary, for example, by gender, field of study and region.","[Haapanen, Mika] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Bockerman, Petri] Turku Sch Econ & Business Adm, Labour Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Bockerman, Petri] IZA, Helsinki, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla; University of Turku,"Haapanen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",mika.p.haapanen@jyu.fi,"Haapanen, Mika/M-6646-2019; Böckerman, Petri/M-4969-2013","Haapanen, Mika/0000-0003-2964-3352; Böckerman, Petri/0000-0002-5372-2985","Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation [6621]; Academy of Finland [293120, 303552]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [303552, 293120] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA),"This study was supported by the Yrjo Jahnsson Foundation [grant number 6621] and the Academy of Finland SRC projects 'Work, Inequality and Public Policy' [grant number 293120] and 'Beyond MALPE Coordination: Integrative Envisioning' [grant number 303552].",,46,14,15,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

In particular, it investigates the reasons why freelancers have established cooperatives and what conditions are required for freelancer cooperatives to increase their work. A review of the extant literature on the manner in which freelancers have to organize, as well as case studies regarding freelancer cooperatives, shows that freelancer cooperatives have emerged in order to reduce members' job uncertainty and to reduce time variance of projects assigned to a freelancer. Based on an analysis of freelancers' organizational characteristics relative to entrepreneur cooperatives and worker cooperatives, we propose that the freelancer cooperatives are a hybrid between entrepreneur cooperatives and worker cooperatives. This paper also proposes the conditions required for development of freelancer cooperatives and suggests how those are distinguished from traditional entrepreneur cooperatives.","[Jang, Jongick] Hanshin Univ, Osan, South Korea",Hanshin University,"Jang, J (通讯作者)，Hanshin Univ, Osan, South Korea.",jijang5@hs.ac.kr,,,Hanshin University,Hanshin University,I would like to thank the anonymous referees and participants at the 5th EMES International Research Conference on Social Enterprise in Helsinki for very helpful discussions and comments.

We use a new data set on output, inputs, and total factor productivity for the US states to study this question. Unlike previous cross-country research that tries to disentangle the channels through which financial development impacts growth, we use a plausibly exogenous measure of financial development: the timing of banking deregulation across states during the period 1970-2000. At the same time our new data set allows us to go beyond what was previously done in the state banking deregulation literature and identify whether finance impacts states' input accumulation or TFP growth. We find, in line with existing cross-country studies, that deregulation boosts growth by accelerating both TFP growth and the accumulation of physical capital without having any impact on human capital. In contrast to the cross-country studies, we also find that the effects of deregulation are largely independent of states' initial level of development; both rich and poor states grow faster after deregulation. Additionally, since our data set breaks down aggregate output into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and the remaining industries, we are able to show that deregulation accelerates the growth of productivity in manufacturing. This last finding answers an important critique of the banking deregulation studies which asserts that observed growth effects may be coming from the growth of financial industry itself and not from the beneficial effect of finance on other industries, such as manufacturing.","[Jerzmanowski, Micha] Clemson Univ, John Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Jerzmanowski, Micha] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Clemson University; Clemson University,"Jerzmanowski, M (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, 222 Sirrine Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",mjerzma@clemson.edu,,,,,,,35,26,28,4,48,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Assume that the talent's distribution of workers is the uniform distribution.

We provide a rationale for the relationship between cognitive ability and honesty and discuss its generalizability.","[Ruffle, Bradley J.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Tobol, Yossef] Jerusalem Coll Technol, Sch Management, IL-91160 Jerusalem, Israel; [Tobol, Yossef] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Wilfrid Laurier University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Ruffle, BJ (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",bradleyruffle@gmail.com,"Ruffle, Bradley/ITT-0251-2023","Ruffle, Bradley/0000-0002-7122-9414; Tobol, Yossef/0000-0003-3307-6397",,,,,35,20,20,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

In this paper, we show in a two-sector growth model, that regulatory price distortion can negatively affect the economy, and then, based on the model, we empirically estimate the impact of the price distortion on output growth in China, using monthly, time series data from 2005M1 to 2012M12. In contrast to the usual argument for regulatory control to mitigate price volatility, we find that regulatory price distortion negatively affects output growth in China during both the short and long term, because it is robust to different measures of output and price distortion. Hence, the argument that using price regulation to protect economic growth is undermined, and subsequently, this study lends its support to energy price deregulation. A market oriented energy price regime may improve the resilience of the domestic economy to global oil price shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The manufacturing employment share has been almost stagnant in Latin America, but exhibits a hump-shaped pattern in Korea and Taiwan. Both groups have moved increasingly toward service-based economies. A nine sector general equilibrium model, treating sectoral productivity growth rates as exogenous, accounts for some of the differing sectoral allocations of employment in Latin America and East Asia over the sample period. I perform a series of experiments, replacing the sectoral labor productivity growth rates in each sector for each Latin American country with the corresponding growth rates in Korea and Taiwan. Low aggregate productivity growth in Latin America is an economy-wide phenomenon concerning all sectors; however, the findings highlight the possible importance of raising productivity in manufacturing and wholesale to have significant increases in aggregate productivity growth rates. I focus attention on the importance of the level of disaggregation in examining the relationship between labor productivity growth and sectoral movement of labor. Some evidence is presented in linking sectoral policies to productivity growth in Latin America and East Asia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The recent books The World the Game Theorists Made by Paul Erickson and How Reason Almost Lost Its Mind: The Strange Career of Cold War Rationality by Paul Erickson, Judy Klein, Lorraine Daston, Rebecca Lemov, Thomas Sturm, and Michael Gordin raise a number of complex historical questions about the interconnections among game theory, utility theory, decision theory, optimization theory, information theory, and theories of rational choice. Moreover, the contingencies of time, place, and person call into question the usefulness of economists' linear narratives about the autonomous and progressive development of modern economics.

Meanwhile, foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country continued to increase in the 2000s. Thus, this paper examines the location choice of multinational and local firms in Vietnam. We adopt the mixed logit model to conduct an empirical analysis of the possible interaction of neighbouring regions and attracting FDI. Using firm-level data for the period 2000-2005, the results show that most provincial characteristics exert similar influences on foreign and domestic entrants, except for wage rates, which exhibit an opposing effect. The agglomeration of FDI entices foreign and domestic firms to locate in the same region, whereas the agglomeration of local firms is less relevant to the location choice of all firms. The spatial interdependence effect of attracting investment is particularly relevant to local entrants. Provinces with more foreign (domestic) firms reveal a complementary (competition) effect on the attractiveness of their neighbouring provinces.","[Yang, Chih-Hai; Chiu, Chung-Yueh; Tsou, Meng-Wen] Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan",National Central University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",,,,Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 102-2410-H-008-005-MY3],Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology,We are grateful to two anonymous referees for helpful suggestions and comments.

What is the impact of the future IEA on current emissions after its announcement? We show that the answer to this question is ambiguous. We examine four types of IEAs that aim to reduce pollution stock in the environment. IEA type 1 sets a level of emissions, IEA type 2 and IEA type 3 set a percentage and a uniform cut vis-a-vis the business-as-usual policy respectively. IEA type 4 sets the policy that maximizes future joint benefits of the signatories. We show that all of these agreements reach their goal in the long run, but the intended benefits of these IEAs can potentially be offset by the anticipatory non-cooperative response of the signatories, leading to an environmental degradation in the short run. Which IRA is preferable depends on the targeted level emissions during the phase of cooperation. When this target is above a certain threshold, welfare under IEA type 1 is larger than under IEA type 2 which is larger than under IEA type 3. Moreover, the highest level of welfare that can be attained under IEA type 1 is above the highest level of welfare achieved by any one of the other three IEAs.","[Acikgoz, Omer T.] Yeshiva Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10033 USA; [Benchekroun, Hassan] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Benchekroun, Hassan] McGill Univ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Yeshiva University; McGill University; McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Benchekroun, H (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Benchekroun, H (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",acikgoz@yu.edu; hassan.benchekroun@mcgill.ca,,"Benchekroun, Hassan/0000-0001-9929-2397",Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC),Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC)(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC)),"We thank the Associate Editor, Peter Berck, three anonymous referees, Michele Breton, Robert Cairns, Bard Harstad, Ngo Van Long and Cees Withagen for helpful comments.

The extended framework also makes the contribution of natural capital to economic growth explicit. This can be useful for countries relying on non-renewable resources to better understand the need to develop other sources of growth-human or productive capital-to prepare for times of scarcer resource endowments.

We also show that existing empirical evidence is consistent with our theoretical predictions.","[Chen, Yan] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Chen, Yan] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kesten, Onur] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Tsinghua University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,"Chen, Yan/0000-0003-1287-4525","National Science Foundation [SES-0720943, 0962492]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0962492] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Susan Athey, Dirk Bergemann, Caterina Calsamiglia, Yeon-Koo Che, Isa Hafalir, Rustam Hakimov, Fuhito Kojima, Scott Kominers, Nancy Kotzian, Erin Krupka, Morimitsu Kurino, John Ledyard, Keji Mei, Antonio Miralles, Herve Moulin, Parag Pathak, Jim Peck, Paul Resnick, Al Roth, Rahul Sami, Tayfun Sanmez, Xiang Sun, Guofu Tan, Utku Unver, and Xiaohan Zhong; seminar participants at Arizona, Autonoma de Barcelona, Bilkent, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Florida State, Kadir Has, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Microsoft Research, Rice, Rochester, Sabanci, Shanghai Jiao Tong, Tsinghua, University of California, Los Angeles, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of Southern California, University of Texas, Dallas, Vanderbilt, Research Unit on Complexity and Economics Lisbon meetings (2010), the 2011 Auction Markets and Their Applications, Decentralization, Eurasia Business and Economics Society, Stony Brook, Berlin Social Science Centre, and National Bureau of Economic Research Market Design Working Group meeting for helpful discussions and comments; and Ming Jiang, Malvika Deshmukh, Tyler Fisher, Robert Ketcham, Tracy Liu, Kai Ou, and Ben Spulber for excellent research assistance.

We argue that these costs are not easily discernable in the new Keynesian (NK) model, which defines a theoretical framework for monetary policy. First, the costs may result from the effects of unconventional monetary policy measures on the intensity of restructuring and the persistence of uncertainty ( which increased after the outbreak of the crisis). However, neither of these processes is considered in the new Keynesian model. Second, costs may be generated not only by distortions in the choices made by economic agents but may also be a result of the decisions made by governments, particularly in terms of the fiscal deficit level. However, the new Keynesian model does not consider the effects of unconventional monetary policy measures on the quality of fiscal policy. Without carefully considering the costs, there is a significant risk that unconventional monetary policy measures could become a conventional response to recurrent crises.","[Cizkowicz, Piotr; Rzoncaz, Andrzej] Warsaw Sch Econ, Aleja Niepodleglosci 162, PL-00001 Warsaw, Poland; [Rzoncaz, Andrzej] Monetary Policy Council, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Cizkowicz, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Aleja Niepodleglosci 162, PL-00001 Warsaw, Poland.",pcizko@sgh.waw.pl; andrzej.rzonca@nbp.pl,,,,,,,83,2,2,2,3,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The spillover effects of the oil market on a firm are segregated into firm specific and market wide information. First, our results report a higher level of synchronicity by dynamic conditional correlations than by R square since the former better captures dynamic linear dependence. Second, we find strong evidence of size effect. In particular, stock price synchronicity is generally higher in large cap firms than in small cap ones. Oil shocks affect synchronicity in the upper quantiles differently based on firm size. Third, we also find that synchronicity responds to oil shocks significantly in extreme low quantiles, implying that shocks in the oil market are transmitted to Chinese oil firms via firm specific information. Finally, we determine that oil shocks have little or no immediate impact on stock price synchronicity; instead, cumulative lagged effect is evident. This evidence highlights the lagging effect of spillover of oil shocks on Chinese oil firms.","[Peng, Cheng; Zhu, Huiming; Jia, Xianghua] Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [You, Wanhai] Fuzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Fuzhou, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Fuzhou University,"Zhu, HM (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zhuhuiming@hnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71521061, 71671062, 71431008]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Our deepest gratitude goes to the editor (Prof. Sushanta Mallick), the associate editor and anonymous reviewers for their careful work and constructive suggestions that have helped improve this paper substantially.

Finally, there is evidence that business cycle dissimilitudes have been decreasing with time, consistent with the previous findings coupled with the idea that information and communications technology make distances smaller.","[Brinca, Pedro] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Brinca, Pedro] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal; [Aguiar-Conraria, Luis; Soares, Maria Joana] Univ Minho, NIPE, P-4704553 Braga, Portugal; [Aguiar-Conraria, Luis] Dept Econ, P-4704553 Braga, Portugal; [Gudjonsson, Haukur Vidar] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Soares, Maria Joana] Dept Matemat & Aplicacoes, P-4704553 Braga, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Minho; Stockholm University,"Brinca, P (通讯作者)，Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.;Brinca, P (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, Oporto, Portugal.",pedro.brinca@novasbe.pt,"Soares, Maria Rosa Nunes/J-6779-2013; Soares, Maria/JGM-5854-2023; Brinca, Pedro/ABA-2488-2020; Aguiar-Conraria, Luis/M-2936-2019","Aguiar-Conraria, Luis/0000-0001-6822-7103; Soares, Maria Joana/0000-0003-3943-1900; Brinca, Pedro/0000-0002-3399-6081","FEDER funds through Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade - COMPETE; Portuguese national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-037268 (PEst-C/EGE/UI3182/2013)]; Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation [SFRH/BPD/99758/2014, UID/ECO/00124/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-C/EGE/UI3182/2013, UID/ECO/00124/2013] Funding Source: FCT",FEDER funds through Programa Operacional Factores de Competitividade - COMPETE; Portuguese national funds through FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank Annika Alexius, seminar attendants at Stockholm University, Nova SBE, CEF.UP, the editor and anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Much coordination game data might be explained by team reasoning, a departure from individualistic choice theory. However, a less exotic explanation is also available based on best-responding to uniform randomisation. We test these two accounts experimentally, using novel games which distinguish their predictions. The results are inconsistent with best-responding to randomisation but consistent with team reasoning as the modal behaviour, though there is also unexplained heterogeneity. Increasing the difficulty of the coordination tasks produces some behaviour suggestive of response to randomisation, but this is a minor feature of the data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of the anchoring and adjustment heuristic has been confirmed in the Slovak cultural environment. The magnitude of the anchoring effect is not affected by previous experience with the product. However, the effect is higher when the anchors are relevant.

This papermakes the income distribution endogenous by supposing that aspirational parents can socialize children into having aspirational preferences which are modelled as a reference point in income space. The model looks at the endogenous determination of the level of income, income inequality and income redistribution where the proportion of aspirational individuals evolves endogenously according to pay-offs along the equilibrium path. The paper discusses implications of the model for intergenerational mobility. It also shows how the income generation process is critical for the dynamics and welfare conclusions.

We define two subperiods, the estimation and forecast windows, for each IT product that are separated by the product release date.

We compare the forecast performance of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) plus generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) and quasi-ARMA (QARMA) plus Beta-t-EGARCH (exponential- GARCH). QARMA plus Beta-t-EGARCH belongs to the family of dynamic conditional score (DCS) models. We find that the in-sample statistical performance of DCS is superior to that of ARMA plus GARCH for most of the IT stocks. We also find that the out-of-sample density predictive performance of ARMA plus GARCH is never significantly superior to that of DCS. However, the predictive performance of DCS significantly dominates that of ARMA plus GARCH for several IT products.

Households take into account the overall lifetime uninsured consumption risk when optimizing their resources, which based on micro data varies across households. Thus, representing households' consumption by merging cross-sectional micro data into the single Euler equation (the common approach for estimating risk aversion based on consumption-based asset pricing theory) may be too rough an approximation, leading to biased results with respect to risk aversion. Our results suggest that consumption-based asset pricing models that were rejected in several studies do in fact fit the data when we account for households' lifetime consumption risk.

Methods: The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental policy which promotes the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy through tax policy, using a general equilibrium model. Results: Results show that the efficacy of an environmental policy depends on the elasticity of substitution existing in the economy. Conclusions: It is crucial to invest in research and in the development of technology that promotes technological change and fosters greater use of renewable energy, particularly in the most polluting productive sectors in Mexico. It also shows that it is necessary to accelerate energy transition, using clean energy sources as part of the policies and strategies to mitigate greenhouse gases.","[Castro Ramirez, Juan Carlos] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gutierrez Andrade, Miguel Angel] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Dept Ingn Elect, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Omana Pulido, Elsa Patricia] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Dept Matemat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Ramírez, JCC (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",jcdesprof@gmail.com; gamma@xanum.uam.mx; eop@xanum.uam.mx,,,,,,,23,1,1,1,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Because sports activity is likely to be misreported and correlated with unobserved determinants of health, we use the number of sports facilities within 6 miles of the individual's residence as an instrument for sports activity. Although the instrument is powerful in explaining sports activity, the second-stage effects on health are mostly statistically insignificant due to the high SEs of the IV estimates.","[Brechot, Marc; Franck, Egon] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Nueesch, Stephan] Univ Munster, Georgskommende 26, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Munster,"Nüesch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Georgskommende 26, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",nueesch@wwu.de,,,,,,,45,7,7,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We investigated whether CSR influences corporate value and whether the extent of that influence varies with corporate value or time. The results indicate that the influence of CSR on corporate value does not change with time. CSR exerts a positive influence on company value, and this influence does not change over time. However, the extent of the influence significantly varies with corporate value. When the corporate value of a company is not high, investing in CSR would only increase costs and fail to effectively increase corporate value. In contrast, if the corporate value of the company is high, investments in CSR in this circumstance would instead promote the effective increase of corporate value.","[Chen, Roger C.

We show that the results previously documented in the literature for Australia are spurious due to failure to establish the stationarity property of the price series, and the co-integration relationship between retail and wholesale prices when neglecting to account for a regime shift in the data. Using a robust approach involving a threshold error correction model, we find little evidence to support the contention that retail petrol price reverts asymmetrically to long-run equilibrium. Asymmetric adjustments in retail prices are found only in four of the twenty-eight retail gas stations in Queensland. These results cast doubt on the previously reported pervasiveness of this asymmetric price response phenomenon in Australia. We further caution on erroneous inference with the use of weekly rather than daily data, and when failing to account for a regime shift in the data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The second feature was, and still is, the reallocation of labor from manufacturing to the service sector. Data from the Polish Labor Force Survey for the period 1995-2015 were used to construct measures of worker flows, gross and net, and their cyclical properties were used as a way to test the predictions of structural change and transition theories.

We use official statistical data of inbound international tourism demand to Catalonia (Spain) and compare the forecasting accuracy of four processing methods for the input vector of the networks: levels, growth rates, seasonally adjusted levels and seasonally adjusted growth rates. When comparing the forecasting accuracy of the different inputs for each visitor market and for different forecasting horizons, we obtain significantly better forecasts with levels than with growth rates. We also find that seasonally adjusted series significantly improve the forecasting performance of the networks, which hints at the significance of deseasonalizing the time series when using neural networks with forecasting purposes. These results reveal that, when using seasonal data, neural networks performance can be significantly improved by working directly with seasonally adjusted levels.","[Claveria, Oscar] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr & Stat, AQR IREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Monte, Enric] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Signal Theory & Commun, Barcelona, Spain; [Torra, Salvador] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr & Stat, Riskctr IREA, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; University of Barcelona,"Claveria, O (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr & Stat, AQR IREA, Barcelona, Spain.",oclaveria@ub.edu,"Claveria, Oscar/G-6741-2014; Monte, Enrique/F-8218-2013; Torra, Salvador/A-3601-2015","Claveria, Oscar/0000-0001-9740-1852; Monte, Enrique/0000-0002-4907-0494; Torra, Salvador/0000-0002-8786-8800",,,,,48,16,17,0,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The test proposed by Huber and Melly to test the independence between error terms and regressors (conditional on the selection probability) is also considered. This is the first attempt in the migration literature to use quantile regression with sample selection. The data used come from the US American Community Survey. The results show that the hypothesis of conditional independence is not rejected, and increments in earnings associated with the usual socioeconomic characteristics in labour studies vary between the cohorts considered. The main conclusions are that a decline in returns from education may be a sign that a high level of education no longer provides a competitive advantage and that being a black person is associated with substantially lower earnings regardless of the individuals' position in the earnings distribution. This may explain why, historically, comparatively fewer black Cubans have made the decision to emigrate to the USA because of a lack of economic incentives.","[Cobas-Valdes, Aleida; Fernandez-Macho, Javier; Fernandez-Sainz, Ana] Univ Basque Country, Dept Econometr & Stat, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Cobas-Valdés, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Econometr & Stat, Bilbao, Spain.",aleida.cobas@ehu.eus,"Fernandez-Macho, Javier/AAO-2865-2020; Fernandez-Sainz, Ana/AAH-5469-2019","Fernandez-Macho, Javier/0000-0002-5970-4382; Fernandez-Sainz, Ana/0000-0001-6574-2433; Cobas-Valdes, Aleida/0000-0001-8352-726X","UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group (Basque Government Department of Education) [IT-642-13]; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness; FEDER [MTM2016-74931-P, ECO2016-76203-C2-1-P]","UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group (Basque Government Department of Education); Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government)","The authors acknowledge research funding received from UPV/EHU Econometrics Research Group (Basque Government Department of Education grant IT-642-13) and Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and FEDER (grants MTM2016-74931-P and ECO2016-76203-C2-1-P).",,74,0,0,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The first stage of the methodology consists of grouping the companies in similar financial performance classes (e.g.: good, average, poor performance classes). We optimise the allocation of the observations within the performance clusters by applying an enhanced version of an observation re-allocation procedure proposed in our previous work. Next, based on the result of the grouping phase, we construct a performance class variable by attaching a performance label to each data row. Then, in the second phase of our methodology, we propose a feed-forward neural-network classification model that maps the input space to the newly-constructed performance class variable. This model allows us to forecast the performance of new companies as data become available.","[Costea, Adrian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet Stat & Informat Econ, Dept Stat & Econometr, 15-17 Calea Dorobanti St,Ion Angelescu Bldg, Bucharest 010552, Romania; [Costea, Adrian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet Stat & Informat Econ, Data Min Grp Lab, 15-17 Calea Dorobanti St,Ion Angelescu Bldg, Bucharest 010552, Romania; [Ferrara, Massimiliano] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Ctr Res Innovat Org & Strategy, Via Bianchi 2, I-89127 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Ferrara, Massimiliano] Univ Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, Dept Law & Econ, Via Bianchi 2, I-89127 Reggio Di Calabria, Italy; [Serban, Florentin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet Stat & Informat Econ, Dept Appl Math, 15-17 Calea Dorobanti St,Ion Angelescu Bldg, Bucharest 010552, Romania; [Serban, Florentin] Univ Bucharest, Doctoral Sch Math, 14 Acad St,Sect 1, Bucharest 010014, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bocconi University; Universita Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Bucharest,"Costea, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet Stat & Informat Econ, Dept Stat & Econometr, 15-17 Calea Dorobanti St,Ion Angelescu Bldg, Bucharest 010552, Romania.;Costea, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet Stat & Informat Econ, Data Min Grp Lab, 15-17 Calea Dorobanti St,Ion Angelescu Bldg, Bucharest 010552, Romania.",adrian.costea@csie.ase.ro,"Ferrara, Massimiliano/P-8797-2014; Serban, Florentin/C-7105-2012; Costea, Adrian/B-2518-2015","Ferrara, Massimiliano/0000-0002-3663-836X; Costea, Adrian/0000-0002-9968-0469","Supervision Department of the National Bank of Romania; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2905]","Supervision Department of the National Bank of Romania; Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by the Supervision Department of the National Bank of Romania which kindly provided the periodic financial statements of the analysed non-banking financial institutions under its confidentiality agreement policy.

To augment the literature on income convergence, the robust conceptual framework employed here is based upon Terry Jordan's much broader socioeconomic and political definition of Europe. Using associated variables, the study applies the Kohonen data visualization technique to highlight statistical clustering and movement of countries across three time periods from 2001 to 2013. Kohonen U-matrix and component maps reveal several distinct clusters of countries that remain stable over time, including Europe's industrialized core and Scandinavia, as well as a cluster of laggard Soviet successor states at the opposite extreme. The eleven new EU countries that had been part of the eastern bloc show evidence of real (beta-) convergence toward the European core, but at various paces. The Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia experience some of the greatest observable convergence, followed by Estonia, the Visegrad states, and the former Yugoslav states of Croatia and Slovenia. Other countries that demonstrate considerable movement during the time period under investigation include some crisis-battered Mediterranean countries, plus Montenegro, Kosovo, and Turkey. While most of the evident statistical mobility is positive, Ireland experiences nominal and real divergence during the period 2011-13. In the context of Europe's ongoing recession and the aftermath of the UK's referendum, these findings have implications for two uncertainties: the very survival of the EU and its prospects for further expansion.","[Deichmann, Joel I.] Bentley Univ, Global Studies, Waltham, MA USA; [Eshghi, Abdolreza] Bentley Univ, Mkt, Waltham, MA USA; [Haughton, Dominique; Li, Mingfei] Bentley Univ, Math, Waltham, MA USA; [Haughton, Dominique] Univ Toulouse 1, Univ Paris 01, Paris, France",Bentley University; Bentley University; Bentley University; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole,"Deichmann, JI (通讯作者)，Bentley Univ, 175 Forest St, Waltham, MA 02452 USA.",jdeichmann@bentley.edu,/AAB-1905-2021,,,,,,36,9,9,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

To overcome the difficulty of two different policy rates, two indices, the PDI and the MDI are utilized to capture the response of the monetary authority within a nonlinear Taylor rule context. The empirical findings for the Turkish economy with MS-VAR and MS-Granger causality analyses suggest that while the policy interest rates are determined in the spirit of the Taylor rule, the monetary policy involuntarily affirms inflation after the application of the policy, a finding that is consistent with the FTPL theory. As a result, as the central bank tries to establish price stability and financial stability with two policy interest rates, accepting higher inflation rates could be unavoidable.

First, suppliers' efficiencies are obtained through applying DEA. Then, the suppliers' related data are utilized to train GEP to find the best trained DEA-GEP algorithm for predicting efficiency score of Decision Making Units (DMUs). The aforementioned data is also used to train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict efficiency scores of DMUs. The proposed hybrid DEA-GEP is compared to integrated approach of Artificial Neural Network with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA-ANN) to support the validity of the proposed model. The obtained results clearly show that the model based on GEP not only is more accurate than the DEA-ANN model, but also presents a mathematical function for efficiency score based on input and output data set.

It further assesses the extent to which targeting central banks are less responsive to financial imbalances, compared to those implementing alternative policy strategies. Based on a sample of 26 emerging countries, including 13 targeters, the analysis suggests that monetary policy in targeting countries is relatively more sensitive to financial risks. However, despite stronger central banks' responses to financial imbalances, the financial sector appears to be more fragile for targeters. Our conclusion therefore challenges the view that central banks, through their policy interest rates, can guarantee the stability of the financial system. It rather suggests that the control of inflation should remain the primary monetary policy objective, while a (macro)prudential authority would be in charge of the financial stability objective.

We show that desirable properties for the measurement of imbalance are the inclination to any increase in downside risk in the context of closed leagues, and the aversion to any increase in outer risk in the context of open leagues.","[Gayant, Jean-Pascal] Univ Mans, GAINS, Ave Olivier Messiaen, F-72085 Le Mans 9, France; [Le Pape, Nicolas] Univ Caen, CREM, Campus 1,Batiment A, F-14032 Caen 5, France",Le Mans Universite; Universite de Caen Normandie,"Gayant, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Mans, GAINS, Ave Olivier Messiaen, F-72085 Le Mans 9, France.",jpgayant@univ-lemans.fr; nicolas.lepape@unicaen.fr,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,0,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

As this micro-level perspective is rarely studied, we analyze both the micro and macro levels by examining the effects of the entrepreneurs' individual intention to innovate and public financing. Additionally, we include the meso level, representing entrepreneurs' network. Entrepreneurs are embedded in social spheres in which they capture resources and identify opportunities. But not all entrepreneurs are equally well supported, and some tend to be completely isolated. We thus focus on multilevel factors explaining new product or service launching in new ventures. Drawing on data of 48,251 French new ventures, we reveal that innovation intention and public financing positively impact new ventures' product and service innovation launching, while entrepreneurs' isolation has a negative effect. We also highlight two interaction effects that enhance the multilevel effects of innovation antecedents.","[Geraudel, Mickael] Univ Luxembourg, CREA, 162a,Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Gast, Johanna; Gundolf, Katherine] Montpellier Business Sch MRM Labex Entreprendre, Montpellier, France; [Gast, Johanna] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business, Lappeenranta, Finland",University of Luxembourg; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Géraudel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Luxembourg, CREA, 162a,Ave Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",mickael.geraudel@uni.lu,"Gundolf, Katherine/IYJ-8956-2023","Gundolf, Katherine/0000-0001-5473-4606",French National Research Agency through program 'Investments for the Future' [ANR-10-LabX-11-01],French National Research Agency through program 'Investments for the Future'(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This research received financial support from the French National Research Agency through the program 'Investments for the Future' under reference number ANR-10-LabX-11-01.,,99,1,3,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

To do so, one specific event - a referendum on migration policy with an unexpected outcome - that will potentially cut off Swiss listed companies from the supply of foreign labour is studied. Although operating in an industry with a high share of immigrants is associated with lower returns, the effect is not very strong, which indicates that investors seem to trust the government to leave some leeway in the implementation of the constitutional amendment that was voted on.","[Hanke, Philip C.] Univ Bern, Inst Publ Law, NCCR Move Migrat Mobil Nexus, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Hanke, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Publ Law, NCCR Move Migrat Mobil Nexus, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland.",philip@hanke.com,,"Hanke, Philip Cosmo/0000-0003-3405-7438",Swiss National Science Foundation; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung.,,6,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Further, because they apparently were not aware that financial markets by themselves could not equalize interest rates across countries, they did not properly appreciate that the exchange rate is strongly influenced by agents' expectations of aggregated differences in local returns. Thus, we believe that the same underlying explanation provided by Ford (2015) and Ford and Horioka (2016a, 2016b) for the Feldstein-Horioka (1980) Puzzle and the PPP Puzzle - namely that financial markets alone cannot achieve net transfers of financial capital and cannot equalize real interest rates across countries - also helps explain why previous attempts to connect changes in the exchange rate to economic fundamentals have not been successful and so can also be said to contribute to solving the Exchange Rate Disconnect Puzzle.","[Horioka, Charles Yuji] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kitakyushu, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Osaka, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ford, Nicholas] Univ Cambridge, Wolfson Coll, Cambridge, England",Osaka University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Cambridge,"Horioka, CY (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",horioka@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Horioka, Charles Yuji/AFE-9181-2022",,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H01950]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H01950].,,13,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We show that tunnelling significantly reduced in both POEs and SOEs after the SSSR. More importantly, we find a significant and positive privatization effect' on SOEs' tunnelling activities during the post-reform period suggesting the reductions of tunnelling were smaller among SOEs than POEs following the SSSR. In contrast, excess returns around the SSSR indicate that investors expected a negative privatization effect' on SOEs' tunnelling. These findings suggest that the quality of corporate governance did not improve among SOEs as a result of the secondary privatization as the stock market expected without fundamental changes to firm ownership and control following the SSSR.

The CETA, as a modern agreement on international trade, modifies not only the international trade tariff barriers, but primarily the non-tariff barriers (NTBs), whose quantification is relatively complicated. With the exception of some agricultural products, CETA eliminates customs tariffs on all goods and also diminishes technical barriers to trade, especially double testing in selected groups of industrial goods. The Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model was selected as an impact estimation tool. The Global Trade Analysis (GTAP) database was used for the impact quantification purposes. The applied model's discussion and its calibration for the purposes of quantification of the CETA's impacts are included in this article. The results represent the quantified changes in the area of both the tariff and non-tariff trade barriers between the EU, or Czech Republic, and Canada.

All the more so, in the above-mentioned tax reform, the method of taxation of agricultural enterprises depends on the size of agricultural enterprises.","[Konopska-Strus, Emilia] Univ Wroclaw, Fac Law & Econ, Dept Financial Management, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Konopska-Strus, E (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Pl Uniwersytecki 1, PL-50137 Wroclaw, Poland.",konopska.emilia@gmail.com,,"Konopska-Strus, Emilia/0000-0002-1767-8542",,,,,3,0,0,0,0,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-5233-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,988,992,,,,,,5,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0QL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000492966900136,0

To explore this impact we base our research on Structure-Conduct-Performance paradigm (SCP) where structure (analyzed through domestic product acceptance and market structure) drives conduct (strategic choices regarding A/S of brand management elements), which in turn drives performance (viewed through market share and costs). Our results indicate that A/S is not equally applicable to all elements of brand management strategy. Rather, domestic products acceptance in a foreign market and market structure have different effects on the level of A/S of brand's product, pricing, distribution and promotion strategies. While market structure complexity increases the importance of adaptation of all elements, greater domestic product acceptance allows for product and promotion strategies to remain standardized. Subsequently, A/S of each element of the brand strategy differently influences brand market share in a foreign market and brand management costs. As a result, we learn that adaptation of pricing and promotion strategies will drive brand's market share. However, adaptation of promotion strategy will also increase brand management costs, while distribution strategy adaptation, although having no effect on brand's market share, will have an impact on the decrease of brand management costs.","[Krupka, Zoran; Ozretic-Dosen, Durdana; Previsic, Jozo] Univ Zagreb, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Krupka, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, JF Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",zkupka@efzg.hr; dozretic@efzg.hr; jprevisic@efzg.hr,"Krupka, Zoran/I-2290-2018","Krupka, Zoran/0000-0003-2896-7531",,,,,75,2,3,2,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The market analytics call this segment of the free market as LOHAS - Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability, where the consumers are relatively upscale and well-educated people, which are seeking for ecological and healthy products. But it still works on the principles of the free market economics, which are against some of yoga principles such a non-possessiveness or contentment.

Using the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies survey data, it shows that Japanese adults perform better than Korean respondents, on average, on skill proficiency tests. A decomposition analysis shows that the score gap in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving skills between the two countries is mostly due to different returns to individual characteristics such as upper-secondary and tertiary education. Adult skills have a positive and significant impact on individual earnings and employment probability, in both countries. In Japan, the returns to literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills increase significantly with experience, and tend to fall with formal education, suggesting employer learning or human capital accumulation through career progression. In contrast, in Korea, the returns to literacy and numeracy skills do not seem to increase with experience.","[Lee, Jong-Wha] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Wie, Dainn] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan",Korea University; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",jongwha@korea.ac.kr,"WIE, DAINN/AAY-9460-2021; Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016","Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961",Korea University [K1508441],Korea University,"The authors are grateful to Daiji Kawaguchi, Seik Kim, and Marcus Noland for helpful comments and Eunbi Song for research assistance.

According to this scheme, the state offers a job to everyone who is willing to work. In response to the many critiques the ELR program has received, we show that it is the best alternative to eliminating unemployment, instituting sound public finance, ensuring social and financial stability, and achieving long-term growth and international economic balances. We also make suggestions with a view of ensuring the efficiency of the ELR institutional design. In this context, we highlight the accountability issue that is largely ignored in the relevant literature, but that is paramount given the state of public finances after the 2008 crisis. We argue that accountability and efficiency should be taken as the core of the ELR project if it is to be politically viable, and they can be addressed alongside the analogy of lending of last resort. In particular, ELR projects should be supervised by a state bank that is set up to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the scheme, along with controls from below. We conduct a simulation of how much such an ELR program would cost for Italy, showing that its gross cost would be less than 2.0 percent of Italian GDP and its net cost would be negative.","[Mastromatteo, Giuseppe] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy; [Esposito, Lorenzo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Monetary Eecon, Milan, Italy; [Esposito, Lorenzo] Bank Italy, Financial Supervis, Rome, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Mastromatteo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy.",,,,,,,,68,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, studies on Middle-East economies are limited. Moreover, many existing studies test for Granger causality in a bi-variate setting which in turn leads to conflicting causality results. The goal of this study is to investigate the causal interaction between stock prices and exchange rates empirically in Iran, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia from January 2004 to December 2011. Among four Middle-East economies, we find that stock prices and exchange rates have bi-directional causality in Iran, Oman and Saudi Arabia, but the variables do not interact in Kuwait. Additionally, the recursive causality tests reveal that these relationships are stable over the analysis period. Therefore, stock prices and exchange rates affect each other at least in Iran, Oman and Saudi Arabia.","[Parsva, Parham] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Econ, Tehran, Iran; [Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town, Malaysia",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town, Malaysia.",tcfoon@usm.my,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011; Parsva, Parham/AAO-5738-2020","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222;",,,,,35,3,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The results of investigation enable to state that the level of trust of Russian citizens largely depends upon peculiar actions of the state aimed at keeping stability and social order. The execution of social obligations by the state, including pension savings sphere, is a specific indicator of retaining control by the state over the system and actions of its actors. This kind of control enables rising citizens trust level to the state, which performs function of conceptual foresight in crisis instability thereby providing adequate stability level of citizens' social wellbeing. If interaction rules keep on changing, this dramatically will decrease the citizens' level of trust to the actors in the system of retirement savings.","[Radchenko, Tatiana; Voronina, Lyudmila] UFU, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Radchenko, T (通讯作者)，UFU, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",t.radchenko@mail.ru; voronina_612@outlook.com,"Voronina, Lyudmila Ivanovna/HOC-9794-2023","Voronina, Lyudmila Ivanovna/0000-0002-2538-5627","Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0006]; administration of the Institute of Public Management and Entrepreneurship, UrFU","Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation; administration of the Institute of Public Management and Entrepreneurship, UrFU","The authors are grateful to the colleagues from the center of social technologies Optima for help and assistance in writing of the article.

I examine this hypothesis using micro data from rural India. Employing an identification strategy based on instrumental variables, I find robust evidence that visible inequality has a negative and significant impact on household conspicuous consumption. Further, my results indicate that the increase in conspicuous expenditure in response to a fall in visible inequality is diverted from education spending which is perceived to have positive social externalities. This suggests that traditional redistributive policies that seek to reduce the level of economic inequality, by encouraging 'wasteful' spending of households, might have adverse welfare consequences.","[Roychowdhury, Punarjit] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Umphrey Lee Ctr, 3300 Dyer St,Suite 301, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Roychowdhury, P (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Umphrey Lee Ctr, 3300 Dyer St,Suite 301, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",proychowdhur@smu.edu,,"Roychowdhury, Punarjit/0000-0002-3623-9334",,,,,51,21,24,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This is done by way of a cross-country comparative exercise that analyses micro-level survey data on household income, debt, and working conditions. Notwithstanding some differences across the countries, living conditions have worsened after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) for a substantial number of households, as reflected in respondents' reports of declining household income, recourse to debt to cover living expenses and deteriorated employment relations. As the finance-work nexus has been more detrimental to low-income and non-standard workers in Germany and Poland, the article concludes that the impacts of financialisation on well-being cannot be simply inferred from the sizes of national financial systems or the extent of household engagement with finance, nor from extant welfare regime typologies. To better account for these impacts one also needs to consider the more intermediate effects of finance on well-being through labour market segmentation.","[Santos, Ana C.; Lopes, Claudia A.] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal; [Lopes, Claudia A.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Betzelt, Sigrid] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Berlin, Germany",Universidade de Coimbra; University of Cambridge; Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Santos, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Ctr Social Studies, Coimbra, Portugal.",anacsantos@ces.uc.pt; cimdal2@cam.ac.uk; sigrid.betzelt@hwr-berlin.de,"Lopes, Claudia Abreu/AAF-5816-2019","Lopes, Claudia Abreu/0000-0002-2645-0224; Santos, Ana Cordeiro/0000-0002-3654-2544",,,,,33,3,3,1,7,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The paper explains the current capital outflows by comparing China and Japan with respect to the impact of exchange rate expectations on speculative capital flows. It is argued that both in China and Japan, given benign liquidity conditions in the USA, policy-induced appreciation expectations have generated capital inflows that have contributed to overinvestment and financial market bubbles. The current reversal of capital flows is seen as a signal that the bubble in China has burst. To stabilize growth in China and to discourage speculative capital outflows a fixed exchange rate to the dollar is recommended. Given Japan's experience and given that China's foreign assets remain high, the depreciation pressure on the Chinese renminbi can be expected to abate.","[Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Schnabl, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Leipzig, Germany.",schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2017,25.0,1,,,,,32,57,,10.1111/cwe.12185,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EK3QC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393839900003,0

Convergence accelerations are characterized by nominal exchange rate and unit labour cost changes, while slowdowns are followed by investment shocks. The importance of external trade is particularly emphasized during convergence accelerations.

Second, the effect of the firm information environment on corporate leverage is attenuated in countries with stronger governance mechanism and better information transparency.

Our survey indicated that residents in this region were highly concerned about PM2.5 pollution control and supported PM2.5 pollution control policies. In this study, a payment card (PC) format is used to elicit residents' perceived WTP. With a two-part model, we estimate the mean WTP for an 80% reduction of severe PM2.5 polluting days in this region is 602 CNY a year, approximately accounts for 1% of the GDP per capita. This result indicates an important funding source for the government to control PM2.5 pollution in the region. In the econometric analysis, the mean WTP is found to significantly relate with income, expense, age and education level. It decreases with income, age and educational level, but increases with expense, and it is higher for females, people who have children, own cars and apartments but lower for those having larger families. By comparing with relevant researches, this letter indicates a strong and ever-increasing WTP for air pollution control among residents in the Jing-Jin-Ji region, China.","[Wei, Weixian; Wu, Yan] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Wei, WX (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wxwei@uibe.edu.cn,,"WEI, Weixian/0000-0002-9722-4777",,,,,23,25,25,0,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The optimal level of IPR protection depends on the technological capability of the host country. In less developed countries, IPRs should be just strong enough to induce FDI since international technology spillovers are the dominant source of technological development. A stronger level of IPR protection is instead recommended for more advanced emerging economies as a tool to exploit the potential of their domestic innovators.

A panel cointegration analysis and an impulse response function are conducted with multi-country panel data, over two time periods, 1998-2011 and 1993-2007. In addition, to extend a comparative analysis over different economies, BRICS (i.e. Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and G7 (i.e. the US, Japan, Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Canada) countries are selected as representatives of emerging economies and developed countries, respectively. The empirical results show that military spending enhances social welfare expenditures in developed countries, while the effect is ambiguous in emerging economies. Also, military spending is capable of promoting the social welfare index based on the FMOLS estimation. The comparative analyses indicate that unlike in the G7, the effect of the growth of military spending on the growth of social welfare expenditures is negative and shorter in the BRICS.","[Zhang, Ying; Liu, Xiaoxing; Xu, Jiaxin; Wang, Rui] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Peking University,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yingzhang@seu.edu.cn,"Xu, Jiaxin/GPS-4486-2022","Xu, Jiaxin/0000-0003-3297-7118",National Social Science Foundation of China [15CGL045]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473036]; Ministry of Education of Jiangsu Province [2014SJD013]; Social Science Research Grant of Southeast University [2242015S22005]; European Commission,National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of Jiangsu Province; Social Science Research Grant of Southeast University; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This work was financially supported by National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 15CGL045], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71473036], Ministry of Education of Jiangsu Province [grant number 2014SJD013], Social Science Research Grant of Southeast University [grant number 2242015S22005] and European Commission.",,53,16,18,3,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The new method uses quantization and volatility information together with feedforward neural networks for achieving high-frequency trading (HFT). The proposed procedures are based on estimating the Forward Conditional Probability Distribution (FCPD) of the quantized return values. From past samples, the conditional expected value can be learned, from which FCPD can be obtained by using a special encoding scheme. Based on this estimation, a trading signal is triggered if the probability of price change becomes significant as measured by a quadratic criterion. Due to the encoding scheme and quantization, the complexity of learning and estimation has been reduced for HFT. Extensive numerical analysis has been performed on financial time series and the new method has proven to be profitable on mid-prices.

We focus on the contribution of real exchange rate shocks to macroeconomic volatility in selected Central and Eastern European countries. The contribution of real exchange rate shocks relative to other shocks allows us to evaluate whether the real exchange rate is a source of volatility or a buffer against shocks, as the theory suggests. The identification of the contributions is based on variance decomposition in two-country structural VAR models, which are identified by the sign restriction method. For most of the countries in the sample, shocks are predominantly symmetric relative to their effective counterpart, although the role of non-symmetric shocks is non-negligible. In general, for all the countries considered except Bulgaria and Slovenia, the real exchange rate does not generate large volatility over the business cycle and, with the exception of Bulgaria and Romania, is mostly driven by the non-symmetric shocks. These results are consistent with the real exchange rate having a shock-absorbing nature.","[Audzei, Volha; Brazdik, Frantisek] Czech Natl Bank, Na Prikope 28, Prague 11503, Czech Republic; [Audzei, Volha] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech National Bank; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Audzei, V (通讯作者)，Czech Natl Bank, Na Prikope 28, Prague 11503, Czech Republic.",vaudzei@cerge-ei.cz,"Audzei, Volha/H-2867-2014",,GDN [RRC14 + 56],GDN,"This research was supported by GDN under grant number RRC14 + 56.

We find that both peer and parental socialization efforts have a positive influence over adolescents' academic skills, and that these effects are complementary: as parents invest more, peers amplify their effects. Our results suggest that peer effects are heterogenous (boys, popular students and high achievers are more likely to be influenced by peers academic abilities).

Using self-reported individual micro-level data from the World Values Survey for seven developing countries (China, Ecuador, Egypt, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and Yemen), our cross-country regressions and principal component analysis reveal that socio-demographic characteristics of individuals are strong predictors of their informal sector employment. Our estimations further document that individual preferences for an economically strong, interventionist and egalitarian state and confidence in state and political institutions are positively and significantly correlated with informal sector employment, whereas variables associated with confidence in free market institutions and support for competition are negatively and significantly correlated with informal sector employment. We also show that individuals who participate either actively or inactively in peaceful and lawful political processes are significantly less likely to work in the informal sector. Finally, we document that individual norms, such as religiosity and tax morale, are negatively correlated with informal sector employment. Throughout our analysis, instead of having to rely on ad-hoc informality categorizations of third parties, we base our measurement of informal sector employment directly on the self-evaluation of individuals, who have the best information on the degree of their informality.","[Basbay, Mustafa Metin] Univ Cambridge, Ctr Dev Studies, Alison Richard Bldg,7 West Rd, Cambridge CB3 9DT, England; [Elgin, Ceyhun; Torul, Orhan] Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Natuk Birkan Bldg, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",University of Cambridge; Bogazici University,"Torul, O (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Econ, Natuk Birkan Bldg, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",mustafametinb@gmail.com; ceyhun.elgin@boun.edu.tr; orhan.torul@boun.edu.tr,"Torul, Orhan/P-9322-2015; Torul, Orhan/GOK-1840-2022; Başbay, Mustafa Metin/N-4202-2014; Elgin, Ceyhun/D-3123-2014","Torul, Orhan/0000-0002-1251-1022; Torul, Orhan/0000-0002-1251-1022; Elgin, Ceyhun/0000-0001-8796-2429; Basbay, Mustafa Metin/0000-0002-2776-8592","Bogazici University Research Fund [BAP 9081, 13920]",Bogazici University Research Fund(Bogazici University),"We would like to thank Murat Guray Kirdar, Gokhan Ozertan and the rest of the faculty at the Department of Economics, Bogazici University, as well as the participants of the 5th All-Istanbul Workshop 2015 for their valuable comments and contributions.

We show in this paper that pension dispersion is very similar for men and women within the French pension system of a given sector (public or private). Gender differences are less marked among retired civil servants than among former private sector employees. However, the determinants of these inequalities are not the same for men and women. Using a regression-based decomposition of the Gini coefficient, we find that pension dispersion is mostly due to dispersion of the reference wage for all retirees but gender differences exist. For women, in particular, pension dispersion is also due to the dispersion in contribution periods. We also decompose the Gini coefficient by source of pension to measure the impact of institutional rules (minimum pensions, survivor's pension) on the extent of pension inequality. Unexpectedly, we find that the impact of minimum pensions is limited, although slightly larger for civil servants than for private-sector employees. Survivor's pension schemes, on the other hand, contribute positively to pension dispersion among retired women.","[Bonnet, Carole; Meurs, Dominique; Rapoport, Benoit] INED, 133 Blvd Davout, F-75020 Paris, France; [Meurs, Dominique] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre, Econ, 200 Ave Repub, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Rapoport, Benoit] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ, CNRS, Sorbonne UMR,Maison Sci Econ, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bonnet, C (通讯作者)，INED, 133 Blvd Davout, F-75020 Paris, France.",carole.bonnet@ined.fr; dominique.meurs@ined.fr; benoit.rapoport@univ-paris1.fr,,,Unsa Education; IRES,Unsa Education; IRES,Financial support from Unsa Education along with IRES is gratefully acknowledged.

The neo-Schumpeterian revival has marginalized this theoretical element, in favor of an interpretation focused primarily on technological aspects of innovation. Recent attempts by innovation scholars to re-integrate the missing financial elements have been hindered by this theoretical gap. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the recovery of the finance/innovation nexus in the context of Schumpeter's theory by proposing an original institutional interpretation of the relationship between finance and the entrepreneurial function. The new approach identifies the economic role of innovation as dependent on the contextual form taken by the related funding process. Application of these concepts to the U.S. trustified capitalism experience allows for an alternative interpretation linking corporate internalization of innovation and financial repression. A Schumpeterian trilemma involving monetary capitalism, financial autonomy of the corporate sector and financial stability is revealed. The proposed framework provides a flexible theoretical background for the development of our understanding of the current capitalist regime, open to further integration with other schools of economic thought.","[Callegari, Beniamino] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Nydalsveien 37, N-0484 Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Callegari, B (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Nydalsveien 37, N-0484 Oslo, Norway.",beniamino.callegari@bi.no,,,,,,,73,8,10,1,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This is surprising given the considerable growth in financial innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years and its potential implications for developing country macroeconomic policy. This paper investigates the development of financial innovation and its impact on money demand in the region using panel data estimation techniques for 34 countries between 1980 and 2013. The results indicate that there is a negative relationship between financial innovation and money demand. This implies that financial innovation plays a crucial role in explaining money demand in Sub-Saharan Africa and given innovations such as mobile money in the region this can have important implications for future policy design.","[Kasekende, Elizabeth] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Dunne, John Paul] Bank Uganda, Econ Res Dept, Kampala, Uganda",University of Cape Town,"Kasekende, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa.",lizkasekende@gmail.com,"Dunne, John Paul/K-9455-2019","Dunne, John Paul/0000-0001-6150-7663",,,,,54,17,18,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Our theoretical framework suggests that inheritance rules shape filial obligations to parents, and thus the within-family intergenerational transmission of resources. In countries with egalitarian inheritance rules, inheriting children represent a large share of the population, and support generous pension systems; in countries with nonegalitarian inheritance rules, a majority of noninheriting individuals prefer basic pension systems. An empirical cross-country analyses using historical data on inheritance rules support these predictions. These results are robust to controlling for alternative legal, religious, demographic, economic, and political explanations. Evidence from individual (General Social Survey) data confirms our findings: US citizens whose ancestors came from countries featuring egalitarian inheritance rules rely more on the government as a provider of old age security income.","[Galasso, Vincenzo] Bocconi Univ, Dondena, IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Profeta, Paola] Bocconi Univ, Dondena, Milan, Italy; [Galasso, Vincenzo] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Galasso, Vincenzo; Profeta, Paola] CESIfo, Munich, Germany",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Ifo Institut,"Galasso, V (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dondena, IGIER, Milan, Italy.",vincenzo.galasso@unibocconi.it; paola.profeta@unibocconi.it,"Galasso, Vincenzo/AFP-4222-2022","Galasso, Vincenzo/0000-0002-3882-0587","NETSPAR; Progetto MIUR-PRIN [2010T8XAXB_008, 2015FMRE5X]",NETSPAR; Progetto MIUR-PRIN,"We thank Filippo Mezzanotti, Massimo Pulejo and Michel Serafinelli for excellent research assistance.

The distinction between these two risk components is more readily identified in the Japanese context than in the well-studied US context because municipal bonds in Japan are not subject to preferential tax treatment as they are in the US. Daily data are used to analyze spreads for the bonds of three prefectures (Tokyo, Aichi, and Osaka) during periods that capture the Yubari crisis of 2006 and the global financial crisis of 2008 (sample periods extending from 2005 to 2014). Kalman filter methods of estimation are used. We find that contrary to popular opinion, the widening of spreads during the Yubari crisis was not due to an increase in the default premium but rather to a lack of market liquidity. By contrast, the much greater widening of spreads during the global financial crisis can be traced to a sharp increase in the default premium. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This result emerges in a heterogeneous firms model with endogenous markups based on Melitz & Ottaviano (2008). Our framework features imperfect pass-through of corporate taxes into prices and partial deductibility of production costs. Corporate taxes reduce mark-ups and hence pre-tax profits, especially for high cost firms. As production costs are only partially deductible, low productivity firms are relatively more responsive to tax policy than high productivity firms. We further show that shocks which affect mark-ups through the toughness of competition, such as trade liberalization, reinforce the heterogeneity in effective tax rates across firms.

For the case study, we select six OECD countries (USA, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and South Korea) and six indicators (gross domestic expenditure for research and development (GERD), number of researchers, gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, GDP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI) and total factor productivity (TFP)). The time series of the transmission power over a 10-year period (2001-2010) are built on the basis of publication data collected from the Web of Science. The correlation between transmission power and the selected indicators is computed. Results show that Japan and South Korea exhibit a positive strong correlation between transmission power and GERD on one hand and transmission power and number of researchers on the other hand. These two countries have the same pattern as regarding the transmission power and each of the selected indicators; other countries do not show any comparable pattern. The study concludes that the transmission power computed at national level only is not sufficient to measure the extent to which an economy is knowledge-based, because it does not take into account the synergy contributed at international level by a nation innovation actor.","[Megnigbeto, Eustache] Bur Etud & Rech Sci Informat, 09 BP 477 St Michel, Cotonou, Benin; [Megnigbeto, Eustache] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Venusstr 35, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Mêgnigbêto, E (通讯作者)，Bur Etud & Rech Sci Informat, 09 BP 477 St Michel, Cotonou, Benin.;Mêgnigbêto, E (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Venusstr 35, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",eustachem@gmail.com,"Megnigbeto, Eustache/A-3210-2009","Megnigbeto, Eustache/0000-0003-2687-3726",,,,,48,9,10,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

We show that these emissions reductions are primarily driven by within-product changes in emissions intensity rather than changes in output or in the composition of products produced. We then develop and estimate a quantitative model linking trade with the environment to better understand the economic forces driving these changes. Our estimates suggest that the implicit pollution tax that manufacturers face doubled between 1990 and 2008. These changes in environmental regulation, rather than changes in productivity and trade, account for most of the emissions reductions.","[Shapiro, Joseph S.; Walker, Reed] Univ Calif Berkeley, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shapiro, Joseph S.; Walker, Reed] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Shapiro, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, 207 Giannini Hall 3310, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Shapiro, JS (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",joseph.shapiro@berkeley.edu; rwalker@berkeley.edu,,,NSF [SES-1530494]; Department of Energy; Sloan Foundation; National Bureau of Economic Research on the Economics of Energy Markets; Yale MacMillan Center; Yale Program on Applied Economics and Policy Research; Weyerhaeuser Research Grant from the Yale Center for Business and the Environment; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; UC Office of the President through the University of California Center for Energy and Environmental Economics,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

The experiment comprises three games. In the first one, the only equilibrium strategy is not to trust, and not to reciprocate. In the second we exogenously introduce a sanctioning rule that imposes on untrustworthy second-movers a penalty proportional to the number of those who reciprocate trust. This generates a second equilibrium where everybody trusts and reciprocates. In the third game, the collective punishment mechanism is adopted through majority-voting. In line with the theory, we find that the exogenous introduction of the punishment mechanism significantly increases trustworthiness, and to a lesser extent also trust. However, in the third game the majority of subjects vote against it: subjects seem to be unable to endogenously adopt an institution which, when exogenously imposed, proves to be efficiency enhancing.","[Sun, Huojun; Bigoni, Maria] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Bigoni, Maria] IZA Inst Lab Econ, Bonn, Germany",University of Bologna; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bigoni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",maria.bigoni@unibo.it,"Bigoni, Maria/R-4995-2019","Bigoni, Maria/0000-0001-5988-6115",Law and Economics Research Center of Zhejiang University [RG201310004]; Italian Ministry of Education [RBFR084L83],Law and Economics Research Center of Zhejiang University; Italian Ministry of Education,"We thank Stefania Bortolotti, Marco Casari, Davide Dragone, Diego Gambetta and Paolo Vanin for insightful comments.

From 1937 to December 1941, the country was engaged in a land war of attrition in China. This war requested an immense amount of resources and was associated with armaments procurement strategy with emphasis in the army. However, the Japanese strategic vision assumed that the state was strong enough to engage in one land war against China and in a naval war in the Pacific simultaneously. The basis of Japanese strategy was a utopia. Making things worse, the naval war in the Pacific was conducted against the most industrialized powers in the world [the US and the British Empire (Britain, Australia, India, etc.)]. Finally, the internal Japanese industrial mobilization was associated with immense errors in armaments production (absence of economies of scale and scope, limited raw materials, etc.). Under these circumstances, the defeat was an expected outcome.","[Salavrakos, Ioannis-Dionysios] Univ Athens, Dept Turkish & Modern Asian Studies, Athens, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Salavrakos, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Turkish & Modern Asian Studies, Athens, Greece.",isalavra@turkmas.uoa.gr,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This paper analyzes the effectiveness of public grants and tax credits used to promote long-run R&D investment. Cointegration techniques have been used to deal with the existence of common trends, which might lead to spurious correlation. In this context, we propose a new empirical strategy applying DOLS and FMOLS estimators to the cointegrated firms and the LSDV estimator to non-cointegrated firms. Cointegrated firms are those that invest persistently in R&D while non-cointegrated firms invest in a non-continuous or occasional way. A panel of 237 Spanish manufacturing firms for the 1990-2009 period is used. We find evidence that public grants are more effective for firms where R&D investment is persistent and the quality of projects matters. In addition, our results suggest that a tax credit is suitable for boosting long-run R&D investment as a whole, especially if the base amount of tax credit is incremental. Surprisingly, incremental tax credit is only in force in a few countries such as Italy, Korea, Mexico, Portugal, United States and Spain.","[Alvarez-Ayuso, Inmaculada C.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Kao, Chihwa] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT USA; [Romero-Jordan, Desiderio] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Mostoles, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Connecticut; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Alvarez-Ayuso, IC (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, C Francisco Tomas y Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",inmaculada.alvarez@uam.es,"romero-jordán, desiderio/AAZ-2424-2020; ALVAREZ AYUSO, INMACULADA/K-5808-2014","romero-jordán, desiderio/0000-0002-5699-5364; ALVAREZ AYUSO, INMACULADA/0000-0003-0495-623X",Government of the Principality of Asturias; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),Government of the Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"We are grateful to participants at the 61st annual North American meetings of the Regional Science Association in Washington D.C.

We find that after 2009, the decrease in the shadow federal funds rates (monetary easing) decreased the borrowing costs of firms with unstable earnings and dividend payments (i.e., firms with a low quality rating) that pay a high premium when borrowing. Conversely, the loose monetary policy stance after 2009 increased the borrowing costs of firms (of high and low quality) that usually pay a lower premium when borrowing. Before 2008, these relationships are reversed: while firms that can usually obtain cheap external funding benefit from a monetary easing, firms with more expensive funding are adversely affected by this policy. Our results uncover distortional effects of monetary policy. Loose monetary policy causes borrowing costs to converge (diverge) across firms after 2009 (before 2008).","[Aysun, Uluc] Univ Cent Florida, UCF Coll Business Adm, 4000 Cent Florida Blvd,POB 161400, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Jeon, Kiyoung] Bank Korea, Res Dept, 39 Namdaemun Ro, Seoul 04531, South Korea; [Kabukcuoglu, Zeynep] Villanova Univ, Villanova Sch Business, Dept Econ, 1007 Bartley Hall,800 E Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Bank of Korea; Villanova University,"Aysun, U (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Florida, UCF Coll Business Adm, 4000 Cent Florida Blvd,POB 161400, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",uaysun@bus.ucf.edu; kyjeon@bok.or.kr; zeynep.kabukcuoglu@villanova.edu,"Yom, Zeynep/AAE-5014-2020","Yom, Zeynep/0000-0001-7715-7944; Aysun, Uluc/0000-0002-3136-2915",,,,,52,3,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, there is relatively little evidence on the long-run educational and labor market consequences of childhood peers. We examine this question by linking administrative data on elementary school students to subsequent test scores, college attendance and completion, and earnings. To distinguish the effect of peers from confounding factors, we exploit the population variation in the proportion of children from families linked to domestic violence, who have been shown to disrupt contemporaneous behavior and learning. Results show that exposure to a disruptive peer in classes of 25 during elementary school reduces earnings at age 24 to 28 by 3 percent. We estimate that differential exposure to children linked to domestic violence explains 5 percent of the rich-poor earnings gap in our data, and that each year of exposure to a disruptive peer reduces the present discounted value of classmates' future earnings by $80,000.","[Carrell, Scott E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carrell, Scott E.; Hoekstra, Mark; Kuka, Elira] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hoekstra, Mark] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 3087 Allen Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kuka, Elira] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, 3300 Dyer St, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Southern Methodist University,"Carrell, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Carrell, SE (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",secarrell@ucdavis.edu; markhoekstra@tamu.edu; ekuka@smu.edu,,"Hoekstra, Mark/0000-0002-1515-4219",UC Davis Center for Poverty Research,UC Davis Center for Poverty Research,"Carrell: Department of Economics, University of California-Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, and NBER (email: secarrell@ucdavis.edu); Hoekstra: Department of Economics, Texas A&M University, 3087 Allen Building, College Station, TX 77843, and NBER (email: markhoekstra@tamu.edu); Kuka: Department of Economics, Southern Methodist University, 3300 Dyer Street, Dallas, TX 75275, and NBER (email: ekuka@smu.edu).This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Marianne Bertrand, Coeditor.

The spatial regression discontinuity design controls for continuous local agglomeration externalities, so we attribute an important role to capital formation in explaining persistent spatial patterns of economic activity. This persistence is driven by higher local public investment levels, which local governments could maintain after the end of the program because of a persistently higher tax base. We also find evidence for significant local relocation of economic activity, which raises doubts that the net effect of the policy is positive.

On average, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 25% for nondurables and services within one quarter of the payments. The MPC is heterogeneous, monotonically increasing with income, and the average is largely driven by high-income households with substantial amounts of liquid assets, who have MPCs above 50%. The account-level data and the properties of the payments rule out most previous explanations of excess sensitivity, including buffer stock models and rational inattention. How big are these mistakes? Using a sufficient statistics approach, I show that the welfare loss from excess sensitivity depends on the MPC and the relative payment size as a fraction of income. Since the lump-sum payments do not depend on income, the two statistics are negatively correlated such that the welfare losses are similar across households and small (less than 0.1% of wealth), despite the large MPCs.","[Kueng, Lorenz] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Kueng, Lorenz] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kueng, L (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Kueng, L (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Kueng, Lorenz/IWE-5373-2023","Kueng, Lorenz/0000-0002-2743-922X",,,,,56,70,88,3,72,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The results suggest that most SR investors rebalance their portfolios slightly more often than conventional investors do, hold potentially more diversified portfolios, and hold a mixed portfolio combining both conventional and SR funds. Further, while SR investors' buying decisions are similarly sensitive to the past returns on SR and conventional funds, SR investors' selling decisions are more sensitive to the past negative returns on SR than on conventional funds, which indicates that they are less likely to sell SR than conventional funds as past negative returns decrease. Moreover, the aggregated flows of SR and conventional funds are similarly sensitive to past returns. However, the aggregated flows of SR funds for which the majority of their investors are sticky SR investors are less sensitive to past positive returns. Finally, sticky SR investors' flows (at the individual level) are more sensitive to the past positive returns and are less sensitive to the past negative returns on SR than on conventional funds. Although these results suggest that sticky SR investors do have values-driven motives for holding SR funds, their flows to SR funds are less persistent than their flows to conventional funds, which indicates that these investors are less likely to reinvest in SR than in conventional funds.

We consider a finite population of loss-averse agents who are repeatedly and randomly matched to play a symmetric two-player normal form game. When an agent revises her strategy, she compares the payoff from each strategy to a reference point. Under the resulting dynamics, called prospect dynamics, risk-dominance is no longer sufficient to guarantee stochastic stability in 2 x 2 coordination games. We propose a stronger concept, loss-dominance: a strategy is loss-dominant if it is risk dominant and a maximin strategy. In 2 x 2 coordination games, the state where all agents play the loss-dominant strategy is uniquely stochastically stable under prospect dynamics for any degree of loss-aversion and all types of reference points. For symmetric two-player normal form games, a generalized concept, generalized loss-dominance, gives a sufficient condition for stochastic stability under prospect dynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We develop an analytical model of two-stage production processes that can be distributed between two countries and investigate unilateral emission pricing and its supplementation with border carbon taxes. In contrast to existing final good models, we are able to show how impacts of regulation differ across the different stages of the supply chain, depending on the interplay of comparative advantages and general equilibrium effects. To get a more comprehensive picture, we subsequently apply a computable general equilibrium model that includes a representation of international supply chains. We find heterogeneous but mostly positive effects of a unilateral carbon emission reduction by the European Union on the degree of vertical specialization of European industries. Border taxes are successful in protecting upstream industries, but with negative side effects for downstream industries.","[Schenker, Oliver] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany; [Koesler, Simon] Univ Strathclyde, Int Publ Policy Inst, Ctr Energy Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Loeschel, Andreas] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany; [Loeschel, Andreas] Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, UIBE, Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Oxford, England",Frankfurt School Finance & Management; University of Strathclyde; University of Munster; University of Oxford,"Schenker, O (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany.",o.schenker@fs.de,"Schenker, Oliver/AAX-2286-2021; Löschel, Andreas/AAG-6699-2020","Löschel, Andreas/0000-0002-3366-8053",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Call okonomie des Klimawandels [01LA1105B]; 7th EU-framework project WIOD: World Input-Output Database: Construction and Applications under Theme 8: Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities [225 281],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Call okonomie des Klimawandels; 7th EU-framework project WIOD: World Input-Output Database: Construction and Applications under Theme 8: Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities,"Oliver Schenker gratefully acknowledges the support from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the Call okonomie des Klimawandels (funding code 01LA1105B: Climate Policy and the Growth Pattern of Nations (CliPoN)).

Our results are consistent with U.S. findings that boys benefit more from an advantageous family environment than do girls in terms of grade-school outcomes. Father's education, which has not been examined in previous studies, is particularly important for sons. However, we find a very different pattern of parental influence on adult outcomes. Gender gaps in educational attainment, employment, and earnings are increasing in maternal education, benefiting daughters. Paternal education decreases the gender gaps in educational attainment (favoring sons) and labor market outcomes (favoring daughters).

Simulations with an Applied General Equilibrium Model,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,North American Free Trade Agreement; Mexico; CGE modelling,IMPACT,"Background: The performance of Mexico's economic structure, especially in manufacturing sector, is highly dependent on the North American market. The complications in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiation process have created a sense of uncertainty regarding the future of commercial relationship between the partners. In these circumstances, it is essential to evaluate the economic impacts of different trade policy scenarios in Mexico. Methodology: An applied general equilibrium (AGE) model is used as the basis for the estimates. The model uses a Mexico social accounting matrix (slot), valued at market prices (2008), which is the first SAM with this feature that is constructed for Mexico. Results: In the short-term model, tariff variations have a reduced impact on aggregate gross domestic product (GDP), although a greater impact was observed for some export sectors. In the long-term model, besides the variation in tariffs, it is considered a contraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. In this model, the consequences would be greater, both in aggregate GDP, decreasing by 3.5 percent, as a significant contraction of exports and significant sectoral impacts in external market orientation activities. These adverse impacts are stronger when Mexico retaliate with most favored nations (MFN) tariffs on the imports from United States of America (USA). Conclusions: Considering only tariff variations, the eventual cancellation of NAFTA would have moderate economic impacts on the Mexican economy, since the MFN tariff rates, agreed by the WTO (World Trade Organization) members, are, for the most part, small. Unfortunately, an event of this importance could result in a contraction of FDI flows, in which case the impact would be of greater magnitude.","[Davila Flores, Alejandro; Valdes Ibarra, Miriam] Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Ctr Invest Socioecon, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico; [Sobarzo Fimbres, Horacio Enrique] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila; Colegio de Mexico,"Flores, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Ctr Invest Socioecon, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico.",alejandro.davila@uadec.edu.mx; hsobarzo@colmex.mx; miriam.valdes@uadec.edu.mx,,,,,,,27,1,1,3,11,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

During recessions, fears of unemployment stir up precautionary sentiments that induce agents to save more. The additional savings may be used as investments in both a productive asset (equity) and an unproductive nominal liquid asset. The desire to hold the nominal liquid asset puts deflationary pressure on the economy which, provided that nominal wages are sticky, increases labor costs, and reduces firm profits. Lower profits repress the desire to save in equity, which increases (the fear of) unemployment, and so on. This mechanism causes the model to behave differently from its complete markets version and is quantitatively important even if monetary policy counteracts the desire to hold more of the liquid asset by lowering the interest rate. The deflationary pressure yields a mean-reverting reduction in the price level, which implies an increase in expected inflation and a decrease in the expected real interest rate even if the policy rate does not adjust. Thus, our mechanism is different from the typical zero lower bound argument. Due to the deflationary spiral, our model also behaves differently from its incomplete market version without aggregate uncertainty, especially in terms of the impact of unemployment insurance on average employment levels.

We exploit the 1990s trade liberalization in Brazil as a natural experiment generating exogenous shocks to local economies. We document that regions exposed to larger tariff reductions experienced a temporary increase in crime following liberalization. Next, we investigate through what channels the trade-induced economic shocks may have affected crime. We show that the shocks had significant effects on potential determinants of crime, such as labor market conditions, public goods provision, and income inequality. We propose a novel framework exploiting the distinct dynamic responses of these variables to obtain bounds on the effect of labor market conditions on crime.

By making information on program quality accessible to the public, QRIS attempts to alter parental preferences for quality-related attributes and encourage competition between providers. This paper draws on a variety of datasets to empirically characterize the way in which families and providers respond to the enactment of QRIS. Specifically, it exploits the differential timing in states' QRIS roll-out to examine two sets of outcomes: (i) families' child care choices and maternal employment and (ii) the supply and compensation of child care labor. Estimates from difference-in-differences models reveal several noteworthy findings. First, although QRIS induces families to shift from parental to non-parental care, economically disadvantaged families are more likely to use informal care, while their advantaged counterparts are more likely to use formal care. Second, QRIS increases the supply of high-skilled labor, particularly within the center-based sector. Third, all but the most highly-skilled child care workers experience rising compensation levels but also greater turnover. Finally, states that administer a wage compensation program alongside their QRIS experience larger increases in child care supply and compensation as well as lower turnover rates than states operating a QRIS in isolation.","[Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Herbst, Chris M.] Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix,"Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.;Herbst, CM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, IZA, 411N Cent Ave,Suite 420, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",chris.herbst@asu.edu,,,,,,,35,10,15,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,OCT,2018,54.0,,,,,,172,190,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.08.007,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GX2VC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447577200011,0

The Thai military staged nine successful coups during this period, which allows an empirical inquiry in a single-country framework. Regression analyses of the defense budget reveal that successful coups result in large defense budget changes in the two years that follow. Among the three branches of the Thai armed forces, the army has gained the most in terms of budget allocations after coups relative to the navy and air force. This finding is consistent with the observation that the army has been the dominant force in the history of the military in the country. These results imply that coup leaders have made use of acquired executive power to direct more resources to their organizations. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This time period has witnessed important changes in the French labour market and educational system, in particular an important compression of earnings differentials as well as a large expansion in access to secondary and higher education. Using a two-sample instrumental variables approach, I estimate two measures of intergenerational economic persistence: the intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE) and the intergenerational correlation (IGC). Over the period, the IGE exhibits a V-shaped pattern. It falls from a high of value of 0.6 for cohorts born in the 1930s to around 0.4 for those born in the 1950s, but subsequently rises to a level close to that at the beginning of the period. In contrast, the IGC remains relatively stable over the period. This suggests that changes in the IGE are partly driven by transitory responses to changes in cross-sectional inequality rather than long-term changes in the degree of intergenerational persistence.","[Lefranc, Arnaud] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy, France",CY Cergy Paris Universite,"Lefranc, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy, France.",,,"Lefranc, Arnaud/0000-0003-0105-584X",French National Research Agency under the grant TRANSINEQ [ANR-08-JCJC-0098-01]; Labex MME-DII Center of Excellence [ANR11-LBX-0023-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-08-JCJC-0098] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Research Agency under the grant TRANSINEQ(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Labex MME-DII Center of Excellence; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research received financial support from the French National Research Agency under the grant TRANSINEQ (ANR-08-JCJC-0098-01), and from the Labex MME-DII Center of Excellence (grant ANR11-LBX-0023-01).",,57,9,9,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2018,85.0,340,,,,,808,845,,10.1111/ecca.12269,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GS8DK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443937500006,0

Next, through reading the sheets, we provide an international comparative analysis, and show: (1) China's households are still on their early stage of wealth accumulation, and this trend is associated with a changing structure in favour of financial assets. (2) Although being subject to relatively low insolvency and liquidity risks, the sector has experienced, generally contrary to major developed or emerging countries, a climbing leverage cycle since the global financial crisis. These findings imply that China's policymakers should, on the one hand, make further efforts to help households accumulate wealth with an improved structure in terms of liquidity and risk diversification, and on the other hand, need to pay high attention to the increasing household financial stress and the potential risk contagion.","[Li, Cheng] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Econ, Natl Inst Finance & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Li, C (通讯作者)，2 Yuetan Beixiaojie, Beijing 100836, Peoples R China.",licheng@cass.org.cn,,,"Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences","This article is part of the research project Analysis of China's Macroeconomic Situation and Risk Warnings funded by Institute of Economics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.",,45,7,7,4,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Evidence from virtual worlds,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Contest success functions; Military victory; Virtual worlds,CONFLICT; ANARCHY; PERFORMANCE; TRADE; RATIO,"This paper investigates how differences in military spending translate into probability of victory in a conflict. To do so the paper empirically estimates and compares the four main forms of contest success functions - the Tullock, the logit, the difference, and the relative difference form. In order to circumvent measurement issues and endogeneity biases associated with historical battle-related data, we advocate the use of virtual worlds. Data from virtual worlds is an innovative and promising tool in conflict research. It allows conflict analyses based on rich and objective empirical evidence on economic behavior in a warfare context; something which is difficult to achieve in real world settings. Thanks to collaboration with the developer of a virtual world, we are able to construct an original database of 19,229 battles that occurred during January 2011. The results show that the relative difference contest success function as proposed by Bevia and Corch6n (2015) outperforms other existing forms of contest success functions. Thus, the decisive factor to predict the outcome of a battle is the relative difference in forces devoted by rivals. Relative size matters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

On the 50th anniversary of the paper, we argue that there is no 'natural rate of unemployment', and that the relation between inflation and unemployment is not the one assumed by Friedman or neoclassical theory. In Section 2 we present the conventional framework in which the Phillips curve is drawn by neoclassical economists. It emphasizes the exogenous nature of money, as well as the assumption that (a large part of) unemployment has to do with workers' trade-off between paid work and leisure time (in a utility maximization perspective). Section 3 explains that the neoclassical framework is flawed, because money is endogenous and unemployment is not simply an outcome of workers' choices with regard to the observed 'equilibrium' wage level. This section points out that inflation cannot be controlled with an interest-rate policy and that unemployment is the result of a lack of effective demand (hence it is involuntary). Section 4 provides two alternative macroeconomic analyses, one where inflation as well as unemployment are explained by the disorderly working of the banking system and another where conflict in the functional distribution of income within a monetary economy of production dominates. The conclusion offers some policy-oriented remarks as regards contemporary fiscal and monetary policies that a variety of countries have been adopting in their (largely ineffective) attempt to emerge from the crisis that erupted in 2008 at the global level-whose negative consequences still affect a relevant part of the world population.","[Rochon, Louis-Philippe] Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON, Canada; [Rossi, Sergio] Univ Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland",Laurentian University; University of Fribourg,"Rochon, LP (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON, Canada.",,"Rossi, Sergio/AAO-6365-2020",,,,,,35,3,3,2,16,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Using dyadic data from an experiment and a household survey in rural Bangladesh, this study evaluates whether the incentive for risk sharing increases trust between villagers. Incentive for risk sharing in the dyad is characterized by their negative income correlation, large difference in their risk preferences, and large difference in their income volatilities. The empirical results demonstrate supporting evidence for this hypothesis: incentive for risk sharing, particularly negative income correlation, facilitates trust. These findings suggest that the introduction of safety net programmes such as health insurance, which reduce the incentive for risk sharing, may break down trust. This implication could make an important contribution to our understanding of the effect of industrialization on social capital-an effect that has long been discussed.","[Shoji, Masahiro] Seijo Univ, Fac Econ, Setagaya Ku, 6-1-20 Seijo, Tokyo 1578511, Japan",,"Shoji, M (通讯作者)，Seijo Univ, Fac Econ, Setagaya Ku, 6-1-20 Seijo, Tokyo 1578511, Japan.",shoji@seijo.ac.jp,"Masahiro, Shoji/AAB-9339-2020",,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25780172]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780172] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25780172].,,81,7,8,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In this paper, we present an agent based model (and a scalable approximation of it) in a closely related spirit. The central feature of this model is that wealth enables an individual to secure more wealth. Specifically, the important and novel feature of this model is its ability to simultaneously produce both the Pareto distribution observed in empirical data for the top 10% of the population and the exponential distribution observed for the lower 90%. We show that the model produces these distributions of wealth when initialized with an equitable distribution. Then, using historical data, we initialize the model with US wealth shares in 1988 and show that the model tracks wealth share changes from 1988 to 2012. Simulations to 2088 project that the top 0.01% of the population will possess more than 70% of the total wealth in the economy.","[Vallejos, Hunter A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nutaro, James J.; Perumalla, Kalyan S.] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory,"Nutaro, JJ (通讯作者)，Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.",hunterandresvallejos@gmail.com; nutarojj@ornl.gov; perumallaks@ornl.gov,,"Vallejos, Hunter/0000-0003-4008-191X; Perumalla, Kalyan/0000-0002-7458-0832; Nutaro, James/0000-0001-7360-2836",,,,,11,4,6,2,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

This article uses survey experiments to demonstrate that charitable giving can reciprocally crowd out support for government spending. Moreover, this crowding-out effect in public opinion varies by political ideology and by issue. In Study 1, survey respondents who were randomly assigned to read about charitable giving in a particular area were less likely to support additional taxation and government spending in that domain. This result was driven by liberals in the arts domain and moderates and conservatives in the human services domain. Study 2 leveraged data from the Ice Bucket Challenge to replicate this effect among very liberal respondents and show that crowding-out was attenuated when respondents perceived donations to have greater impact.

This paper proposes the concept of regional learning paradigms and trajectories to study how alternative and more advanced learning processes arise in a region, and highlights the evolutionary path-creation strategies enabling a paradigmatic jump. By taking into consideration also learning modes typical of peripheral or declining industrial areas, generally left aside in previous theories, this new conceptual approach allows us to understand how more complex learning and innovation processes can emerge in all types of regions. From these reflections, spontaneous processes or policy recommendations to catch-up in the innovation ladder are highlighted for each type of region.","[Capello, Roberta; Lenzi, Camilla] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm and Construct En, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Lenzi, C (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture Built Environm and Construct En, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",roberta.capello@polimi.it; camilla.lenzi@polimi.it,"Lenzi, Camilla/ABE-4498-2022","Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900; LENZI, CAMILLA/0000-0002-0880-3516",,,,,70,11,11,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This paper contributes to the extensive debate on WTP (Willingness To Pay) elicitation formats by assessing whether the Circular Payment Card (CPC) can reduce anchoring on respondents' previous answers under multiple elicitation questions. This new format uses a visual pie-chart representation without start or end points: respondents spin the circular card in any direction until they find the section that best matches their WTP. We used a CV survey based on two ways of reducing risks associated with flooding, each randomly presented first to half of the respondents, to test the absolute performance of CPC. We presented a second survey on two social insurance schemes for subjects currently uninsured to respondents randomly split into three subgroups. Each group's WTP was elicited using one of three formats: Open-Ended (OE), standard Payment Card (PC) and the new CPC. The two insurance schemes were always proposed in the same order, and we assessed the relative performance of CPC by comparing anchoring across respondents. Our results provide evidence that CPC is likely to reduce anchoring in multiple elicitation questions and that respondents may rely on different heuristic decisions when giving WTP in the OE and in the two PC formats.","[Champonnois, Victor; Chanel, Olivier] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Cent Marseille, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France; [Champonnois, Victor; Chanel, Olivier] Aix Marseille Univ, AMSE, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France; [Makhloufi, Khaled] Aix Marseille Univ, INSERM IRD UMR SESSTIM 912, Fac Med Timone, 27 Bd Jean Moulin, F-13385 Marseille 5, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Chanel, O (通讯作者)，AMSE, 5 Blvd Maurice Bourdet CS50498, F-13205 Marseille 01, France.",victor.champonnois@univ-amu.fr; olivier.chanel@univ-amu.fr; khaled.makhloufi@hotmail.com,"Chanel, Olivier/H-6500-2013","Chanel, Olivier/0000-0002-8221-7558","Investissements d'Avenir French Government program [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02, ANR-11-LABEX-0061]; program Riskemotion [ANR-08-RISKNAT-00701]; program GREEN-Econ [ANR-16-CE03-0005]",Investissements d'Avenir French Government program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); program Riskemotion; program GREEN-Econ,"This research was carried out thanks to the A*MIDEX grant AMSE (ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02) and OT-Med (ANR-11-LABEX-0061) funded by the Investissements d'Avenir French Government program, as well as the programs Riskemotion (ANR-08-RISKNAT-00701) and GREEN-Econ (ANR-16-CE03-0005), all managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

As SARP extends WARP by additionally imposing transitivity on the revealed preference relation, this effectively defines the conditions under which transitivity adds bite to the empirical analysis. For finite data sets, our characterization takes the form of a triangular condition that must hold for all three-element subsets of normalized prices, and which is easy to verify in practice.

The effects of older sibling admission on the probabilities of choosing both the sibling's school and distinct but observably similar schools are large and positive, even when siblings are too far apart in age to attend school together. The evidence is more consistent with information transmission and path dependence channels than cost, convenience, sibling competition, or parental pressure. Sibling-induced changes in stated preferences affect admissions outcomes, including assignment to elite schools. The results imply significant externalities from policies such as affirmative action that alter the distribution of school assignments, as well as providing insight into the role of family networks in decision-making regarding educational investments.","[Dustan, Andrew] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",Vanderbilt University,"Dustan, A (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Econ, 221 Kirkland Hall, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",andrew.dustan@vanderbilt.edu,,"Dustan, Andrew/0000-0002-1357-1406",Institute of Business & Economic Research; Weiss Family Fellowship through the Center for Effective Global Action,Institute of Business & Economic Research; Weiss Family Fellowship through the Center for Effective Global Action,"I thank Alain de Janvry, Elisabeth Sadoulet, Fred Finan, Ben Faber, Jeremy Magruder, and Ted Miguel for helpful comments.

Converse to the existing empirical literature in this area, we apply a panel data analysis to control for endogeneity due to unobserved heterogeneity. We use a dataset with 24 daily observations of day-ahead and intraday prices from 2010 to 2016, and we apply a fixed effects regression under consideration of robust Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. A noteworthy element of the regression model is the simulation-based design of a variable indicating the power generation technology that is price-determining at a certain point in time. In this context, we differentiate between the fuel types coal, gas, and others, to model the nonlinear price behavior for a varying demand. For 2016, we find price dampening effects of both wind and solar power of approximately 0.6 (sic)/MWh per additional GWh of feed-in. Along with the rapidly increasing shares of wind and solar power of the total power generation during the last years, their price dampening effect has declined since 2013, due to a drop in fuel prices. Another finding is that a reduction in forecasting errors on the power generation from wind and solar, and smoothing of the cyclical demand would lead to a decreased price volatility.

It is hard to disentangle the effects of the purchases themselves from new information about economic fundamentals.

We then describe the approaches to estimate the various roles of brands, such as providing information and increasing the utility of consumption.

This article describes a relatively straightforward approach to measuring patent value with aggregate market data and the BLP model. We apply the approach to United States smartphones. The demand estimates and recovered marginal costs produce sensible simulations of equilibria prices and shares from several hypothetical patent infringements. In one simulation, the presence of near field communication on the dominant firm's flagship smartphone results in a 29% increase in profits. This estimate provides a starting point for establishing a reasonable royalty between the patent holder and the dominant firm in a hypothetical negotiation. This simulation also shows that law-abiding firms inside the market may be damaged by the dominant firm's patent infringing behavior. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Hiller, R.

We prove that Markov-perfect insurance contracts preserve standard properties of optimal insurance with private information and are not more restrictive than a long-term contract with one-sided commitment. Markov-perfect contracts imply a determinate asset time-path and a non-degenerate long-run stationary wealth distribution. Quantitatively, we show that Markov-perfect risk-sharing contracts provide sizably more consumption smoothing relative to self-insurance and that the welfare gains from resolving the commitment friction are larger than the gains from resolving the moral hazard friction at low asset levels, while the opposite holds for high asset levels.

Deciding what to wear, watch, read and drive often includes alternatives that allow access for a period of time, as opposed to outright ownership of a good. Consumers may also want both, where access provides a wider variety of offerings than possible with ownership, and ownership provides greater assurance of availability. We propose a mixed discrete/continuous utility model for assessing the economic relationship between mixed decision variables. In application to two studies involving on-line music and videos, we find that commonly used models of choice mischaracterize the economic relationship between access and ownership. We explore the degree to which profit maximizing prices are dependent on correctly assessing whether access through subscription services are substitutes or complements to product ownership.","[Lee, Sanghak] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Kim, Hyowon; Allenby, Greg M.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Kim, Jaehwan; Allenby, Greg M.] Korea Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Korea University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea.",sanghak.lee@asu.edu; kim.6150@osu.edu; jbayes@korea.ac.kr; allenby.1@osu.edu,"Allenby, Greg/AAB-4268-2020","Allenby, Greg/0000-0001-9759-0067; Kim, Hyowon/0000-0002-5748-673X; Lee, Sanghak/0000-0002-5883-5065; Brennan, Jospeh/0000-0003-4759-2720",,,,,15,1,1,0,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Methods: The constructed portfolio consists of four elements from different countries: two government obligations and two bond indexes, aiming to employ international diversification. All the data was collected for the period of 12 years in order to represent the consequences of accrued recessions. Findings & Value added: The past two severe financial crises created a higher demand for stable investments, and more investors are ready to compromise a higher rerun for it. Therefore ; the results of this paper represent a simulation of low-risk hedge thud portfolio construction with the use of highly rated debt instruments.","[Vukovic, Darko B.; Prosin, Victor] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Vukovic, Darko B.] South Ural State Univ, Natl Res Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); South Ural State University,"Vukovic, DB (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, St Petersburg Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Kantemirovskaya 3A, St Petersburg, Russia.",vdarko@hotmail.rs,"Vukovic, Darko B./AGI-2271-2022; Vukovic, Darko B./GQY-5928-2022; Vukovic, Darko B/G-9374-2016","Vukovic, Darko B./0000-0002-1165-489X; Vukovic, Darko B/0000-0002-1165-489X",,,,,39,8,9,0,7,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Our theoretical argument builds on idiosyncratic and common risks aggravating each other. When this is the case, individuals have a greater incentive to mutually insure against idiosyncratic risk when greater common risk makes the worst case scenario of bad realizations of common and idiosyncratic risks more likely. Our empirical analysis exploits common rainfall risk as a source of common county-level agricultural risk in the 19th-century United States. We find that a greater share of the population was organized in religious communities in counties with greater common agricultural risk, holding expected agricultural output constant. The link between rainfall risk and membership in religious communities is stronger among more agricultural counties and counties exposed to greater rainfall risk during the growing season. We also find that among the historically more agricultural counties, more than 1/3 of 19th-century differences in religious membership associated with rainfall risk persist to the turn of the 21st century.

Interestingly, the sign of the correlation between employment and labor productivity has also changed from positive to negative. We develop a calibrated business cycles model in the New Keynesian tradition, featuring a Taylor-type monetary policy rule, and an input-output production structure. This approach fully explains changes in the volatility and comovement among output, employment, and labor productivity, without the need to invoke the good luck hypothesis. By combining efficient monetary policy with the structural change in the economy, we have succeeded in addressing the issue. We find that monetary policy, by itself, is able to account for the bulk of the changes in the data. However, it will be necessary to increase the share of intermediate inputs in gross output over time to ensure a full match with data.","[Batabyal, Sourav] Missouri Western State Univ, Dept Econ Polit Sci & Sociol, 4525 Downs Dr, St Joseph, MO 64507 USA; [Islam, Faridul] Morgan State Univ, Dept Econ, 1700 E Cold Spring Lane, Baltimore, MD 21251 USA; [Khaznaji, Maher] Loyola Univ Maryland, Sellinger Sch Business & Management, 4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA",Morgan State University; Loyola University Maryland,"Batabyal, S (通讯作者)，Missouri Western State Univ, Dept Econ Polit Sci & Sociol, 4525 Downs Dr, St Joseph, MO 64507 USA.",sbatabyal@missouriwestern.edu; faridul.islam@morgan.edu; mmkhaznaji@loyola.edu,"Batabyal, Sourav/AFA-3280-2022","Islam, Faridul/0000-0003-2342-5733",,,,,45,1,1,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

To address this question, we develop a general equilibrium model featuring two skill types, search frictions, wage bargaining, and a welfare state that redistributes income through unemployment benefits and the provision of public goods. Our quantitative analysis suggests that, in all 20 countries studied, immigration attenuates the effects of search frictions. The resulting gains tend to outweigh the welfare costs of redistribution. Immigration has increased native welfare in almost all countries. In two-thirds of countries, both high- and low-skilled natives have benefited from the presence of immigrants, contrary to what models without search frictions or redistribution predict.

It uses an identity-economic model and analyses prescriptions among the different religions to derive testable hypotheses. In the empirical section, the East Asian Social Survey and a generalized Poisson model are used to estimate the effects of different religions on fertility. In line with theoretical predictions, the empirical results suggest that a positive effect of Catholicism on fertility is still present in East Asia. In line with the sparse previous empirical evidence on Buddhism, it seems to have no effect on fertility.","[Bessey, Donata] Yonsei Univ, EastAsia Int Coll, Yonseidae Gil 1, Wonju 220710, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Bessey, D (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, EastAsia Int Coll, Yonseidae Gil 1, Wonju 220710, South Korea.",dbessey@yonsei.ac.kr,,,Yonsei University's New Faculty Research Grant,Yonsei University's New Faculty Research Grant,"I would like to thank Hyun-ok Lee, Kimiko Osawa, James Paradise, Sungho Park, and session participants at the 14th International Convention of the East Asian Economic Association in Bangkok for helpful comments.

We show that the tight link between import intensity and gains from trade that exists in static models breaks down along transition paths in dynamic models. When trade costs are reduced, the need to accumulate factors temporarily shifts spending from consumption to investment. Import intensity may rise or fall along the transition path, depending on the relative import intensity of consumption and investment. Calibrating the model to the US economy, we find that investment is more import intensive than consumption, so that import intensity is falling along the transition path even as consumption is rising. Therefore, while higher import intensity is associated with higher consumption when comparing steady states (as in static models), it is associated with lower consumption along a given transition path. We also consider the case of endogenous firm creation as another form of investment and factor accumulation, and again find a negative relationship between consumption and import intensity along the transition path.","[Brooks, Wyatt J.] Univ Notre Dame, 434 Flanner Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Pujolas, Pau S.] McMaster Univ, 419 Kenneth Taylor Hall,1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S4M4, Canada",University of Notre Dame; McMaster University,"Pujolas, PS (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, 419 Kenneth Taylor Hall,1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8S4M4, Canada.",wbrooks@nd.edu; pujolasp@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,26,10,10,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We consider a countercyclical loan-to-value (LTV) policy that responds to a credit-to-income ratio, and we compare its effectiveness with a permanent tightening of the LTV ratio and a monetary policy rule that responds to credit. To this end, we construct a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with housing market, household debt and collateral constraints, and we estimate it with Canadian data using Bayesian methods. Our study suggests that a countercyclical LTV ratio is a useful policy to reduce spillovers from the housing market into consumption and to lean against housing market boom-bust cycles. It performs better than the permanent tightening of the LTV ratioa policy that has been used in a number of countriesand the monetary policy rule, both in terms of the stabilization of household indebtedness and spillovers into consumption. Monetary policy that leans against the wind is the least desirable due to its large adverse consequences on the real economy.

On considere une politique contre-cyclique pret/valeur (P/V) qui repond a un ratio credit/revenu, et on compare son efficacite avec une contraction permanente du ratio P/V et une politique monetaire qui repond au credit. cette fin, on construit un modele d'equilibre general dynamique stochastique et qui prend en compte le marche de l'habitation, la dette des menages et les contraintes collaterales, et on e ce modele a l'aide de methodes bayesiennes en utilisant des donnees canadiennes.

Our argument rests on the fact that, in an overlapping-generations (OLG) model, changes in government debt cause changes in the real interest rate that redistribute the burden of repayment across generations. We do not rely on the assumption that the equilibrium is dynamically inefficient, and our argument holds in a version of the OLG model where the real interest rate is always positive.

Based on data from a comprehensive survey of more than 2200 citizens, the empirical analysis reveals that the polluter pays rule has by far the highest support compared with the ability-to-pay rule and especially compared with the equal-pay rule, which is widely refused in the sample. Since the distribution of the costs of the German energy transition is largely in line with a polluter-pays rule, its strong support seems to contribute to the high acceptance of the energy transition at all. The main result of our econometric analysis with multivariate binary and ordered probit models is that not only some attitudinal factors like environmental values and political identification, but especially economic self-interest is relevant since (equivalent) energy expenditures have a significantly negative effect on the support of the polluter-pays rule and especially (equivalent) income has a significantly negative effect on the preference for the ability-to-pay rule. These results suggest that the use of distributional arguments for the criticism of energy policy measures is not necessarily value-driven on the basis of real perceptions of distributive justice, but can also be strategically motivated to prevent and combat economically unfavorable measures. Together with the strong general support of the polluter-pays rule, these results suggest that a sharp reorientation of the German energy transition due to distributional arguments is not very useful.

In particular, we examine whether it matters if it is the husband or wife who controls this income transfer. We exploit the introduction of child benefits to families with at least four children. The law assigned the mother as the beneficiary but, when asked who collected the amount, one-third of beneficiary families reported the father as the recipient. We use the propensity score matching approach to assess the issue of possible self-selection of beneficiary families into answering who was the recipient parent and the results favour common support. We apply the difference-in-difference approach and find evidence in favour of a gender bias in the spending of child benefits. On average, after the reform, recipient families' spending on child clothing, food and tobacco was significantly different from that of non-recipient families. Further analysis suggests that recipient families with the mother (father) in control of the amount spent more on child clothing and food (tobacco) relative to non-recipient families. The evidence has implications on the design of welfare programmes to benefit the children.","[Lyssiotou, Panayiota] Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Lyssiotou, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Econ, POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",p.lyssiotou@ucy.ac.cy,,,University of Cyprus,University of Cyprus,"I am very grateful to the Editors-in-Chief, Prof. Ronald B.

Our findings indicate that migrant households exhibit significantly lower consumption levels than comparable urban households. The observed gap is mainly driven by differences in non-food consumption. We also find that the restrictions imposed by the ho khau system contribute significantly to the gap. Moreover, remittances of migrant households to family members in rural regions are responsible for a considerable part of the gap. Finally, we observe that the consumption gap declines with the duration of residence of migrant households in their destination cities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We show that for some policies, such as feed-in tariffs for renewable electricity, detailed representation of renewable resource grades is required to describe the technology more precisely and identify cost-effective policy designs. We demonstrate the hybrid approach for modeling heterogeneity in the quality of natural resource inputs required for renewable energy production in a stylized computable general equilibrium framework. Importantly, compared to the traditional approach, the hybrid approach resolves near-flat or near-vertical sections of the supply curve and improves the precision of policy simulation. We then represent the shape of a resource supply curve based on more detailed data. We show that for the case of onshore wind development in China, a differentiated feed-in tariff design that can only be modeled with the hybrid approach requires less than half of the subsidy budget needed for a uniform feed-in tariff design to achieve the same installation targets.

The inflation of VaR generates an expected loss between the minimum loss and maximum loss and covers extreme returns which exceed VaR models. Furthermore, the relationship between bubbles and realized volatility is modelled and realized volatility is found to have a significant effect on bubbles which increases with the length of the realized volatility period. As a consequence, it is argued that longer periods of realized volatility have a significant influence on the formation of bubbles which in turn increase the crash risk in stock markets.

This paper analyses the economic costs and benefits of imposing a global carbon tax on international bunker emissions by employing a computable general equilibrium model approach. Under the assumption of an emissions reduction of 5% below 2000 levels by 2020, we demonstrate that a global bunker emissions charge, on one hand, reduces trade volume and change trade patterns between countries and regions, while on the other hand, accelerates the adoption of energy-saving technologies and reallocates the supply of international transportation services throughout the world. The net economic impact, though negative on average, is modest compared to the benefits obtained from the emissions reduction. If revenues from a bunker emissions charge are properly distributed among countries and regions, the losses to disadvantaged countries are likely to be offset by the benefits to advantaged countries. This finding provides useful insights for policy-makers: a global bunker emissions charge could, in future, be an economically feasible strategy to reduce the increasing bunker emissions through the implementation requires more political effort and wisdom.

Traditional medicine, which offers an alternative disease model, may undermine learning by strengthening prior beliefs about hygiene. We show that believers in traditional medicine have smaller impacts, suggesting that traditional and modern medical beliefs are substitutes and that traditional medicine may exacerbate the infectious disease burden in this context.","[Bennett, Daniel] Univ Southern Calif, 635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England",University of Southern California; Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Bennett, D (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, 635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",bennettd@usc.edu,"Naqvi, Asjad/AAP-5034-2021; Schmidt, Wolfgang Andreas/W-5599-2019; Schmidt, Wolfgang Andreas/ITT-3506-2023; Naqvi, Asjad/AAE-2793-2019","Schmidt, Wolfgang Andreas/0000-0001-7831-8738; Schmidt, Wolfgang Andreas/0000-0001-7831-8738; Naqvi, Asjad/0000-0002-0986-6009; Schmidt, Wolf-Peter/0000-0001-7449-4152",,,,,84,9,9,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The job offer doubled exposure to industrial work but, since most quit within months, had no impact on employment or income after a year. Applicants largely took industrial work to cope with adverse shocks. This exposure, meanwhile, significantly increased health problems.

Using a between-subject design, half of the subjects are asked to promise to answer the survey questions truthfully to make them commit to truth-telling. We find a statistically significant difference between mean stated well-being between the two samples (with and without a promise). People are consistently found to exaggerate their happiness and for several different aspects of life, without a promise. We then investigate to what extent the differences in stated well-being also affect the inference from regressions models on the determinants of SWB. The effect on the covariates are only weakly statistically significant and only for a few variables, if we compare the samples with and without the promise. Thus, this means that the policy implications based on an SWB study only marginally depends on whether we include a truth-telling question or not.","[Carlsson, Fredrik; Kataria, Mitesh] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Carlsson, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",fredrik.carlsson@economics.gu.se; mitesh.kataria@economics.gu.se,"Carlsson, Fredrik/E-3734-2010","Kataria, Mitesh/0000-0002-5434-3784",Laboratory of Opinion Research at the University of Gothenburg,Laboratory of Opinion Research at the University of Gothenburg,This work was supported by the Laboratory of Opinion Research at the University of Gothenburg.,,41,4,4,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Yet peer monitoring may also involve particular costs, such as the cost of denouncing wrongdoing, that are larger for group members than for the lender. Moreover, in practice, joint-liability credit often involves monitoring by the lender. To investigate the role of external monitoring and explore the nature of the costs associated with internal group monitoring, we conduct a field experiment in joint liability credit groups in Burkina Faso. In the experiment, we randomly increase the intensity of external monitoring in credit groups. We find that external monitoring crowds out monitoring by the group leader, causes loan renewal decisions to be more severe and the handling of individual default to be more state-dependent. In addition, increased external monitoring decreases favoritism towards members of the leader's family. We argue that external monitoring reduces the costs of pointing fingers at moral-hazardous behaviors and of sanctioning. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Increases in the variance of their risky production process cause firms to issue assets with a higher variable payment (equity). Hikes in investors' perceived ambiguity have the opposite effect, and lead to less risk-sharing. Entrepreneurs from capital-scarce countries finance themselves relatively more through debt than equity. They are thus exposed to higher volatility per unit of consumption. The expected returns on capital invested in capital-scarce countries may also be lower. Such results do not hold in the absence of ambiguity, that is, when investors only perceive risk. New facts uncovered from cross-country firm-level data are consistent with our model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We exploit detailed friendship nominations in the US Add Health data, and extend the Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) model to deal with (i) endogenous peer selection, and (ii) unobserved contextual effects, in order to identify heterogeneity in peer effects with respect to personality. The results indicate that peer effects in the uptake of smoking are predominantly affecting individuals who are emotionally unstable. That is, emotionally unstable individuals are more vulnerable to peer pressure.

In a 2006 local council election in Korea, the names of candidates nominated by the same party for a ward appeared on the ballot in alphabetical order (based on the Korean alphabet). As a result, in certain districts, some female candidates were arbitrarily elected, based on their name-order advantage. In the subsequent election, those elected females were more likely to be nominated by the party and to win seats again. However, the accidental exposure to female politicians failed to generate positive spillover for other female candidates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Two symmetric players have either high or low private value. The contest organizer observes players' values ex post, and can commit ex ante to four different symmetric information policies exhaustively: She can fully disclose or conceal the players' types, and she can disclose their types if and only if when both are high or if and only if when both are low. We characterize the unique equilibriums, and completely rank the four policies by various criteria. We find the full concealment policy extracts highest aggregate expected effort, followed by the policy of disclosing types if and only if when both are high. The policy of disclosing types if and only if when both are low induces least aggregate expected effort. Players enjoy highest expected payoffs under the policy of disclosing types if and only if when both are low; the other three policies yield the same expected payoffs to players. In terms of prize allocation efficiency, the full concealment policy is ranked highest and the full disclosure policy is ranked lowest.

I examine whether such buyers can be exploited by sellers through the use of specifically designed pricing structures. Theoretically, I show that a necessary condition for exploitation is consumer naivet about their belief bias, otherwise they infer their biased beliefs from the sellers' actions. My main experimental result establishes that whether exploitation arises depends on how difficult it is for buyers to make such inferences. When sellers can only make take-it-or-leave-it offers, no exploitation arises. If, however, contracts are agreed upon by bilateral bargaining, sellers earn higher profits compared to the case with unbiased beliefs. I present evidence that in the former case buyers anticipate and prevent exploitation. In the latter case, the richer interaction structure makes it harder for buyers to infer the sellers' incentives, leading to exploitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that neglecting LGD may overstate economic performance in Chinese provinces. The eastern region shows better performance in single factor efficiency and total factor efficiency than the non-eastern regions. The western region shows the worst total factor performance. The north-eastern region is the only region that has experienced a decline in total factor performance. The state-dominated, investment-driven development model may help technological progress across Chinese regions but could lead to significant factor misallocation. We argue that biases towards more state-dominated investment and land supply in less productive western, central and north-eastern regions, at the expense of investment and land supply in more productive eastern regions, have contributed to the recent slowdown in economic growth in China. Therefore, further market-oriented reforms in factor markets should be considered in the future.","[Wu, Jianxin; Wang, Bing] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA, Australia",Jinan University; University of Western Australia,"Wu, YR (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Nedlands, WA, Australia.",wjx1115@163.com; yanrui.wu@uwa.edu.au; 13533691199@126.com,"Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459",Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of China [17JZD013],"Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",This work is supported by the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Ministry of Education of China (No. 17JZD013).,,48,20,22,8,67,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2018,26.0,4,,,,,82,105,,10.1111/cwe.12250,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN3GV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438893100005,0

Although a larger ETS will be more efficient, the literature warns that it could make net permit selling regions worse off. We use a CGE model to simulate the linking of two provincial ETSs, namely those of Hubei and Guangdong. Our simulations suggest a trade-off between efficiency and equity as the richer regions (typified by Guangdong) will benefit from linking but the poorer regions (typified by Hubei) may lose. This is because poorer provinces in China tend to be more emissions intensive and therefore likely to face a carbon price rise upon linking, the costs of which may be only partially offset by trading, if indeed trading is permitted. We show this, and explain why it is the case by improving on the stylized model suggested by Adams and Parmenter (2013). Following Atkinson (1970), we find that worsened equity from linking may dominate improved efficiency, thus reducing aggregated welfare. We advise more generous caps to be given to more emissions intensive and less developed regions. If so, as suggest our simulation results, a Pareto-improvement could be attainable.

However, the 1988 reform allowed spouses to choose between joint and separate taxation, involving a reduction in tax rates for secondary earners. Our aim is to analyze this reform as a quasi-natural experiment, assessing the effects of tax changes on labor participation. To find out the causal effect we adopt the difference-in-differences technique. We use data from the 'Spanish Income Tax Panel 1982-1998'. Our results show that, as a consequence of differential tax changes, married women in families more strongly affected by the fiscal reform increase their labor participation more than secondary earners from families less affected by the reform. The participation rate for secondary earners in the treatment group increases by 9.4 percentage points whereas the control group increases their participation rate by 7.8 percentage points. We define the treatment group as those secondary earners in relatively low-income families in year 1987 and the control group as those in middle-high income families, because the former experiences a stronger reduction in tax rates than the latter. As a result, we can attribute the 1.6-percentage-point-increase in participation rates to the 1988 income tax reform.","[Fuenmayor, Amadeo; Granell, Rafael; Mediavilla, Mauro] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Tarongers Sn, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Mediavilla, Mauro] Barcelona Inst Econ, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Valencia,"Fuenmayor, A (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Ave Tarongers Sn, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Amadeo.Fuenmayor@uv.es,"Fuenmayor, Amadeo/J-1124-2016; Mediavilla, Mauro/T-6460-2017; Granell, Rafael/K-9704-2017","Fuenmayor, Amadeo/0000-0002-1485-1792; Mediavilla, Mauro/0000-0003-2002-2859; Granell, Rafael/0000-0002-9040-2382",,,,,39,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The need to provide education fostering motivation and qualities required for students' future social and vocational independence has emerged. The government-promoted career education policies have become established as one of the pillars of youth employment policy. This study explored the effects of career policies in school settings by identifying graduates' earning capacity (annual income) through an online survey followed by quantitative analysis of the results. We report the evaluation of career policies by respondents, and then measure the effects of these policies on both labor participation and income. Although the specific program we focused on did not show clear effects, career education policies in general, and daily activities in elementary and middle schools affect graduates' incomes. We also identify other key attributes that influence income. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The novelty of this paper is to identify the causality channels among R&D, ICTs, and economic growth. Econometric evidence yields that bi-directional causality takes place between ICTs and economic growth. While ICT diffusion leads to a rise in the share of R&D personnel in total employment, it has no causal impact on the share of income devoted to R&D. In this context, empirical results offer that OECD countries need to support the development of ICTs not only to foster economic growth but also to enhance the R&D sector.","[Saglam, Bahar Bayraktar] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Hacettepe University,"Saglam, BB (通讯作者)，Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",sbahar@hacettepe.edu.tr,,,,,,,17,7,8,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

By focusing on the expected real interest rate, previous studies provide some empirical support for explanations of the Great Depression that are not exclusively monetary in nature. However, these studies did not consider the context and the market microstructures from which the data was sourced. Our analysis suggests that it is more likely that agricultural commodity markets adjusted to deflationary expectations by the end of 1930. Evidence from commodities futures markets, such as the Chicago Board of Trade, therefore should not be used to critique the Keynesian challenge to the classical monetarist explanation of the Great Depression.

I study the effect of increases in cigarette prices following the MSA on alcohol consumption among 18- to 24-year olds to determine the economic relationship between cigarettes and alcohol among young adults. I perform analyses at both the conditional mean and quantiles and find that increases in cigarette prices reduce drinking participation among young adults at the extensive margin. However, conditional upon one's decision to drink, higher cigarette prices increase alcohol consumption. Such a pattern of substitution is concentrated between the 40th and 50th conditional quantiles.

The results of the research showed that China has not yet formed a complete value chain of the PV industry that is internationally competitive. The economic effect of the double-anti policy on China as a result of the EU is more pronounced than that with the U.S. The double-anti policy will have a negative impact on China's low carbon economy development.

To explain this phenomenon, we introduce uncoordinated job searches into a general equilibrium monetary search framework. Our model shows that the uncoordinated job searches by unemployed workers give rise to an equilibrium, where a firm is matched with zero, one, or multiple job applicants. The ex post difference in matching probabilities generates a two-point wage dispersion among identical workers, when the Mortensen rule is implemented in the wage-determination process. In our model, inflation positively influences the wage dispersion directly through its impact on firm's real profit and indirectly through the effect of inflation that spills over from the goods market to the labor market. With reasonable parameter values, the calibrated model can account for most of the observed responses of residual wage dispersion to inflation.","[Zhang, Min] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Min] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huangfu, Stella] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University of Sydney,"Zhang, M (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",zhang.min@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,"Huangfu, Stella/0000-0003-4783-4881; Zhang, Min/0000-0001-8361-6262",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203132],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are thankful for the feedback received at various places where this paper was presented.

In our laboratory experiment, we find that individuals underreact to increasing the informativeness of a signal, thus undervalue high-quality information, and that they disproportionately prefer information that may yield certainty. Both biases appear to be mainly due to non-standard belief updating. We find that individuals differ consistently in their responsiveness to information - the extent that their beliefs move upon observing signals. Individual parameters of responsiveness to information have explanatory power in two distinct choice environments and are unrelated to proxies for mathematical aptitude.

This paper presents a novel model to analyze a FIT contract with a minimum price guarantee (i.e., a price-floor regime) from an investor's perspective. The results show that a perpetual guarantee only induces investment for prices below the price floor when offering a risk-free investment opportunity. In contrast, the finite guarantee may induce investment even when the revenue from the guarantee is lower than the investment cost. When an investor faces a scenario with regulatory uncertainty, a higher and more likely reduction in the price floor induces earlier investment. For all cases, investors postpone an investment decision when market conditions present a higher price volatility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using data on the prevalence of the mutation that causes sickle cell disease, we measure the impact of malaria on mortality in Africa prior to the period in which formal data were collected. Our estimate is that in the more afflicted regions, malaria lowered the probability of surviving to adulthood by about ten percentage points, which is twice the current burden of the disease. The reduction in malaria mortality has been roughly equal to the reduction in other causes of mortality. We then ask whether the estimated burden of malaria had an effect on economic development in the period before European contact. Using data at the ethnic group level, we find little evidence of a negative relationship between malaria burden and population density or other measures of development.","[Depetris-Chauvin, Emilio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Depetris-Chauvin, Emilio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Ciencia Polit, Santiago, Chile; [Weil, David N.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Weil, David N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weil, DN (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",davidweil@brown.edu,,"Depetris-Chauvin, Emilio/0000-0002-4236-7869",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD041020] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,62,15,19,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The traditional restricted protocol that allows communicating intentions only fails to improve efficiency over the no-communication conditions. When players are allowed to send any messages (free-form), the majority of them send messages that underscore a reason for which players should choose the efficient action. To explore further whether the absence of such a richer message in the traditional restricted communication protocol can be the cause of its ineffectiveness, we ran an additional treatment that included the intention-based message as well as a reason based message. The data show that the richer restricted communication is as effective as free-form communication, and that reason-based messages are an effective efficiency enhancing device in this class of coordination games regardless of whether the protocol is restricted or free-form.

We exploit sector- and origin-country level import data for a panel of Chinese cities between 1997 and 2012, and differentiate between retailer and non retailer goods and across countries of origin of imports. We find that international global retail presence in Chinese cities produces a disproportionate rise in retail good imports from the retailers' country of origin. Our results point to a trade-cost reducing role of Western retailers that make it easier for foreign retail-good producers from their home country to export to China. Global retailers then act as a bridgehead for the penetration of the Chinese market by producers from their home country, in a way that goes beyond higher sales of imported retail goods by the retailers themselves.

We adopt an innovative approach which is based on a class of model-free interest rate volatility (VXI) indices we derive from options traded on the CBOE. The empirical analysis indicates substantial interest rate volatility risk for medium-term instruments which declines to the levels of the equity market only as the tenor increases to 30 years. We show that this risk appears to be priced in the market and has a significant time-varying relationship with equity volatility risk. US Treasury market volatility is appealing from an investment diversification perspective since the VXI indices are negatively correlated with the levels of interest rates and of equity market implied volatility indices, respectively. Although VXI indices are affected by macroeconomic and monetary news, they are only partially spanned by information contained in the yield curve. Motivated by our results on the magnitude and the nature of interest rate volatility risk and by the phenomenal recent growth of the equity volatility derivative market, we propose the use of our VXI indices as benchmarks for monitoring, securitizing, managing and trading interest rate volatility risk. As a first step in this direction, we describe a framework of one-factor equilibrium models for pricing VXI futures and options on the basis of empirically favored mean-reverting jump-diffusions.

(2005) to a continuous-time dynamic setting. It is known that the original smooth ambiguity preferences converge to the subjective expected utility as the time interval shortens so that decision makers do not exhibit any ambiguity-sensitive behavior in the continuous time limit. Accordingly, this study proposes an alternative model of these preferences that interchanges the role of the second-order utility function with that of the second-order probability to prevent the smooth ambiguity attitude of decision maker from evaporating in the continuous-time limit. By utilizing the utility convergence results established by Kraft and Seifried (2014), our model is eventually represented by the stochastic differential utility with distorted beliefs so that most existing techniques in economics and financial studies can be made applicable together with these distorted beliefs. We give an asset pricing example to demonstrate the applicability of our model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Agents have an opportunity to expropriate some of the joint benefit for their own use. Agents have quasi-linear preferences. Two cases are considered: where agents are risk averse but where limited liability constraints do not bind, and where agents are risk neutral and subject to limited liability constraints. We ask how to structure the investments and division of the surplus over time to avoid expropriation. In the risk-averse case, the dynamics of actions and surplus may or may not be monotonic depending on whether or not a first-best allocation can be sustained. Agents may underinvest but never overinvest. If the first-best allocation is not sustainable, there is a trade-off between risk sharing and surplus maximization; surplus may not be at its constrained maximum even in the long run and the amnesia property of pure risk-sharing models fails to hold. In contrast, in the risk-neutral case there may be an initial phase in which one agent overinvests and the other underinvests. Both actions and surplus converge monotonically to a stationary state, where surplus is maximized subject to the self-enforcing constraints. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Thus economic progress can become decoupled from social progress. As long as social progress is closely linked to and flows from economic progress, it is appropriate for government to focus attention on economic policy to promote economic growth. Indeed, for at least the first four decades of the postwar period, there are good reasons to believe that this was broadly the case for most developed economies. Then, starting in the 1980s and accelerating after the financial crisis of 2008, we argue that social progress in these countries became progressively decoupled from economic progress. The result has been the phenomenon of misery in the midst of plenty: despite continued economic growth, we witness rising dissatisfaction among large segments of the public, declining trust in most public and private institutions, rising nationalism and populism, rising discontent with globalization, increasing unwillingness to accept migrants and refugees, and growing ethnic and religious conflicts. This paper argues that the prevailing thinking about government policy is an outgrowth of the Age of Coupling. In the Age of Decoupling, however, a radically different approach to government policy is required, one that focuses not just on material wellbeing and its distribution, but also on promoting people's sense of empowerment and social solidarity.","[Snower, Dennis J.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Snower, DJ (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",dennis.snower@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,2,2,2,0,13,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 24,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,018-21,10.5018/economics-ejoumal.ja.2018-21,0.0,,,10,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF2TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431792200001,0

We conduct a replication and a reinvestigation of GLSS. In the replication, we use the GLSS protocol and we reproduce their results. In the reinvestigation, we introduce one major change: We replace their variation of the standard Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe (1995) investment game with the original unmodified game. The standard game endows both players, while the modified version endows only the first mover. After endowing both movers in the reinvestigation experiment, we find a significant correlation between the two measures, suggesting that trust is a single construct, whether measured by the survey questions or by an incentivized trust game.","[Aksoy, Billur; Kovaliukaite, Ada; Eckel, Catherine] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Harwell, Haley] Univ Richmond, Jepson Sch Leadership Studies, 28 Westhampton Way,Jepson Hall, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Richmond,"Aksoy, B (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",billuraksoy@tamu.edu; hharwell@richmond.edu; kovaliuk@tamu.edu; ceckel@tamu.edu,,"Aksoy, Billur/0000-0003-0658-0440","Eckel's Sara and John Lindsey Professorship, College of Liberal Arts, Texas AM University","Eckel's Sara and John Lindsey Professorship, College of Liberal Arts, Texas AM University","We would like to thank David I.

To this purpose, we consider a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated to Italy which explicitly accounts for underground production. We construct various tax reform scenarios, such as ex ante budget-neutral tax shifts from direct to indirect taxes, and tax cuts on labor and business financed by decreases of government spending. Our results indicate that neglecting the existence of the underground sector may lead to severely miscalculating the macroeconomic effects of tax reforms. Further, the dimension of the underground sector is permanently and considerably reduced by changes in the tax mix that diminish the labor tax wedge. Reductions of the business tax prove to be highly expansionary in the presence of a sizable informal sector.","[Annicchiarico, Barbara; Cesaroni, Claudio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Annicchiarico, B (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.",barbara.annicchiarico@uniroma2.it,"Annicchiarico, Barbara/A-9326-2012; Cesaroni, Claudio/AAF-1075-2020","Annicchiarico, Barbara/0000-0003-1601-6843;",,,,,58,10,10,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Yet, very few studies in the economic literature have attempted to evaluate the efficiency of creative sectors around the world. In that regard, this paper examines the efficiency of the production of creative goods in Mexico. The empirical examination is made covering 36 metropolitan areas at four different periods of time, using the quinquennial economic censuses taken by the government in 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013. The paper first estimates the static performance of the creative industries by means of data envelopment analysis models. Subsequently, the Malmquist productivity index is used to estimate their dynamic efficiency. Using both analyses, it is shown that, contrary to a commonly held view in the literature, most of the efficient creative industries in Mexico are to be found in metropolitan areas that are not relatively large. Furthermore, it is also found that more than three fourths of the creative sectors in the metropolitan areas are inefficient. The paper then makes use of Florida's 3Ts model to explore some possible factors that could account for those inefficiencies. Two features that are not widespread in Mexico, good public infrastructure and culturally diverse cities, are found to be explanatory factors of best practices in the production of creative goods.","[Benita, Francisco] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Engn Syst & Design Pillar, 8 Somapah Rd, Singapore 487372, Singapore; [Urzua, Carlos M.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Gobierno, Carlos Lazo 100, Mexico City 01389, DF, Mexico",Singapore University of Technology & Design; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Urzúa, CM (通讯作者)，Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Gobierno, Carlos Lazo 100, Mexico City 01389, DF, Mexico.",francisco_benita@sutd.edu.sg; cmurzua@gmail.com,"Urzúa, Carlos M./E-8262-2017; Benita, Francisco/V-6047-2018; Urzúa, Carlos M./Z-3373-2019","Benita, Francisco/0000-0003-4867-5149; Urzúa, Carlos M./0000-0002-3955-265X",,,,,40,10,10,1,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Bearing that in mind, I ask the question: has southern Africa escaped the Malthusian stagnation? Specifically, I study whether primary school completion rates have played any role in total fertility rates in all countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) during the 1980-2009 period. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the results, based on dynamic panel time-series methods, suggest that primary education is associated with lower fertility in the SADC, or that the community is already trading-off quantity for quality of children. Although I do not claim causality, overall the results are significant because, in accordance with unified growth theory, they suggest that the SADC is experiencing its own transition from the Malthusian stagnation epoch into sustained growth, or that the SADC is going through its own post-Malthusian regime.","[Bittencourt, Manoel] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Bittencourt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",bittencourt.manoel@gmail.com,"Bittencourt, Manoel/Y-7530-2019","Bittencourt, Manoel/0000-0001-7460-8842",ERSA; NRF; ERSA; NRF,ERSA; NRF; ERSA; NRF,Financial support from ERSA and the NRF is acknowledged.,,34,2,2,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Each of these estimators assumes different underlying properties for some inputs, which potentially affect the TFP measurements. We analyze the role of corporate taxation within a TFP catch-up model, providing new insights on the unexplored fiscal aspect of the UK productivity puzzle. Our findings are summarized as: (i) the Ackerberg et al.

The inefficiencies are a result of lobbying by firms to establish, or prevent, barriers to the perfectly competitive allocation of factors of production (labor). It is shown that lobbying may lead to a static welfare loss depending upon the elasticity of substitution between goods, and the relative lobbying power of firms. Further, productivity growth, via learning by doing, changes the relative lobbying power over time. This may magnify or diminish the static welfare loss in the long-run depending on the level of initial misallocation.

To determine the structural breaks and efficiency changes over time, we use the time-varying rolling Hurst exponent and threshold vector error correction models. Our main findings indicate that all of the studied commodities exhibit long-term efficiency and short-term inefficiencies that can be explained by global economic conditions: the 2008 global financial crisis, financialisation of commodities markets, and fluctuations in crude oil prices. Time-varying optimal weights minimising the portfolio risk show different patterns between food and crude oil. In terms of hedging effectiveness, food futures are better than crude oil futures. Therefore, optimal portfolios risk hedging requires an adequate rebalancing between spot and futures prices depending on markets conditions and the type of commodities considered. Investigation of the semi-strong efficiency form of these markets through the consideration of intra-day prices could constitute a future extension of the present work.","[Jebabli, Ikram] Univ Auvergne, CRCGM, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Roubaud, David] MBS, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Roubaud, David] MRM, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34000 Montpellier, France",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite de Montpellier,"Jebabli, I (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CRCGM, Clermont Ferrand, France.",jebabliikram@yahoo.fr; d.roubaud@montpellier-bs.com,"ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; JEBABLI, Ikram/AAZ-4189-2020","ROUBAUD, DAVID/0000-0003-3827-6187; JEBABLI, Ikram/0000-0001-5060-3545",,,,,87,8,8,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This paper explores how European mining companies in the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia secured scarce supplies of African labour, by combining coercive labour recruitment practices with considerable investments in living standards. By reconstructing internationally comparable real wages, we show that copper mine workers lived at barebones subsistence in the 1910s-1920s, but experienced rapid welfare gains from the mid-1920s onwards, to become among the best paid manual labourers in Sub-Saharan Africa from the 1940s onwards. We investigate how labour stabilization programs raised welfare conditions of mining worker families (e.g., medical care, education, housing quality) in the Congo, and why these welfare programs were more hesitantly adopted in Northern Rhodesia. By showing how solutions to labour scarcity varied across space and time, we stress the need for dynamic conceptualizations of colonial institutions, as a counterweight to their oft supposed persistence in the historical economics literature.","[Juif, Dacil; Frankema, Ewout] Wageningen Univ, Rural & Environm Hist Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Juif, D (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Rural & Environm Hist Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",dacil.juif@wur.nl; ewout.frankema@wur.nl,"frankema, ewout/B-4186-2015; Juif, Dácil/Q-6492-2018","Juif, Dácil/0000-0003-2463-9549",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO VIDI Grant) [016.124.307],Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO VIDI Grant),"For their comments on earlier drafts of this paper, we would like to thank the participants of the 10th New Frontiers in African Economic History Workshop, participants of the Utrecht Economic and Social History Group Seminar, Jan Luiten van Zanden, Gareth Austin, Duncan Money and Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk.

While the tax competition literature has generally focused on base shifting and the resulting positive fiscal externalities, we show theoretically and empirically that negative fiscal externalities can dominate when the tax base is apportioned across jurisdictions. This can lead to a negative relationship between jurisdiction size and the desired tax rate. Interstate truckers in the United States owe state diesel taxes based on diesel consumption, which is apportioned based on the miles driven in each state. We find that own-state diesel sales fall when the diesel tax rates of other states rise, suggesting that tax base evasion is the predominant source of externalities. We then estimate a tax reaction specification, finding that the own-state tax rate is negatively correlated with the tax rates set in other states and with state size, both consistent with the sign of the estimated fiscal externality.","[Marion, Justin] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Muehlegger, Erich] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Marion, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",marion@ucsc.edu; emuehlegger@ucdavis.edu,,"Muehlegger, Erich/0000-0002-5670-7895",,,,,41,5,5,2,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

This study focuses on discussing the possible factors that determine crude oil prices, which include world economic growth, market power of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), non-OPEC supply and the value of dollar, taking into account the structural changes that influence the study period, which is quarterly data for the period of 1994.Q1-2015.Q3. For time series stationarity tests, Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Perron (1997) unit root test with structural break is used. To test the existence of a long relationship in the presence of structural changes, the Gregory and Hansen (1996a, 1996b) method of co-integration is used. For long-run coefficient, we proceed to estimate fully modified least squares. The result shows a significant influence of non-OPEC supply, the dollar appreciation and world gross domestic product growth, but OPEC did not have a significant effect on the price of oil, which is indicated by the structural break for OPEC capacity utilisation at 2002.Q1, that indicates the starting point of the loss of OPEC power.

However, in reality human preferences are often not transitive. This is especially true for the indifference relation, which can lead an individual to make a series of choices which in their totality would be viewed by the same individual as erroneous. There is a substantial literature that raises intricate questions about individual liberty and the role of government intervention in such contexts. The aim of this paper is not to go into these ethical matters but to provide a formal structure for such analysis by characterizing games where individual preferences are quasi-transitive. The paper identifies a set of axioms which are sufficient for the existence of Nash equilibria in such games.","[Basu, Kaushik] Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Pattanaik, Prasanta K.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",Cornell University; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Basu, K (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",kb40@cornell.edu,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

We find compelling supporting evidence in the behavior of participants who send and respond to others' statements of confidence about how well they have scored on an IQ test. In two-player tournaments where the higher score wins, a player is very likely to choose to compete when he knows that his own stated confidence is higher than the other player's, but rarely when the reverse is true. Consistent with this behavior, stated confidence is inflated by males when deterrence is strategically optimal and is instead deflated (by males and females) when luring (encouraging entry) is strategically optimal. This behavior is consistent with the equilibrium of the corresponding signaling game. Overconfident statements are used in environments that seem familiar, and we present evidence that suggests that this can occur on an unconscious level.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rustichini, Aldo] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [van de Ven, Jeroen] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van de Ven, Jeroen] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",charness@econ.ucsb.edu; arust@econ.umn.edu; j.vandeven@uva.nl,"Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024","van de Ven, Jeroen/0000-0001-5111-0427",,,,,41,41,44,3,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This paper develops a model of permit banking under imperfect competition and imperfect inter-temporal arbitrage, in which the firms in one dominant sector can exert market power in both product and permit markets, while those in other sectors or linked programs are perfectly competitive. A simple analytical model is developed to generate contestable hypothesis. We further extend the model to account for the physical power system, institutional rules and market conditions, and then apply it to the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market. We show that if the dominant firm has market power, then the permit price rises at a higher rate than the discount rate, contrary to perfectly competitive permit market, where the permit price rises at the discount rate following the classic Hotelling's rule. Furthermore, under a declining emissions cap system with the permits front-loaded in early time periods, the dominant firm has an incentive to suppress the permit prices (monopsony) when buying the permits in early periods, and then inflate the permit prices (monopoly) when selling them in later periods. Numerical results of the PJM case are consistent with the analytical conclusion.

We find that the resulting cultural evolutionary dynamic can be characterized as a continuous imitative dynamic in a population game. By using the properties of imitative dynamics, we show that as in Bisin and Verdier, cultural substitutability is the key that leads to cultural heterogeneity. Furthermore, we model an agent's cultural intolerance towards another agent as an increasing function of their cultural distance. We find that the curvature of the cultural intolerance function plays an important role in determining the long-run cultural phenomena. In particular, when the cultural intolerance function is convex, only the most extremely polarized state is a stable limit point. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This absence of gender neutrality with respect to work-division is known as the work-division puzzle. Gender differences regarding characteristics (preferences, productivity) and context (wage rates, social norms) are generally recognized as competing explanations for this fact. We experimentally control for context and productivity to investigate preferences for work-division by true co-habiting couples, in a newly developed specialization task. Efficiency in this task comes at the cost of inequality, giving higher earnings to the advantaged player. We compare behavior when men (or women) are in the advantaged position, which corresponds to the traditional (or power) couple case where he (or she) earns more. Women and men contribute equally to the household public good in all conditions. This result allows us to rule out some of the standard explanations of the work-division puzzle.","[Cochard, Francois] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Couprie, Helene] Univ Cergy Pontoise THEMA, 33 Bd Port, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Hopfensitz, Astrid] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; CY Cergy Paris Universite; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Hopfensitz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",fcochard@univ-fcomte.fr; helene.couprie@gmail.com; astrid.hopfensitz@tse-fr.eu,"Hopfensitz, Astrid/C-1236-2014","Hopfensitz, Astrid/0000-0002-6503-6114",ANR-DFG [TIPI ANR-08-FASHS-018]; ANR [SINT ANR-15-CE33-0005-01]; ANR Labex IAST,ANR-DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANR Labex IAST(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We would like to acknowledge financial support from the ANR-DFG project TIPI ANR-08-FASHS-018 (French-German co-operation program) and the ANR project SINT ANR-15-CE33-0005-01.

As a byproduct of the model we obtain a hedging portfolio. Using linear programming duality we compute also the risk premium. The model applies to coupon-indexed and principal indexed bonds, and allows the analysis of bonds with different design parameters (coupon, target GDP growth rate, and maturity). We calibrate for UK and US instruments, and carry out sensitivity analysis of prices and risk premia to the risk factors and bond design parameters. We also compare coupon-indexed and principal-indexed bonds. Further results with calibrated instruments for Germany, Italy and South Africa shed light on a policy question, whether the risk premia of these bonds make them beneficial for sovereigns. Our findings affirm that designs are possible for both coupon-indexed and principal-indexed bonds that can benefit a sovereign, with an advantage for coupon indexed bonds.

Specifically, we determine the information content of equity and house prices, private credit volumes, and sovereign and corporate bond yields, for 11 advanced economies over the past three decades, using both signalling extraction and logit modelling. The outcomes show that high asset prices more often signal high inflation than low inflation/deflation. However, in some countries, high asset prices and low bond yields are a significant indicator of low inflation or deflation as well. The transmission time of financial developments to inflation can be quite long (up to 8 quarters). For monetary policy, these findings imply that stimulating asset prices through Quantitative Easing (QE) can effectively influence inflation, but that the effects are quite uncertain, both regarding timing and direction.","[de Haan, Leo; van den End, Jan Willem] Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"de Haan, L (通讯作者)，Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",l.de.haan@dnb.nl,,"van den End, J.W./0000-0003-3580-5127",,,,,32,6,6,4,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

India has emerged as a leading rice exporter. The Government of India has introduced the National Food Security Act which requires 33.6 million tons of rice per year for its public food distribution system. In this study, we modeled India's rice market and analyzed policy implications of the long-term impact of India's food security act on domestic and international rice market. We developed a structural economic demand and supply model for India's rice market and further added subsidy equations to trace the consequence of National Food Security Act on domestic rice consumption and on the international market. We specifically focus on three different scenarios: subsidy as price effect, subsidy as inelastic income effect, and subsidy as elastic income effect under the broader framework of National Food Security Act. We found that at the end of the projection period (2024-2025), as a result of rice subsidy program, the consumption of rice increases significantly in the case of price effect while the inelastic income effect has no or less impact on production, consumption, and export of rice. Hence, the policy implication of our study is that if the objective of the National Food Security Act is to increase consumption then it needs to be implemented as price effect.

In the eurozone (EZ), doubts that banks and governments of peripheral countries could settle debts when they matured led to a massive capital outflow after the fall of Lehman Brothers and, especially, the first Greek sovereign-debt crisis. This has led some authors to hold that the situation in the EZ is a balance-of-payments (BoP) crisis. However, the European Central Bank (ECB) offset massive financial capital withdrawals with a huge inflow of reserves to the EZ periphery, making the international reserves constraint irrelevant. This invalidated the BoP view in other authors' opinion, who pointed out bad bank behaviour and a poor initial institutional design as the alternative root cause for the current mess. This position is known as the monetary sovereign (MS) view. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the debate between both sides, with Cesaratto, as a representative for the BoP view, and Lavoie, De Grauwe and Wray, for the MS view, and discuss whether a reconciliation between these two positions can be possible. We step into the discussion to offer two additional arguments in favour of the second view: (i) A currency union requires a single monetary policy, as opposed to a fixed exchange-rate regime; TARGET2 balances combined with refinancing operations are an essential ingredient of monetary policy implementation. (ii) The current situation is more easily understood as another episode of financial instability after banks have granted huge amounts of credit (which they refinanced abroad). The situation got even worse because governments supporting troubled banks in their respective jurisdictions lacked a lender of last resort.","[Febrero, Eladio; Bermejo, Fernando] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ & Finance, Cuenca, Spain; [Uxo, Jorge] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ & Finance, Talavera De La Reina, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Febrero, E (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Dept Econ & Finance, Cuenca, Spain.",eladio.febrero@uclm.es,"Bermejo, Fernando/AAV-7931-2020; Uxó, Jorge/AAB-3357-2019; Febrero, Eladio/AAB-5335-2019; Bermejo, Fernando/I-2882-2015","Bermejo, Fernando/0000-0003-0792-5674; Uxó, Jorge/0000-0002-2218-1004; Febrero, Eladio/0000-0002-0722-9487;",,,,,60,15,16,1,11,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Since the mid-1980s, their work, collectively and individually, has developed from a concern with contested exchanges to analyses of behavioural repertoires pursued through evolutionary game theory in which they claim that 'history matters'. Despite their alignment with the mainstream, they retain an appeal to some heterodox economists. We argue that this appeal is misplaced. Their theoretical work and knowledge claims rest on methodological individualism and equilibrium reasoning, which fosters an obtuse reductionism. They present a confused methodology, which seems to be motivated by a desire to remain coherent to standard economics. We show how their acceptance of methodological individualism and ergodic modelling undermines their knowledge claims as well as their declaration that history matters in their analysis.","[Finch, John H.; McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Finch, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,69,2,2,2,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We argue that forcing patent pools to allow each individual patent holder to license the technology indep endently does not necessarily work as a screening tool to select only desirable patent pools. We consider a duopolistic model in which some users demand only specific technologies. We demonstrate that a patent pool with indep endent licensing enables patent holders to undertake anti- competitive price discrimination. Moreover, since forming a patent pool mitigates the price competition forced by lower grade entrants, combination with independent licensing might worsen welfare further. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the Binary Conditional Contribution Mechanism (BCCM), every agent's message has the form, I am willing to contribute to the public good if at least k agents contribute in total.This mechanism offers agents risk-free strategies, which we call unexploitable. We prove that if agents choose unexploitable messages in a Better Response Dynamics model, all stable outcomes of the BCCM are Pareto efficient. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate whether observed behavior is consistent with this prediction. Subjects play the BCCM in an environment with complete information and homogeneous valuations or in a second environment with incomplete information and heterogeneous valuations. In both cases all stable outcomes in the experiment are in line with the prediction of the dynamic model. Furthermore, comparison treatments with the Voluntary Contribution Mechanism show that the BCCM leads to significantly higher contribution rates.","[Reischmann, Andreas; Oechssler, Joerg] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Oechssler, J (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Dept Econ, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",oechssler@uni-hd.de,,"Oechssler, Joerg/0000-0003-1418-0842",University of Heidelberg,University of Heidelberg,"We thank participants of the Game Theory Festival 2013 at Stony Brook, as well as IWGTS at the University of Sao Paulo.

For this purpose, we develop a two-country monetary union new Keynesian general equilibrium model with housing and collateral constraints, to be calibrated for Lithuania and the rest of the euro area. We consider two different scenarios for macroprudential policies: one in which the ECB extends its goals to also include financial stability and a second one in which a national macroprudential authority uses the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) as an instrument. The results show that both rules are effective in making the financial system more stable in both countries, and especially in Lithuania. This is because the financial sector in this country is more sensitive to shocks. We find that an extended Taylor rule is indeed effective in reducing the volatility of credit, but comes with a cost in terms of higher inflation volatility. The simple LTV rule, on the other hand, does not compromise the objective of monetary policy. This reinforces the Tinbergen principle, which argues that there should be two different instruments when there are two different policy goals.","[Rubio, Margarita] Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Comunale, Mariarosaria] Bank Lithuania, Totoriu G 4, LT-01121 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Nottingham; Bank of Lithuania,"Rubio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Comunale, M (通讯作者)，Bank Lithuania, Totoriu G 4, LT-01121 Vilnius, Lithuania.",margarita.rubio@nottingham.ac.uk; mcomunale@lb.lt,,"Comunale, Mariarosaria/0000-0002-7994-5204",,,,,46,7,7,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

This paper documents that this decline was more pronounced in manufacturing than in services in the U.S. and in a broad set of other industrialized economies, and shows that a model with cross-sectoral differences in productivity growth and in the degree of capital-labor substitutability is consistent with these trends. We calibrate the model exploiting additional information on the pace of structural change from manufacturing to services, on which the model also has predictions. We then conduct a decomposition to establish the relative importance of several potential drivers of changes in factor income shares and structural change that have been proposed in the literature. This exercise reveals that differences in the degree of capital bias of technical change across sectors, combined with differences in substitution possibilities, are key determinants of the observed patterns.

It examines, within Nielsen's setting, the impact of online shopping on taxes and tax competition and contrasts destination-based taxation with origin-based taxation. Heterogeneous consumers surf the Internet at a cost. It is assumed that fiscal leakage occurs during transactions on the Internet either because of tax evasion or of the existence of a tax liability threshold. Whereas cross-border shopping effectively results in taxes being levied at origin, this model by adding e-commerce shows that taxing online trade based on the origin principle softens tax competition and allows sustaining the destination principle on brick-and-mortar shops. Tax competition is reduced if tax is origin-based, because the Internet helps the small country expand its tax base, which induces tax convergence.","[Beauvallet, Maya Bacache] Telecom ParisTech, 46 Rue Barrault, F-75013 Paris, France",IMT - Institut Mines-Telecom; Institut Polytechnique de Paris,"Beauvallet, MB (通讯作者)，Telecom ParisTech, 46 Rue Barrault, F-75013 Paris, France.",maya.bacache@enst.fr,,,,,,,23,9,9,1,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Choices are not completely consistent with any of the economic theories we consider, however, they are not random either. We use our experimental data to structurally estimate risk preferences and correct for decision error. Using a measure constructed from the estimates and individual choices, we find that risk preferences do predict future field behavior. Children who are more risk averse are less likely to receive disciplinary referrals one and two years after the experiment and are more likely to complete high school, even controlling for economic rationality, family background, scholarly achievement and past misbehavior. Accounting for decision error turns out to be important as a simple aggregate measure of risk is not found to be correlated with field behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We consider this issue by comparing the market-versus-state attitudes of respondents from a capitalist country, Finland, and from an ex-communist group of Baltic countries, and by arguing that the period of communist rule can be viewed as an 'experiment' in institutional imposition. We find that, consistent with some earlier related work, citizens from ex-communist countries tend to be more supportive of state ownership than respondents from capitalist economies. However, they also favour increasing inequality and competition as the means to enhance incentives.

While average market return to the licensing of any new drug that a vaccine maker produced also increases, returns to drug firms that do not make vaccines remain the same after the legislation. Company risk-taking enhances market reaction to the announcement of a new vaccine. Delitigation appears to contribute to the transformation of vaccine makers.

This paper uses the detention tendencies of quasi-randomly assigned bail judges to estimate the causal effects of retrial detention on subsequent defendant outcomes. Using data from administrative court and tax records, we find that pretrial detention significantly increases the probability of conviction, primarily through an increase in guilty pleas. Pretrial detention has no net effect on future crime, but decreases formal sector employment and the receipt of employment- and tax-related government benefits. These results are consistent with (i) pretrial detention weakening defendants' bargaining positions during plea negotiations and (ii) a criminal conviction lowering defendants' prospects in the formal labor market.","[Dobbie, Will] Princeton Univ, Ind Relat Sect, Louis A Simpson Int Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Dobbie, Will; Yang, Crystal S.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cioldin, Jacob] Stanford Law Sch, William H.

We identify game niches by genre, age-appropriateness, console system, a release cohort, and publisher. First, we show that games are more likely to be released so as to avoid weeks when their niche already faces competition. Next, we show that consumer substitution across games is stronger within most of the dimensions describing product niches. Sales volumes decay quickly after the opening weekend, so at any point in time, a niche will typically be served by few current titles. From this, we calculate that delaying game release 1 week yields substantial increase in revenue for a video game facing higher-than-average competition.","[Engelstaetter, Benjamin; Ward, Michael R.] Zentrum Europa Wirtschaftsforsch, Mannheim, Germany; [Engelstaetter, Benjamin] Hsch Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; [Ward, Michael R.] Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Hochschule Darmstadt; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Ward, MR (通讯作者)，Zentrum Europa Wirtschaftsforsch, Mannheim, Germany.;Ward, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",mikeward@uta.edu,"Ward, Michael/AHC-7709-2022","Ward, Michael/0000-0003-0669-5475",,,,,39,8,8,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

On one hand, overhead (nonprogram expenses) is vital to the operational abilities of a nonprofit; on the other hand, there is evidence that donors dislike paying for overhead costs. In this paper, we use an experiment to study overhead from the perspective of donors. First, we replicate the prior finding establishing the existence of overhead aversion. Then we obtain new results by extending this line of research, examining whether donors have an aversion to specific types of overhead (specifically, salaries and fundraising). Our results suggest that donor behavior may be dependent on their outside option. If an overhead-free donation is readily available, then the average donor in our experiment (70-80% of subjects) prefers that charity to receive the donation. However, if donations are not overhead-free, most (approximately two-thirds of subjects) prefer the donation go toward fundraising efforts instead of salary-related expenditures.","[Portillo, Javier E.] Birmingham Southern Coll, Dept Polit Sci Econ & Sociol, Birmingham, AL 35254 USA; [Stinn, Joseph] Florida State Univ, Dept Econ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Portillo, JE (通讯作者)，Birmingham Southern Coll, Dept Polit Sci Econ & Sociol, Birmingham, AL 35254 USA.",jeportil@bsc.edu; js12z@my.fsu.edu,,,,,,,23,16,21,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We first briefly review Piketty's text, and highlight two theories advanced by Piketty: one about the relationship between return on capital and economic growth (r - g) associated with the ratio between two variables (k/y), and another theory in which the same (k/y) relationship is associated with a ratio between the growth rate of savings-to-economic growth (i.e., k/y= s/g). Piketty uses these two devices, s/g and r > g to warn readers about a possible future of secular stagnation (a continued age of very low or even negative g's), in which the inequality r > g may create inequality levels not seen since the XIX century, or worse. The constant growth model, however, provides what Piketty's analysis does not include: transitional dynamics, the adjustments agents would make in such dire low growth scenario and system responses. Furthermore, the constant growth model shows why r > g, r - g > 0 is both a logical and a computational condition valid for all times. In sum, we show that Piketty's theoretical devices cannot support his contentions.

Assuming that each party has incomplete market information about the other, we can thus define a dynamic game relationship between employers' incentives to retain workers and workers' mobility behaviour. By using evolutionary game theory, in this study we analyse various conditional evolutionary stable strategies and explore how employer behaviour influences the mobility of the workers in this industry in China. The results show that under the prevailing employment model, construction workers are bound to change jobs regardless of whether their employers adopt incentives to retain them or not. This finding suggests that the government, as the market regulator, should reform its employment model to ensure that construction workers switch jobs in an orderly and rational manner.","[Sun Jide; Wang Xincheng; Shen Liangfa] Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Wang, XC (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wxc2040@163.com,,"Wang, Xincheng/0000-0001-8027-018X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472139],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71472139].,,35,19,20,5,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

However, its behavior at conditional quantiles of the distribution have been not explored. Methods: This study determines the periods in which inflation persistence in Mexico presented structural changes in its conditional distribution using a quantile regression approach. Additionally, the article examines for each period, if inflation follows a stationary behavior using the Quantile Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, estimate the persistence of inflation shocks, and analyze if inflation is converging to the long-term inflation target of 3% impose by the Central Bank. Results: The episodes found coincided with periods when Mexico's economic policies underwent drastic changes that altered the price formation process. The evidence indicates that inflation shocks present an asymmetric behavior, while high magnitude negative shocks rapidly vanish, high magnitude positive shocks tend to be long lasting. Inflation converged to a stationary process in all its conditional quantiles under the inflation targeting regime. Besides, since 2009 the hypothesis that inflation adjusted for seasonal effects remains within the range variability of 1% point of the long-term inflation target of three percent cannot be statistically rejected. Conclusion: The quantile regression is a useful and convenient statistical tool to analyze inflation persistence. In particular, it gives a clear picture about the periods in which inflation changed, and on the impact of inflation shocks in a specific quantile.","[Acosta, Marco A.] Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Acosta, MA (通讯作者)，Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",macosta@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,2,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Constrained by the zero lower bound on the policy rate, the monetary authority is unable to implement its objectives when private sector expectations stray far enough from the target. Low-inflation expectations become self-fulfilling, resulting in an additional Markov equilibrium in which the monetary authority falls short of the nominal target, average output is below its efficient level, and the policy rate is typically low. Introducing a stabilization goal for long-term nominal rates can implement a unique Markov equilibrium without fully compromising stabilization policy.","[Armenter, Roc] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Armenter, R (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",Roc.armenter@phil.frb.org,,,,,,,64,20,21,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

To this purpose, we use a meta-analysis with 551 estimates from 68 empirical studies that take private credit to GDP as a measure for financial development. We distinguish between linear and logarithmic specifications. First, we find evidence of significantly positive publication bias in both the linear and log-linear specifications. It suggests the literature has exaggerated the size of the finance-growth effect in the past. Second, we find suggestive evidence that the logarithmic specification is superior to the linear specification. In the logarithmic specification when accounting for publication bias, a 10% increase in credit to the private sector increases economic growth with 0.09 percentage points. For the linear estimates, no significant effect of credit to the private sector on economic growth is found on average. Overall, the evidence points to a positive but decreasing effect of financial development on growth and supports the too much' finance hypothesis.","[Bijlsma, Michiel; Kool, Clemens; Non, Marielle] CPB Netherlands Bur Policy Anal, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Bijlsma, Michiel] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Kool, Clemens] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Utrecht University,"Non, M (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Policy Anal, Tilburg, Netherlands.",m.c.non@cpb.nl,,"Non, Marielle/0000-0002-3248-9205",University of Amsterdam,University of Amsterdam,"We thank Sophie Kramer and Jessica Warren for research assistance.

The GNP aggregate has been selected as a measure of economic growth because it allows to omit the influence of international companies located in Ireland on the global production level. A TECM approach has been selected for analysis as it is an appropriate tool for the effective modeling of different regimes of growth around the long run which is assumed to be stable. The time series (in levels and in logs) exhibited both non-stationarity and structural breaks. It was possible to find out the determinants of growth in the long as well as short run and the threshold variables that extracted the period of intense economic growth. The best empirical models were obtained with the following thresholds: the GDP deflator and the net exports.

In contrast to the previous literature, this paper adopts a multivariate, nonlinear framework to analyse Gibson's paradox in the Netherlands over the period 1800-2012. Specifically, SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis) and MSSA (Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis) techniques are used. It is shown that changes in monetary policy regimes or volatility in the price of gold by themselves cannot account for the behaviour of government bond yields and prices over the last 200 years. However, the inclusion of changes in the real rate of return on capital, M1, primary credit rate, expected inflation, and money purchasing power enables a nonlinear model to account for a sizeable percentage of the total variance of Dutch bond yields. This is a novel study of the Gibson's paradox using a non-linear approach unravelling the multidimensional nature of the paradox. The results should assist policy makers in setting monetary policy and help to better understand the behaviour of financial institutions on the markets. Central banks, should however evaluate the implication of this study in setting inflation targeting goals. Results of this study are also expected to stimulate further research on the bank credit policies by managing interest rates.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Skare, Marinko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia",Brunel University; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Kingston Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk; mskare@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692",,,,,58,0,0,0,5,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Effects vary strongly across government functions and are strongest in relative terms for social spending and infrastructure.

However, in general, these nations survived the crisis with less damage compared with advanced countries. The majority of developing countries did not experience a financial system collapse. What were the main factors behind their relatively better performance? We argue that the main reason was the relatively moderate financial account shocks, in terms of both magnitude and duration, experienced by developing economies during the global crisis. This was due to the fact that advanced countries could not fully serve their roles as safe havens during the recent global turmoil. Furthermore, developing countries enjoyed greater autonomy and legitimacy in implementing expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in an environment in which international cooperation partially met the need for an international lender of last resort. If the returns in advanced countries become more attractive, developing countries may face larger external financial shocks in future crises.","[Comert, Hasan] Middle East Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey; [Colak, Mehmet Selman] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Cömert, H (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Ankara, Turkey.",hcomert@metu.edu.tr; mselman.colak@tcmb.gov.tr,"Cömert, Hasan/ABA-3525-2020","Cömert, Hasan/0000-0002-1523-9423",,,,,27,1,1,0,9,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,2,,,,,201,226,,10.2298/PAN150905028C,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GP3QZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440769600004,0

This paper presents the rationale for the inclusion of R&D provisions, quantifies the subsidy implied by alternative options using the user's cost approach and approximates aggregate impacts by means of simple extrapolations from elasticities found in literature. We find that the provisions for immediate expensing of R&D included in the 2011 proposal would be less generous than what national schemes currently offer. We present alternative allowances that would serve to either maintain present levels or increase business R&D expenditure and we cost them in terms of foregone CIT revenue. In view of the pressing current need for a boost in business investment and the EU's R&D investment targets for the year 2020, we argue that the level of support should be ambitious. Importantly, to take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by this tax reform, EU member states will have to engage in complementary interventions in their national innovation systems. We conclude with a broad consideration of what these may be for the varied and variably developed business innovation capabilities found across the EU.","[d'Andria, Diego; Pontikakis, Dimitrios] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium; [Skonieczna, Agnieszka] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Taxat & Customs Union, Brussels, Belgium",European Commission Joint Research Centre,"d'Andria, D (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium.",diego.d'andria@ec.europa.eu,,"d'Andria, Diego/0000-0002-1915-4128",,,,,77,9,9,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Disasters occurring during reelection years, as well as those occurring in electorally important states, are more likely to receive SBA declarations.

Despite similar developments in inequality, the growth performance and drivers for growth differed markedly among countries, allowing clusters of different growth regimes to be identified. Among them are 2 extreme types: the debt-led private-demand boom and the export-led mercantilist economies. Whereas the former rely mainly on credit-financed household consumption in order to compensate for the potential lack of demand (associated with the depressing effect of financialisation), the latter rely on net exports as the main driver of aggregate demand. Using a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types.","[Detzer, Daniel] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Inst Int Polit Econ IPE, Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Detzer, D (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Inst Int Polit Econ IPE, Berlin, Germany.",,,,Seventh Framework Programme [266800],Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by the Seventh Framework Programme [Grant Number 266800].,,64,14,14,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Both voters, who tend to make the same voting choices because of their conformity preferences, collect information about the consequences of a project and then vote on the project. We focus on an informative equilibrium in which voters vote informatively using pure strategies. This is a symmetric Nash equilibrium. Our result is interesting as it shows that nonconformist voters exert less effort from a social perspective because of a positive externality that results in the free-rider problem, while conformity preferences can help to improve the sum of the voters' expected payoffs from the social perspective. This is because conformity preferences may alleviate the free-rider problem associated with coordination (making the same vote). Specifically, conformity preferences give special importance to the correlation between voters' signals, even if this correlation is unrelated to the accuracy of the signals. Furthermore, we present the exact conformity preference level which helps voters to exert an optimal effort level that maximizes the sum of the voters' expected payoffs compared to the nonconformist case.

This concept is an apt analogy for the relationship between innovation and shortage in the health sector.

The initial upswings tend to be led by household investment and debt-financed personal consumption expenditures, which then wane in relative importance, and lead downswings. As those expenditures are financed in significant part by money creation, they function as an external market-driving accumulation by enabling monetary profit realisation-in a way analogous to Rosa Luxemburg's treatment of the public and foreign sectors. Empirical studies on wage-led/profit-led demand regimes typically exclude household investment or include it in with business investment. This paper argues that it is vital to distinguish an independent role for 'semi-autonomous' household expenditures as a driver of effective demand and cyclical dynamics. The failure to do so in empirical studies sustains misleading conclusions such as the perceived relevance of Goodwin-type profit squeeze cycles.",,,,brett.fiebiger@hotmail.com,,,,,,,41,28,30,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We systematically vary a group's composition from all individuals being partner over blended groups of partners and strangers to all individuals being stranger in each round. We want to explore how individuals' past experiences in blended groups of partners and strangers affect cooperation in newly formed groups with permanent members only. Our results show that previous group composition does not affect cooperation in the subsequent partner setting with one exception: Groups cooperate significantly less compared to all other settings, when one stranger entered the group. We further analyze this situation in-depth and find that only in a setting with one stranger a reaction chain based on negative reciprocity results in low contributions in the subsequent setting. Partners falsely attribute low cooperation levels to partners formerly assigned the role of a stranger.

By closely integrating the prospect theory and the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, this paper develops a generalized framework of decision-making. Theoretically, we first use a four-step editing phase and a valuation phase to generate two key functions: the value function and the weighting function. We then demonstrate how to compute the intuitionistic fuzzy prospect values as the reference for decision-making. Empirically, experiments are conducted to examine how well the patterns of subjects' decision-making, under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment, comfort to the framework proposed in this paper. The experiments reveal that the ways that subjects choose to deal with information are consistent with what are implied by the fuzzy logic of our framework in various scenarios. The experimental results show that (i) the shapes of the value function and the weighting function in our framework are in line with those of prospect theory, (ii) people are less risk averse when making decisions under an intuitionistic fuzzy environment than under uncertainty, and (iii) with the presence of ambiguity, people systemically underweight the probabilities of the outcomes with gains as well as those of the outcomes with losses. This paper illustrates that our methodology can elicit prospects not only under uncertainty but also under ambiguity, and the decision-making patterns can be fully captured by parameters in the value function and the weighting function. As our approach generalizes to the case of ambiguity, the prospect theory can therefore be viewed as a special case in our framework.","[Gu, Jing] Sichuan Univ, Sch Econ, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zijian] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zeshui] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xuezheng] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 169 East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Sichuan University; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Chen, XZ (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 169 East Shuanggang Rd, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",hymacmechen@hotmail.com,"Wang, Zijian/IQU-2128-2023; Xu, Zeshui/N-8908-2013","Wang, Zijian/0000-0001-8770-1755; Xu, Zeshui/0000-0003-3547-2908","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71401116, 71571123, 71473168]; Sichuan University [2018hhs-07, YJ201353, Skyb201404, skqy201766]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan University(Sichuan University),"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71401116, No. 71571123, No. 71473168), and by Sichuan University (No. 2018hhs-07, No. YJ201353, No. Skyb201404, No. skqy201766).",,35,8,8,1,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This manuscript advances the hypothesis that economic sanctions increase the likelihood of systematic banking crises by deteriorating the target economy's macroeconomic conditions and limiting its access to international capital. To test the argument, we gathered data for over 125 emerging economies for the years from 1970 to 2005. The findings indicate that sanctions are likely to raise the probability of banking crises. The results also show that financial sanctions are more detrimental to the stability of banking systems than trade sanctions. Further, we find that the hypothesized effect of sanctions is conditioned by the extent of economic cost inflicted on targeted economies. One major implication of the findings is that sanctions, as external shocks, can potentially destabilize the financial stability of target countries in addition to the well-documented adverse effects on economic growth, political stability, and humanitarian conditions.","[Hatipoglu, Emre] Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Peksen, Dursun] Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",Sabanci University; University of Memphis,"Peksen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",dpeksen@memphis.edu,"Hatipoglu, Emre/GZB-2442-2022; Hatipoglu, Emre/AAA-9372-2021","Hatipoglu, Emre/0000-0002-5927-4423; Hatipoglu, Emre/0000-0002-5927-4423",,,,,64,40,41,6,36,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Under near-rationality, agents' subjective beliefs are distorted away from rational expectations via a change of measure process which fulfills some regularity conditions. In most applications, the beliefs distortion process is also directly observed by (a subset of) the decision-makers - e.g., ambiguity-averse households or policy-makers with a concern for robustness - and therefore included into their optimization problems. We investigate conditions for existence and local uniqueness of solutions under endogenous distortions, as well as the relation with their rational expectations counterparts. We show that linearly perturbed solutions may well be affected by the presence of distorted beliefs, depending on the underlying model economy. In particular, while directly affecting first-order decision rules, near-rationality may also induce failure of the certainty equivalence principle. Moreover, the martingale representation of distorted beliefs might prove non-unique, pointing to a subtle form of equilibrium indeterminacy.","[Hespeler, Frank] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Sorge, Marco M.] Univ Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [Sorge, Marco M.] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); University of Salerno; University of Gottingen,"Sorge, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",msorge@unisa.it,,"Hespeler, Frank/0000-0002-5328-5033; Sorge, Marco Maria/0000-0002-8311-039X",,,,,31,0,0,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

A high saving investment association may be observed even in perfectly integrated international financial markets if saving and investment are shifted in the same direction due to a common third factor. Instead of focusing on specific common sources, we estimate factors that are (i) common across all countries and (ii) common within each country, using a multi-level factor model proposed by Choi et al. (2017). By controlling for multi-level factors in the saving investment regression, we effectively isolate the impact of exogenously increased saving on investment regardless of the nature of common sources. We show that the global and country-specific factors together account for almost 50% of the saving-investment correlation in a panel of 19 OECD countries for 1961-2005, and capital mobility has increased over time particularly in Europe. Our analysis provides a measure of capital mobility which helps assess the effectiveness of policies or incidence of taxes in an open economy.","[Hwang, Sun Ho; Kim, Yun Jung] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Sogang University,"Kim, YJ (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, 35 Baekbeom Ro, Seoul 04107, South Korea.",sunho3137@sogang.ac.kr; yunjungk@sogang.ac.kr,"Hwang, Sun Ho/IAN-2107-2023","Hwang, Sun Ho/0000-0002-9798-838X",,,,,68,2,2,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We use Sri Lankan household data to examine how the adoption of new technologies by households positively impacts their ability to achieve household economies of scale. This suggests that new technologies not only deliver a greater variety of consumption goods to consumers, but they may also play an important role in enabling large households to escape poverty by lowering the per-capita costs of maintaining a given standard of living. Given the importance of consumption economies of scale in the measurement of poverty, this study provides some insights on the extent to which the number of poor households changes when food consumption scale economies due to technology adoption in the domestic sphere are incorporated.","[Jayasinghe, Maneka; Smith, Christine] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Ratnasiri, Shyama; Chai, Andreas] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Jayasinghe, M (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia.",maneka.jayasinghe@griffithuni.edu.au,"Jayasinghe, Maneka Savithri/AAP-3527-2020; Ratnasiri, Shyama/AAP-9863-2021","Jayasinghe, Maneka Savithri/0000-0002-3613-4073; Ratnasiri, Shyama/0000-0002-9295-4076; Chai, Andreas/0000-0003-0838-9324",Griffith University,Griffith University(Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus),"Maneka Jayasinghe wishes to acknowledge the financial support received from Griffith University to undertake Ph.D study programme.

We exploit the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the associated exchange listing requirements as an exogenous regulatory shock that raises board independence. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that board independence leads to significantly higher managerial ownership. In particular, firms forced to raise board independence exhibit managerial ownership that is 26.35% higher, relative to firms not required to raise board independence. Thus, board independence and managerial equity ownership constitute governance mechanisms that act as complements, rather than substitutes. Our empirical strategy relies on a quasi-natural experiment and is far more likely to show a causal effect than what has been documented in the literature. Finally, an instrumental-variable analysis reinforces our conclusion.","[Jiraporn, Pornsit; Nimmanunta, Kridsda] NIDA, NIDA Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand; [Jiraporn, Pornsit] Penn State Univ, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA",National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); National Institute of Development Administration - Thailand; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，NIDA, NIDA Business Sch, Bangkok, Thailand.;Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA.",pxj11@psu.edu,,,,,,,16,12,13,3,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The current paper introduces the national security into the welfare analysis missing from the earlier work. This creates a trade-off between the private goods and the security as a public good in the social cost-benefit analysis. There are three major results. First, and arising from the intergenerational interaction, it is optimal to introduce a pay to the young generation when in duty even by resorting to a distortive tax. Second, when optimizing the size of the army, the optimal choice between the draft army and the professional army depends on the risk class of the country. A security gradient arises. Third, the choice is linked to the size and the quality of the reserve generated by the two approaches.","[Kanniainen, Vesa] Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland; [Kanniainen, Vesa; Ringbom, Staffan] HECER, Helsinki, Finland; [Kanniainen, Vesa] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Ringbom, Staffan] Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; Ifo Institut; Hanken School of Economics,"Kanniainen, V (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Dept Polit & Econ Studies, Helsinki, Finland.",vesa.kanniainen@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Robustness of the empirical analysis is established through both two-stage least squares and generalized method of movements techniques. The results of this article show that the size of the economy, breadth and depth of the banking system, the monetary policy stance, the degree of openness, the level of corruption, the degree of civil liberty and status of market access to investors, all play a crucial role in the determination of the size of the domestic bond market.

A downstream firm transforms multiple complementary inputs into final products. When complementary input suppliers have market power, upstream competition within a given input market benefits not only the downstream firm, but also the complementary input suppliers, by raising complementary input prices. Thus, the downstream firm is unable to earn higher profits, even when socially efficient entry is allowed. Hence, the inefficient incumbent supplier can deter socially efficient entry by using exclusive contracts, even in the absence of scale economies, downstream competition, and relationship-specific investment.

This study was carried out based on data from 7,267 medium-sized and large industrial firms active in Poland. The main conclusion of the article is that the path from product and process innovation to success arrives through organizational and marketing innovations. A firm's market orientation is an important factor in determining its success. However, at the same time it exhibits a weak, negative influence on innovation in the fields of organizational and marketing innovation. This apparent contradiction results from the fact that in Poland the marketing orientation of a firm may depend on the activities of those in the sales department, rather than on the formal structure of this department. Moreover, such a market orientation (which depends on the individual approaches of employees) may counteract the motivation to create a costly formal system which would promote the market orientation of a firm.","[Lobos, Krzysztof] WSB Univ, Wroclaw, Poland; [Szewczyk, Miroslawa] Opole Univ Technol, Opole, Poland",Opole University of Technology,"Lobos, K (通讯作者)，WSB Univ, Wroclaw, Poland.",,,"Szewczyk, Miroslawa/0000-0002-0969-8973; Lobos, Krzysztof/0000-0002-7411-4145",,,,,96,5,5,0,17,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,2720-5088,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

From 2007 to 2010, Chengdu adopted urban-rural coordination policy by defining rural land property rights and establishing a rural land market. After 2010, Chengdu adopted an urban-rural integration strategy and allowed villager and business enterprises to participate in land consolidation. The transition from urban-rural division to urban-rural integration involves reducing systematic costs.

It may attribute to the fact that consumers self-select into purchasing houses with high- or low-density tree cover based on some unobserved systematically different characteristics. As a result, estimates from sample selection models confirm the hypothesis that purchasing a house with high-density tree cover leads to a positive price differential compared with the low-density tree cover in Napa, Los Angeles, and that buying a low-density tree cover house results in negative price differential in Napa, Los Angeles.","[Mei, Yingdan] China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, B1003 New Main Bldg,18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Hite, Diane] Auburn Univ, Coll Agr, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Sohngen, Brent] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",China University of Petroleum; Auburn University System; Auburn University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Mei, YD (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, Sch Business Adm, B1003 New Main Bldg,18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",meiyingdan@vip.sina.com,,"Sohngen, Brent/0000-0002-9094-160X",,,,,12,6,6,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

From 2001 to 2012, 65 lenders introduced 1220 mortgage products in Australia. We examine whether the product proliferation was a result of consumer demand or a response to pressure to lower lending rates. We find that consumer demand for mortgages does not have a significant relationship with the number of mortgage products, but that decreases in the policy interest rate are highly significant as an explanatory variable for product proliferation. Such behaviour is consistent with information obfuscation, reducing the ease with which consumers can compare lending rates. Further, the relationship between mortgage products offered and the policy interest rate is asymmetric: decreases in the cash rate are associated with increased mortgage products offered, but increases in the cash rate have a more muted effect on decreasing the number of products.","[Nguyen, Jeremy; Valadkhani, Abbas] Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology; Monash University,"Valadkhani, A (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Swinburne Business Sch, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",abbas@swin.edu.au,"Valadkhani, Abbas/I-6960-2019; Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019","Valadkhani, Abbas/0000-0003-2538-1949; Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462",,,,,36,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this case there are needed detail knowledges about individual variants and that is why the evaluation is carried out by experts and can be objectified their evaluation. For solving such type of the task can be employed the methods based on the thresholds of sensitivity. These methods are used to rank a finite number of decision variants especially in a case when neither a direct evaluation nor the utility theory gives satisfactory results. From this group of methods have been chosen AGREPREF method and approximation of fuzzy relations method. These methods are due to its nature suitable for evaluating variants with a set of qualitative criteria.","[Olivkova, Ivana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Transport, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava 70833, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Olivková, I (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Mech Engn, Inst Transport, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava 70833, Czech Republic.",ivana.olivkova@vsb.cz,"Olivková, Ivana/AAP-7278-2021","Olivková, Ivana/0000-0001-8052-6640",Research and Development in Transport [SP2018/110],Research and Development in Transport,This paper was supported by the internal research project SP2018/110 Research and Development in Transport.,,5,1,1,1,2,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,251,257,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500033,0

Much of this IC, such as purchased organizational, research and development (R&D) and information and communication technology capital, is unaccounted for in systems of national accounts, so that total IC investment is 29.6% of value added, with R&D having the lowest gross domestic product share at 5.0%. On average, deteriorating IC growth has decreased labor productivity by -2.9% annually. Policies fostering multifactor productivity growth have been strongly biased and have ignored the loss of those skills necessary for long-term growth. During 2008-2013, innovation thus failed to compensate for Europe's dwindling fixed-capital-intensive manufacturing and job losses, but broad-based IC offers a roadmap for recovery by relying on an increasing role for IC-producing services.","[Piekkola, Hannu] Univ Vaasa, Dept Econ, POB 700, FI-65101 Vaasa, Finland",University of Vaasa,"Piekkola, H (通讯作者)，Univ Vaasa, Dept Econ, POB 700, FI-65101 Vaasa, Finland.",hannu.piekkola@uva.fi,,,INNOMITTA II project - Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes),INNOMITTA II project - Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes),This work was supported by the INNOMITTA II project financed by the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes).,,52,16,16,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

The aim of this paper is to determine the flow of foreign direct investment into the Czech Republic and which countries are involved in the value of investments. It will also examine what foreign enterprises have been created by size and whether there has been a transformation in the sectors of the industry.It will also examine whether the growth in the number of foreign companies will lead to a rise in foreign direct investment. Based on the linear regression and correlation calculations, the dependence of the variables to be investigated should be proven or reversed. Foreign direct investment is an integral part of the development of the Czech economy, and its impact affects economic and political life in the country.

A sizeable minority of 37% of dual-users reported viewing electronic and conventional cigarettes primarily as complements. Of those who had never smoked or used electronic cigarettes, only 27% thought the complementarity motive would be primary. Dual-user motivations were associated with quit-attempt, cessation methods, gender and age. 1 year on, there was a positive relationship between the level of complementarity in the dual-user's motives and their change in self-reported traditional cigarette consumption. It is concluded that the application of a canonical economic classification of preferences may reveal important heterogeneities among the dual-user population.","[Ronayne, David; Sgroi, Daniel] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Ronayne, David] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, 1 New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Ronayne, David] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, 1 New Rd, Oxford OX1 1NF, England",University of Warwick; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Sgroi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",daniel.sgroi@warwick.ac.uk,"Sgroi, Daniel/D-3449-2012","Sgroi, Daniel/0000-0001-9575-2640; Ronayne, David/0000-0002-5616-1343",Warwick Policy Lab at the University of Warwick; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Warwick Policy Lab at the University of Warwick; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Warwick Policy Lab at the University of Warwick,,20,2,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The relative strength of the UK economy and the banking sector vis-a-vis the EU is taken under consideration. Our results confirm predictions in the relevant literature regarding the output cost of Brexit, with particular emphasis on the EU, and show that financial stability is an important issue, with the banking system suffering significant losses on both sides, particularly over the longer term. Our findings also suggest that policymakers should take into account dynamic effects that may be caused by UK banks moving to the EU after Brexit.

This paper identifies the currency in a currency pair that is experiencing explosive dynamics by also considering the dynamics of effective exchange rates of different currencies.

We find substantial spatial propagation in the temporal dynamics of international transmission of shocks amidst the manifestations of cross-border global value chains (GVCs) with China's accession into the WTO. We provide evidence for the significance of EPU of China and the United States, particularly the latter, in influencing global trade flows. Our results show that while the US impacts can largely be attributed to its indirect trade linkages with other economies, the impacts of China can be relegated more to its direct GVC linkages.

Such methods and results can be used to prioritize efficiency improvement efforts at an industry supply-chain level. This paper utilizes data on manufacturing inventory along with data on inter-industry interactions to develop a method for tracking industry-level flow time and identifying bottlenecks in US manufacturing.

Despite the noble intentions, the GPFG is loaded with inconsistencies, especially because its resources come from the exploitation of fossil fuels that contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the entire Norwegian environmental policy is fragmented and suffers from contradictions.","[Wirth, Eszter] Univ Pontificia Comillas ICAD, Madrid, Spain",,"Wirth, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pontificia Comillas ICAD, Madrid, Spain.",ewirth@comillas.edu,,"Wirth, Eszter/0000-0002-3139-6154",,,,,54,1,1,3,14,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

Concerned about the potential for a burst bubble, the Chinese government has been intervening in the market to rein in the rising price trend since 2010. In March 2017, a new housing policy, called house-sale restriction, was developed to curtail speculation in the Chinese housing market. This study uses a difference-in-difference model to examine the policy effect of this new restriction. By using house-sale and price data of 43 cities across 30 provinces in China, we find that house-sale restrictions could effectively reduce speculation in the market as well as decrease housing prices in the short term. This study analyses only the short-term effect of this new housing policy; the long-term effect requires further examination.","[Yan Yan; Ouyang Hongbing] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Yan, Y (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",freyamax@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,14,16,6,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The equilibrium value is estimated using the behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) approach to determine whether the yen is more misaligned during the Abenomics period. Economic fundamentals such as terms of trade, relative price of nontraded to traded goods, net foreign asset ratio over trade volume, and real interest rate differentials are used to assess the equilibrium exchange rate. Because parameter instability is detected for the whole period (1993 Q1-2016 Q2), stable estimation results for the subsample period (2003 Q1-2016 Q2) are used to compute misalignments. The results indicate that the yen was substantially overvalued during the global financial crisis period (2008 Q4-2012 Q4). In contrast, it was undervalued during the Abenomics period (2013 Q1-2016 Q2) but was much less misaligned than in pre-Abenomics periods. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The literature on choice modelling which informs the decision making process implicitly assumes that individuals are both aware of and familiar with the alternatives being assessed. As far as we are aware, there is limited experience of the role that familiarity and awareness play in conditioning the choice behaviour of individuals. This paper investigates the role of awareness and familiarity in a context of growing interest, namely road pricing reform. Specifically, we analyse how the level of familiarity with the road pricing debate and the awareness of what road pricing means might influence the preferences of individuals for cordon-based and distance-based charging regimes, in contrast to the status quo. Familiarity and awareness are introduced into a choice model that allows for risk attitude, source preference and perceptual conditioning from the attribute level's variation over repeated occurrences, as well as the perceived acceptability of the proposed scenarios. The data was collected in Sydney using a survey that contrasted the current road pricing situation with cordon-based and distance-based charging regimes. The model structure considers familiarity and awareness as endogenous variables. The final model identifies statistically significant roles for user charging fees and how revenue raised is to be spent. The endogenous consideration of awareness and familiarity together with risk attitude and perceptual conditioning through beliefs, provide significant information in improving our understanding of how individuals respond through preference revelation to a number of road pricing reforms.","[Balbontin, Camila; Hensher, David A.; Collins, Andrew T.] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Balbontin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",c.balbontin@econ.usyd.edu.au; david.hensher@sydney.edu.au; andrew.collins@sydney.edu.au,"Balbontin, Camila/ECM-0598-2022","Balbontin, Camila/0000-0001-8985-9070; Collins, Andrew/0000-0002-2500-250X; Hensher, David/0000-0003-0058-2242",CONICYT PAI/INDUSTRIA [79090016]; Australian Research Council [DP140100909],CONICYT PAI/INDUSTRIA; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This research was partially funded by the CONICYT PAI/INDUSTRIA 79090016.

We examine the patterns of variation in the immigrant-native poverty gap between and within countries. We simultaneously combine characteristics of households from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and some key country-specific factors, distinguishing among mixed and non-mixed immigrant households and natives. The main findings for 2012 reveal that immigrants, especially non-mixed immigrant households, are exposed to a higher risk of poverty than natives, though this gap varies across countries. We find evidence of significant household-level effects, but the contribution of country-level variables to explain cross-country differences in the poverty gap is substantially higher. Concerning household characteristics, employment and being young have less effect (positive and negative, respectively) on immigrants than on natives, while each additional child has a more negative effect. Education seems to have a lower effect on the likelihood of being poor for non-mixed immigrant households than for natives and owning a house reduces this likelihood more for non-mixed immigrant households. In terms of country-level factors, labour market and social benefits seem to be equally important for both natives and immigrants. We also compare the results in 2012 with those for 2007 to check for possible changes over time related to the influence of the economic cycle on the poverty gap and/or on the importance of household- and country-level factors.","[Barcena-Martin, E.] Univ Malaga, Dept Stat & Econometr, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain; [Perez-Moreno, S.] Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ Econ Policy, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga; Universidad de Malaga,"Pérez-Moreno, S (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ Econ Policy, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",barcenae@uma.es; sperezmoreno@uma.es,"Pérez Moreno, Salvador/H-2290-2015; Barcena-Martin, Elena/J-4833-2013","Pérez Moreno, Salvador/0000-0001-5207-7219; Barcena-Martin, Elena/0000-0002-6381-7507","Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies; University of Malaga through the III Plan Propio de Investigacion; Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2012-33993]; Fundacion Ramon Areces, XI Concurso Nacional para la Adjudicacion de Ayudas a la Investigacion en Ciencias Sociales","Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies; University of Malaga through the III Plan Propio de Investigacion(University of Malaga); Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government); Fundacion Ramon Areces, XI Concurso Nacional para la Adjudicacion de Ayudas a la Investigacion en Ciencias Sociales","Elena Barcena-Martin and Salvador Perez-Moreno gratefully acknowledge the useful comments and advices of Rafael Munoz de Bustillo, Jose Ignacio Anton and two anonymous referees, as well as the financial support provided by the Spanish Institute for Fiscal Studies and by the University of Malaga through the III Plan Propio de Investigacion.

As a robustness check, we also estimate standard OLS regressions (linear probability models), reduced form OLS regressions, and OLS regressions with the inclusion of a control function (each with and without family-specific fixed effects). Our micro-level data are drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal birth-cohort of relatively disadvantaged urban children who have been followed from birth to age nine.

We investigated the effect of pain on decision making by delivering acute thermal pain to participants' forearm while they made risky and intertemporal choices involving money. Participants (n = 107) were more risk seeking under pain than in a no-pain control condition when decisions involved gains but not when they involved equivalent losses. Pain also resulted in greater preference for immediate (smaller) over future (larger) monetary rewards. We interpret these results as a motivation to offset the aversive, pain-induced state, where monetary rewards become more appealing under pain than under no pain and when delivered sooner rather than later. Our findings add to the long-standing debate regarding the role of intuition and reflection in decision making.","[Koppel, Lina; Andersson, David; Morrison, India; Vastfjall, Daniel; Tinghog, Gustav] Linkoping Univ, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Ctr Social & Affect Neurosci, Linkoping, Sweden; [Koppel, Lina; Andersson, David; Posadzy, Kinga; Vastfjall, Daniel; Tinghog, Gustav] Linkoping Univ, Div Econ, Dept Management & Engn, JEDI Lab, Linkoping, Sweden; [Vastfjall, Daniel] Linkoping Univ, Div Psychol, Dept Behav Sci & Learning, Linkoping, Sweden; [Vastfjall, Daniel] Decis Res, Eugene, OR USA; [Tinghog, Gustav] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Natl Ctr Prior Setting Hlth Care, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Tinghög, G (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Ctr Social & Affect Neurosci, Linkoping, Sweden.;Tinghög, G (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Div Econ, Dept Management & Engn, JEDI Lab, Linkoping, Sweden.;Tinghög, G (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Natl Ctr Prior Setting Hlth Care, Linkoping, Sweden.",gustav.tinghog@liu.se,"Tinghög, Gustav/K-2961-2012; Barrafrem, Kinga/AAU-4205-2020; Västfjäll, Daniel/F-9629-2014","Tinghög, Gustav/0000-0002-8159-1249; Barrafrem, Kinga/0000-0003-3171-8640; Vastfjall, Daniel/0000-0003-2873-4500",Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation,This research was funded by the Ragnar Soderberg Foundation and Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation.,,41,33,38,3,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

This paper suggests an improvement to the SNA treatment of MNEs by proposing an SNA framework that offers a dual presentation of measures on operating entities and measures on special purpose entities. A dual presentation adds information to better understand the role of MNEs and special purpose entities in national accounts. Nevertheless, the proposal also yields a meaningful departure from current SNA recommendations and current practice by statistical compilers, which requires careful consideration of practical matters before implementation is feasible.","[Rassier, Dylan G.] US Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC USA",,"Rassier, DG (通讯作者)，US Dept Commerce, Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",dylan.rassier@bea.gov,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Using this framework, it looks into the relationship between industrialization and regional economic integration in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It also looks at how asymmetric economic integration with advanced economies has affected industrialization and symmetric economic integration in Africa. Based on historical evidence, the paper concludes that there is a positive, circular and cumulative relationship between industrialization and regional economic integration in SSA. It also concludes that the asymmetric economic integration of SSA economies with advanced ones has had negative, circular and cumulative impact on industrialization and (symmetric) economic integration in SSA. Therefore, it argues that, if industrialization and transformative REI is to take place in SSA, there is a need for making context-specific, dynamic and transformative industrial policies as center pieces of development strategies, for rethinking REI initiatives in such a way that they facilitate and amplify the effectiveness of these industrial policies and strategies, and for replacing the legacies of colonialism and neoliberal globalization with strategic integration of SSA economies vis. advanced economies.

Countries seeking to reduce variation in tax revenues as well as raise revenue to solve deficits often consider a VAT, and the IMF in particular has become an advocate for the tax for countries seeking tax reform. For all its popularity, its ability to deliver on these promises remains understudied. Countries with a lower cost of raising funds may instead choose to spend more instead of paying down their debts. This paper uses matching techniques to estimate the impact of a VAT on government debts and deficits. The tax is associated with falls in central government debt and deficits as well as expenditures as a share of GDP. There is limited evidence of increases in tax revenue and increases in stability of government spending. The choice of VAT rate is positively correlated with deficit reduction, and the effects of the tax are heterogeneous with respect to the probability of adoption of the treatment and what taxes it is replacing.","[Ufier, Alex] Fed Deposit Insurance Corp, Div Insurance & Res, Ctr Financial Res, 550 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20429 USA",Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),"Ufier, A (通讯作者)，Fed Deposit Insurance Corp, Div Insurance & Res, Ctr Financial Res, 550 17th St NW, Washington, DC 20429 USA.",aufier@fdic.gov,,"Ufier, Alexander/0000-0001-9436-4152",Center for Financial Research in the Division of Insurance and Research at the FDIC,Center for Financial Research in the Division of Insurance and Research at the FDIC,"I would like to thank my committee members Kevin Grier, Robin Grier, Dan Hicks, Greg Burge, and Scott Linn for help on this paper.

In our analysis, we consider these effects according to two dimensions: a quantity one that captures whether there was an intensification of trade and a quality one that captures changes in the sophistication of the traded goods. The research employs disaggregated trade data obtained from UN Comtrade for 17 Latin American countries between 1996 and 2011. We find evidence that an increase in the importation of parts and components from Latin America had positive impacts on both the quantity and quality dimensions. Subregional heterogeneities revealed that, in general, imports from East Asia had positive effects on the quantity dimension, nurturing the expansion of machinery production networks inside Latin America, and on the quality dimension, increasing the sophistication of the products traded inside Latin America, especially for Mercosur member exports. Imports from North America had positive quantity effects, especially for exports of countries from the Andean Community, Central America, Chile, and Mexico.","[Chang, Mateus Silva] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University,"Chang, MS (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",mateus.chang@keio.jp,,,Keio University; MEXT; Keio Economic Society,"Keio University; MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Keio Economic Society","I deeply appreciate the valuable comments from professors Fukunari Kimura, Kozo Kiyota, Toshihiro Okubo, Colin McKenzie, Masao Ogaki, and Yoshimasa Shirai from Keio University.

We find two types of social information to be particularly effective in reducing traffic violations: the driving behavior of those similar to oneself and the driving behavior of those with high-status cars.

We propose an empirical approach to derive mathematical functional forms that link survey expectations to economic growth. Combining symbolic regression with genetic programming we generate two survey-based indicators: a perceptions index, using agents' assessments about the present, and an expectations index with their expectations about the future. In order to find the optimal combination of both indexes that best replicates the evolution of economic activity in each country we use a portfolio management procedure known as index tracking. By means of a generalized reduced gradient algorithm we derive the relative weights of both indexes. In most economies, the survey-based predictions generated with the composite indicator outperform the benchmark model for one-quarter ahead forecasts, although these improvements are only significant in Austria, Belgium and Portugal.","[Claveria, Oscar] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Inst Res Appl Reg & Publ Econ, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Monte, Enric] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Signal Theory & Commun, Jordi Girona 1-3, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Torra, Salvador] Univ Barcelona, IREA, Riskctr, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; University of Barcelona,"Claveria, O (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA Inst Res Appl Reg & Publ Econ, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",oclaveria@ub.edu; enric.monte@upc.edu; storra@ub.edu,"Claveria, Oscar/G-6741-2014; Torra, Salvador/A-3601-2015","Claveria, Oscar/0000-0001-9740-1852; Torra, Salvador/0000-0002-8786-8800","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-75805-R, TEC2015-692666-P]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"Oscar Claveria (corresponding author): AQR-IREA (Institute for Research on Applied Regional and Public Economics), University of Barcelona, Diagonal, 690, 08034 Barcelona, Spain; e-mail oclaveria@ub.edu.

Unexpectedly, the new government offered primary schools the chance to have 'the freedom and the power to take control of their own destiny', with better performing schools given a green light to fast track convert to become an academy school. In England, schools that become academies have more freedom over many ways in which they operate, including curriculum design, budgets, staffing issues and the shape of the academic year. However, the change to allow primary school academisation has been controversial. This paper reports estimates of the causal effect of academy enrolment on primary school pupils. While the international literature provides growing evidence on the effect of school autonomy in a variety of contexts, little is known about the effect of autonomy on primary schools (which are typically much smaller than secondary schools) and in contexts where the converting school is not deemed to be failing or disadvantaged. The key findings are that English primary schools did change their mode of operation after the exogenous policy change, utilising more autonomy and changing spending behaviour, but this did not lead to improved pupil performance.

J,"Grenville, S",,,,"Grenville, Stephen",,,The Asian crisis: what did we learn and when did we learn it?,ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper steps back from the detail of the Asian crisis, to ask whether the 1997 crisis advanced our broad understanding of the age-old problem of economic crises. Some immediate lessons were learned from the failures of the crisis-response in Indonesia, which was the worst-affected economy. It is notable, however, how little changed to address the ongoing systemic weaknesses. Three areas of unresolved vulnerability can be identified. First, the sudden stops and reversals of international capital flows. Second, the intrinsic fragility of a financial system that borrows short and lends long. Third, unanchored exchange rates, where the market's price-discovery can take the rate to levels far from equilibrium, for sustained periods. For more than a decade after the Asian crisis, international capital flows continued to be seen as unambiguously beneficial, with any attempts at capital flow management rejected. At a global level, it was not until the 2008 financial crisis that widespread financial fragility was addressed through tighter regulation and higher capital requirements. On exchange rates, misleading advocacy of corner solutionseither pure floating exchange rates or immutable fixed ratescontinued in the face of the real-world experience that sometimes intervention is needed to maintain an exchange rate close to equilibrium.","[Grenville, Stephen] Lowy Inst Int Policy, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Grenville, S (通讯作者)，Lowy Inst Int Policy, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",stephengrenville1@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Focusing on whether and how aspirations impact the welfare effect of a transfer, we demonstrate the following results. First, when the donor forms aspirations, as the degree of his/her aspirations to their parents increases, a transfer is more likely to cause donor enrichment. However, this does not affect the recipient's welfare at all. In contrast, when the recipient forms aspirations, whether the increase in the degree of these aspirations causes immiserization depends on whether the transfer raises the recipient's consumption. Second, we show that if the donor's or recipient's marginal utility increases with their respective aspirations, the transfer is more likely to cause recipient immiserization. However, whether donor enrichment occurs depends on the situation. These results imply that there are two types of effects that aspirations can have on the welfare of both countries: effects caused by the aspirations, and effects that occur through the capital market. Furthermore, we find that these two effects on welfare do not necessarily work in the same direction.","[Hamada, Kojun] Niigata Univ, Fac Econ, Nishi Ku, 8050 Ikarashi 2 No Cho, Niigata, Niigata 9502181, Japan; [Shinozaki, Tsuyoshi] Tohoku Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Aoba Ku, 1-3-1 Tsuchitoi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808511, Japan; [Yanagihara, Mitsuyoshi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan",Niigata University; Tohoku Gakuin University; Nagoya University,"Yanagihara, M (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",yanagi@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"Shinozaki, Tsuyoshi/AAD-9284-2020; Hamada, Kojun/I-9461-2019","Hamada, Kojun/0000-0002-4684-5477","JSPS KAKENHI [16K03615, 16H03612, 24530262, 26380360, 15K03449]; Nagai Foundation for Science and Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03449, 26380360, 24530262, 16K03615] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Nagai Foundation for Science and Technology; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank Ichiro Daitoh, Ken-ichi Hashimoto, Akihiko Kaneko, Hideya Kato, Junya Masuda, Noritsugu Nakanishi, Yasuhiro Takarada, and Akihiko Yanase, as well as the seminar participants of the 31st Nagoya International Economic Study Group (NIESG) International Economics Seminar in Kushiro Public University of Economics and the 3rd Spring Conference of the Japan Society of International Economics (JSIE) in Fukuoka University for their helpful comments and suggestions.

One core assumption in statements of this calibration puzzle is that small-stakes risk aversion is observed over all levels of wealth, or over a sufficiently large range of wealth. Although this assumption is viewed as self-evident from the vast experimental literature showing risk aversion over laboratory stakes, it actually requires that lab wealth be varied for a given subject as one evaluates the risk attitudes of the subject. We consider evidence from a simple design that tests this assumption, and find that the assumption is strikingly rejected for a large sample of subjects from a population of college students. We conclude that the implausible predictions that flow from these assumptions do not apply to one specialized population widely used to study economic behavior in laboratory experiments.

Using a regression discontinuity strategy and focusing on state education spending, we find that Democratic and Republican governors allocate spending differently. In particular, school districts with higher shares of minority students receive larger state transfers than other districts under Democratic governors. A similar pattern occurs in state transfers to higher education institutions. This is true regardless of whether the governor is eligible for reelection; we find no evidence that Democrat governors are simply sending money to areas with a larger share of Democrats. These results suggest that the observed policy divergence is driven by differences in preferences of elected candidates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By comparing potential water demand with estimates of (sustainable) water availability in different regions, we identify regions that are likely to be constrained in their future economic growth potential by the scarcity of water resources. We assess the macroeconomic impact of water scarcity under alternative allocation rules finding that, by assigning more water to sectors in which it has a higher value, shifting production to less water intensive sectors, and importing more water intensive goods, constrained regions can effectively neutralize these water related climate risks and adapt to a changing water environment. However, this adaptation effort is likely to imply some radical changes in water management policies.

Innovative downstream firms create value and profit opportunities through product differentiation, which however affects an upstream monopolist's incentive to vertically integrate. By playing the downstream firms against each other for integration, the upstream firm can extract even more than the additional profits generated by the downstream firms' differentiation activities. To preempt rent extraction, the downstream firms may then reduce differentiation, which reduces social welfare. We show that this social cost of vertical integration is more likely to arise in innovative and competitive industries, and that the competition for integration channel of downstream rent extraction is robust to upstream competition.

The basic assumption of such markets is the lack of correlation between returns, and therefore the existence of low entropy, the lack of randomness, manifestation of fractality and long-term memory, integrated into a single measure, will indicate the distancing from the state of efficient market. This paper proposes five different estimates (for informational entropy, run test, Hurst exponent, long-term correlation coefficient and fractal dimension) to construct a new measure of market efficiency based on a deviation from the ideal state (expressed by the efficient market). The Capital Market Efficiency Exponent is estimated for nine emerging capital markets and, for comparison, for three developed capital markets, at different stages of development over a 16-year time span.","[Camelia, Oprean] Lucian Blaga Univ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania; [Cristina, Tanasescu] Lucian Blaga Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania; [Amelia, Bucur] Lucian Blaga Univ, Dept Math & Informat, Fac Sci, Sibiu, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Cristina, T (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ, Dept Business Adm, Fac Econ, Sibiu, Romania.",cristina.tanasescu@ulbsibiu.ro,"Tanasescu, Cristina/AAM-3983-2020; Oprean-Stan, Camelia/AAL-5673-2020; Bucur, Amelia/AGU-1269-2022; Tanasescu, Cristina/ABE-9989-2020","Tanasescu, Cristina/0000-0001-8347-4014",,,,,66,8,8,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that team incentives are associated with greater behavior modification (e.g. more gym visits) than individual incentives. Information on peers' gym attendance (either in a team or individual setting) also promotes more frequent gym use relative to a simple individual incentive. In addition, being in a team and receiving information on peers are effective in changing a non-user of the gym to a user. We also observe that periodic information feedback has a longer-lasting impact on gym attendance than other interventions.

Is this compensation for risk or for unobserved abilities? To answer this question we embed a Roy model into an incomplete markets equilibrium framework that features risk averse individuals who face industry -specific idiosyncratic shocks to their labor earnings. The interaction between earnings shocks and an individual's comparative advantage determines the optimal industry choice. Compensation for permanent shocks to labor earnings represents about two thirds of the observed correlation. There is no compensation for temporary risk. Compensation for risk explains about 40% of observed cross-industry differences in residual labor earnings. Additionally, workers accumulate different levels of wealth depending on their chosen industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Intuitively, our model shows that donors should stay in control of how their aid is spent when their own private information is more important than the private information of the recipient. Less obviously, an increase in the difference of preferences between donors and recipients can increase rather than decrease the leeway that donors should grant the recipients, as the recipients' information gains in importance relative to those of the donors, and recipients become less likely to communicate truthfully. We test the model using dyadic data for 28 bilateral aid donors and 112 recipients, over the 1995-2010 period. Our proxy for centralized aid is project aid, while budget aid leaves more leeway to the recipient and thus proxies for decentralized aid. In line with the model, misaligned interests and informational asymmetries indeed influence the shares of aid given as budget and project aid.","[Dreher, Axel; Langlotz, Sarah] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Marchesi, Silvia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantitat & Strategie Im, I-20126 Milan, Italy",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Dreher, A (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Econ, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.",mail@axel-dreher.de; sarah.langlotz@awi.uni-heidelberg.de; silvia.marchesi@unimib.it,"Dreher, Axel/AAN-1839-2020; Langlotz, Sarah/AAJ-7283-2020; Marchesi, Silvia/ABA-5366-2021","Dreher, Axel/0000-0002-7227-3599; Marchesi, Silvia/0000-0003-0748-7176",,,,,72,7,7,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

One of them is proposed by Moore (1992) and the other by Perry and Reny (1999). The objective of each mechanism is to allocate a single unit of an indivisible private good to the player with the highest reservation value at zero cost to her. Implemented in an environment with complete information Moore's mechanism, compared with Perry and Reny's mechanism, shows a lower rate of wasteful use of resources, but we could not find evidence that this mechanism has a better rate in allocating the object to the right player. The use of either the ascending clock or the slow ascending clock improves the performance of Perry and Reny's mechanism in allocating the object to the right player at zero cost in both informational environments. Finally, we find evidence of a higher likelihood of low value players staying with the object when their valuation for the object increases and when they know the valuation of their opponents; however, the monetary amount they have to pay for staying with the object plays a relevant role in this decision.

We compare the two models using four different approaches: (i) four goodness-of-fit graphical plots, (ii) a bootstrapped correlation matrix generated in each scenario with the empirical correlation matrix used as a benchmark, (iii) Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) as risk measures, and (iv) co Value -at-Risk (CoVaR) and Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) as co-risk measures. We illustrate this four-step procedure using a portfolio of daily returns of six international stock indices. The VaR results confirm that the t based copula model is an attractive alternative to the Gaussian. The ES analysis is less conclusive, and indicates that risk managers should jointly use the risk measure as well as the copula model. The results highlight the importance of promoting stress testing rather than ES in the risk management industry, particularly in the aftermath of a financial crisis.","[Lourme, Alexandre] Univ Bordeaux, Dept Econ, Bordeaux, France; [Maurer, Frantz] KEDGE Business Sch, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France; [Maurer, Frantz] Univ Bordeaux, IRGO, EA4190, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France",Universite de Bordeaux; Kedge Business School; Universite de Bordeaux,"Maurer, F (通讯作者)，KEDGE Business Sch, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.;Maurer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, IRGO, EA4190, 680 Cours Liberat, F-33405 Talence, France.",frantz.maurer@kedgebs.com,,,,,,,46,16,16,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The i is taken to be the anchor for a low and stable rate of inflation in an open economy model. Yet, some analysts, orthodox and heterodox alike, have challenged this belief arguing that cas turn to the exchange rate (e) channel and adopt it as a second policy tool with the aim of meeting pi(0) (Svensson, 1999; Hufner, 2004). The purpose of this paper is to show that the veritable anchor of inflation is neither i nor e, but the wage rate and the unit labour costs (ULC). We conduct econometric analyses based on data from a set of inflation targeting countries.

Sigma and Beta estimation strategies are used to provide between and within cross-country dispersions. The empirical evidence is based on: time, regions, income levels, resource-wealth, state fragility and time-consistent growth quality (GQ) performance. First, for 'within dispersions' the following outcomes are established: (1) GQ dispersions within fundamental characteristics have been decreasing over time, (2) From a time-dynamic view, countries within Asia and the Pacific have experienced the highest reduction in GQ differences while nations in the Middle East and North Africa (Central and Eastern European) region have witnessed the highest (lowest) differences, (3) From an income perspective, upper-middle-income (Low-income) countries have the lowest (highest) differences in GQ. (4) Resource-rich and Non-fragile countries have higher differences relative to their Resource-poor and Fragile counterparts respectively. Second, for 'between dispersions' and policy syndromes, we found two time-consistent extremities. (1) In decreasing need of policy intervention, the following are apparent for the Policy syndrome extreme: Hopeful, Fragile, Sub-Saharan African, Low-income and Resource-rich countries. (2) In the same line of policy inference, the following are apparent for the Syndrome-free extreme: Central and Eastern European, Asia and the Pacific, Latin American, Best Performing and Upper-middle-income countries.

Our identification does not rely on zero impact restrictions typically used in the literature for recovering news shocks.

We explore these results using U.S. Naval Academy data covering a 17-year history of the random assignment of students to peer groups.

I propose a model to study the implications of the protection technology on the prevalence of infections and on welfare at different levels of exposure. I find that the effect of aggregate exposure on prevalence and on protection inefficiencies depends crucially on the characteristics of the available protection technology. For example, a vaccine may yield lower infection rates and smaller costs of decentralization as exposure increases, but only if the protection it provides is sufficiently long lasting. Other protection technologies, such as those used for cybersecurity, may lead to coordination failures. The analysis has implications for disease eradication, the desirability of interventions with and without universal vaccines, and coordination failures in cybersecurity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We find an average pass-through rate of around 60%. This significantly varies with demand factors: while the pass-through rate to baseline tariffs, where firms have greater market power because customers are less willing to switch, is only 50%, it increases to 70% in the competitive segment of the market. Although the pass through rate of independent firms is significantly higher than that of other firms in the competitive market segment, the extent of supply-side heterogeneity is limited. Thus, the firms' ability to exercise market power and reduce pass-through appears to be constrained by competition and largely determined by demand side factors. Finally, we find that the pass-through rate in the competitive market segment has been approaching unity over the past years, indicating a rise in competitive pressure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Immigrants provide a natural source of entrepreneurship, both in the US and in Africa, which suggests that making African cities more livable can generate economic benefits by attracting talent.

Results are obtained for a general class of payoff functions, which subsumes the linear-quadratic specification frequently used in theoretical and applied work. We assume homogeneous agents and characterize equilibria for two-sided and one-sided link formation. (Pairwise) Nash equilibrium networks are nested split graphs, which are a strict subset of core-periphery networks. We highlight the relevance of the convexity of the value function for obtaining these structures. More central agents are shown to exert more effort and obtain higher gross payoffs in equilibrium. However, net of linking cost, central agents may obtain strictly lower net payoffs. The curvature of the value function is also important for efficiency considerations. These findings are relevant for many social and economic phenomena, such as educational attainment, criminal activity, labor market participation, and R&D expenditures of firms.

Ad hoc fiscal rules might imply substantial welfare costs; the goal is to analyze the magnitude of these costs by quantitatively evaluating the relative welfare sub-optimality of these rules. I posit a closed form solution for the infinite horizon consumption problem of the planner of a resource-rich economy with resource price uncertainty and precautionary saving. The model is subsequently calibrated and simulated to provide a welfare-based comparison between the fiscal rules based on the Permanent Income Hypothesis and on the ad hoc Bird-in-Hand policy. The results of the simulation indicate the presence of a positive and substantial welfare loss suffered from switching to the Bird-in-Hand rule.

By modeling contests as incomplete information all-pay auctions with linear costs, we analytically and experimentally show that the expected maximum effort is higher in simultaneous contests, in which contestants choose their effort levels independently and simultaneously, than in sequential contests, in which late entrants make their effort choices after observing all prior participants' choices. Our experimental results also show that efficiency is higher in simultaneous contests than in sequential ones. Sequential contests' efficiency drops significantly as the number of contestants increases. We also discover that when participants' ability follows a power distribution, high ability players facing multiple opponents in simultaneous contests tend to under-exert effort, compared to theoretical predictions.

An Inquiry into the Decline of the US Labor Force Participation Rate,BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNITED-STATES; EMPLOYMENT; EARNINGS; UNEMPLOYMENT; TAXATION; GROWTH; TRENDS; SKILLS; LIFE; RISE,"The U.S. labor force participation rate has declined since 2007, primarily because of population aging and ongoing trends that preceded the Great Recession. The labor force participation rate has evolved differently, and for different reasons, across demographic groups. A rise in school enrollment has largely offset declining labor force participation for young workers since the 1990s. Labor force participation has been declining for prime age men for decades, and about half of prime age men who are not in the labor force may have a serious health condition that is a barrier to working. Nearly half of prime age men who are not in the labor force take pain medication on any given day; and in nearly two-thirds of these cases, they take prescription pain medication. Labor force participation has fallen more in U.S. counties where relatively more opioid pain medication is prescribed, causing the problem of depressed labor force participation and the opioid crisis to become intertwined. The labor force participation rate has stopped rising for cohorts of women born after 1960. Prime age men who are out of the labor force report that they experience notably low levels of emotional well-being throughout their days, and that they derive relatively little meaning from their daily activities. Employed women and women not in the labor force, by contrast, report similar levels of subjective well-being; but women not in the labor force who cite a reason other than home responsibilities as their main reason report notably low levels of emotional well-being. During the past decade, retirements have increased by about the same amount as aggregate labor force participation has declined, and the retirement rate is expected to continue to rise. A meaningful rise in labor force participation will require a reversal in the secular trends affecting various demographic groups, and perhaps immigration reform.","[Krueger, Alan B.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Krueger, AB (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,NIA NIH HHS [P30 AG024928] Funding Source: Medline,NIA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),,,73,118,171,1,35,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

They create a network of interbank exposures by which they expose other banks to potential insolvency cascades. In this paper, we show how a regulator can use information about the financial network to devise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that captures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different impact on creating systemic risk, they are taxed differently. We call this tax a systemic risk tax (SRT). We use an equilibrium concept inspired by the matching markets literature to show analytically that this SRT induces a unique equilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient, i.e. it minimizes systemic risk given a certain transaction volume. On the other hand, we show that without this SRT multiple equilibrium matchings exist, which are generally inefficient. This allows the regulator to effectively stimulate a 'rewiring' of the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it more resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume. Moreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e.g. a Tobin-like tax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it taxes all transactions indiscriminately. A Tobin-like tax is indeed shown to have a limited effect on reducing systemic risk while it decreases transaction volume. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the competitive forecast accuracy achieved by existing point forecast models, point forecasts can only provide limited information relating to the expected level of future load. To account for the uncertainty of future load, and provide a more complete picture of the future load conditions for dispatch planning purposes, quantile forecasts can be useful. This paper proposes a computationally efficient approach to forecasting the quantiles of electricity load, which is then applied to forecasting in the National Electricity Market of Australia. The proposed model performs competitively in comparison with one industry standard and two recently proposed quantile forecasting methods. One of the main advantages of the proposed approach is the ease with the number of covariates can be expanded. This is a particularly important feature in the context of load forecasting where large numbers of important drivers are usually necessary to provide accurate load forecasts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It impedes economic growth, weakens the rule of law and undermines the legitimacy of institutions. Although it has been studied at national level from different perspectives, there is a recent growing body of research on local corruption. As far as we know, these latter studies focused on corruption and its effects on votes. However, a further question arises as to whether there is a mimetic effect on neighbouring municipalities? We employ data from Spain, and the boom in local corruption in the 2000s, to respond to this question. Specifically we have constructed a panel database (2001-2010) on local characteristics, economic factors and corruption at local level in order to achieve this. Our spatial econometrics methodology supports the hypothesis that corruption is not local-specific, and leads to two opposing outcomes: on the one hand, local corruption is contagious and the probability of being 'infected' increases by 3.1% for each corrupt neighbouring municipality; on the other hand the likelihood of a municipality being taken to court increases by 6.7% for each neighbouring municipality accused. Although the former is alarming, the latter provides hope in the fight against local corruption. (C) 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

It exploits a novel and unique dataset for Germany, a major exporting country. Due to the direct link between CO2 emissions and fuels consumed, we argue that it is necessary to employ a production function framework to consistently analyse CO2 emission intensity. We show that such an approach solves the issue of omitted variable bias that standard regressions approaches on CO2 emission intensity of firms are exposed to. Furthermore, it enables us to apply latest econometric techniques from the productivity literature to resolve the endogeneity problem of unobserved productivity and to include a measure of export activity into the estimation. Our findings suggest a positive relation between export intensity and CO2 productivity the inverse of emission intensity. This exporter's environmental premium holds for most of the German manufacturing industries at the two-digit level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It sets within the same theoretical framework the fact that both the sectoral concentration of manufacturing activities and the internal structure of the whole economy do change in the course of industrial development, and shows that the speed of such transformations depends upon the time at which industrial development has taken place. In particular, for late industrializing countries the intra- and inter-sectoral structural adjustments have been significantly faster as compared to those experienced by nations that built their manufacturing base in earlier times. These results have strong implications for the current debate on early deindustrialization.

The approach depends on two identifying assumptions and a functional description for transfer payments that can be estimated using common publicly available data sources. We use this approach to evaluate tax implicit equivalence scales for the tax-transfer systems of 12 European countries that applied in 2012. Cross-country averages for the tax implicit scales generate a surprising set of stylised results: at low incomes, each additional household member increases the tax implicit scale by approximately 0.5, relative to 1.0 for the first adult; at high incomes, the average tax implicit scales describe variation that is remarkably similar to the modified OECD scale. However, substantial cross-country variation underlies these average scales, suggesting important differences in value judgements implicit in the respective tax-transfer systems; differences that can otherwise be difficult to discern when systems are complex and opaque.","[van de Ven, Justin; Herault, Nicolas; Azpitarte, Francisco] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [van de Ven, Justin] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England; [Azpitarte, Francisco] Brotherhood St Laurence, 67 Brunswick St, Fitzroy, Vic 3065, Australia",University of Melbourne,"van de Ven, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.;van de Ven, J (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London SW1P 3HE, England.",justin.ven@simdynamics.org,"Herault, Nicolas/K-7080-2012; Azpitarte, Francisco/F-2170-2016","Herault, Nicolas/0000-0003-2080-0390; Azpitarte, Francisco/0000-0002-2688-6933","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacio n [ECO2008-03484-C0201/ECON, ECO2010-21668-C03-03]; Xunta de Galicia [10SEC300023PR]; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course [CE140100027]",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacio n(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course(Australian Research Council),"Azpitarte acknowledges financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacio n (grants ECO2008-03484-C0201/ECON and ECO2010-21668-C03-03) and the Xunta de Galicia (10SEC300023PR).

To alleviate these problems he proposes the adoption of one of the indices developed by Chakravarty (2003). In this paper I identify the following paradox: while the Chakravarty indices clearly exhibit more sensible tradeoffs than the HDI, the HDI produces more sensible rankings than the Chakravarty indices. To solve the paradox I identify the axioms behind each methodology responsible for the unintuitive tradeoffs and rankings and illustrate how to develop an index with these questionable axioms removed. This approach can result in methodologies that exhibit more intuitive tradeoffs by design, as it seeks inputs from the public as to what those tradeoffs ought to be, and produces rankings that are more in line with what the HDI wishes to measure: human development and capabilities, as conceptualized by Sen (1985).","[Zambrano, Eduardo] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Zambrano, E (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Econ, Orfalea Coll Business, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",ezambran@calpoly.edu,,"Zambrano, Eduardo/0000-0002-5991-9105",UNDP; Orfalea College of Business,UNDP; Orfalea College of Business,"Part of the content of this paper circulated in 2011 as the HDRO-UNDP Working Paper 2011/10 entitled Functionings, Capabilites and the 2010 Human Development Index (Zambrano, 2011).

The negative impact is larger among lower achieving students (but not among immigrant students), the same students who are most prone to attend voucher schools. For high achieving students, the voucher school impact is around zero. Comparing internal and external evaluations of the exact same standardized tests, we find that voucher schools are 0.14 standard deviations more generous than municipal schools in their internal test grading. The greater leniency in test grading is more pronounced among students at academic than at vocational programs.

In the United States, households' access to TDA exhibits substantial heterogeneity: 401(k) has a higher contribution limit than IRA, but only 50% of workers are eligibility for it. I developed an overlapping-generations model that captures the tax benefits of TDA and the heterogeneity in 401(k) eligibility to investigate the quantitative impacts of TDA on the aggregate economy and their implications on policy reforms. Experiment results show that IRA already provides sufficient tax benefits for most households. The effects of providing universal 401(k) are relatively insignificant because households who can benefit from 401(k) already have access to it. On the other hand, raising the TDA contribution limit allows high-income households to increase their use of TDA and results in stronger effects on the economy. When households' use of TDA is considered, the U.S. income tax system is less distortionary and the welfare gain from a consumption tax reform is reduced by more than half.

The findings from the two different approaches are congruent, in that there is no asymmetry of tail dependence and no asymmetric conditional volatility in crude oil returns over the two different sample periods.

The use of such technologies as well as land and labour productivity are rising as a consequence. Nonetheless, both have to increase much faster to meet growing food and non-food demands in part through the further expansion of modern input use. This paper explores the role of individuals' locus of control as a potential complementary avenue to promote the adoption of such technologies. Using data from several large surveys in rural Ethiopia, it first measure locus of control and find evidence of 'external' locus of control among a substantial fraction of rural households. An ordered-choice framework is subsequently employed to estimate these households' propensity of technology adoption. The empirical specification extends the standard model by explicitly including locus of control measures. Associations between modern inputs use and factors conventionally deemed important (such as access to extension, household wealth and agro-ecology) are uncovered. Moreover, the results provide strongly suggestive evidence that lower internal and higher 'external' locus of control respectively dampen the propensity to adopt modern farming technology. These new findings indicate that locus of control and related psychological traits may serve as a complementary pathway to influence farmers' choices in production technology and beyond.","[Taffesse, Alemayehu Seyoum; Tadesse, Fanaye] Int Food Policy Res Inst, ESSP, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Taffesse, AS (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, ESSP, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",a.seyoumtaffesse@cgiar.org,,,Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (CSA); World Bank; Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP); United Stated Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Ethiopia; IFPRI's Ethiopian Strategic Support Program,Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (CSA); World Bank(The World Bank India); Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP); United Stated Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Ethiopia(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); IFPRI's Ethiopian Strategic Support Program,"This paper was prepared for the 42nd plenary session for the AERC's Biannual Research Workshop under the theme Agriculture and Structural Transformation in Africa in November 2015.

The results of the evaluation of the 27 identified metropolises were generalized using a typology of their inclusion within the framework of the listed components: most metropolises were classified as type B - an established metropolis, followed by type C - an elementary metropolis, and type A - a dominant metropolis.

Late-bidding by buyers arises not to snipe each other, but to snipe the shill bids. We allow the number of bidders in the auction to be random and model a continuous bid arrival process. We show the existence of late-bidding equilibrium. Next, we characterize all equilibria under a natural monotonicity condition and show that they all involve sniping with positive probability.

This paper considers reverse causality, from prices - and more generally, from demand - to integration in a model of a dynamic oligopoly. If integration is costly but enhances productive efficiency, then a trend of rising prices and increasing integration could be due to growing demand, in which case a divorcement policy of forced divestiture may be counterproductive.

In a canonical New-Keynesian DSGE model, we carry out a positive analysis by employing Bayesian methods to estimate three main categories of monetary policy rules, namely a Taylor-type interest rate rule, a money growth rule and an expanded Taylor rule with money. Based on China's quarterly data from 1996Q2 to 2015Q4, our estimation shows that the expanded Taylor rule obtains the best empirical fit to the data. Moreover, impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions demonstrate that monetary policy rules with or without money provide very different implications for the policy behavior. Our results ultimately suggest that money has so far been more closely targeted than nominal interest rate and still plays an important role as a monetary policy target in China. Furthermore, a conventional Taylor-type interest rate rule is not good enough yet to describe China's monetary policy behavior.","[Li, Bing] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Room 525,Weilun Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qing] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Room 546,Weilun Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Li, B (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Room 525,Weilun Bldg, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",libing@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; liuqing@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71103103]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20151080392]; Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Project [16YJA790029]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program; Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Project","We would like to thank the editors, Kevin Huang and Zheng (Michael) Song, and the two anonymous referees for their helpful comments that led to significant improvements of the paper.

Allister; Pouw, Nicky",,,Towards an economics of well-being,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Well-being; Pluralism; Ontology; Sustainable development; Poverty; Inequality,,"There is growing concern that presently dominant frameworks in economics no longer provide a way of adequately addressing and analysing the problems of today's globalising and rapidly changing world. This article makes a number of fundamental proposals about how we might reframe economics to move it towards a clearer focus on human well-being. It develops arguments for a change in the basic ontological proposition and for the need to see 'the economy' as an instituted process of resource allocation. From this viewpoint, economics is then the study of resource allocation decisions and processes and the forces that guide these: from a human perspective it is about understanding who gets what, under what conditions and why? The paper argues that a pluralist approach to understanding the economy is necessary for political, analytical and technical reasons. Drawing on a range of contributions to heterodox economics, the paper argues that if we are to understand current crises and challenges, then our understanding of resource allocation in society must have a broader scope than is present in mainstream economics; it proposes a rethinking of economic agency and provides a critique of rational behaviour that is founded in shifting the emphasis from a narrow conception of welfare to well-being. Acknowledging human well-being as a multidimensional concept, the relationship between the well-being of the person and the collective is reconsidered and the methodological implications for the issue of aggregation are discussed. The article seeks to serve as a point of departure for formulating new research questions, exploring the relationships between human well-being and economic development and analysing economic behaviour and interactions in such a way as to bring us closer to peoples' realities on the ground.","[McGregor, J.

In the associated 'fiscal regime', taxation multipliers turn positive, while the government spending multiplier has the same functional form as its counterpart in the 'monetary regime', augmented by a nominal wealth effect. As a result, fiscal multipliers tend to be larger in the fiscal regime, with the degree of price stickiness being a key determinant of their exact sizes. In particular, multipliers go to infinity as prices become fully fixed, and collapse to their equivalents in the monetary regime as prices become fully flexible. Standard calibrations suggest that the fiscal regime hosts a government spending multiplier on output that lies between 1 and 3. We also analyze the effectiveness of money-financed fiscal stimulus. In the fiscal regime, money-financed stimulus is equivalent to a particular form of debt-financed stimulus. The effectiveness of money-financed stimulus in raising output (relative to inflation) decreases as monetary policy becomes more responsive to inflation.

Researchers usually interpret this empirical pattern as evidence that the low skilled are vastly overconfident while the high skilled are more accurate in assessing their skill. However, measurement error alone can lead to a negative relationship between performance and overestimation, even if skill and overconfidence are unrelated. To clarify the role of measurement error, we restate the Dunning-Kruger effect in terms of skill and overconfidence. We show that we can correct for bias caused by measurement error with an instrumental variable approach that uses a second performance as instrument. We then estimate the Dunning-Kruger effect in the context of the exam grade predictions of economics students, using their grade point average as an instrument for their exam grade.

Determining the effect of health on occupation may tell us how people adapt to their limitations, and what types of jobs make this harder or easier. This paper uses the first 14 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey to examine the effect of health and changes in health on occupation for the working-age population. I use dynamic panel models which account for selection into employment. Two measures of occupation are used to capture two aspects of occupation highlighted in the literature as being linked to health: physical job demands and status. The results of the analyses provide some evidence that a health shock reduces the likelihood of manual employment for younger men, suggesting that younger men may adapt to a health shock by reducing physical job demands. Worsening health and work-limiting long-term conditions are found to have a negative effect on occupational status for men and women, suggesting health selection into lower-status jobs, and an adverse effect of poor health on occupational mobility.","[Flavel, Joanne] Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Flavel, J (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Natl Inst Labour Studies, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",joanne.flavel@flinders.edu.au,"Flavel, Joanne/GSJ-2450-2022; Flavel, Joanne/R-1718-2019","Flavel, Joanne/0000-0003-3228-7192;",Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS),Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government),"I am grateful to Sue Richardson, Anna Ziersch, Lixin Cai, Umut Oguzoglu, Stephane Mahuteau, Laurence Lester and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and suggestions.

In this study, we use a conditional copula model to estimate the time-varying asymmetric correlations of stock markets and construct optimal portfolios by using estimated correlations. We find that optimised portfolios provide significant benefits for both Australian and the US investors.

We revisit the issue using a microfounded model of money with centralized and decentralized markets. The individuals live for two periods. The young individuals work, receive wage income and hold money and capital in the centralized market. They also trade goods in the decentralized markets either as a buyer or a seller. Only money is accepted as a means of payment in the decentralized markets. The old individuals consume all their wealth in the centralized market. The quantity in the decentralized market negatively depends on the seller's wealth, because the marginal utility of consumption in the centralized market is diminishing, but the buyer takes it as exogenous. Therefore, the equilibrium wealth exceeds the socially optimal level under the Friedman rule. A positive nominal interest rate makes money holdings costly, reduces wealth and improves welfare, even if the government optimally uses the age-specific tax.","[Hiraguchi, Ryoji] Meiji Daigaku, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan",,"Hiraguchi, R (通讯作者)，Meiji Daigaku, Sch Polit Sci & Econ, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",hiraguchi@meiji.ac.jp,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The core of the new theory is the call for opportunity pluralism, which consists in enlarging the range of opportunities available to people at every stage in life. In this essay, we discuss how successful Fishkin is at shaking the way economists think about equality of opportunity. We identify two aspects of Fishkin's theory that deeply conflict with economic theories of equality of opportunity. Those aspects have to do with the way economists interpret the ethical values of respect for preferences and responsibility. We also argue that the way Fishkin suggests to look at opportunities can help economists fill gaps in the way they define well-being and social justice.

We extend the standard debt sustainability analysis framework so as to more faithfully reproduce these countries' economic reality in two aspects. First, we allow them to differ in the cyclical stance of their fiscal policy and in their degree of fiscal responsiveness to debt. Second, we explicitly integrate the specific risk premium paid by each country when borrowing in foreign currency. It allows us to evaluate the impact of alternative policies that the government may consider to improve sustainability. The results lead to three policy recommendations: i) a country should consider decreasing its exposure to currency risk only in extreme cases (like Argentina); ii) on the contrary, greater fiscal responsiveness (i.e. stronger fiscal tightening whenever there is a debt increase) could enhance sustainability to a much greater extent; iii) countries with low responsiveness to debt or a poor fiscal consolidation track record should be cautious with countercyclical fiscal policies, as they may trigger an unsustainable debt trajectory in the trough of the economic cycle.","[Paret, Anne-Charlotte] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, MRS, EHESS, 91 Blvd Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France; [Paret, Anne-Charlotte] Cent Marseille, Amundi Asset Management, 91 Blvd Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Paret, AC (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, MRS, EHESS, 91 Blvd Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France.;Paret, AC (通讯作者)，Cent Marseille, Amundi Asset Management, 91 Blvd Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France.",Anne-Charlotte.Paret@amundi.com,,,,,,,42,9,10,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We include CO2 emissions both in levels and in per capita terms, which allows to analyze if a decoupling exists both in absolute and in relative terms. We also test for the functional form of the relationship, something that is usually missed in the literature, but which is very relevant, because a misspecification could lead to biased estimates. We apply cointegration techniques and estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) for testing whether these variables are endogenous over the long-term while also considering the short-term dynamics. The economic productive structure, the degree of openness, and the share of clean sources in the total energy supply are also considered as explanatory variables. In addition, other variables that measure changes in the economic structure are included to check for robustness of the estimates. The results show that there is a. linear relationship (when a log-log transformation is employed) between CO2 emissions and per capita economic activity level (which would involve an exponential relationship between the non-transformed variables). Moreover, we cannot reject the level-log model, indicating that emissions increase at a decreasing rate in reference to the increase in economic level activity. Emissions increase jointly with the industrial sector's participation in the total output, as a consequence of the intensity of this activity in the consumption of energy from fossil fuel sources. The degree of openness is inversely related to CO2 emissions. This is because the periods of major opening were based on primary input exports, which are lower in energy intensity than industrial products. The changes in CO2 emission are inversely related to the variation in the share of clean sources in the total energy supply. Finally, all the variables included in the cointegration vector are endogenous, adjusting together to the deviations from the long-term relationship. As a consequence of the above, economic growth appears not to be enough for diminishing Uruguayan emissions in the long term. Changes in the energy matrix should be encouraged, and emissions reduction should come not through energy constraints but through the development of clean sources, or improvements in energy use efficiency, given the impact of energy on the economic activity level.

This paper asks whether, in a world where paper currency is becoming increasingly vestigial outside small transactions (at least in the legal, tax compliant economy), there might be relatively simple ways to finesse the zero bound without affecting how most ordinary people live. Surprisingly, this question gets little attention compared to the massive number of articles that take the zero bound as given and look for out-of-the-box solutions for dealing with it.

We find evidence that the effect from democracy to human development is nonlinear and varies depending on the levels of growth and democracy. The results confirm that the interaction effect of democracy-growth nexus has a positive impact on human development but the effect is sensitive to democratization process and the level of a country's economic development. It is established that democracy is more crucial in developed countries, whereas economic growth is vital in developing countries. The findings imply that the role of democracy in enhancing human development should not be overemphasized as economic growth is vital in the developing countries.","[Saha, Shrabani] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Int Business Sch, Lincoln, England; [Zhang, Zhaoyong] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, 270 Joondalup Dr, Perth, WA 6027, Australia",University of Lincoln; Edith Cowan University,"Zhang, ZY (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, 270 Joondalup Dr, Perth, WA 6027, Australia.",zhaoyong.zhang@ecu.edu.au,"Zhang, Zhaoyong/D-5100-2013","Zhang, Zhaoyong/0000-0001-9596-2648",Sumitomo Foundation,Sumitomo Foundation,"The authors wish to thank the Journal Editor, Professor Sushanta Mallick, and two anonymous referees for their very helpful comments and suggestions on earlier version of this paper which have greatly improved the quality of the paper.

Taking the general case of mixed stock and flow variables, we discuss new state space and exact discrete time representations and demonstrate that the discrete time ARMA representations widely used in empirical work, based on differencing stock variables, are members of a class of observationally equivalent discrete time ARMA(p 1, p) representations, which includes a more natural ARMA(p, p) representation. We compare and contrast two approaches to likelihood evaluation and computation, namely one based on an exact discrete time representation and another utilising a state space representation and the Kalman-Bucy filter. We demonstrate the value of our approach in two applications: a univariate study of the yield curve at different frequencies; and, a multivariate study of the relationship between US GDP and oil prices, taking account of the mixed frequencies with which these data are available.

A profitable company can find investors easily, because they count on a big return on investment. However, enterprises that are not effective enough could end up being taken over by others, go bankrupt or shut down business. Purpose of the article: is to identify the impact of a high share of equity in the total assets on the profitability of manufacturing companies. Methods: The focus of this paper is on the manufacturing sector. Research time-scale is set to sixteen years (2000-2015). The choice of this period is determined by data availability. In the examined interval of time over 15 thousand firms from the sector in question were flirted drawn from the EMIS. The gathered data enabled computation of the following financial indicators for the itemized companies: gross margin, operating margin, return on sales, return on assets, and return on equity. Then selection of companies was carried out to choose these with a high share of equity in its total assets. The proportion was regarded to be high if it reaches fifty one percent. Companies with quantities below this threshold have been excluded from the sample. The next step defines intervals (classes) for the equity ratio. Depending on the value of equity, the remaining firms were assigned to their corresponding class. In order to analyze influence of the quantity of equity on the level of profitability t-Student test for independent samples has been applied. Findings & Value added: The comparative analysis of the indicator of the size of equity with the indicators of profitability makes it possible to confirm that there is a significant impact on the value of profitability ratios of manufacturing companies. However, in most cases the impact is statistically irrelevant.","[Tomczak, Sebastian Klaudiusz] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology,"Tomczak, SK (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Operat Res, Wybrzeze Wyspianskiego 27, PL-50370 Wroclaw, Poland.",sebastian.tomczak@pwr.edu.pl,,"Tomczak, Sebastian/0000-0003-3528-3533",,,,,31,3,3,0,7,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Our theoretical model predicts that different from traditional business risk model uncertainty and concerning about model misspecification have ambiguous effects on the investment behavior and liquidity management, which depends on the firm's liquidity measured by firm's cash-capital ratio w = W/K. It shows that model uncertainty induces the firm to under-invest when the firm has sufficient cash. However, the firm prefers over-investing as its liquidity is essentially low. Moreover, an increasing in model uncertainty accelerates firm's payout while an increasing in business risk will delay the firm to pay out cash. Finally, it shows that model uncertainty significantly lowers a firm's average q and marginal q as well as marginal value of liquidity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

An experiment of self-revealing individual cheating,JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Experimental data; Cheating behavior; Intellectual achievement,DISHONESTY; BEHAVIOR; HONESTY,"The extensive body of economic and psychological research correlating between students' cheating and their academic grade point average (GPA) consistently finds a significant negative relationship between cheating and the GPA. However, this literature is entirely based on students' responses to direct-question surveys that inquire whether they have ever cheated on their academic assignments. The present paper examines this relationship on the basis of experimental data. It reports the results of a two-round experiment designed to expose student cheating at the individual level and correlate it with three intellectual achievement measures: the GPA, the high-school matriculation average grade (MAG) and the psychometric exam score (PES). The experiment involved two classes of third-year economics students incentivized by a competitive reward to answer a multiple-choice trivia quiz without consulting their electronic devices. While this forbiddance was deliberately overlooked in the first round, providing an opportunity to cheat, it was strictly enforced in the second, conducted two months later in the same classes with the same quiz. A comparison of subjects' performance in the two rounds, self-revealed a considerable extent of cheating in the first one. Regressing the individual cheating levels on subjects' gender and their intellectual achievement measures exhibited no significant differences in cheating between males and females. However, cheating of both genders was found to significantly increase with each achievement measure, implying, in sharp contrast with the direct-question surveys, that higher achievers are bigger cheaters.

To do this we conduct a large-scale randomized control trial, covering over 21,000 households in 1,309 villages surveyed four times over a seven-year period, to evaluate a nationwide program in Bangladesh that transfers livestock assets and skills to the poorest women. At baseline, the poorest women mostly engage in low return and seasonal casual wage labor while wealthier women solely engage in livestock rearing. The program enables poor women to start engaging in livestock rearing, increasing their aggregate labor supply and earnings. This leads to asset accumulation (livestock, land, and business assets) and poverty reduction, both sustained after four and seven years. These gains do not crowd out the livestock businesses of noneligible households while the wages these receive for casual jobs increase as the poor reduce their labor supply. Our results show that (i) the poor are able to take on the work activities of the nonpoor but face barriers to doing so, and, (ii) one-off interventions that remove these barriers lead to sustainable poverty reduction.","[Bandiera, Oriana] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, IGC, London, England; London Sch Econ, STICERD, London, England; BRAC, Res & Evaluat Unit, London, England; Univ Bocconi, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; Univ Bocconi, IGIER, Milan, Italy; UCL, IFS, Dept Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; University of London; University College London,"Bandiera, O (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, IGC, London, England.",,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023","Sulaiman, Munshi/0000-0001-6061-933X; Gulesci, Selim/0000-0001-7394-0720","DFID as part of the iiG; IGC; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [RES-544-28-5001]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1, ES/L005689/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L005689/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI",DFID as part of the iiG; IGC; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Earlier drafts were circulated under the titles Can Basic Entrepreneurship Transform the Economic Lives of the Poor? and The Misallocation of Labor in Village Economies.

Existing models of status quo bias are inconsistent with the former finding while models of decision avoidance are inconsistent with the latter.

With constraints, there may not exist a matching that satisfies fairness and nonwastefulness (i. e., stability). We demonstrate our new mechanism, the Adaptive Deferred Acceptance mechanism (ADA), satisfies strategy-proofness for students, nonwastefulness, and a weaker fairness property. We also offer a technique to apply ADA even if heredity is violated (e.g., minimum quotas).","[Goto, Masahiro; Kurata, Ryoji; Yokoo, Makoto] Kyushu Univ, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Kojima, Fuhito] Stanford Univ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Tamura, Akihisa] Keio Univ, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan",Kyushu University; Stanford University; Keio University,"Goto, M (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",goto@agent.inf.kyushu-u.ac.jp; fkojima@stanford.edu; kurata@agent.inf.kyushu-u.ac.jp; aki-tamura@math.keio.ac.jp; yokoo@inf.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Tamura, Akihisa/C-5705-2014; Tamura, Akihisa/ABD-1571-2020","Tamura, Akihisa/0000-0001-9528-7582; Kojima, Fuhito/0000-0002-1154-2652; YOKOO, MAKOTO/0000-0003-4929-396X",JSPS Kakenhi [24220003]; National Research Foundation through its Global Research Network [NRF-2013S1A2A2035408]; Sloan Foundation,"JSPS Kakenhi(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); National Research Foundation through its Global Research Network; Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Our objective was to assess how energy security may change over the course of the century, and to what extent these changes depend on the uncertainty of the factors that drive the evolution of energy systems, including future technologies, improved energy efficiency, fossil fuel resources and markets, and economic growth. To this end, we focused on Europe and on a set of energy security indicators based on three perspectives: sovereignty, robustness and resilience. A database of scenarios allowed us to account for the large uncertainties surrounding the determinants of future energy systems. We then analyzed the way energy security indicators evolve over time, and how their trajectories vary across scenarios. We identified the indicators that vary the most between scenarios, i.e., the indicators whose future evolution is the most uncertain. For these indicators, we performed an analysis of variance to estimate the contribution of each driver to the uncertainty of the indicators. The paper shows that the European double target of significantly decreasing CO2 emissions and increasing the security of the supply of energy may be difficult to reach. Nevertheless, some levers could facilitate the transition to a low-carbon society while improving energy security, or by limiting its degradation. The results emphasize not only the importance of policies in favor of low or zero carbon technologies in power generation but also the differences in their contributions to the complete uncertainty of the indicators. Policies promoting energy efficiency also play a role but only in the resilience of TPES. These policies are thus important levers for mitigating the negative impacts of climate policies on energy security. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, even though Elliott et al. (2015) have derived a Dupire formula for a local regime-switching model, its calibration still remains a challenge, primarily due to the fact that the derived volatility function for each state involves all the state price variables whereas only one market price is available for model calibration, and a direct implementation of Elliott et al.'s formula may not yield stable results. In this paper, a closed system for option pricing and data extraction under the classical regime-switching model is proposed with a special approach, splitting one market price into two market-implied state prices. The success of our approach hinges on the recovery of the two local volatility functions being transformed into an optimal control problem, which is solved through the Tikhonov regularization. In addition, an efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal solution by iteration. Our numerical experiments show that different shapes of local volatility functions can be accurately and stably recovered with the newly-proposed algorithm, and this algorithm also works quite well with real market data.

Specifically, we focus not only on the total expenditure but also on the composition, and we employ dichotomous indices of political regimes rather than score indices. Moreover, we construct instruments for democratization based on the democratization wave and conduct an instrumental variables estimation to address endogeneity problems. Our results show that while democratization does not have a significant impact on total expenditure, it increases expenditure on health. Democratization decreases expenditure on defense, although the result of the instrumental variables estimation is not significant. Furthermore, considering the time-varying effect of democratization, defense expenditure starts decreasing immediately after a regime change and health expenditure increases in the medium and long run, while they do not significantly vary before a regime change. Thus, while focusing only on total expenditure does not uncover the effects of democratization, considering detailed categories of government expenditure enables us to understand how democratization changes governments' behaviors.

We show that USOs can be used for equity purposes provided that the regulator is able to control the competitive structure of the industry.

In this paper, we investigate many anomalies in IPOs that produce huge initial return, long-term return reversal and high turnover rate from the perspective of investors' desire to gamble (skewness preferences). Based on Cumulative Prospect Theory, this paper theoretically and empirically verified that there is a significant impact on first day and long-term returns. Using all issued IPO between 2009 and 2012 as a study sample, the empirical results show that the increase of a standard deviation of skewness preference, and the first day returns increase 5.478%. Moreover, when the market environment is favorable, the positive sentiment of investors will make the effect of skewness preferences stronger. In the long run, the stronger the expected skewness is, the more negative the long-term risk premium is, and the lower the possibility of new shares that institutional investors continue to hold. In addition, skewness preferences across different industries, different financing scale, and different issue price has a significant difference.","[Tang, Wei; Xu, Liheng] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tianhao] Yale Univ, Dept Stat, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Fudan University; Yale University,"Tang, W (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",14110680034@fudan.edu.cn; tianhao.wu@yale.edu; 12210680129@fudan.edu.cn,"Wu, Tianhao/GXI-0277-2022; Tang, Wei/IZQ-1283-2023",,,,,,37,2,2,1,7,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

We show that this result does not hold under the assumptions that unobserved prices and expenditures remain constant. These assumptions are naturally satisfied in laboratory settings where the world outside the lab remains unchanged during the experiment. Hence for so-called induced budget experiments the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference is a necessary and sufficient condition for utility maximization in general, not just over lab goods. Lab experiments are therefore a valid tool to put the utility maximization hypothesis to the test.

The current practices basically stick to the first-best policy framework, and the theory of second best, even if mentioned, is at most marginally important. Some justifications for this textbook framework are called for if we do not think second best is a bad idea. This paper argues that this textbook framework cannot be justified by the absence of irremovable distortions in the real world, and should be considered within the social-welfare framework to maintain coherence with other parts of the framework. Without calling for a major revamp of the current way of teaching, I suggest that the theory of third best can be adopted to justify this way of teaching in a realistic environment: when policy-makers are informationally constrained, and when the unaccounted-for distortion is not large, or when a conservative attitude is adopted for interventions.","[Woo, Wai Chiu] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Woo, WC (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",wcwoo@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,18,2,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

This policy distorts the comparative advantages that would emerge in the absence of such an economic policy and also induces lower purchasing power, leading to suboptimal consumption. There are barely any theoretical models (to our knowledge) showing the impact of a global minimum for minimum wages. We found that, under such circumstances, a global lower bound for minimum wages that re-establishes the competitive wage rate in very poor countries represents a Pareto improvement: It enhances the markets due to the expansion in sales caused by the increase in real wages of the vast majority (workers). One of the innovations of this primer is to apply a simple DSGE model to the macroeconomic consequences of a global minimum for minimum wages.","[Caraballo Cueto, Jose] Univ Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR 00936 USA",University of Puerto Rico,"Cueto, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR 00936 USA.",jose.caraballo8@upr.edu,,,,,,,34,2,2,0,8,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

This phenomenon is perhaps most notable in the apparel industry, which in recent decades has seen the rise of fast fashion and an accelerating rate of novel style introductions from semi-annual to semi-weekly. In this paper I study the potential for this type of accelerating novelty to have a negative impact on consumer well-being. I analyze a simple theoretical model of consumer behavior in which consumers with a preference for novelty decide how fast to replace their fashion goods before and after an innovation which accelerates the rate at which new goods become available. In the basic model, where consumers update their goods based on their intrinsic preference for novelty, the novelty-accelerating innovation is not welfare-decreasing. However, when the model is extended in realistic ways, I find that there are at least three conditions under which the innovation may decrease welfare by increasing the extent of sub-optimal replacement: if there are external costs of updating to a newer good; if the consumers are boundedly rational and exhibit present bias; or if consumers' replacement decisions reflect an arms race for social status. My results in these model extensions provide an economic foundation for rising popular concern about undesirable social effects of fast fashion. I also discuss the implications of these results for future patterns of consumption, which are likely to reflect still more accelerated novelty and possibly the expansion of fashion behavior to a broader range of consumption settings.","[Cooper, Kristen B.] Gordon Coll, Wenham, MA 01984 USA",,"Cooper, KB (通讯作者)，Gordon Coll, Wenham, MA 01984 USA.",kristen.cooper@gordon.edu,,,,,,,41,2,3,2,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The model is calibrated to the United States economy, including a stylized version of its student loan system. We find that moving to an income-contingent educational financing system, whereby transfers to students are financed from taxes on labor income, generates aggregate welfare gains. Such a system improves risk-sharing among college graduates and incentivizes individuals to obtain more education. These positive effects overturn the negative impact from labor supply distortions. Reforming the educational financing system towards income contingency, however, generates a considerable amount of transitional dynamics, so that welfare gains and losses are distributed unevenly across generations.

The cointegration approach relies on formal cointegration testing to unveil stationary spread time series. The time-series approach focuses on finding optimal trading rules for mean-reverting spreads. The stochastic control approach aims at identifying optimal portfolio holdings in the legs of a pairs trade relative to other available securities. The category other approaches contains further relevant pairs trading frameworks with only a limited set of supporting literature. Finally, pairs trading profitability is reviewed in the light of market frictions.

Motivated by our findings, we develop a heterogeneous-agent, incomplete-markets, overlapping-generations dynasty model. House-holds jointly decide over their life cycle on (i) kids' human capital investments (schooling) and (ii) parents' entry, exit and investment into alternative entrepreneurial modes (subsistence and modern). With financial constraints all of these are co-determined. A calibrated version of our model can account for the broad correlation patterns uncovered in the data within and across generations, e.g., a non-monotonic relationship between educational choices and assets across occupations, growth in profits and employment for modern firms only, and dynastic persistence across generations in education and wealth. Endogenous human capital acquisition is a key driver of inequality and intergenerational persistence. Eliminating this channel would decrease the top 10% income share by 47%. Eliminating within-period borrowing constraints would increase average household expenditure by 7.1% and benefit the middle class, reducing top and bottom expenditure shares. It would also reduce by 28% the correlation between household assets and kids' schooling levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

First, loss aversion explains excess smoothness and sensitivity-that is, the empirical observation that consumption responds to income shocks with a lag. Intuitively, such lagged responses allow the agent to delay painful losses in consumption until his expectations have adjusted. Secondly, the preferences generate a hump-shaped consumption profile. Early in life, consumption is low due to a first-order precautionary-savings motive. However, as uncertainty resolves over time, this motive is dominated by time-inconsistent overconsumption that eventually leads to declining consumption towards the end of life. Thirdly, consumption drops at retirement. Prior to retirement, the agent wants to overconsume his uncertain income before his expectations catch up. Post-retirement, however, income is no longer uncertain, and overconsumption is associated with a sure loss in future consumption. As an empirical contribution, I structurally estimate the preference parameters using life-cycle consumption data. My estimates match those obtained in experiments and other micro studies, and generate the degree of excess smoothness observed in macro consumption data.","[Pagel, Michaela] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Pagel, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,,,,,87,41,49,3,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In a communication graph game, players can only cooperate if they are connected in an undirected graph representing the communication possibilities. The Myerson value of such a game is obtained by taking the Shapley value of the corresponding restricted game. For the special case that the graph is cycle-free and connected, for each player the corresponding hierarchical outcome yields an alternative solution. In a permission tree game, the player set is enriched with a rooted directed graph (or tree) on the set of players. A coalition is said to be feasible, if for every player in the coalition, except the top (root) player, also its predecessor belong(s) to the coalition. The permission value is obtained by taking the Shapley value of the associated restricted game. In this paper, we modify the Myerson value and hierarchical outcome that are defined for (undirected) communication graph games to a value for permission tree games. We also define a new solution that assigns all payoff to the unique top player in the hierarchy. Then comparable characterizations are given of these three solutions and the known permission value.","[van den Brink, Rene; Dietz, Chris; van der Laan, Gerard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Xu, Genjiu] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Northwestern Polytechnical University,"van den Brink, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Dept Econometr, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jrbrink@feweb.vu.nl; cdietz@feweb.vu.nl; glaan@feweb.vu.nl; xugenjiu@nwpu.edu.cn,"Xu, Genjiu/O-2569-2018","Xu, Genjiu/0000-0002-1472-3950; van den Brink, Rene/0000-0001-8570-3706","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, NWO [400-08-026]; NWO [400-08-026]; NSFC [71271171]; Science and Technology Research and Development Program in Shaanxi Province of China [2014KW03-01]","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Research and Development Program in Shaanxi Province of China","This research is financially supported by Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, NWO Grant 400-08-026.

Price-contingent strategies introduce two externalities in the use of private information: a pecuniary externality and a learning externality. The pecuniary externality induces agents to put too much weight on private information and in the standard case, when the allocation role of the price prevails over its informational role, overwhelms the learning externality which impinges in the opposite way. The price may be very informative but at the cost of an excessive dispersion of the actions of agents. The welfare loss at the market solution may be increasing in the precision of private information. The analysis provides insights into optimal business cycle policy and a rationale for a Tobin-like tax for financial transactions.","[Vives, Xavier] IESE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain",University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Vives, X (通讯作者)，IESE Business Sch, Madrid, Spain.",,"Vives, Xavier/B-1597-2013",,"European Research Council under the European Advanced Grants scheme [230254]; Spanish MINECO [ECO-2011-29533, ECO2015-63711-P]; European Research Council (ERC) [230254] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council under the European Advanced Grants scheme; Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"A previous version of the paper was circulated under the title Endogenous Public Information and Welfare.

The results of the empirical analysis reveal that the dynamic correlations of output and prices were typically negative, suggesting a countercyclical behaviour of prices, apart from the early 1840s and from the beginning until the middle of the 20th century, when the correlation was positive, indicating a procyclicality of prices. A historical decomposition analysis based on a sign-restricted structural vector autoregressive model is able to relate the procyclical and countercyclical behaviour to the predominance of aggregate supply and aggregate demand and/or monetary policy shocks, respectively. Moreover, inflation uncertainty (monetary policy stance) was found to have a positive (negative) effect on inflation over the last 215 years. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, if signal acquisition is made an endogenous and costly decision, then rational voters have disincentives to purchase information as the group size becomes larger. We investigate the extent to which human subjects recognize this trade-off between better information aggregation and greater incentives to free-ride in a laboratory experiment where we vary the group size, the cost of information acquisition and the precision of signals. We find that the theory predicts well in the case of precise signals. However, when signals are imprecise, free-riding incentives appear to be much weaker as there is a pronounced tendency for subjects to over-acquire information relative to equilibrium predictions. We rationalize the latter finding using a quantal response equilibrium that allows for risk aversion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We first introduce a novel, stable, and efficient method for computing the decision rules in deterministic dynamic economic problems. We use the results as nonlinear and global certainty-equivalent approximations for solutions to stochastic problems, and compare their accuracy to the common linear and local certainty-equivalent methods. Our examples demonstrate that this method can be applied to solve high-dimensional problems with up to 400 state variables with acceptable accuracy. This method can also be applied to solve problems with inequality constraints. These features make the nonlinear certainty-equivalent approximation method suitable for solving complex economic problems, where other algorithms, such as log-linearization, fail to produce a valid global approximation or are far less tractable.","[Cai, Yongyang] Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Judd, Kenneth] Stanford Univ, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Steinbuks, Jevgenijs] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Chicago; Stanford University; The World Bank,"Cai, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",yycai01@gmail.com; kennethjudd@mac.com; jsteinbuks@worldbank.org,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0951576, SES-1463644, OCI-0725070, ACI-1238993]; United States Department of Agriculture NIFA-AFRI Grant [2015-67023-22905]; state of Illinois",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); United States Department of Agriculture NIFA-AFRI Grant; state of Illinois,"We thank three anonymous referees and Thomas Hertel for their helpful comments.

We propose that entrepreneur-operated CMS firms typically develop a stewardship governance structure, which relies heavily on the social and psychological context of trust between management and employees, and demands employment stability. Accordingly, firms with more deeply ingrained CMSes are expected to have a lower employment adjustment speed. By applying a partial adjustment model to a sample of Taiwanese firms, we show that firms continually adjust to achieve a target employment level. The empirical proxy variables for the extent of CMSes are negatively related to the adjustment speed, particularly among firms with above-target employment or having consecutive periods of loss.

But despite the attention to this subject in the professional literature, there remains insufficient understanding of just how imperfect the existing official estimates actually are. After studying the methods used by the US government statistical agencies as well as the extensive previous academic literature on this subject, I have concluded that, despite the various improvements to statistical methods that have been made through the years, the official data understate the changes of real output and productivity. The official measures provide at best a lower bound on the true real growth rate with no indication of the size of the underestimation. In this essay, I briefly review why national income should not be considered a measure of well-being; describe what government statisticians actually do in their attempt to measure improvements in the quality of goods and services; consider the problem of new products and the various attempts by economists to take new products into account in measuring overall price and output changes; and discuss how the mismeasurement of real output and of prices might be taken into account in considering various questions of economic policy.","[Feldstein, Martin] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Feldstein, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mfeldstein39@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,60,67,0,7,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using a survey experiment with vignettes on a sample of German citizens (N = 479), we examine attitudes towards inheritance taxation. Our results reveal several relevant dimensions for a proposed fair inheritance tax rate (PITR): The PITR decreases with a close relationship between testator and heir and when the asset is a family-occupied house or family enterprise compared with a  lump sum. It increases with the value of bequest and income of the heir representing equity considerations. Respondents advocate higher tax rates to reduce fiscal budget deficits. Respondents with a strong family orientation propose a low inheritance tax rate.","[Gross, Christiane] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Sociol, Klagesmarkt 14-17, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Lorek, Kerstin; Richter, Friedemann] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Sch Business & Econ, Findelgasse 7-9, D-90402 Nurnberg, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Gross, C (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Sociol, Klagesmarkt 14-17, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",c.gross@ish.uni-hannover.de; kerstin.lorek@fau.de; richterfriedemann@gmail.com,,"Gross, Christiane/0000-0001-7878-4464",Emerging Field Initiative (EFI) of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg,Emerging Field Initiative (EFI) of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg,"Financial support by the Emerging Field Initiative (EFI) of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg is gratefully acknowledged.

This approach allows introducing changes of regimes in the conditional mean function of the inter-exceedance times (i.e., the time between two consecutive extreme events) in order to admit the presence of short- and long-term memory patterns. Further, through its multifractal structure, the MSM-POT approach is able to capture the typical stylized facts of extreme events observed in financial time series, such as temporal clustering of the size of exceedances and temporal behavior of tail thickness. We compare the performance of the MSM-POT model with competing self-exciting models and a GARCH-EVT approach in an in- and out-of-sample VaR forecasting exercise based on the extreme returns of six daily commodity futures prices (i.e. Brent and WTI crude oil, cocoa, cotton, copper, and gold). Empirical results suggest that the VaR estimates generated by the MSM-POT model for the returns analyzed produce the most accurate forecasts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I consider the selection of a third party in a two-person bargaining problem where each disputant has private information about its relative strength or weakness. For a class of problems, I find that the disputants choose the third party that is best for the strong type but worst for the weak type due to the incentive of each disputant to avoid seeming weak to their adversary. The selected third party's intervention entails a higher ex ante chance of conflict than intervention by any other alternative. This paper shows how the process of interim third-party selection can have important consequences for the outcome of a third-party intervention in bargaining. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To this end, the present paper reconsiders and reinvigorates Giddens's (1990) concept of 'facework'. It reviews the use of the concept in the literature, finding considerable conceptual confusion, particularly in distinguishing between Giddens's and Goffman's (2003 [1955]) earlier conceptualisation. This is addressed through a formal definition of facework. The paper then develops the concept further, based on Giddens's own structuration theory. It focuses particularly on two aspects, viz. the different dimensions and elements of facework, and the balance between institutionalised and agentic elements inherent in it. The paper concludes by summarising the implications this analysis has for broader conceptions of individuals 'representing' organisations and expert systems.","[Kroeger, Frens] Coventry Univ, Ctr Trust Peace & Social Relat, Cheetah Rd, Coventry CV1 2TL, W Midlands, England",Coventry University,"Kroeger, F (通讯作者)，Coventry Univ, Ctr Trust Peace & Social Relat, Cheetah Rd, Coventry CV1 2TL, W Midlands, England.",frens.kroeger@coventry.ac.uk,,,,,,,122,16,16,6,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper examines whether similar findings are obtained when examining benefice ratios, and we find arguably even greater differences. Specifically, we see that headline inflation identifies far more inflationary episodes since the 1990s than core inflation does. Furthermore, Jordan's (1997) argument that the speed of inflation is a negative and significant determinant of benefice ratios does not hold when we move from headline to core inflation, both within the U.S. and also across the OECD. We also find strong evidence that the initial level of GDP at the onset of an inflationary episode matters. In particular, output gains from accelerating inflation appear only to be beneficial for OECD countries that start with a low level of GDP. Conversely, countries that start with a high level of GDP should not pursue additional output gains from allowing a rise in inflation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Since being classified by the regulators as fraudulent, earnings management has required a separate detection methodology. The majority of detection research is performed through the comparison of a large number of statements for the same company in order to find irregularities in earnings behavior. Shortening of the detection time and the amount of data becomes important. Purpose of the article: The goal was to compare the characteristics of M-Score and Delta P-Delta R and to find their advantages and limitations. Applying both indicators to the different samples, the research attempted to determine the statistical connection between them and to set up the limits of their applicability. Since M-Score indicator is liquidity-based, this research attempted to determine to which extent M-Score and Z-Score are statistically related. Methods: The research paper compares the behavior of both indicators using various samples of financial data: the sample of companies, charged with fraud, the sample with exceptional liquidity, the large random sample and the sample from the emerging market economy. Based on the original observations, two other subsamples (one based on poor Z-Score and one based on exceptional Z-Score) were extracted from the main sample. For all samples Delta P-Delta R, M- Score and Z-Score were statistically compared among and between themselves. Findings/ value added: The research found the limitations of Delta P-Delta R and M-Score in the stable markets and was able to connect them in the emerging market by using linear regression model (also including Z-Score). The research confirmed that M- Score can mistake exceptional performance for manipulations, resulted in Type I errors. Delta P-Delta R appeared somewhat coarse and prone to Type II errors. The combined use of both in the emerging markets will provide the best approach.","[Pustylnick, Igor] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Vladivostok, Russia",Far Eastern Federal University,"Pustylnick, I (通讯作者)，899 Wellington,Rd22, Hillsburgh, ON NOB 120, Canada.",ipustylnick@conestogac.on.ca,,,,,,,21,3,4,1,32,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

In the model, the network good is a subscription social network good. This means that in each period, each consumer has to pay a subscription price to use the good, and the utility derived from subscribing to the good increases as more of her neighboring consumers subscribe. Consumers myopically optimize their subscription decisions, and the monopolist chooses a sequence of subscription prices that maximizes his discounted sum of per period profits. Three main results emerge. First, I characterize a unique steady state of the monopoly market. Second, I find that optimal sequences of subscription prices oscillate around the subscription price at the steady state. Third, I analyze how changes in the monopolist's discount factor and the density of the social network affect the subscription price, subscription rate, and deadweight loss at the steady state.

We consider two types of stable relations: repeated procurements and connections based on the state ownership of suppliers. On the basis of a large dataset on the procurement of granulated sugar in Russia from 2011 to 2013, we find that for private suppliers, prices of repeated contracts were lower compared to one-time deals when procured through more transparent procedures and higher when procured through non-transparent procedures. For non-transparent procedures, we observe significant overpricing of contracts with state-owned suppliers compared to private suppliers, especially in the case of repeated contracts, whereas for competitive e-auctions, there is only a small difference between the contract prices of state-owned suppliers and private suppliers.

Indeed, the financialization and integration of commodity markets expose the economy to potential contagion risks i.e., adverse shocks hitting one or more commodity markets spread to the entire economic system. To this purpose, we use the delta Conditional Value-at-Risk (Delta CoVaR) approach based on quantile regression to identify a measure of contagion risk for energy, food and metals commodity markets. This novel methodology allows us to detect whether the risk contribution for a given market is significant, while distinguishing between tail events driven by financial factors, economic fundamentals or both. Furthermore, it permits us to assess whether the contagion risk of one market is significantly larger than the one of another market. The results show that commodity markets generate contagion risks which are mainly triggered by financial factors for energy and metal markets and by financial and economic fundamentals for food markets. Oil market contributes more to contagion than metal and food markets. Moreover, it emerges that there are spillovers from energy to food markets and oil is also more important than biofuel in affecting food markets. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V.

Under this program residential schools were built for girls in grades 6-8 (often known as middle school) and were unique because it is one of the few programs that exclusively focuses on improving school infrastructure for girls. The program was restricted to individuals belonging to backward castes in India which provides exogenous identifying variation. I use this eligibility criteria along with cohort variation in exposure to the program introduced in 2004 to estimate the impact of KGBV on enrollment and academic performance. I find that potentially affected cohorts are more likely to have attended school and perform better on reading tests. I run placebo regressions with data from a pre-policy year and do not find any effects along these dimensions providing confidence in the identification strategy.","[Chatterjee, Somdeep] Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Business Environm Grp, IIM Rd, Lucknow 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Business Environm Grp, IIM Rd, Lucknow 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India.",somdeep@iiml.ac.in,,"Chatterjee, Somdeep/0000-0002-9825-2227",,,,,7,1,1,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

By adopting Akerman et al. (2013)'s decomposition method, we examine the relative importance of within-sector and between-sector wage variations in Korean manufacturing over the period of 1980-2012. Our analytic results confirm that within-sector wage variation explains the lion's share of overall wage inequality. Taking this finding into account, we estimate the impacts of international trade, skilled-biased technological change and labor market conditions on within-sector wage inequality in Korea. Our estimation results suggest that there was a structural change in determinants of wage inequality before and after the mid-1990s. The influence of international trade mainly through heightened import competition on wage dispersion became relatively more conspicuous over the last two decades.

It then decomposes the contribution of potential explanatory factors to the distributional changes. The United States emerges as the frontier country because its best firms are far better than those of its close competitors. Part of the process of convergence to the frontier across the development process represents a trimming of the left tail, much is movement of the central mass and, for rich countries and many poor countries, it is actually the best firms that lag the frontier benchmark. Among potential explanatory variables that may drive convergence, ownership and human capital appear most important. These variables lose explanatory power as firm and average country management quality rises. Hence, once in the advanced country range, the factors that improve management quality are less easy to document and hence influence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Uneven growth accompanied by lagging institutional development, preventing human capital formation, might have inhibited human development in the short to medium run.

By focusing on the presence of a stable frontier between Castile and the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in the late Middle Ages, our analysis shows how a historical border may generate differences in inequality that can become extremely persistent. We argue that the dynamics of being a militarily insecure frontier region created the conditions on the Castilian side for a high concentration of economic and political power. Through the application of a border specification and a spatial regression discontinuity design to municipal-level data, we find that municipalities on the Castilian side have a significantly higher percentage of landless workers, a greater accumulation of wealth, and more jurisdictional rights among the privileged orders, as measured in the 18th century. We use current indicators of land inequality and development to show that the effect of the frontier of Granada persists even today.","[Oto-Peralias, Daniel] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Romero-Avila, Diego] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain",University of St Andrews; Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Oto-Peralías, D (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",dop2@st-andrews.ac.uk; dromtor@upo.es,"Romero-Ávila, Diego/K-4359-2017","Oto-Peralias, Daniel/0000-0001-8773-6835",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2009-13357]; Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35430]; Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science [SEJ-4546],Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science,"Diego Romero-Avila would like to dedicate this article to the memory of his father, Pedro Jose Romero de Avila Aguilar, for encouragement and support throughout his career.

A model which allows a financial crisis to have both a short-run effect on the growth rate of labor productivity and a long-run effect on its level is estimated on 61 countries over 1954-2010. A banking crisis as defined by Reinhart and Rogoff reduces the long-run level of GDP per worker, and also that of capital per worker, by on average 1.1 percent, for each year that the crisis lasts; it also reduces the TFP level by 0.8%. The long run, negative effect on the level of GDP per capita, 1.8 percent, is substantially larger. So there is also a hit to employment. The effects on labor productivity, capital and TFP are larger in developing than in developed countries; the opposite is the case for employment.","[Oulton, Nicholas] London Sch Econ, Ctr Macroecon, London, England; [Sebastia-Barriel, Maria] Bank England, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Bank of England,"Oulton, N (通讯作者)，Lndon Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Ctr Macroecon, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.oulton@lse.ac.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council,UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank of England or its Monetary or Financial Policy Committees.

Ordered probit analysis of UK data from wave 2 (2010-2011) of Understanding Society provides evidence in support of a wide range of cultural goods generating positive leisure experience, reflected in overall (life, general happiness) and domain (leisure) satisfaction. Frequency of engagement is central to certain activities: only regular participation in arts activities and sport generates positive effects. In contrast, arts events are positive irrespective of frequency. The findings also indicate even less frequent engagement in activities exhibiting cultural characteristics, e.g. museums/historical sites, has positive association with satisfaction. Finally, although employment has a negative association with leisure satisfaction, engagement in leisure activities is not found to spillover into job satisfaction (with the exception of certain sports). This suggests individuals consider work and leisure (including quality of leisure time) separately.","[Wheatley, Daniel; Bickerton, Craig] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Burton St, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England",Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Wheatley, D (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Burton St, Nottingham NG1 4BU, England.",daniel.wheatley@ntu.ac.uk; craig.bickerton@ntu.ac.uk,,"Wheatley, Daniel/0000-0002-6753-2867",,,,,56,91,95,6,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We study the development of China's gas market-oriented reform and how third party access becomes a pressing issue in that context. This paper aims to report stakeholders' benefit and distributional effects during a hypothetical third party access process. To that end, we apply an oligopolistic equilibrium model, based on the mixed complementarity problem, to China's gas pipeline network. We compare two scenarios: a scenario without third party access and the other scenario where an independent pipeline operator optimizes flows. This latter scenario aims to guarantee that the maximum social benefit is achieved. In addition, the latter scenario transfers the congestion rent to former integrated gas companies to compensate their actual loss control of the pipeline operation, in order to minimize the adverse distributional effects for pipeline companies. The solution of the model indicates that operational separation is feasible with Pareto improvement in China's context. Moreover, it merits particular attention from policy makers in China that pipeline capacity scarcity should be properly evaluated and managed.","[Xu, Jing] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Hallack, Michelle; Vazquez, Miguel] Univ Fed Fluminense, Fac Econ, Campus Gragoata F, BR-24210201 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Hallack, Michelle; Vazquez, Miguel] Bocconi Univ, IEFE, Via Rontgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Vazquez, Miguel] FGV, Ctr Regulat & Infrastruct Studies CERI, Barao de Itambi 60, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Fudan University; Universidade Federal Fluminense; Bocconi University; Getulio Vargas Foundation,"Xu, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, 600 Guoquan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",jingxu526@gmail.com; michellecmhallack@gmail.com; miguel.vazquez.martinez@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,13,14,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Using provincial level panel data from 1998 to 2009, this paper investigates the effect of religious beliefs on bureaucratic corruption in China. The empirical results show that, bureaucratic corruption is negatively associated with local religious heritage, implying that religious culture plays a positive role in restraining official's corruption since religion has influence on political preference and work ethic. We also find that the negative association between religion and corruption is weaker in provinces with stronger law enforcement, which identifies the substitution effect between religious ethic and legal supervision in curbing corruption. Our findings also reveal that, among the different religions, the anti-corruption effects of China's native religions (i.e., Taoism and Buddhism) are more significant than those of foreign religions (i.e., Christianity and Islam). These conclusions are consistent and robust to various measures of main variables and a variety of robustness checks. Given the very few studies and limited data resources in the context of China, this paper as a tentative study provides new evidences of the relationship between religion and corruption.

Sectoral case studies on agribusiness, garment/apparel, automotive and electronics illustrate SMEs' effective integration into GVCs. Findings - SMEs face multiple obstacles and challenges which may limit the benefits derived from the development of GVCs in Asia and the Pacific. Policymakers are suggested to design and implement appropriate strategies and polices in order to facilitate the development of SMEs under the ongoing globalization. Originality/value - This is the first policy paper which proposes a comprehensive framework for SMEs' effective participation in GVCs, specifically suggesting seven approaches, namely, SME development; trade policy; behind-the-border and cross-border trade facilitation; regional integration frameworks; FDI promotion; SME clusters; and national innovation system.","[Abe, Masato; Proksch, Marc] UN Econ & Social Commiss Asia & Pacific, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Abe, M (通讯作者)，UN Econ & Social Commiss Asia & Pacific, Bangkok, Thailand.",abem@un.org,,,Inha University; Le Havre University,Inha University; Le Havre University,"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 10th Inha-Le Havre International Conference on International Trade, Capital Flows and Economic Development: Capacity Building and Economic Initiatives, which was held at the Inha University, Incheon, the Republic of Korea, on 20 and 21 October 2016.

First, these studies fail to account for the multilateral resistance term. This omission makes the estimates from standard gravity model bias and inconsistent. Second, there is a significant proportion of zero trade flows, however, these studies also fail to account for them properly. They use either the Tobit model or replace zero flows with arbitrary small values. Apart from these problems, they also exhibit considerable heterogeneity in the RTA effects on trade. In this paper, a meta-analysis of previous empirical studies is conducted to derive a combined effect size and also to explain the heterogeneity. In addition, I use the gravity model to compare the trade-creating effect of the main African RTAs. Using the gravity model, I compare the estimation methods of previous studies to the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator that tackles the zero flows. From the meta-analysis, I find a general positive effect of African RTAs of about 27%-32%. A comparative assessment of the RTAs using gravity model shows a striking heterogeneity.","[Afesorgbor, Sylvanus Kwaku] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Afesorgbor, Sylvanus Kwaku] European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy",Aarhus University; European University Institute,"Afesorgbor, SK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Aarhus, Denmark.;Afesorgbor, SK (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Florence, Italy.",safesorgbor@econ.au.dk,,"Afesorgbor, Sylvanus Kwaku/0000-0001-6284-459X",Tuborg Foundation,Tuborg Foundation,"I thank Martin Paldam, Philipp Schroder, Peter van Bergeijk, the editor, two anonymous referees and all participants at both the African economic conference (2013), Johannesburg, and International Network for Economic Research conference (2014), Loughborough, UK, for helpful comments and suggestions.

Using data of 14 European countries between 1996 and 2013, we apply panel data and SUR methods to assess public expenditure-income elasticities. We find that some functions of government spending for a few countries (e.g. Austria, France, the Netherlands and Portugal) validate Wagner's law. For the Netherlands, expenditures with environment protection increase more than proportionately to economic growth, and for France that is the case of spending in housing and community amenities. In addition, Greece is the only country where two public spending items react more than one to one to growth.","[Afonso, Antonio] ISEG UL Univ Lisbon, Dept Econ, UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Alves, Jose] ISEG ULisbon Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal; [Alves, Jose] UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",,"Alves, J (通讯作者)，ISEG ULisbon Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.;Alves, J (通讯作者)，UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",jose.borges.alves@phd.iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Alves, JosÃ©/ACY-4164-2022; Alves, José/AAB-2894-2019; Afonso, António/B-5954-2009","Alves, JosÃ©/0000-0002-9979-7544; Afonso, António/0000-0002-6926-2653; Matias Alves, Jose/0000-0002-9490-9957",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology),Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),UECE is supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology).,,15,14,18,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This study thus investigates a mechanism in which market information obtained through agents is interpreted, transformed and applied for decision making and presents outcomes. In particular, the study focuses on the mediating role of adaptive capability on the relationship between market information management and export performance. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon the theories of knowledge-based view and contingency paradigm, a research model is developed for linking the key constructs of foreign agent operations, information management, adaptive capability and performance. Structural equation modeling is applied for testing the model using data collected from a sample of 152 Korean SME exporters. Findings - The results indicate that a firm's operation quality of foreign agents strongly affects the quality of market information management which consequently impacts export performance. In the relationship between market information management and export performance, in particular, adaptive capability is found to play a mediating role. This implies that export performance is, for the most part, achieved by the mediation of adaptive capability, although market information leads directly to export performance to some degree. The results also confirm the existence of reciprocal causation between a firm's export performance and foreign agent operations. The finding suggests that the outcome of SME export performance continues to provide feedback to its operations of foreign agents and consistently influence each other. Originality/value - This study makes an important contribution to the body of export literature by identifying the mediating effects of adaptive capability on the relationship between market information management and export performance. In addition, the results create a recursive model for SME export performance by verifying the reciprocal relationship between export performance and operating with agents. This study thus helps extend understanding of international operations through foreign agents in the SME context.","[Ahn, Se-Hwa] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Small & Medium Sized Enterprise Management, Chungcheongnam Do, South Korea",Korea University of Technology & Education,"Ahn, SH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Dept Small & Medium Sized Enterprise Management, Chungcheongnam Do, South Korea.",shahn@koreatech.ac.kr,,,Korea University of Technology Education [2016-0189],Korea University of Technology Education,This work was supported by the research fund of Korea University of Technology & Education in 2016 (No. 2016-0189).,,56,1,1,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

In particular, we show that in a broad class of models where shocks have continuous paths, the propagation of a monetary impulse is independent of the nature of the sticky price friction when shocks are small. The propagation of large shocks instead depends on the nature of the friction: the impulse response of inflation to monetary shocks is independent of the shock size in time-dependent models, while it is nonlinear in state-dependent models. We use data on exchange rate devaluations and inflation for a panel of countries from 1974 to 2014 to test for the presence of state-dependent decision rules. We present some evidence of a nonlinear effect of exchange rate changes on prices in a sample of flexible exchange rate countries with low inflation.

I assume only that bidders are risk averse and the indivisible good for sale is a normal good. I show that removing quasilinearity leads to qualitatively different solutions to the auction design problem. Expected revenue is no longer maximized using standard auctions that allocate the good to the highest bidder. Instead, the auctioneer better exploits bidder preferences by using a mechanism that allocates the good to one of many different bidders, each with strictly positive probability. I introduce a probability demand mechanism that treats probabilities of winning the indivisible good like a divisible good in net supply 1. With enough bidders, it has greater expected revenues than any standard auction, and under complete information, it implements a Pareto efficient allocation.","[Baisa, Brian] Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",Amherst College,"Baisa, B (通讯作者)，Amherst Coll, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",bbaisa@amherst.edu,,,Whitebox Advisors Fellowship,Whitebox Advisors Fellowship,"I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Whitebox Advisors Fellowship.

Especially, the short term positive wage-increase effect, is moderated by attained level of income in relation to other's people earnings (Clark, 2011). This allows for the hypothesis, that the individual evaluation of work compensation will have a stronger impact on work satisfaction than the direct effect of wages has. The presented study compares psychological and economical variable's impact on job satisfaction. The results, in which a higher level personality variable - core self-evaluations (Judge et al. 1998; Walczak & Derbis, 2017) shows a far stronger impact on job satisfaction than wages or other economic variables, are discussed in light of job choice decisions.","[Bartosz, Walczak Radoslaw] Univ Opole, Fac Social Sci, Inst Psychol, Opole, Poland; [Bartosz, Walczak Radoslaw] Opole Univ, Inst Psychol, P1 Stasz 1, PL-45050 Opole, Poland",University of Opole; University of Opole,"Bartosz, WR (通讯作者)，Univ Opole, Fac Social Sci, Inst Psychol, Opole, Poland.;Bartosz, WR (通讯作者)，Opole Univ, Inst Psychol, P1 Stasz 1, PL-45050 Opole, Poland.",rwalczak@uni.opole.pl,"Walczak, Radosław/AAN-5385-2020; Walczak, Radoslaw Bartosz/R-4603-2018","Walczak, Radoslaw Bartosz/0000-0001-6787-7673",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-5233-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,524,531,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0QL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000492966900076,0

In this chapter, we examine whether the time-series behavior of macroeconomic aggregates (especially labor market aggregates) is in fact supportive of this local-stability view of macroeconomic dynamics, or if it instead favors an alternative interpretation in which the macroeconomy may be better characterized as being locally unstable, with nonlinear deterministic forces capable of producing endogenous cyclical behavior. To do this, we extend a standard AR representation of the data to allow for smooth nonlinearities. Our main finding is that, even using a procedure that may have low power to detect local instability, the data provide intriguing support for the view that the macroeconomy may be locally unstable and involve limit-cycle forces. An interesting finding is that the degree of nonlinearity we detect in the data is small, but nevertheless enough to alter the description of macroeconomic behavior. We complete the chapter with a discussion of the extent to which these two different views about the inherent dynamics of the macroeconomy may matter for policy.","[Beaudry, Paul] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Galizia, Dana] Carleton Univ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Portier, Franck] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Portier, Franck] CEPR, London, England",University of British Columbia; National Bureau of Economic Research; Carleton University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Beaudry, P (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Beaudry, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Portier, Franck/0000-0001-9409-3946",,,,,13,12,12,2,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

Schumpeter considered agents' habits as a particularly important source of heterogeneity. We show how Schumpeter's notion of habits is closely related to modern work on habits, and draw on recent research to elaborate theory that can provide the foundation for Schumpeterian economic policy. We argue that heterogeneity of habits can be a crucial building block and foundation of Schumpeterian economic policy: it offers a target for policy interventions that is different from incentives or information.

We test 53 micro variables using extreme bound analysis on a pooled cross-section data from the World Value Survey representing 98 countries between 1989 and 2014. Several standard variables frequently included in SWB regressions are controlled for. The test variables are broadly categorized as demographic, personal-economic, individual traits and values, social attitudes and collectivism, social relationships and perceptions of control. We find subjective health status, household income rank, family savings, religiosity, most perceptions of control and several social attitudes and collectivism measures to be universal LS determinants. Generally, the determinants of LS vary by a country's level of economic development.

Multisectoral Thirwall's Law facilitates the discussion of the effects of the sectoral composition of trade on the extent of the balance of payments (BOP) constraint and consequently on the long run growth prospects of an economy. In particular, structural change favoring sectors with Schumpeterian and Keynesian efficiencies is expected to improve these prospects. Lall's commodity classification on a technology basis is adequate for delineating such sectors. In this study, distinct export and import functions are estimated for primary production, low technology manufacturing, medium technology manufacturing and high technology manufacturing industries using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test and Johansen approaches to cointegration. Resulting income elasticities are used to discuss the structural change in the technological content of Turkish trade and the validity of the Multisectoral Thirwall's Law. Results suggest that Turkey has come a long way in terms of improvements in Schumpeterian and Keynesian efficiency over the last 50years and that the Multisectoral Thirwall's Law is empirically valid in the case of Turkey.","[Birkan, Ayse Ozden] Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey",Yasar University,"Birkan, AÖ (通讯作者)，Yasar Univ, Dept Econ, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.",ozden.birkan@yasar.edu.tr,"Birkan, Ayşe Özden/ABI-6536-2020","Birkan, Ayşe Özden/0000-0003-2280-9567",,,,,42,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

These trade forms differ in terms of tariff treatment and the ability of firms to sell on the domestic market. At the industry level, we find that falling input tariffs-cause the share of ordinary trade in gross exports to increase, with both the intensive and extensive margins playing roles. The choice of trade form is tied to a lesser degree to the size of the domestic market, which processing firms cannot access. Consistent with the literature, we show that changes in the organization of trade linked to input tariff cuts caused the share of Chinese domestic content in gross exports to increase at the industry-province level.

We first adopt a reduced-form approach to derive general insights on the scope for conflict between national antitrust authorities and on the gains from international merger policy coordination. Taking trade costs as given, we use standard oligopoly models to derive conditions on market structure, under which underenforcement or overenforcement of national merger policies can arise. We then study the interactions between merger policy and trade policy, and find that trade liberalization often leads to stricter national merger policies.

Based on a set of 2-country Bayesian VAR models between major European economies, we find that a surprise stimulus triggers expectations of deficit reversals that may crowd out private expenditure. An anticipated stimulus, on the contrary, is found to boost domestic activity in all samples. Moreover, it has positive cross-border effects in 50 percent of the cases. Overall, our findings suggest that fiscal policy is effective when it is not crowded out by expectations of reversals. We document such crowding out effects in Italy and France.

It finds that minimum wages reduce firms' labor size, albeit at a small magnitude. A one-percent increase in real minimum wages leads to a 0.1% reduction in the number of workers of firms. Firms are more likely to reduce male workers and those without social insurance. As a result, the proportion of female workers and workers with social insurance in firms increases due to minimum wages.

As these services are mainly performed during work hours, this finding provides one mechanism by which absenteeism increases as a consequence of motherhood.

We differentiate between two types of eco-innovations (process vs. product and new-to-the-market (NTM) vs. new-to-the-firm (NTF)) and two different types of eco-innovators (large vs. small and old vs. new firms). Our findings show that new firms are not more eco-innovative and that smaller firms are certainly less eco-innovative. Although the environmental regulation variable is generally a main driver of eco-innovation, there are specific drivers for some eco-innovator and eco-innovation types. This is the case with internal innovation capabilities, which clearly influence small and new firms to eco-innovate, in contrast to large and old firms. Those capabilities are also a driver of NTM eco-innovation versus NTF eco-innovation. Involvement in external knowledge flows and cooperation is also a crucial variable for small firms to eco-innovate and a main driver of NTM versus NTF eco-innovation. Contrary to expectations, there are a few differential drivers for products vs. process eco-innovations. Energy/material cost reductions and environmental regulation influence both eco-innovation types, whereas the demand-pull from the market is absent for both, probably due to a relatively low degree of environmental consciousness and/or willingness to pay for eco-products by its consumers.","[Del Rio, Pablo; Penasco, Cristina] CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Romero-Jordan, Desiderio] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Paseo Artilleros s n, Madrid 28032, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Del Río, P (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain.",pablo.delrio@csic.es,"romero-jordán, desiderio/L-4219-2014; romero-jordán, desiderio/AAZ-2424-2020","romero-jordán, desiderio/0000-0002-5699-5364",,,,,54,69,70,1,47,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The article aims to identify new factors related to a client's creditworthiness, and to create an assessment model. The factors which have relations to a client's creditworthiness were identified in the first research stage. These factors represent the inputs into the model. The assessment model of the client's creditworthiness was created in the second stage. In the third stage, the model was verified and implemented. The neuro-fuzzy method was used for creation, verification and implementation of the model. Five variables were selected as the inputs including damages, insurance length, insurance penetration, annual earnings and 2nd degree liquidity. These input variables were divided into two categories based on their nature (insurance indicators, accounting indicators). Research results show that the proposed model was verified above input data and can be used as a tool for supporting decisions concerning a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The main contribution of the paper is the identification ofnew factors which have relation to a client's creditworthiness and the creation of the assessment model which works with these new factors transferred to fuzzy variables. The proposed model differs from the current approaches primarily thanks to its complex, systematic and hierarchical ability to evaluate the newly identified factors related to a client's creditworthiness as fuzzy variables. Thanks to the model, it is possible to automate and accelerate the process of evaluation of a client's creditworthiness in the insurance industry. The knowledge gained from the evaluation model is immediately possible to use in the strategic management of insurance companies e.g. in marketing activities.","[Doskocil, Radek] Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Doskocil, R (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",doskocil@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Doskočil, Radek/GLN-8159-2022","Doskočil, Radek/0000-0002-9716-1411",Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology [FP-S-15-2787],Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology,This paper was supported by grant FP-S-15-2787 Effective Use of ICT and Quantitative Methods for Business Processes Optimization from the Internal Grant Agency at Brno University of Technology.,,34,1,1,1,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This assumption is computationally very advantageous, and thus often used, but might be problematic due to the implied misspecification. Across most parameterizations, and using the method of simulated moments, we find a relatively large estimation bias in preference parameters. For example, assuming a unit root process when the true AR(1) coefficient is 0.97, leads to an estimation bias of up to 30 percent in the constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) coefficient. If used for calibration, misspecified preferences could, for example, lead to a serious misjudgment in the value of social insurance mechanisms. Economic behavior, such as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), of households simulated from the estimated (misspecified) model is, on the other hand, rather close to that from the correctly specified model.","[Druedahl, Jeppe; Jorgensen, Thomas H.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Druedahl, J; Jorgensen, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",jeppe.druedahl@econ.ku.dk; thomas.h.jorgensen@econ.ku.dk,,"Hogholm Jorgensen, Thomas/0000-0003-2570-9772; Druedahl, Jeppe/0000-0002-0462-8394","Danish Council for Independent Research in Social Sciences (FSE) [5052-00086B, 4091-00040]",Danish Council for Independent Research in Social Sciences (FSE),"We thank the managing editor and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

We isolate two channels through which these effects materialise: statutory reforms, which change legal standards, and strategic appointments, which change court composition. We analyse the probability of plaintiff success in courts using a panel of 81 judges and 2223 judicial decisions made between 2001 and 2015. We test for and subsequently exploit the randomised matching of labour court judges with unfair dismissal cases. We find significant effects from both channels: judges' work background and changes to legal standards are strong predictors of case outcomes. Furthermore, we find evidence of compensating effects: judges with a progressive background rule more often in favour of dismissed employees if legal reforms adversely affect their chance of success in court.

Indeed, we analyze the interaction of this variable with the PIB. The introduction of interactions between independent variables in a multiple linear regression is a specific application called moderated regression analysis.

We show that when neither alternative is ex ante preferred, simple majority voting cannot implement the first best outcome. We introduce a simple bidding mechanism where votes can be bought at a quadratic cost and voters receive rebates equal to the average of others' payments. This mechanism is budget-balanced, individually rational, and fully efficient in the limit. Moreover, the mechanism redistributes from those that gain from the outcome to those that lose and everyone is better off under bidding compared to voting. We test the two mechanisms in the lab using an environment with moderate and extremist voters. The observed efficiency losses under voting are close to theoretical predictions and significantly larger than under bidding. Because of redistribution, the efficiency gain from bidding benefits mostly the moderate voters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

On one hand, this process contributes to the economic development of the country because it causes the influx of not only outside capital in the form of investments, but also new technologies and solutions. On the other hand, when marketization is excessive and extends chaotically it may entail a risk of bankruptcy for local entrepreneurs and have a negative impact on social life, especially in smaller towns. According to the 2012 data, between the years of 2009-2012, more than 50,000 small retail shops vanished in Poland. Small general shops as well as specialized stores lost competition with large retail chain stores. In addition, retail chains increasingly build their own logistics centers. Retail chains of large stores, are already present in the whole country and have plans for further expansion.

Using an event study approach, we quantify the effects of Grexit-related statements made by six important euro area politicians (Merkel, Schaeuble, Tsipras, Varoufakis, Juncker, and Schulz) on intraday stock returns in Germany, Greece, and the euro area during the period of 1 January 2015-19 August 2015. We show that positive statements indicating that a Grexit is less likely lead to higher returns, and negative statements to lower returns. The overall impact of negative statements is more pronounced. The cumulative absolute effects on stock returns are sizeable as the statements contribute to a variation of up to 58 percentage points in the ATHEX.

J,"Hendrickson, JR",,,,"Hendrickson, Joshua R.",,,An Evaluation of Friedman's Monetary Instability Hypothesis,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RUN MONEY DEMAND; STABILITY,"In this article, I examine what I call Milton Friedman's Monetary Instability Hypothesis. Drawing on Friedman's work, I argue that there are two main components to this view. The first component is the idea that deviations between the public's demand for money and the supply of money are an important source of economic fluctuations. The second component of this view is that these deviations are primarily caused by fluctuations in the supply of money rather than the demand for money. Each of these components can be tested independently. To do so, I estimate an otherwise standard New Keynesian model, amended to include a money demand function consistent with Friedman's work and a money growth rule, for a period from 1875 to 1963. This structural model allows me to separately identify shocks to the money supply and shocks to money demand. I then use variance decompositions to assess the relative importance of shocks to the supply and demand for money. I find that shocks to the monetary base can account for up to 28% of the fluctuations in output whereas money demand shocks can account for less than 1% of such fluctuations. This provides support for Friedman's view.","[Hendrickson, Joshua R.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi,"Hendrickson, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, 229 North Hall, University, MS 38677 USA.",jrhendr1@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,22,1,2,1,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We employ a difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) approach to examine whether UCS effectively reduces out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure across income levels and regions. The empirical results note a significant reduction in medical expenditure for the post-UCS period in outpatient as well as inpatient expenditures. The impact of UCS on the difference in medical expenditure between the treated and control groups varies across regions, while there is no significant difference across income level groups. Thus, by helping to pay an affordable copayment for ambulatory care, UCS has overall softened the high medical costs and provides accessible medical resources for poor regions and middle-income people.","[Hsu, Yu-Tung; Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Yang, Chih-Hai] Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",National Central University; Thammasat University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.;Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,25,1,1,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

This study explores impacts of factor-biased technical changes on the economic system in terms of economic growth, employment, and distribution, using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results show that technological innovation contributes to higher level of economic growth with productivity improvements. However, our analysis suggests that economic growth accompanied by skill- and capital-biased technical progress disproportionately increases demand for capital and high-skilled labor over skilled and unskilled labor. This shift in the value-added composition is found to deepen income inequality, as more people in higher income groups benefit from skill premium and capital earnings. Our results suggest that policymakers should prepare a wide range of policy measures, such as reforms in educational programs and taxation systems, in order to ensure sustainable growth.","[Jung, Sungmoon] Busan Inst S&T Evaluat & Planning, 79 Centum Jungang Ro, Busan, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong-Dong; Yeo, Yeongjun] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul 151742, South Korea; [Hwang, Won-Sik] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong Si 30147, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET),"Yeo, Y (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",narkimess@snu.ac.kr; leejd@snu.ac.kr; yel0sik@snu.ac.kr; yyj913@snu.ac.kr,,"Yeo, Yeongjun/0000-0001-9782-3924",National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Government [NRF-2013R1A2A2A03014744],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Korean Government(Korean Government),"The authors are grateful to the editor and two anonymous reviewers who dedicated their considerable time and provided valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of the paper.

Our panel data approach disentangles under-reporting from fluctuations in transitory income and gives a point estimate of the under-reporting rate.

Using conditional difference-in-difference estimation with multiple treatments, we find for a sample of German firms in 1999-2013 that offshoring has a statistically significant negative impact on the firms' innovation activity and productivity growth vis-a-vis nonrelocating comparison firms. In contrast, we find a positive link between domestic relocation activities and the firms' propensity to introduce a product innovation. Firms should thus carefully account for potentially distorting performance effects when deciding about the spatial scale of relocation strategies in the short to mid-run.","[Kreutzer, Fabian] Niederrhein Univ Appl Sci, Monchengladbach, Germany; [Mitze, Timo] Univ Southern Denmark SDU, Dept Econ & Business, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Mitze, T (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark SDU, Dept Econ & Business, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",tmitze@sam.sdu.dk,,"Mitze, Timo/0000-0003-3799-5200",,,,,15,2,2,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

But these explanations cannot account for the steady drop in trade quarrels since the early 2000s and are silent on the link between trade policy and dispute initiations. This paper presents a new theory to show that tariff overhangs, the difference between WTO members' bound and applied tariffs, are the key to understanding the WTO dispute pattern. In the model, lower tariff overhangs constrain WTO members' legal policy options when responding to adverse shocks. Moreover, countries are more likely to gain from dispute filings through WTO-administered tariff retaliation when applied tariff rates are close to their bindings. Guided by this framework, the paper presents empirical evidence that tariff overhangs are an essential determinant of WTO disputes.","[Kuenzel, David J.] Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, PAC 123, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Wesleyan University,"Kuenzel, DJ (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Dept Econ, PAC 123, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",dkuenzel@wesleyan.edu,"Kuenzel, David/L-4212-2019","Kuenzel, David/0000-0001-7429-3246",Grover and Creta Ensley Fellowship in Economic Policy,Grover and Creta Ensley Fellowship in Economic Policy,"I would like to thank the editor Ayse imrohoroglu, one anonymous associate editor, and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments that improved the paper.

Creating opportunities for individuals and groups to talk to policy and decision makers and legislators is a part of the democratic process by which policy is formulated, implemented and tested. But some of these influences might have greater access to policy makers due to their bigger economic power. Some groups or individuals try to act/lobby behind closed doors and in secret. The problem of lack of transparent lobbying - lobbying by the rules - is closely related to decreased equality of access by voices representative of a wide range of interests to public decision-making. Similarly, formal institutions in the form of rules as well as the balance of political forces in society are considered to be endogenous, because they are chosen within the society. When selecting them, conflict of interests between different groups and individuals can be expected. Thus, there is a danger that institutions can develop to the benefit of stronger groups at the expense of others. A transparent environment where groups negotiate and transparency in the promotion of diverse interests - transparent lobbying - can significantly reduce this risk. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the connection between transparent lobbying and quality of democracy, in other words to investigate the influence of transparent lobbying on the process of democratization.","[Laboutkova, Sarka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Laboutková, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",sarka.laboutkova@tul.cz,"Laboutkova, Sarka/AAI-1256-2019","Laboutkova, Sarka/0000-0001-7108-2144",Czech Science Foundation [16-08786S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project No. 16-08786S Impact of Transparency of Lobbying on Democratization and Its Consequences.",,20,2,2,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,439,446,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500049,0

Design/methodology/approach - To calculate a region content in intermediate and value-added exports, this paper uses OECD's inter-country input-output table (ICIOT), and tries to decompose the contents of trade. Using the information of ICIOT, Koopman et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2013) decompose gross exports of a country's exports. Findings - TPP is a loosely tied bloc featured by openness to the Asia-Pacific region. Trade linkages between members are stronger in RCEP than those in TPP, particularly in the trade of intermediate goods. Trades in RCEP are closely connected to exports to TPP, but the opposite direction is not clear. Originality/value - Although this paper uses the approach by Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez, this paper is the first research on the analysis of the export contents in major trading blocs in the Asia-Pacific region.","[Lee, Chang-Soo] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Global Campus, Yongin, South Korea; [Cheong, Inkyo] Inha Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Inha University,"Cheong, I (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Dept Int Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",ikfta@naver.com,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The results indicate that individual stock sentiment has greater impact on small-firm stock prices than big-firm stock prices, which presents obvious cross-section effect. Moreover, individual stock sentiment leads to much sharper FLuctuations of stock prices in the stock market downturn than in the stock market expansion, which shows obvious time-series effect. Specifically, the individual stock sentiment has the greatest impact on small-firm stock prices under the stock market downturn, exerting significant dual asymmetric effect.

In current literature there are many methods and many distances measures, which can be mutually combined. In this paper were used different methods (Nearest neighbour, Farthest neighbour, Centroid method, Average distance, Ward's method) in combination with two selected distance measures (Euclidean and Mahalanobis). We compared situation with and without transformation of variables. There is no manual and rule which would clearly identify the appropriate combination method and distance measures during clustering. Simultaneously, in cluster analysis it is often necessary to determine the optimal number of clusters in to which the objects are to be classified. On the basis of the analyzes was found that in case of the Euclidean distance measure, it is preferable to transform the variables in using of the Ward method and the Farthest neighbour method. The success rates were higher than 80%. For other methods it was advisable to use methods without transformation of variables. The highest success in using of Mahalanobis' distance without transformation was again achieved with Ward's method. Using the Ward's method in combination with the Euclidean distance measure we achieve a higher rate of success by 21.91% in comparison with Mahalanobis distance measure.","[Loster, Tomas] Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Löster, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",losterto@vse.cz,"Löster, Tomáš/N-2754-2017",,"Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic [IP400040]","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic","This paper was supported by long term institutional support of research activities IP400040 by Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic.",,13,3,3,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,886,896,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300089,0

By early 2015, U.S. oil production reached 9.7 million barrels per day, a figure not seen since the nation's previous peak production in 1971. The dramatic increase in U.S. production is commonly referred to as the shale oil revolution. It is often alleged that the shale oil revolution was the result of technological change, particularly horizontal drilling and fracking. Technological change contributed to the increase in production, but such change involved much more than horizontal drilling and fracking. Institutional changes also contributed to the shale oil revolution. Besides market changes, new mechanisms of financing exploration and production were facilitated by low interest rates and quantitative easing. The political and regulatory environments changed as well. We investigate the peculiar interaction of institutions and technology in the shale oil industry between 2010 and 2015.","[Peach, James T.; Adkisson, Richard V.] New Mexico State Univ, Econ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",New Mexico State University,"Peach, JT (通讯作者)，New Mexico State Univ, Econ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",,,,,,,,34,3,3,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The goal of the study is to identify and explain the determinants of success and failure regarding NGOs' participation in designing public programmes. The methodology includes a combination of in-depth interviews with NGO representatives and public servants, a review of official documents, a focus group, and a stakeholders' review of the study's conclusions. The main obstacles to the implementation of the partnership principle are the following: NGOs' insufficient capacities and responsibilities; fluctuations in the participation of public servants and NGO representatives; dependence of partnership on personal contacts; NGOs' late entry and the non consultative, informative character of the partnership.","[Potluka, Oto] Univ Basel, CEPS, Steinengraben 22, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland; [Spacek, Martin] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, SPECTRA Ctr Excellence EU, Vazovova 5, Bratislava 81243 1, Slovakia; [Spacek, Martin] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia; [Remr, Jiri] Inst Evaluat & Social Anal, Hermanova 1169-22, Prague 17000 7, Czech Republic",University of Basel; Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Comenius University Bratislava,"Potluka, O (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, CEPS, Steinengraben 22, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",oto.potluka@unibas.ch; spacek@e-academia.eu; jiri.remr@inesan.eu,"Špaček, Martin/AAP-4639-2020; Remr, Jiří/AAL-8304-2020; Špaček, Martin/HHZ-5652-2022; Potluka, Oto/M-2034-2016","Remr, Jiří/0000-0001-9305-7847; Špaček, Martin/0000-0003-4085-6789; Potluka, Oto/0000-0002-9558-9473",People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union Seventh Framework Programme under REA [607022],People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union Seventh Framework Programme under REA(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results was conducted in the frame of the project Socio-Economic and Political Responses to Regional Polarisation in Central and Eastern Europe (RegPol2), coordinated by the Leibniz Institute for Regional Geography, Leipzig/Germany.

However, these theoretical treatments largely neglect two important effects following devaluation: (1) the inflationary impact on the price of imported intermediate inputs, which raises the prime costs of firms and deteriorates partially or totally their price competitiveness; and (2) the redistribution of income from wages to profits, which ambiguously affects the aggregate demand as workers and capitalists have different propensities to save. New structuralist economists have explored these stylized facts neglected by the orthodox literature and, by and large, conclude that devaluation has contractionary effects on growth and positive effects on the external balance. Given that empirical evidence on the correlation between devaluation and growth is quite mixed, we develop a more general Keynesian-Kaleckian model that takes into account both opposing views in order to analyze the net impact of currency depreciation on the short-run growth rate and the current account. We demonstrate that this impact can go either way, depending on several conditions such as the type of growth regime, that is, wage-led or profit-led, and the degree of international price competitiveness of domestic goods.","[Ribeiro, Rafael Saulo Marques] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge, England; [McCombie, John S.

The ARDL bounds testing approach is employed to examine the long-run relationship between the variables in the presence of structural breaks. The VECM Granger causality is applied to investigate the direction of causal relationships between the variables. Our empirical exercise validated the cointegration between the series in the case of United Arab Emirates. Further, results reveal that an inverted U-shaped relationship is found between economic growth and electricity consumption. Financial development adds in electricity consumption. The relationship between urbanisation and electricity consumption is also an inverted U-shaped. This implies that urbanisation increases electricity consumption initially and, after a threshold level of urbanisation, electricity demand falls. The causality analysis finds feedback hypothesis between economic growth and electricity consumption, i.e. economic growth and electricity consumption are interdependent. The bidirectional causality is found between financial development and electricity consumption. Economic growth and urbanisation Granger cause each other. The feedback hypothesis is also found between urbanisation and financial development, financial development and economic growth, and the same is true for electricity consumption and urbanisation.","[Sbia, Rashid] Solvay Brussels Sch Econ & Management, Dulbea, Belgium; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Ozturk, Ilhan] Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Mersin, Turkey; [Sbia, Rashid] Minist Finance, Macrofiscal Dept, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Montpellier Business School; Cag University - Turkey,"Ozturk, I (通讯作者)，Cag Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Mersin, Turkey.",ilhanozturk@cag.edu.tr,"Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Ozturk, Ilhan/B-9431-2009; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019; sbia, rashid/IYJ-6719-2023","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Ozturk, Ilhan/0000-0002-6521-0901; sbia, rashid/0000-0003-2277-0455",,,,,78,77,77,3,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In the following paper, we are going to test the effectiveness of mobile vs. desktop multimedia ads on the social network Facebook which at the moment has the biggest mobile advertising platform. The sets of video advertisements will be tested on the specific group of users belonging to the millennial generation that is the most represented among the mobile users.

Estimation of tail dependence between financial assets plays a vital role in various aspects of financial risk modelling including portfolio theory and hedging amongst applications. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides well established methods for considering univariate and multivariate tail distributions which are useful for forecasting financial risk or modelling the tail dependence of risky assets. The empirical analysis in this article uses nonparametric measures based on bivariate EVT to investigate asymptotic dependence and estimate the degree of tail dependence of the ASX-All Ordinaries daily returns with four other international markets, viz., the S& P-500, Nikkei-225, DAX-30 and Heng-Seng for both extreme right and left tails of the return distribution. It is investigated whether the asymptotic dependence between these markets is related to the heteroscedasticity present in the logarithmic return series using GARCH filters. The empirical evidence shows that the asymptotic extreme tail dependence between stock markets does not necessarily exist and rather can be associated with the heteroscedasticity present in the financial time series of the various stock markets.","[Singh, Abhay K.; Allen, David E.; Powell, Robert J.] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Allen, David E.] Univ Sydney, Sch Math & Stat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Edith Cowan University; University of South Australia; University of Sydney,"Singh, AK (通讯作者)，Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Business & Law, Perth, WA, Australia.",a.singh@ecu.edu.au,"Allen, David/AAM-9744-2021; Singh, Abhay/AAG-9813-2021; Allen, David/JTV-4098-2023","Allen, David/0000-0001-7782-0865; Powell, Robert/0000-0003-3634-1264; Singh, Abhay/0000-0002-3783-6325",Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (funds awarded to the second and the third authors).,,35,3,4,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For the identification of risks, two approaches to calculating the Cost of Equity were applied. The first approach was based on CAPM's calculation of Cost of Equity, with the assumption of external and systematic risks. The second approach was based on Build-up model with the acceptance of internal and non-systematic risks. The data of the food industry enterprises in Slovakia for the period 2004 2013 were used to implement this research. Based on the application of these approaches, it was possible to identify the impact of internal, external risks, systematic and non-systematic risks on a company performance. Finally, we constructed new 3-dimensional Enterprise Risk Model (ERM) is a suitable risk management tool for assessing and predicting the risk impact on the enterprise performance.","[Sofrankova, Beata; Kiselakova, Dana; Horvathova, Jarmila] Univ Presov Presov, Fac Management, Dept Finance, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia",University of Presov,"Sofranková, B (通讯作者)，Univ Presov Presov, Fac Management, Dept Finance, Konstantinova 16, Presov 08001, Slovakia.",beata.sofrankova@unipo.sk; dana.kiselakova@unipo.sk; jarmila.horvathova@unipo.sk,"Kiselakova, Dana/H-9007-2018; Horváthová, Jarmila/D-2360-2018; Sofrankova, Beata/F-6890-2017","Horváthová, Jarmila/0000-0003-3388-8635; Sofrankova, Beata/0000-0001-9766-0467",VEGA [1/0791/16],VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"The paper is part of the solution and project outputs of the grant project VEGA No. 1/0791/16 Modern approaches to improving enterprise performance and competitiveness using the innovative model Enterprise Performance Model to streamline Management Decision-Making Processes, solved at the Faculty of Management, University of Presov in Presov, the Slovak Republic.",,58,8,8,0,13,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

In this text the author sets herself two goals. First of all she wishes to map how and whether the Czech Republic is prepared for the oncoming period of digitalisation, whether specialised analyses and surveys are performed in regard to these issues, whether the necessary documents are being accepted, whether specialised discussions are being realised with subjects that the specific changes should affect, and how these subjects perceive the need for these changes and prepare for them. The second goal was to find out whether the necessary changes are also being prepared within the terms of the educational system, which should be capable of preparing workers for new challenges arising for the labour market from the concept of the 4th industrial revolution.","[Sojkova, Lenka] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Sojková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",lenka.sojkova@tul.cz,"Sojková, Lenka/AAE-3524-2022","Sojková, Lenka/0000-0002-0563-3419",,,,,12,3,3,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,125,135,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500014,0

First, we propose and discuss the notion of hesitant fuzzy Heronian mean operators. By using these operators, we can portray the relationship of the criteria effectively. Then, the numerical examples are provided and comparative analyses with other aggregation operators are not neglected. Furthermore, the weighted forms of the hesitant fuzzy Heronian mean operators are defined for MCDM problem, based on which, new MCDM methods are proposed.

J,"Alonso, C",,,,"Alonso, Cristian",,,Hard vs. soft financial constraints: Implications for the effects of a credit crunch,JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Credit crunch; Borrowing constraints; Consumption,ENDOGENOUS GRID METHOD; QUANTITATIVE THEORY; IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK; LIQUIDITY; DEBT,"In the aftermath of the Great Recession, understanding how households' consumption responds to a credit crunch has been a central goal of macroeconomics. Most of the recent research has explored this question using a hard constraint modeling device, where households can borrow at the risk-free rate only up to an exogenous amount. An alternative, and more realistic, way to model financial frictions is to allow households to borrow as much as they want but at an interest rate that depends on the level of debt. I refer to the latter as the soft constraint model. In a Standard Incomplete Markets framework with heterogeneous agents, I calibrate two economies differing only in the type of financial constraint that households face and I show that a credit crunch in the hard constraint economy (i.e. decrease in the exogenous borrowing limit) produces a drop in consumption significantly more severe than an equivalent crunch in the soft constraint version (i.e. increase in the borrowing interest rate). I conclude that the quantitative consequences of a credit crunch largely depend on the modeling approach.","[Alonso, Cristian] Princeton Univ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Alonso, C (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Julis Romo Rabinowitz Bldg, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",calonso@princeton.edu,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

The efficient firm pays a higher wage but has lower marginal production costs (due to its productivity advantage). Profits and worker surplus are higher at the efficient firm. A positive productivity shock affecting the efficient firm is always welfare improving; while if affecting the inefficient firm it may be welfare detrimental (if consumers' gain does not compensate the loss in worker surplus and industry profit).

The impact of expressing emotions in ultimatum bargaining,EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Experiment; Ultimatum game; Emotion; Rating; Disapproval aversion,DISAPPOINTMENT AVERSION; INCOMPLETE INFORMATION; FAIRNESS; BEHAVIOR; GAMES; RECIPROCITY; PUNISHMENT,"Past experimental research has shown that when rating systems are available, buyers are more generous in accepting unfair offers in ultimatum bargaining. However, it also suggests that, under these conditions, sellers behave more fairly to avoid receiving negative feedback. This paper experimentally investigates which effect is stronger with the use of a rating system: buyers' inflated inequity acceptance or sellers' disapproval aversion. We explore this question by varying the information condition on the buyers' side. Our experiment shows that in a setup where the size of the pie is common knowledge for both buyers and sellers, when a rating system is present, the sellers exhibit disapproval aversion but the buyers do not display greater acceptance of inequity. By contrast, when only sellers are aware of the size of the pie, sellers behave aggressively to exploit buyers and their behavior does not change in the presence of a rating system; however, buyers display greater acceptance of inequity when a rating system is present. We discuss how these results can be explained by a theoretical model that includes sellers' social disapproval aversion and buyers' disappointment aversion in addition to the players' inequality aversion.","[Chen, Josie I.] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Daxue Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan; [Kamei, Kenju] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",National Taipei University; Durham University,"Kamei, K (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",josiechen@gm.ntpu.edu.tw; kenju.kamei@gmail.com,"Chen, Josie I/AHA-3570-2022","Chen, Josie I/0000-0002-7276-5817; Kamei, Kenju/0000-0002-7905-8584",Murata Science Foundation in Japan; Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST105-2410-H-305-016],"Murata Science Foundation in Japan; Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This project was supported by a Grant from the Murata Science Foundation in Japan and from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan (MOST105-2410-H-305-016).

The condition of effective demand is different from that obtained by Pasinetti (1981, 1993) because now it depends on the family types. In addition, the inclusion of different consumption profiles, and their own dynamics, makes the task of pursuing full employment more challenging. Families face different inflation rates, even with stability of prices. In this vein, the necessity of the Central Bank to pursue stability of general price level is formally approached. The Central Bank intervention is also justified by the influence of different consumption profiles on the rate of interest and on the inter -temporal distribution of income. Our analysis shows some consequences and complexities of a preliminary institutional approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

More recently, a growing literature has identified externalities across different forms of entrepreneurial finance. These externalities include but are not limited to spillovers from one form of finance to another (such as from crowdfunding to venture capital, etc.), spillovers from domestic to international investment, and spillovers from early stage to late stage investment. Sometimes these externalities are positive and at other times they are negative.

However, our results also suggest that properly designed treatments may improve the reading and academic outcomes of students. Specifically, we found that increased access to independent reading materials coupled with effective teacher training led to significant improvements in student reading skills, math test scores, and Chinese test scores. We believe that these improvements are due to changes in reading instruction and the attitudes of teachers toward reading.

First, crowdfunding has the potential to foster innovation by offering new sources of capital to innovation-driven firms and thereby reduce the funding gap for innovative startups. Second, crowdfunding offers a way for the crowd to participate in the innovation process by providing feedback to the entrepreneur.

With this regard special difficulties pose the fiscal criterion relating to the maximum allowed budget deficit of 3 per cent of GDP. If it is not met, the European Commission launches the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Currently, such formula applies to France, Spain and the United Kingdom. Although the issue is not absolutely certain, one can assume that euro will weather the present difficulties and will come out stronger, though the economically unjustified Euro scepticism of some countries is not helping. It may be expected that in the 2020s the European Monetary Union will be joined by all countries that are still using their national currencies and that the EU will be extended to include new member states, enlarging the euro area further. In this article authors are discussing the issue whether Poland will join the EZ in the coming years, considering the challenges of meeting all Maastricht criteria, on the one hand, and the reluctance of the government to give up the national currency, on the other. A mixed method combining the results of qualitative and quantitative research has been used to empirically verify the research question presented.","[Kolodko, Grzegorz W.] Kozminski Univ, TIGER, Warsaw, Poland; [Postula, Marta] Warsaw Univ, Fac Management, Ctr Entrepreneurship, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University; University of Warsaw,"Kolodko, GW (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, TIGER, Warsaw, Poland.",kolodko@tiger.edu.pl; mpostula@wz.uw.edu.pl,,"KOLODKO, Grzegorz W./0000-0001-7015-5612",,,,,34,7,7,1,4,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Previous researches suggest that the performance of the cooperatives is determined by their organizational design. Thus, this fact imposes the need to examine if the organizational models applied by the agricultural cooperatives affect their profitability outcome. This is the first Greek survey on performance contrasting traditional agricultural cooperatives and cooperatives with capital-seeking entities. Financial data of 34 cooperative organizations were used in a profitability equation, estimated with generalized error-structure model for a 5-years period. The findings show that there are differences in the economic results and the factors affecting profitability between these two types of cooperatives, providing evidence that the organizational type affects performance. The results also indicate that there exists management inefficiency especially for the traditional cooperatives. Based on the particular findings, cooperative practitioners and policymakers could advance their knowledge in order to boost performance level in cooperatives.","[Kontogeorgos, Achilleas] Univ Patras, Dept Business Adm Food & Agr Enterprises, Agrinion, Greece; [Sergaki, Panagiota; Kosma, Anastasia; Semou, Vassiliki] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Forestry & Nat Environm, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Patras; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Sergaki, P (通讯作者)，Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Agr Forestry & Nat Environm, Dept Agr Econ, Thessaloniki, Greece.",akontoge@upatras.gr; gsergaki@auth.gr; kosma@agro.auth.gr; vassoula@auth.gr,"Sergaki, Panagiota/AAN-8706-2021","SERGAKI, PANAGIOTA/0000-0003-1717-7091",State Scholarships Foundation (IKY),State Scholarships Foundation (IKY),The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their comments.

They agree, however, that the core problem is human, not market failure. Their widely held assessment helps explain why the Dodd-Frank banking reform says so much and does so little. This study re-tries the usual suspects and finds none guilty. Instead, it points to multiple equilibria in banking and the overall economy. Whether it is Cooke and Company in 1873 or Lehman Brothers in 2008, and opacity are the wicked brew that stokes bank runs. And bank runs prompt employer runs - laying off your employees (other firms' customers) for fear that others are laying off their employees (your customers). The answer is fundamental, not cosmetic banking reform that fixes banking and the economy for good. The answer is replacing leveraged, trust-me banking with fully transparent, 100 percent equity-financed mutual fund banking. This reform, called Limited Purpose Banking, handles all aspects of finance, including lending, risk allocation and the payment system. It would permanently end the leveraging of taxpayers by banks and bring a permanent end to financial crises.","[Kotlikoff, Laurence] Boston Univ, Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Amer Acad Arts & Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Econometr Soc, Cleveland, OH USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kotlikoff, Laurence] Econ Secur Planning Inc, Lexington, MA 02421 USA",Boston University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Amer Acad Arts & Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Econometr Soc, Cleveland, OH USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Kotlikoff, L (通讯作者)，Econ Secur Planning Inc, Lexington, MA 02421 USA.",kotlikoff@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,1,1,0,5,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

However, only a few papers in the economics literature analyze how supervisors influence employees' well-being and enhance productivity. This paper uses longitudinal data of employees with information about their immediate bosses' ability, management skills, and characteristics (such as competency, communication skills, and personality traits) to investigate the influence of supervisors on employees. The main findings are as follows. First, even after controlling for individual-specific fixed effects and other job characteristics, such as those proposed in the job strain model, we find that supervisors' good communication with staff and competency in managerial tasks significantly improve employees' mental health. Second, we find that good communication between the boss and his/her staff enhances the latter's productivity and lowers presenteeism. Third, supervisors' bad communication and low competency increase the probability of quitting. Fourth, good communication partially depends on boss-staff compatibility, which is governed in part by their combined personality traits.","[Kuroda, Sachiko] Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjyuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Yamamoto, Isamu] Keio Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Waseda University; Keio University,"Kuroda, S (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Educ & Integrated Arts & Sci, Shinjyuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",s-kuroda@waseda.jp; yamamoto@fbc.keio.ac.jp,,"Yamamoto, Isamu/0000-0002-4936-613X; Kuroda, Sachiko/0000-0002-3125-3970","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [16K03715, 18K0165]; Health Labour Sciences Research Grant of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [H30-roudou-ippan-008]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03715] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Health Labour Sciences Research Grant of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was conducted as part of the Project Labor Market Analysis Using Matched Employer-Employee Panel Data undertaken at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI).

Contrary to the decisions of the rich, the decisions of the poor were insensitive to changes in the magnitude of potential losses: the risk taking of the poor did not increase when potential losses were low compared to when they were high. The decisions of the poor were also significantly less sensitive to changes in the probability of potential losses, compared to those of the rich. On the contrary, similarly to the decisions of the rich, the decisions of the poor were significantly sensitive to changes in the gain amount: risk taking was higher when the gain amount was higher than when it was lower. The rich sample from Lima showed a similar pattern of risk-taking behavior as other non-poor populations from previous studies. Furthermore, the poor scored higher on the perceived constraints scale and showed the same level of unrealistic optimism for negative events, but less unrealistic optimism for positive events, than the rich.","[Ronzani, P.; Savadori, L.; Folloni, G.; Mittone, L.] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Savadori, L (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",lucia.savadori@unitn.it,"Savadori, Lucia/AAF-8807-2019; Savadori, Lucia/A-6196-2013","Savadori, Lucia/0000-0003-3957-3132; Mittone, Luigi/0000-0001-6521-7698",,,,,55,3,3,0,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

I find that tax morale, measured by the number of reports per unit of irregular activity, is negatively associated with the median reported amount. If the utility of reporting evasion is increasing in the amount of the transaction, then, for a fixed cost of reporting, there exists a threshold value above which tax evasion is reported. Stronger tax morale implies a bigger utility for the individual that reports the transaction and, therefore, a lower threshold value above which tax evasion is reported. The empirical analysis features a regression of the median reported evaded amount per economic activity on tax morale, controlling for province fixed effects, economic activity fixed effects and time dummies. I also propose a simulation exercise to estimate the threshold below which tax evasion is reported and its dependence on tax morale. The simulation also shows that the empirical results are not the byproduct of oversampling of small transactions. I conclude that tax morale makes it more difficult to overlook petty evasion.","[Russo, Francesco Flaviano] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Cinthia, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Russo, Francesco Flaviano] CSEF, Via Cinthia, I-80126 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Russo, FF (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Cinthia, I-80126 Naples, Italy.;Russo, FF (通讯作者)，CSEF, Via Cinthia, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",francescoflaviano.russo@unina.it,,,,,,,35,1,1,1,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The exception from this were Croatia and Slovenia whose more liberal institutional setting and existence of economic relationships with market economies resulted in sizeable portion of exports being directed to Western European markets. The aim of this paper is to explore the effects of trade liberalization with European Union on changes in the structure and quality of exports from NMS in the period 1990-2015. Results obtained using synthetic control method (SCM) signal that the timing of trade liberalization with the European Union shaped the evolution of export performance, structure and quality of exports from NMS. The most advanced NMS managed to reap full benefits of preferential access to EU markets. The effects on countries that later embarked on this process, Slovenia and in particular Croatia have been several times smaller. Trade liberalization increased quality of exports and the share of high technology intensive industries in its structure across all NMS.

Is such transparency beneficial for cooperation? Having no information or having full information on the order of move and on what others have done before in the sequential game leads to the same theoretical prediction: free-riding. However, Nishihara (Nishihara, 1997) proved that full cooperation can be sustained in a class of social dilemma games in a Nash equilibrium if players have partial information. This is the case when they do not know the order of their move in the game and only observe whether or not someone chose to free-ride before them. In an experiment, we implement a game satisfying these conditions. We compare behavior in this game to the same game, but with subjects informed on the order in which they move. Cooperation is not an equilibrium in this case, but we find that cooperation is more frequent in this treatment than in the partial information treatment where cooperation is an equilibrium outcome. We relate our observations to conditional cooperation motivations.","[Vyrastekova, Jana] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Econ, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Funaki, Yukihiko] Waseda Univ, Sch Polit Econ & Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Radboud University Nijmegen; Waseda University,"Vyrastekova, J (通讯作者)，Elinor Ostrom Bldg,Heyendaalseweg 141, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.vyrastekova@fm.ru.nl; funaki@waseda.jp,,,,,,,39,1,1,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We show that the total factor productivity gains are an order of magnitude smaller, at only 0.25 percentage points per year. There are two reasons for this difference. First, the majority of studies have used a decomposition method that effectively assumes linear production functions. This results in values that are much larger than the more appropriate Denison-Kuznets method. Second, we also allow for sectoral differences in human capital. We conclude that the gains from labor reallocation may have been a far less important source of China's growth than is conventionally thought.","[Ye, Longfeng] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Robertson, Peter E.] Univ Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia",Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University; University of Western Australia,"Robertson, PE (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Business Sch, Econ, M251,35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",peter.robertson@uwa.edu.au,,"Ye, Longfeng/0000-0002-5415-6735; Robertson, peter/0000-0002-0424-6732",,,,,94,3,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

In addition to identifying the perceived major obstacles to business operations, the article looks at whether managers in the agribusiness sector perceive corruption differently than do managers in other sectors. The empirical analysis makes use of the most recent wave of the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) conducted between 2012 and 2013, complemented by our own survey conducted in 2016. The results paint a heterogeneous picture. One-fifth of the respondents to BEEPS agree that private payments or gifts to local officials have a moderate or high direct impact, whereas the rate of agreement declines when asked about parliamentarians or government officials. Results of a range of econometric models, however, do not reveal differences between agribusiness and other sectors at large. Only in two of ten specifications do respondents from agribusiness tend to perceive corruption as occurring less frequently than do respondents from other sectors. However, country effects seem to be more important than intersectoral differences in the perception of corruption.","[Herzfeld, Thomas; Kulyk, Iryna; Wolz, Axel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Dept Agr Policy, Halle, Germany; [Herzfeld, Thomas] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr Sci & Nutr, Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO); Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Herzfeld, T (通讯作者)，Theodor Lieser Str 2, D-06120 Halle, Germany.",herzfeld@iamo.de,"Herzfeld, Thomas/B-2929-2014; , IAMO/G-2328-2012; Policy, Department Agricultural/X-9655-2019","Herzfeld, Thomas/0000-0001-8331-5750;",European Union [612755],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This study was conducted with financial support from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration under grant agreement no 612755 (AGRICISTRADE).",,37,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We present evidence that home-sourcing occurs in the context of a new competitive environment where the relative importance of scale economies versus variety is altered, and a recoupling of innovation and production within industrial ecosystems becomes desirable. We look at the determinants of manufacturing home-sourcing. We find that R&D-intensive businesses with core non-standardized products are more likely to switch sourcing of components to the home economy from abroad. Our findings provide evidence in favour of increasing trends towards closer value chains for knowledge-intensive production, suggesting that the possibilities for (and potential impact of) home-sourcing have not been fully recognised as pathways to industrial and economic renewal in mature economies. The implications for industrial policy are to focus on the resilience of existing national industrial ecosystems and their attractiveness and ability to integrate incoming business opportunities.","[De Propris, Lisa] Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Bailey, David] Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Corradini, Carlo] Univ Birmingham, Sch Business, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; Aston University; University of Birmingham,"De Propris, L (通讯作者)，Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",l.depropris@bham.ac.uk,,"De Propris, Lisa/0000-0002-1476-1674; Corradini, Carlo/0000-0001-9164-4108","EU Horizon 2020 project MAKERS-Smart Manufacturing for EU growth and prosperity - Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme, under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions [691192]","EU Horizon 2020 project MAKERS-Smart Manufacturing for EU growth and prosperity - Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme, under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions","The writing of this paper has been supported by the EU Horizon 2020 project MAKERS-Smart Manufacturing for EU growth and prosperity is a project funded by the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Staff Exchange Programme, which is a Research and Innovation Staff Exchange under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions, grant agreement number 691192.

To understand this process, we propose a conceptual framework in which the introduction of religious competition shifts political markets where religious authorities provide legitimacy to rulers in exchange for control over resources. Consistent with our framework, religious competition changed the balance of power between secular and religious elites: secular authorities acquired enormous amounts of wealth from monasteries closed during the Reformation, particularly in Protestant regions. This transfer of resources had significant consequences. First, it shifted the allocation of upper-tail human capital. Graduates of Protestant universities increasingly took secular, especially administrative, occupations. Protestant university students increasingly studied secular subjects, especially degrees that prepared students for public sector jobs, rather than church sector specific theology. Second, it affected the sectoral composition of fixed investment. Particularly in Protestant regions, new construction shifted from religious toward secular purposes, especially the building of palaces and administrative buildings, which reflected the increased wealth and power of secular lords. Reallocation was not driven by preexisting economic or cultural differences. Our findings indicate that the Reformation played an important causal role in the secularization of the West.","[Cantoni, Davide] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Munich, Germany; CESIfo, Munich, Germany; London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; Ctr Econ Performance, London, England; Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Natl Bur Econ Res, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Cantoni, D (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Munich, Germany.",,,,Marie Curie Career Integration Grant; European Research Council from the European Union [638957]; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [638957] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Marie Curie Career Integration Grant(Marie Curie Actions); European Research Council from the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank the editor, Robert Barro, and four anonymous referees for valuable feedback.

The results indicate that the carbon tax is best for Sri Lanka to reduce emissions by 7% from 2010 levels. This policy shows the least welfare deteriorating effect with increases in real GDP by 0.2%. Although Pakistan has a distorted market of energy subsidies and taxes, the carbon tax is appropriate for emissions reductions of 5% from 2011 levels with no adverse impact on GDP. Thus, both economies can achieve their emission targets cost-effectively and any welfare loss can be compensated from the carbon tax revenues.

We compile an original data set for Germany, including regional information on the amount of tax payers using amnesty regulations to voluntarily disclose taxes they have evaded. The data set also includes counts of news reports published by 6 national and 54 local newspapers that address celebrity tax evaders who were publicly tried between January 2010 and June 2016. We find a strong correlation between the amount of self-denunciations and the news coverage. To identify the causal effect, we use exogenous variation in the reporting, resulting from disasters and terrorist attacks that coincide with the celebrity trials. Instrumental variable estimates suggest that an increase in news coverage by the amount of an average trial raises participation in the tax amnesty program by approximately 22.5%. This finding helps to better understand the effectiveness of tax amnesties, and it illustrates the economic implications of publicly trying famous personalities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While the common monetary policy takes care of union-wide fluctuations, fiscal policies should be tailored to meet country-specific conditions. This separation is no longer optimal, however, if monetary policy is constrained by an effective lower bound on interest rates. Specifically, we show that in this case there are benefits from coordinating fiscal policies across countries. By coordinating fiscal policies, policymakers are better able to stabilize union-wide activity and inflation while avoiding detrimental movements of a country's terms of trade. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We use laboratory experiments on college seniors to measure tastes for competition and confidence and then track these subjects' labor market experiences in the early years after college. Women's compensation is positively correlated with preferences for competition coupled with confidence while men's compensation is not. Women who exhibit a taste to compete and are confident about their performance earn substantially more than other women and do not earn less than men. Further, enjoying competition or being confident alone is insufficient to raise compensation. Half of this female earnings' effect is explained by college major and labor market controls, but even controlling for these characteristics, a higher taste for competition for the most confident women results in more than a 7% increase in compensation.

The baseline model, which is a direct extension of Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) model of industry dynamics, can account for the macroeconomic rates of entry and exit over the business cycle observed in the U.S. data. It cannot, however, account for the microeconomic characteristics of entering plants. Assuming that entry costs are cyclical can resolve this inconsistency between the model and the data. We also show that this pattern of entry costs can arise from an endogenous mechanism. The business cycle results are robust when we extend the model to incorporate plant life cycle features.

To do this, I exploit variation in the implementation of seat quotas for women applied to a three-tiered local governance structure in India. Enrollment effects were substantially larger than those previously estimated for exposure to female leaders in the lowest tier of local government. The policy response is larger among girls in poorer households and those with less-educated women in the household, and was commensurate with reductions in idle time and employment in household enterprises. There is no evidence of additional school infrastructure, nor a reallocation of schooling resources. Effect magnitudes imply that more than two thirds of the net effect of the policy comes from female politicians serving in reserved positions other than the village council chairperson seat.","[O'Connell, Stephen D.] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [O'Connell, Stephen D.] IZA Inst Labor Econ, Bonn, Germany",Emory University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"O'Connell, SD (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",soconnell@emory.edu,,"O'Connell, Stephen Daniel/0000-0002-2549-2000",CUNY Doctoral Student Research Grant program,CUNY Doctoral Student Research Grant program,"I thank several colleagues for valuable comments, including Hunt Allcott, Onur Altindag, Mehtab Azam, Karna Basu, Jonathan Conning, Mike Grossman, Lakshmi Iyer, David Jaeger, Ted Joyce, Bill Kerr, Hani Mansour, Mindy Marks, Paloma Lopez de mesa Moyano, Nishith Prakash, Martin Rotemberg, Vidhya Soundararajan, Kibrom Tafere, Suleyman Taspinar, Wim Vijverberg, Alice Zulkarnain, and participants at NEUDC, Cornell University AEM, DEVPEC, the University of California -Riverside, and IZA.

J,"Shapiro, C",,,,"Shapiro, Carl",,,Antitrust in a time of populism,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Antitrust; Competition; Market concentration; Oligopoly; Mergers; Monopolization,DYNAMISM,"This article discusses how to move antitrust enforcement forward in a constructive manner during a time of widespread and growing concern over the political and economic power of large corporations in the United States. Three themes are emphasized. First, a body of economic evidence supports more vigorous merger enforcement in the United States. Tighter merger control can be achieved by utilizing the existing legal presumption against highly concentrating mergers. Second, close antitrust scrutiny is appropriate for today's largest and most powerful firms, including those in the tech sector. Proper antitrust enforcement regarding unilateral conduct by dominant firms should continue to focus on identifying specific conduct that harms customers or disrupts the competitive process. Third, while antitrust enforcement has a vital role to play in keeping markets competitive, antitrust law and antitrust institutions are ill suited to directly address concerns associated with the political power of large corporations or other public policy goals such as income inequality or job creation.

Experimental Evidence from Uganda,JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,knowledge sharing; spread of innovations; incentives for diffusion,SOCIAL NETWORKS; LITERACY; ADOPTION; FOUNDATIONS; BUSINESS,"Many development interventions involve training of beneficiaries, based on the assumption that knowledge and skills will spread 'automatically' among a wider target population. However, diffusion of knowledge or innovations can be slow and incomplete. We use a randomised field experiment in Uganda to assess the impact of providing incentives for knowledge diffusion, and pay trained individuals a fee if they share knowledge obtained during a financial literacy training. Our main results are that incentives increase knowledge sharing, and that it may be cost-effective to provide such incentives. We also document an absence of assortative matching in the social learning process.","[Sseruyange, John] Makerere Univ, Sch Econ, Plot 51,Pool Rd,POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Sseruyange, John; Bulte, Erwin] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Makerere University; Wageningen University & Research,"Bulte, E (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",erwin.bulte@wur.nl,,,Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (N.W.O.)

Regulating product risks with costly consumer attention,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Warning labels; Product labeling regulation; Mandatory disclosure; Product liability; Economics of attention,RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT; INFORMATION; DISCLOSURE; QUALITY; MODEL,"This paper examines the liability and labeling approaches to regulating product safety. Stronger product liability increases producer care, which then has a negative lulling effect on consumer attention to warning labels. By contrast, more visible warning labels increase such consumer care, which then has a positive vigilance effect on producer care. Information campaigns educating consumers about product risks generate a similar vigilance effect. This happens because consumers view producer care and consumer care levels as strategic substitutes, while the firm views them as strategic complements. We argue that when a public policy is chosen, the endogeneity of consumer attention to warnings is not to be overlooked. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper studies the existence and properties of BME in a general class of overlapping generations economies with capital accumulation and stochastic production shocks. Using monotone methods, we develop a general approach to construct Markov equilibria and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for these equilibria to be bubbly. Our main result shows that a BME exists whenever the bubbleless equilibrium is Pareto inefficient due to either overaccumulation of capital or inefficient risk sharing between generations.","[Barbie, Martin] Univ Cologne, Ctr Macroecon Res, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Hillebrand, Marten] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Cologne; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Hillebrand, M (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, Theodor W Adorno Pl 3, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",barbie@wiso.uni-koeln.de; Hillebrand@em.uni-frankfurt.de,"Barbie, Martin/ABG-7708-2021",,,,,,43,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.
