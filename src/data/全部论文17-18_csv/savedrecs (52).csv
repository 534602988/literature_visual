The purpose of this paper is to assess the role income, prices, policy, agricultural production, and market access play on how rural households purchase different food groups. Design/methodology/approach - Six separate log-normal double hurdle models are run on six different food groups to examine what affects the probability a household purchases in each food group and for those who do purchase, what determines the quantity purchased. Findings - Rural Rwandans are price and expenditure responsive but prices have more impact on food group purchases. Crop production resulted in reduced household market procurement for its associated food group but had mixed effects on the purchases of all other food groups. Rural Rwandans purchase and consume low amounts of animal-based proteins which may be a leading factor related to the high stunting and wasting rates. Owning an animal increased the purchased quantity of meat but lowered the purchased quantity of most other food groups. Practical implications - Results suggest that policies and programs have to address multiple constraints simultaneously to increase the purchases of the limited food groups in the rural household diets that may be contributing to the high rates of stunting and wasting. Originality/value - This study is the first to evaluate the interplay among prices, household income, household production, policies and donor programs, and demographic variables on rural Rwandan household food purchases.","[Weatherspoon, Dave D.; Steele-Adjognon, Marie] Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Niyitanga, Fidele] Univ Rwanda, Rural Dev & Agr Econ, Kigali, Rwanda; [Dushimumuremyi, Jean Paul] WFP Rwanda Country Off, VAM, Kigali, Rwanda; [Naseem, Anwar] Rutgers State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Oehmke, James] US Agcy Int Dev, Washington, DC 20523 USA",Michigan State University; University of Rwanda; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; United States Agency for International Development (USAID),"Steele-Adjognon, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",steele37@msu.edu,,,USDA/USAID through the Rutgers Consortium for Policy Impact Analysis [TA-CA-15-008],USDA/USAID through the Rutgers Consortium for Policy Impact Analysis(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),The views presented in this manuscript are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the United States Agency for International Development.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the association between the technical efficiency of horticultural farms and access to finance from different finance providers. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 434 farmers who produce mango, mangosteen, chili and red onion in Indonesia. Data were subsequently analysed using data envelopment analysis and bootstrap truncated regression. Findings - The results show that commercial credit from banks and in- kind finance provided through farmers' associations have a positive association with the technical efficiency of some types of horticultural farms. Commercial credit from micro finance institution and flexible payment of inputs to the agricultural input kiosk generally have negative associations, especially with the technical efficiency of mangosteen farms. Subsidised credit from banks and in- kind finance from traders have both positive and negative associations with the technical efficiency of the horticultural farms. Originality/value - This study adds to the existing literature by analysing access to finance from a broader range of finance providers and its relation to technical efficiency.","[Wulandari, Eliana; Meuwissen, Miranda P.

Private and public R&D spending across three competing, yet complementary inputs - Labor, Capital, and Resources - follow a portfolio allocation decision, where inputs with relatively higher growth in costs, see higher R&D investment and productivity gains. Two policy experiments are reported; a market-based Resource tax increase, and a centralized green policy, where public R&D budget is shifted towards Resource-saving technologies. We highlight that in the presence of labor market institutions, which give rise to hysteresis, and limited R&D budgets, a policy of continuous Resource tax growth is needed to induce Resource-saving technological change to achieve a greener economy. This needs to be coupled with planned government spending adjustment to spur demand and boost investment. The findings also suggest that a mix of market-based and centralized policies may be optimal.","[Naqvi, Asjad] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Naqvi, Asjad] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Stockhammer, Engelbert] Kings Coll London, London, England",Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of London; King's College London,"Naqvi, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Vienna, Austria.;Naqvi, A (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",snaqvi@wu.ac.at,"Naqvi, Asjad/AAP-5034-2021; Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019; Naqvi, Asjad/AAE-2793-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535; Naqvi, Asjad/0000-0002-0986-6009",Austrian Central Bank (Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB)) Anniversary Fund [17400],Austrian Central Bank (Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB)) Anniversary Fund,We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.

At the same time, the deployment of this technology creates serious concerns about the negative effects it may have on agriculture and on the environment. This paper applies a behavioural approach to explore possibilities for improved negotiation outcomes between unconventional gas developers and host landowners using economic experiments in the laboratory. The paper specifically focuses on the role that security bond could have in resolving some of the conflicts surrounding unconventional gas development. The empirical findings from the economic experiments show that a security bond deposited by a developer prior to the commencement of the gas extraction can result with improved negotiation outcomes between developers and host landowners. Our findings suggest that the security bond is effective because it mitigates the effects of loss averse behaviour by landowners that do not hold sub-surface extraction rights.","[Ancev, Tiho] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Merrett, Danielle] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Grad Sch Management, MGSM Expt Econ Lab, N Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia",University of Sydney; Macquarie University,"Ancev, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",tiho.ancev@sydney.edu.au,,"Kent, Danielle/0000-0002-4751-1321; Ancev, Tihomir/0000-0002-3521-7782","FRSS program of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Sydney","FRSS program of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Sydney","The authors would like to thank Eloise Taylor and Samuel Miller for assistance with conducting the experiments for this study and for providing important theoretical and empirical insights.

The three most commonly used are limited entry system, individual quotas and territorial use rights in fisheries. Substantial transaction costs can be involved in the establishment and maintenance of fishing rights, including definition costs, enforcement costs and coordination costs. This paper compares these fishing rights by examining the three types of transaction costs they may incur. The comparison is conducted through an analysis of the success and failure of their applications in different regions (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico and South Africa). The main findings of this research suggest that, firstly, there is no panacea for fishery problems and the three types of fishing rights have different advantages and disadvantages in reducing transaction costs. Secondly, sometimes a mixture of the different fishing rights has the potential to create better protection than a pure regime. Thirdly, governmental intervention is crucial for overcoming residual externalities of fishing rights. This paper synthesises the literature which examines fishing rights individually by providing a comparison between these fishing rights. An analytical framework for comparison is established by linking the discussion of fishing rights with the transaction costs literature.","[Liu, Jing; Qin, Tianbao] Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Environm Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Qin, TB (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Environm Law, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",tianbaoq@hotmail.com,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [17CFX040],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"This article is extending the research done for the book, J.

Although a stylized framework, the inclusion of native species permits analysis of trade-offs between the management actions of invasive species control and of habitat restoration for a range of settings and species characteristics. In general, more aggressive invasive species and more invasion-susceptible ecosystems require greater investment in habitat restoration despite its relative expense. Explicitly modeling invasion strategies reveals that the specific ecological mechanism of invasion defines the location of management activities in the river network, and the choice between invasive species control and habitat restoration. The analysis of this bioeconomic model develops insights that help managers to harness the power of native-invasive species establishment interactions in stemming bio-invasions across time and space.","[Albers, Heidi J.; Dietterich, Thomas G.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Hall, Kim Meyer] Oregon State Univ, Dept Forest Ecosyst & Soc, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Lee, Katherine D.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Taleghan, Majid Alkaee] Oregon State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",University of Wyoming; Oregon State University; Idaho; University of Idaho; Oregon State University,"Albers, HJ (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",jo.albers@uwyo.edu; kim.hall@oregonstate.edu; Icatherinelee@uidaho.edu; alkaee@eecs.oregonstate.edu; tgd@eecs.oregonstate.edu,,"Albers, Heidi J/0000-0002-3775-7870; Dietterich, Thomas/0000-0002-8223-8586; Lee, Katherine/0000-0002-5267-0474","National Science Foundation [0832804, 1331932]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems [0832804] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1331932, 1521687] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division Of Computer and Network Systems(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (0832804, 1331932).",,44,8,9,4,66,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

These regimes determine from whom permission is required to take the resources and who obtains the benefits of their use. They have evolved separate frameworks in three distinct jurisdictional areas-within national jurisdiction, beyond national jurisdiction and in the Antarctic Treaty Area. This article argues that if these regimes continue to evolve separately, there is a strong temptation for countries to play 'chicken' with biological resource governance through forum shopping or opting out of agreements that do not suit their political ends. Using game theory and a transgenic tilapia fish example incorporating genetic material from the three jurisdictional areas, it illustrates the legal and ethical dilemmas that can arise from the territorial (jurisdictional) approach to access and benefit sharing-to the detriment of fairness and conservation in tilapia's countries of origin. Tilapias are known as the 'chicken of the sea' because they dominate global farmed production and developing countries depend on them as their primary source of protein, livelihoods and trade. This means there will be serious consequences if the regimes do not achieve their fairness and conservation objectives for sharing their genetic material. This article concludes that a purpose-driven cooperative governance approach can sidestep the game of chicken and promote fairer and more conservation focused outcomes than the current jurisdictional approach for the developing country providers of migratory aquatic resources.","[Humphries, Fran] Griffith Univ, Griffith Law Sch, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Humphries, F (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Law Sch, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",frances.humphries@griffith.edu.au,,"Humphries, Fran/0000-0002-5476-4669",Griffith University,Griffith University(Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus),I thank Professor Charles Lawson for his comments on this article.

When findings of such assessments become part of political and scholarly controversies, they can be interpreted in unintended ways. The value of the ensuing debate is enhanced by a shared understanding of key concepts, methodological approaches, and evaluative criteria. Here we illustrate the importance of such shared understanding by example of a recent controversy surrounding the estimated impacts of decentralized zoning on deforestation in a major agricultural frontier, the Argentine Dry Chaco. In a recent analysis, we concluded that provincial zoning plans had significantly reduced deforestation in three provinces; critics suggest it had not. In attempting to resolve this debate, we identify six areas in which shared understanding can support more productive interaction. These include: (1) the distinction between impact and other measures of effectiveness, (2) an appreciation of recent advances in methods for causal inference, (3) the distinction between effective and perfect enforcement, (4) the challenge of attributing impacts to mechanisms and actors, (5) transparency in standards used to judge the desirability of observed outcomes, as well as (6) caution in the generalization of findings to other geographies.","[Nolte, Christoph] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, 665 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Gobbi, Beatriz; Lambin, Eric F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Georges Lemaitre Ctr Earth & Climate Res, 3 Pl Louis Pasteur, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Gobbi, Beatriz] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200 E, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Inst Study Int Dev, 805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [de Waroux, Yann le Polain] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, 805 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 0B9, Canada; [Piquer-Rodriguez, Maria] Humboldt Univ, Dept Geog, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany; [Piquer-Rodriguez, Maria] Natl Univ Tucuman, Inst Reg Ecol, Edificio Copulas, Yerba Buena, Tucuman, Argentina; [Butsic, Van] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 231 Mulford Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Sch Earth Energy & Environm Sci, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lambin, Eric F.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Boston University; Universite Catholique Louvain; KU Leuven; McGill University; McGill University; Humboldt University of Berlin; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Nolte, C (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, 685 Commonwealth Av, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",chrnolte@bu.edu; beatriz.gobbi@uclouvain.be; yann.lepolaindewaroux@mcgill.ca; maria.piquer-rodriguez@geo.hu-berlin.de; vanbutsic@berkeley.edu; elambin@stanford.edu,"Piquer-Rodríguez, María/H-5589-2019; Nolte, Christoph/K-1692-2019; le Polain, Yann/N-2554-2016; Nolte, Christoph/D-8089-2019","le Polain, Yann/0000-0001-9887-7270; Nolte, Christoph/0000-0001-7827-689X; Lambin, Eric/0000-0002-0673-5257; Piquer-Rodriguez, Maria/0000-0001-8181-5049","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Palo Alto, CA [426]","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Palo Alto, CA","We thank three anonymous reviewers for valuable feedback.

Therefore, novel economic valuation schemes must be developed in order to support conservation programs and mitigate biodiversity loss. Here, we assess the economic implications of retention forestry practices and create a habitat network in a mixed-montane forest in Southwestern Germany. We applied a simulation-optimization approach for i) evaluation of retention forestry practices applied in the region, ii) creation of forest reserves with a minimum eligible area for biodiversity conservation and establishing a connecting corridor with minimum cost, and iii) allocation of deadwood islands inside the connecting corridor with minimum cost. The average opportunity cost arising from retention forestry practices amounted to 1795 EUFt/ha by leaving a minimum deadwood volume of 35 m(3)/ha and 2.5-5 habitat trees/ha. The optimized plan for establishing a habitat network would reduce the net present value (NPV) of forest management between 3.7% and 4.2%, and the novel design for the allocation of deadwood islands would impose a marginal reduction ( < 1%) to the NPV. We conclude that the creation of a habitat network for biodiversity conservation can be realized with the minimum trade-off to forest management profitability.","[Augustynczik, Andrey Lessa Derci; Yousefpour, Rasoul; Hanewinkel, Marc] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Estraviz Rodriguez, Luiz Carlos] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Forest Sci, Ave Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, Brazil",University of Freiburg; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Augustynczik, ALD (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Chair Forestry Econ & Forest Planning, Tennenbacherstr 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",andrey.lessa@ife.uni-freiburg.de; rasoul.yousefpour@ife.uni-freiburg.de; lcer@usp.br; marc.hanewinkel@ife.uni-freiburg.de,"Yousefpour, Rasoul/F-1601-2017; Rodriguez, Luiz Carlos Estraviz/D-7043-2012; hanewinkel, marc/E-5639-2011","Yousefpour, Rasoul/0000-0003-3604-8279; Rodriguez, Luiz Carlos Estraviz/0000-0002-1430-7981; hanewinkel, marc/0000-0003-4081-6621","German Research Foundation (DFG), under the ConFoBi project [GRK 2123]; SuFoRun project (Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant) [691149]","German Research Foundation (DFG), under the ConFoBi project(German Research Foundation (DFG)); SuFoRun project (Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant)","We would like to acknowledge the funding of this research by the German Research Foundation (DFG), under the ConFoBi project (number GRK 2123).

I find that misallocation of resources increased before 2010 and declined afterwards. Initially, output distortion was the major source of misallocation, while the importance of capital distortions increased after the financial crisis. Determinants of changes in allocation efficiency may include growing competition in domestic markets, tighter credit supply and legal issues. However, I show that fragmentation of production induces bias to the estimates of firm-specific distortions, leading to the overestimation of gains from reallocation. Thus, in the absence of inter-firm trade data, the conclusions on misallocation should be treated with caution.","[Benkovskis, Konstantins] Latvijas Banka, Monetary Policy Dept, Kr Valdemara Iela 2A, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia; [Benkovskis, Konstantins] Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Strelnieku Iela 4A, LV-1010 Riga, Latvia",,"Benkovskis, K (通讯作者)，Latvijas Banka, Monetary Policy Dept, Kr Valdemara Iela 2A, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.;Benkovskis, K (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ Riga, Strelnieku Iela 4A, LV-1010 Riga, Latvia.",konstantins.benkovskis@bank.lv,,"Benkovskis, Konstantins/0000-0003-1935-6843",,,,,36,6,6,0,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In addition to protection against a range of diseases, vaccines also have social and economic benefits. However, for vaccines to be effective, routine immunization programmes must be undertaken regularly to ensure individual and community protection. Nonetheless, in many countries in Africa, vaccination coverage is low because governments struggle to deliver vaccines to the most remote areas, thus contributing to constant outbreaks of various vaccine-preventable diseases. African governments fail to deliver vaccines to a significant percentage of the target population due to many issues in key areas such as policy setting, programme management and financing, supply chain, global vaccine market, research and development of vaccines. This review gives an overview of the causes of these issues and what is currently being done to address them. This review will discuss the role of philanthropic organisations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and global partnerships such as the global alliance for vaccines and immunizations in the development, purchase and delivery of vaccines.","[Songane, Mario] McGill Univ, McGill Life Sci Complex, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada",McGill University,"Songane, M (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, McGill Life Sci Complex, Montreal, PQ H3G 0B1, Canada.",mario.songane@mcgill.ca,,,,,,,83,24,27,2,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Unlike shakeouts in automobiles, tyres, or televisions, the commercial airframe industry's early life cycle was affected by external factors, particularly government demand. Using newly digitized data on all planes introduced in the commercial market between 1926 and 1965, we find that commercial airframe manufacturers with bomber contracts during the Second World War were more likely to have postwar market share than firms without such contracts, controlling for plane characteristics and other forms of government contracting. We attribute the effect of bomber contracts to advantages in R&D learning capacity acquired by firms with military airframe contracts. Despite low (or zero) initial presence in the commercial market, these learning capacity advantages allowed such firms to survive the early period of the shakeout, and later to thrive.","[Jaworski, Taylor] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Smyth, Andrew] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA",Queens University - Canada; Marquette University,"Jaworski, T (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,39,5,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This can be explained by the fact that a price variation will have a greater negative impact in a stable financial context than a similar variation during a highly volatile period. For example, French stocks decreased painlessly by 16 per cent in August 2002, whereas a similar fall in January 1882 led to the failure of several brokers. Market volatility was very low at the end of the nineteenth century, whereas investors are now used to dealing with large price movements. A fall of 16 per cent was much more of a shock in 1882 than it would be today. To control for the instability of the volatility, a new method for identifying crashes is proposed. Each price variation is measured in numbers of standard deviations of the preceding period. These adjusted variations can then be ranked to identify the worst market crashes. This method is tested on four long-term series. A better match between crashes and historical events is achieved than with pure price variations. This improved matching brings new insights to several historical debates.","[le Bris, David] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education,"le Bris, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France.",,,,,,,,54,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

After defining what we call input-output physical multipliers, an application for the case of fishing in Galicia (Spain) was developed. The results show that this method is valid for obtaining a more accurate assessment of the possible socioeconomic impacts arising from a fishing supply shock, considering in equal measure the backward and forward linkages of fishing activity with other sectors. The defined multipliers permit the assessment and comparison ex ante of different management scenarios for fisheries.

We investigate the effect of institutional contexts on attitudes toward policies, and we examine the relevance of political values for these effects. Institutional theory suggests that the institutional context influences whether individual rationality (IR) or social rationality (SR) frames choices. To investigate the effects of such contexts and political values on attitudes toward policies aimed at reducing private car use, we conducted a survey experiment involving 1500 car owners in Oslo, Norway. One group of respondents received a text emphasizing the individual health gains from reducing local air pollution (IR context), a second group received a text emphasizing the social responsibility for avoiding climate change (SR context), and a control group received no such text. We found effects of the contexts on attitudes toward emission-reducing policies, and found that the effects vary across individuals with different political values. The SR context yielded higher support for an increase in petrol prices among non-individualists only. The IR context yielded higher support for a decrease in space for cars among both non-individualists and individualists.

Using novel disaggregated data on crop production, we estimate the direct impacts of rainfall shocks on agriculture and then use a Computable General Equilibrium model to simulate how these rainfall shocks propagate through the wider economy of the basin under three different climate change scenarios. The basin's economy and expanding agricultural sector are highly vulnerable to the impacts of rainfall shocks. A rainfall decrease scenario could lead to a 5% decline in the basin's GDP, with agricultural GDP standing to drop by as much as 10%. All sectors benefit from greater rainfall amounts. Distributional impacts depend on income group, with poor households accruing greater benefits relative to non-poor households under a scenario of additional rainfall and suffering proportionally lower income losses under a scenario of rainfall decrease.","[Borgomeo, Edoardo] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Vadheim, Bryan; Walker, Oliver] Vivid Econ, 26-28 Ely Pl, London EC1N 6TD, England; [Woldeyes, Firew B.] Ethiopian Dev Res Inst, Macroecon & Trade Res Ctr, POB 2479, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Alamirew, Tena] Addis Ababa Univ, Water & Land Resource Ctr, POB 3880, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Tamru, Seneshaw] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium; [Charles, Katrina J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Kebede, Seifu] Addis Ababa Univ, Sch Earth Sci, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",University of Oxford; Addis Ababa University; KU Leuven; University of Oxford; Addis Ababa University,"Borgomeo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",edoardo.borgomeo@ouce.ox.ac.uk,"Charles, Katrina J/D-1948-2009; Alamirew, Tena/GOP-0486-2022; Agumassie, Tena Alamirew/AAL-3707-2021","Agumassie, Tena Alamirew/0000-0001-7491-4401; Kebede Gurmessa, Seifu/0000-0003-0283-2014; Borgomeo, Edoardo/0000-0002-8351-9064",Global Green Growth Initiative; REACH: Improving Water Security for the poor; UK Aid from the Department for International Development (DFID) [201880],Global Green Growth Initiative; REACH: Improving Water Security for the poor; UK Aid from the Department for International Development (DFID),"This work was funded by the Global Green Growth Initiative.

This paper analyzes those valuation languages along the coal chain and their relationships with the territory where coal is extracted and burned. The paper examines and compares the coal chains between Colombia-Netherlands and Colombia-Turkey, assessing the various dimensions of the ecological distribution conflicts. The coal chain is analyzed through different layers and scales. To identify the valuation languages along both coal chains, semi-structured interviews and secondary data analysis were conducted. Discourse analysis methodologies were used to determine the frequency and relevance of the valuation languages. Results show that multiple valuation languages appear, which are peculiar to each country and to the economic and political contexts in which the different stages of coal chain are embedded. Environmental justice actions taken along the coal chain with the focus on acknowledging these multiple valuation languages are also discussed. In conclusion, the analysis reveals that these actions depend on the willingness of social actors to give up or negotiate their valuation languages or on the power to impose them.","[Cardoso, Andrea] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, E-08193 Bellaterra, Spain; [Cardoso, Andrea] Univ Magdalena, Fac Business & Econ, Santa Marta, Colombia",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Universidad del Magdalena,"Cardoso, A (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, E-08193 Bellaterra, Spain.;Cardoso, A (通讯作者)，Univ Magdalena, Fac Business & Econ, Santa Marta, Colombia.",acardoso@unimagdalena.edu.co,,"Cardoso, Andrea/0000-0001-9985-154X",EnvJustice project (ICTA UAB); Colciencias [529-2011]; Universidad del Magdalena,"EnvJustice project (ICTA UAB); Colciencias(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Universidad del Magdalena","I am grateful to Joan Martinez-Alier of the ICTA, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona for his 'invaluable' guidance and support, to Ethemcan Turhan for his help in Turkey and to PAX for their help in The Netherlands fieldwork.

To increase aid effectiveness, some have argued that potential recipients should compete for aid. We experimentally test this proposition against a baseline treatment where groups of heterogeneous agents receive aid by improving environmental quality. With the first mechanism, aid is allocated based on the improvement of environmental quality by each group with the potential of multiple groups receiving aid. In the second mechanism, aid is competitively allocated only to the single group that has initiated the greatest improvement of environmental quality. Surprisingly, the average level of environmental progress is lower in a competitive setting than in the setting with the potential for multiple recipients. Underscoring this result is our finding that environmental progress is stable in the baseline but begins high and falls quickly with repetitions in the competition. Although the initial level of progress is higher on average in the competitive setting, this mechanism generates the highest variance which could be catastrophic to sensitive ecosystems. These findings have direct implications on which mechanism the granting agency should use dependent upon their specific objectives.","[Chambers, Paul E.] Univ Cent Missouri, Dept Econ, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA; [Dutcher, E.

In contrast to the literature that studies parameters of a particular social welfare function, such as the discount rate, we shift the focus and directly assume a parametric form for the intertemporal distribution of well-being. This has the advantage of avoiding explicit discounting choices, which has initiated much debate. Specifically, we consider a set of intertemporal distributions that reach a steady-state at a pre-specified level of sufficient well-being, or equivalently after a pre-specified end-of-growth horizon. We numerically illustrate our results in DICE and find that the social cost of carbon increases over-proportionally with the sufficiency level of well-being. While the social cost of carbon in 2015 is US$ 7 if the sufficiency level is four-fold the present level, it is US$ 30 if the sufficiency level is 15-fold, and US$ 100 if the sufficiency level is 26-fold the present level. This shows in a transparent way how conceptions of intergenerational distributive justice drive the social cost of carbon.","[Haensel, Martin C.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Hänsel, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",haensel@economics.uni-kiel.de,"Quaas, Martin/C-4220-2012","Quaas, Martin/0000-0003-0812-8829","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [03F0655J, 01LA1104A-C]; ESRC [ES/N009010/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N009010/1] Funding Source: researchfish",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to three anonymous reviewers, Jeroen van den Bergh, Vincent Martinet, Linda Kleemann and Moritz Drupp for fruitful suggestions.

Even when these values are estimated, they are allocated without any particular spatial referencing. Little is known about the spatial and distributional effects arising from changes in ecosystem service provision. This paper estimates spatial equity in ecosystem services provision using a dedicated data disaggregation algorithm that allocates 'synthetic' socioeconomic attributes to households and with accurate geo-referencing. A GIS-based automated procedure is operationalized for three different ecosystems in Israel. A nonlinear function relates household location to each ecosystem: beaches, urban parks and national parks. Benefit measures are derived by modeling household consumer surplus as a function of socio-economic attributes and distance from the ecosystem. These aggregate measures are spatially disaggregated to households. Results show that restraining access to beaches causes a greater reduction in welfare than restraining access to a park. Progressively, high income households lose relatively more in welfare terms than in low income households from such action. This outcome is reversed when distributional outcomes are measured in terms of housing price classes. Policy implications of these findings relate to implications for housing policies that attempt to use new development to generate social heterogeneity in locations proximate to ecosystem services.","[Fleischer, Aliza] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Agr Econ Res, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB 12, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel; [Felsenstein, Daniel; Lichter, Michal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, IL-91900 Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Fleischer, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Agr Econ Res, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB 12, IL-7610001 Rehovot, Israel.",aliza.f@mail.huji.ac.il; daniel.felsenstein@mail.huji.ac.il,"Felsenstein, Daniel/JME-1462-2023; Fleischer, Aliza/J-7900-2016","Fleischer, Aliza/0000-0002-6575-4052","Ring Family Foundation for Atmospheric and Global studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel","Ring Family Foundation for Atmospheric and Global studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel","We would like to thank three anonymous referees for insightful comments.

However international differences in carbon control policies may cause not only carbon leakage but also competitiveness disadvantages. In this context, border carbon adjustments are a promising tool for discouraging these problems. But designing a real-world border carbon adjustment instrument implies to consider significant issues: technical feasibility, data availability, the risk of retaliation from developing countries, and its compatibility within the World Trade Organization legal framework. There are still no conclusive answers about a proper design. This paper is an attempt to address the above-mentioned challenges proposing a carbon border tax (CBT) based on avoided emissions. Such a CBT is applied at a product level and not at a sector level, and all international prices are deflated to guarantee that import 'like' goods received a treatment similar to 'like' domestic products. Using the WIOD, we simulate a CBT based on avoided emissions applied by the European Union, and we compare the results with a CBT based on embodied emissions.","[Rocchi, Paola] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Serrano, Monica; Roca, Jordi] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Business, Av Diagonal 696, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Arto, Inaki] Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sci Pk UPV EHU, Leioa 48940, Bizkaia, Spain",University of Barcelona; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3),"Rocchi, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso S-N, Seville 41092, Spain.",paola.rocchi@ec.europa.eu; monica.serrano@ub.edu; jordiroca@ub.edu; inaki.arto@bc3research.org,"Roca, Jordi/H-5851-2015; Serrano, Mònica/H-6489-2015","Serrano, Mònica/0000-0003-1190-5406; Rocchi, Paola/0000-0003-0985-6721; Arto, Inaki/0000-0001-6427-7437","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-67524-R, ECO2015-68023, HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P]; AGAUR of Catalonia's Government [2014SGR-950]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); AGAUR of Catalonia's Government,"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [grant numbers ECO2015-67524-R, ECO2015-68023, and HAR2015-69620-C2-1-P]; and the AGAUR of Catalonia's Government [grant number 2014SGR-950].

The interactions of numerous socio-economic, demographic, natural, and institutional factors constitute the underlying causes of soil degradation in Ethiopia. However, there exist evidence gaps on the contextual factors that hinder investments on soil conservation among smallholders. Using primary data generated through a stated preference survey among 359 sample smallholder farm households in Southern Ethiopia, this study investigates investment constraints on soil management technologies among smallholders. A random parameter logit model was implemented to estimate the model. Results indicate that smallholders are willing to invest in soil management technologies if appropriate incentive mechanisms, primarily, secured land tenure rights and access to finance are in place. Unfortunately, the prevailing land tenure regime in the country does not allow private property rights on land and smallholders have very limited access to credit. Thus, instituting secure land rights and improving credit access to smallholders should be considered as key interventions to enhance adoption of soil management technologies. The study highlights that policy interventions that incentivize adoption of soil management measures provide not only on-site private benefits but wider societal off-site benefits through the provision of multiple ecosystem services.","[Tarfasa, Solomon] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Balana, Bedru B.] Int Water Management Inst, West Africa Off, PMB CT112, Cantonments, Accra, Ghana; [Tarfasa, Solomon; Tefera, Tewodros; Woldeamanuel, Teshale; Moges, Awdenegest; Dinato, Mengistu] Hawassa Univ, SNNPR, POB 05, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Black, Helaina] James Hutton Inst, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; CGIAR; International Water Management Institute (IWMI); Hawassa University; James Hutton Institute,"Balana, BB (通讯作者)，Int Water Management Inst, West Africa Off, PMB CT112, Cantonments, Accra, Ghana.",b.balana@cgiar.org,"Moges, Awdenegest/JWA-5800-2024; Amede, Tewodros Tefera/AAT-2689-2021; black, helaina/HHM-9892-2022; Tefera, Tewodros/HTN-6403-2023","Moges, Awdenegest/0000-0001-6084-8327; Balana, Bedru/0000-0002-7344-5743","Ecosystem Services and Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) research programme [NE-K010441-1]; ESPA; NERC [NE/K010441/1, NE/K010298/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K010441/1, NE/K010298/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Ecosystem Services and Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) research programme; ESPA; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This paper is the output from the 'ALTER - Alternative Carbon Investments in Ecosystems for Poverty Alleviation: below-ground versus aboveground opportunities for the restoration of ecosystem services' project, being implemented in Ethiopia and Uganda and funded by Ecosystem Services and Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) research programme [Grant No.: NE-K010441-1].

Design/methodology/approach - The data consist of 3 group interviews and 18 respondents, whose responses were analysed using a frame analysis. Findings - Locality is discussed in the context of three frames: the immediate surroundings, the Finnish national ethos and the global discourses of food enthusiasts. The results show that, in terms of local food events, locality comprises not only food, but also place, people and cultural context conveying national and global elements. Research limitations/implications - The data of this study are limited in size, and limited to the Finnish context. Practical implications - Local food events could be promoted to locals and nearby residents, not just to tourists. With the design of the eating environment (music and visuals), the local food experience can be enhanced. Social implications - Local food events strengthen the residents' regional identity. Originality/value - The research setting for this paper is original; the study takes part in the scarce discussion about gastronomic tourism in Finland.

The role of self-identity as a Muslim, dietary acculturation in the host culture, moral obligation to purchase halal meat and trust on the authenticity of halal meat are explored. Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional data were collected through a survey with 378 Chinese Muslims, currently living in Beijing and Xian cities. Data were analysed by means of correlations and stepwise multiple regressions to test the model and the moderating effects of self-identity, dietary acculturation, moral obligation and trust on behavioural intention. Findings - A positive personal attitude towards the consumption of halal meat, personal conviction, motivation to comply, perceived control over consuming halal meat and perceived availability of halal meat predict the intention to eat halal meat among Chinese Muslims. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the focus on only four individual characteristics related to religious food consumption, namely, self-identity, dietary acculturation, moral obligation and trust. Additional individual characteristics such as individualism-collectivism and involvement or values could improve the predictive power of the model. Practical implications - Practical implications extend to food marketers and food policy decision-makers who might pursue identity, acculturation, trustworthiness and moral obligation-related strategies in their distribution and communication efforts targeted at the growing halal food market segments across China and worldwide. Originality/value - The current study addresses the important limitation of previous studies regarding the inclusion of additional possible individual characteristics such as moral obligation and trust in the TPB model to investigate the determinants of halal meat consumption within a food-religion context.","[Ali, Adnan] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Mkt, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ali, Afzaal; Sherwani, Mehkar; Hussain, Sikander] Univ Int Business & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo Xiaoling] Univ Int Business & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of International Business & Economics; University of International Business & Economics,"Ali, A (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China.",afzaal_ciit@yahoo.com,"Ali, Afzaal/JXX-3750-2024; Ali, Dr. Adnan/HJI-1007-2023","Ali, Afzaal/0000-0002-7323-6781; Ali, Dr. Adnan/0000-0001-8836-8851",,,,,47,40,44,2,46,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Using a database of 17 OECD countries over the 1890-2013 period, this paper integrates production factor quality into the measure of TFP, namely by factoring the level of education of the working-age population into the measure of labor and the age of equipment in the measure of capital stock. We then estimate how the diffusion of technology impacts the growth of this newly measured TFP through two emblematic general purpose technologies, electricity and information and communication technologies (ICT). Using growth decomposition methodology from instrumental variable estimates, this paper finds that education levels contribute most significantly to growth, while the age of capital makes a limited, although significant, contribution. Quality-adjusted production factors explain less than half of labor productivity growth in the largest countries except for Japan, where capital deepening posted a very large contribution. As a consequence, the one big wave of productivity growth (Gordon in Am Econ Rev 89(2):123-128, 1999), as well as the ICT productivity wave for the countries which experienced it, remains only partially explained by quality-adjusted factors, although education and technology diffusion contribute to explain the earlier wave in the USA in the 1930s-1940s. Finally, technology diffusion, as captured through our two general purpose technologies, leaves unexplained between 0.6 and 1 percentage point of yearly growth, as well as a large proportion of the two twentieth-century technology waves. These results both support a significant lag in the diffusion of general purpose technologies and raise further questions on a wider view on growth factors, including changes in the production process, management techniques and financing practices. Measurement problems may also contribute to the unexplained share of growth.","[Bergeaud, Antonin; Cette, Gilbert; Lecat, Remy] Banque France, Paris, France; [Cette, Gilbert] Univ Aix Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Cette, Gilbert] Univ Aix Marseille, EHESS, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, Marseille, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Lecat, R (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",remy.lecat@banque-france.fr,"Bergeaud, Antonin/AAQ-8974-2020; Lecat, Rémy/AAG-9907-2020","BERGEAUD, ANTONIN/0000-0003-2341-3986",,,,,108,11,12,1,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2018,12.0,1,,,,,61,97,,10.1007/s11698-016-0149-2,0.0,,,37,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,FT0FA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000422795900003,0
J,"Bharucha, J",,,,"Bharucha, Jehangir",,,Tackling the challenges of reducing and managing food waste in Mumbai restaurants,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Restaurants; Surplus food; Food wastage; Mitigation of wastages,SERVICE; SIZE,"Purpose Around 67 million tons of food is wasted in India every year, which has a value of more than US$14 billion (Haq, 2016). The purpose of this paper is to concentrate on one major source to which the current massive proportion of wastage can be attributed: restaurants. It investigates the statistics, the problem at large, how the restaurants are handling it and recommends ways to better manage the issue. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative inquiry has been used. The research population for this study consisted of 63 restaurant owners across Mumbai city and its suburbs. In-depth discussions were held with these restaurant owners/managers in various matters of interest to this study. Findings The group of restaurateurs opined that the solution to Mumbai's restaurants waste management lies in micro management rather than large scale plans. In total, 75 percent of the restaurants have 10-20 percent extra preparation. High-end fine-dining restaurants make even more additional preparations and are the ones more receptive to participating and also sensitive toward importance of waste management. Several of the restaurant owners claim that they can estimate the requirements on specific days of the week. In all, 18 percent of the restaurants surveyed claimed to have a complete dispose of policy. Majority of the restaurants have a clear policy to distribute the surplus food among their staff. Several other innovative strategies were shared. Research limitations/implications The restaurant owners/mangers may not have truthfully answered all questions. The participants might have the fear that the authorities would take cognizance of some of the practices that they are following and would have been guarded in their responses. There would always be a fear that the identities would not be kept confidential. Practical implications India as a country has been agriculture based for centuries and characterized by massive food production. Yet, people face rampant starvation and malnourishment. This arises to a large extent due to the colossal amounts of food wasted at marriages, restaurants and even by destruction of crops. Originality/value The restaurant industry is of critical importance to the Indian economy and while research in India has focused on overall food wastage, studies on restaurant food waste are lacking.","[Bharucha, Jehangir] HR Coll Commerce & Econ, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Bharucha, Jehangir] Lincoln Univ Coll, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Lincoln University College,"Bharucha, J (通讯作者)，HR Coll Commerce & Econ, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.;Bharucha, J (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ Coll, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.",jehangir.bharucha@hrcollege.edu,,,,,,,42,41,41,1,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

A handful of individuals, often working as lone voices, are doing their best to incorporate the concepts into their everyday work and promote the concepts more widely. As is often the case elsewhere, the term universal design is misunderstood and confused with special and separate designs for people with disability rather than inclusion for everyone. Compliance to legislated disability access standards has created further confusion and as a consequence many myths about universal design have emerged. Such myths have held back the implementation and understanding of universal design and inclusive practice. Australian governments at all levels have shown little interest in promoting universal design principles, save for a casual mention of the term in policy documents. This is in spite of changes to disability and ageing policies promoting more autonomy and independence for individuals. When political leadership is absent, leadership often defaults to the community, or to be precise, to a handful of people with a passion for the cause. In 2013 a chance meeting of two unrelated individuals set the wheels in motion to establish a centre for universal design in Australia.

Due to globalization, the government has great competition among market participants. Enterprises need to have a well-designed strategy to successfully position themselves on the market and achieve the largest market share. Because of the turbulent market, enterprisescan't expect constant revenues and security. The enterprise's success and survival is influenced by the strategy that needs to be defined according to its capabilities and its own vision of development. Enterprises in the metal processing sector are in a very unequal position, because in general, the manufacturing industry in the Republic of Croatia is not developed. That is why it is necessary to find a solution and strategic opportunities according which the enterprise can develop not only its business but also the entire sector of the industry. If Croatia wants to turn into a regional economic leader then it has to rapidly and efficiently develop new technologies, develop new products and services and place them on the international market. To achieve this, it is necessary that Croatian enterprises behave innovatively, proactively, and assume the risks of starting new business ventures. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the experiences of Croatian enterprises in the metal processing industry with the strategic investment promotion actions. The aim of this paper is to study and systematically elaborate the basic theoretical approaches to the implementation of investment and private equity strategies in the metal processing industry as a purpose of achieving competitive advantage. Point out the experience of small, medium and large enterprises in the metal processing industry regarding investment strategy activities and present the current state of implementation and encouragement of measures to strengthen competitiveness. The research is conducted on a detailed analysis of the general state of the metal processing industry of the Republic of Croatia, and strategic models and methods that enterprises in the metallurgical industry can increase its competitiveness. Large, small and medium enterprises are analysed. A total 508 enterprises in the metal processing industry in the Republic of Croatia are analysed.

It is the experience of architectural firms that clients decide their own focus on accessibility during the design process, and also whether the level of accessibility should be higher than that stipulated in the Danish Building Regulations. Post-occupancy evaluations point out that when the client is particularly conscious of, or ambitious about, accessibility/Universal Design (UD), the result is a building with an extensive level of accessibility. Thus, the client is a key figure for the project and the level of ambition. Based on interviews with 15 Danish clients, this paper presents a characterisation of their conception of Universal Design. It is significant that, as a concept, UD has not gained currency among the clients that let their ambition level be defined by the Danish Building Regulations. In order to capture differences between clients, a description of the client's conception of users and designs is based on an analytical framework about the concepts of particular, universal, market and equality. The analysis shows that three conceptions about accessibility/UD can be characterized among the clients: 1) accessibility by design, 2) broad accessibility 3) added value. Above all, the findings show that a development is going on towards UD, although slowly.","[Grangaard, Sidse] Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst SBi, Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Grangaard, S (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Kobenhavn Sv, Denmark.",sig@sbi.aau.dk,,"Grangaard, Sidse/0000-0003-3814-6614",,,,,20,0,0,0,2,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,706,715,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-706,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371434.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100068,0

Design/methodology/approach Data were obtained from an online survey applying content analysis, uni- and multivariate tests and multivariate regression models. Findings In total, 60 percent of respondents are not aware of (ir)responsible conduct of MFR. Most of those aware of such behavior indicate that this has induced a change in their shopping behavior. This holds to a similar extent for those not aware but envisaging the (ir)responsible conduct of MFRs. The findings point to a negativity bias in that consumers' reaction is more sensitive regarding irresponsible than responsible firm behavior. This bias is higher for consumers already knowledgeable about the (ir)responsible behavior of MFRs. The likelihood that consumers punish irresponsible conduct is influenced by the importance they attach to food quality and safety while those having high concerns for environmental, social and ethical' issues are more likely to reward responsible firm actions. Research limitations/implications The negativity bias which implies that consumers react more sensitive regarding irresponsible than responsible firm behavior is likely underestimated in hypothetical studies. Practical implications Customer loyalty is at stake for MFRs behaving irresponsible while it can be strengthened by responsible firm conduct. Originality/value This research is the first to highlight the importance consumers in Vietnam attach to responsible firm conduct. It also points to a lack of awareness of such behavior.","[Ha Thi Mai Vo; Hartmann, Monika] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Dept Agr & Food Market Res, Bonn, Germany; [Ha Thi Mai Vo] Hue Univ, Coll Econ, Hue City, Vietnam; [Langen, Nina] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Vocat Educ & Work Studies, Educ Sustainable Nutr & Food Sci, Berlin, Germany",University of Bonn; Hue University; Technical University of Berlin,"Hartmann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Dept Agr & Food Market Res, Bonn, Germany.",maiha.vo@ilr.uni-bonn.de; monika.hartmann@ilr.uni-bonn.de; nina.langen@tu-berlin.de,"Hartmann, Monika/J-8224-2017","Hartmann, Monika/0000-0002-3631-164X; Langen, Nina/0000-0002-7690-2276",German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"The authors thank the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for the fellowship the first author obtained for carrying out this research.

Described research concerns the situation in the Visegrad Group, in particular, the correlation between the level and dynamics of economic development and democratic participation, appearing in voter turnout. The Visegrad Group (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary) presents the fastest developing part of the European Union. Since joining the EU in 2002, they have gradually reduced the economic gap between them and the Western Europe. The countries of the Central Europe received relatively balanced settlement and industry structure from the period of the Soviet domination. Not until the political changes in the 90s and the subsequent period of economic growth the tendencies to polarize the socio-economic development have intensified in them. The paper analyses the dynamics of economic development in selected regions of the countries (NUTS-2) and its correlation with the level of electoral participation of the population from 2002 to 2018. The main hypothesis of the article is that there is a clear correlation between the economic growth of regions and electoral participation of their inhabitants. Further differentiation of the level of affluence between regions may lead to the stratification of civic democratic engagement. The significance of the problem stems from the fact that the low citizen involvement in the political life of the country, which manifests itself in, among other things, the low level of electoral participation, usually results in dangerous radicalization of social moods and favors populist political parties.","[Madras, Tomasz] Politechn Bialostocka, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Madras, T (通讯作者)，Politechn Bialostocka, Bialystok, Poland.",t.madras@pb.edu.pl,"Madras, Tomasz/C-4123-2019","Madras, Tomasz/0000-0001-9895-1020",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,491,499,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700054,0

This applies in particular to the constitutional provisions that prescribe: the state's responsibility for the development of all its territories, the protection of areas of interest for the Republic of Croatia, the duty of the state to assist financially weaker units of local self-government in accordance with the law and the obligation of the Republic of Croatia to achieve the objectives of the European Union. In that context, the paper tries to answer to what extent these constitutional provisions contribute to the developmental position of the Eastern Croatia. The relationship between the prescribed responsibility and the effectiveness of the state is also observed. From the research methodology, the following methods are used: normative method, secondary research, comparative method, historical method, analysis method and statistical method. The fundamental problem noted in the paper is that the region of the Eastern Croatia, in the latest results of the development index of December 2017, is still at the bottom of economic and social development. Therefore, the question of the effectiveness of constitutional norms is logically challenged. In this connection, the question arises as to why the East Slavonia is developing slower than most parts of Croatian territory, despite the prescribed constitutional responsibility of the state. In addition to analysing the provisions of the Croatian Constitution, the paper also provides comparative overview of constitutional provisions encouraging the development of all parts of the state territory in other European countries: Italy, Spain, the Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerland. It is concluded that constitutional provisions that encourage the development of all state areas are not found only in the Croatian Constitution but also in the constitutions of some European states. However, the effectiveness of constitutional provisions depends on a range of political, economic, cultural and other factors.","[Marinac, Antun] Polytech Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia",,"Marinac, A (通讯作者)，Polytech Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",amarinac@vup.hr,,,,,,,10,0,0,2,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,462,471,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900048,0

The implementation of the first and partly the second point created a system for public administration in the Czech Republic, based on a combined model of state administration performance. The combined model is characterised by the transfer of a part of the state's power to a lower level, closer to the citizens, for example through local authorities.

Therefore, the aim of the paper is to test the hypothesis that implementation of fiscal consolidation on central level has different effects on regional inequalities, then implementation on sub-central level. Therefore, we explore the impact of fiscal consolidation on central and sub-central level on regional inequalities among EU member countries for period 1995-2009. Two groups of variables are particularly important for this study: measure of fiscal consolidation and difference between central and sub-central component of the fiscal consolidation. Due to fact that recent literature recognizes problems with using cyclically-adjusted primary budget balance (CAPB) as a measure for fiscal consolidation we extend regional empirical literature by using a new database of fiscal consolidation, introduced by Devries et al. (2011), that successfully tackles all this issues. For measuring the central and sub-central component of the fiscal consolidation we use the share of the central and sub-central spending and revenues in total public spending and revenues for the years when the fiscal consolidation has been realized. The results indicate that the structure of fiscal consolidation (led by implementation on national or sub-national level) differently influences regional inequalities. Finally, the paper highlights that fiscal consolidation is not only the matter of the public debt levels or economic growth, but also important regional issue.","[Mustra, Vinko; Viskovic, Josip; Burnac, Pasko] Univ Split, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Mustra, V (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",vmustra@efst.hr; josip.viskovic@efst.hr; pburnac@efst.hr,"Vinko, Mustra/E-3322-2017; Visković, Josip/D-5966-2017",,,,,,26,0,0,1,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1086,1094,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900114,0

By employing a Bayesian disease mapping approach with a block-level lattice dataset of Tokyo for 1930, we found that wider access to purified water through water supply systems played an important role in mitigating mortality risks during the study period. Our estimation results show that clean water accounted for approximately 41.3 and 34.9 % of improvements in crude and child death rates, respectively, between 1921 and 1937 in Tokyo.","[Ogasawara, Kota] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Engn, Dept Ind Engn & Econ, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Shirota, Shinichiro] Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Kobayashi, Genya] Chiba Univ, Fac Law Polit & Econ, Inage Ku, 1-33 Yayoi Cho, Chiba 2638522, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology; Duke University; Chiba University,"Ogasawara, K (通讯作者)，Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Engn, Dept Ind Engn & Econ, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.",ogasawara.k.ab@m.titech.ac.jp; ss571@stat.duke.edu; gkobayashi@chiba-u.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [26885029, 15K17036]; Nakajima Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17153, 26885029, 15K17036] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Nakajima Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to Alan Gelfand, Lionel Kesztenbaum, Ran Abramitzky, Yukitoshi Matsushita, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and encouragements.

The timeframes for this study are the period from 2006 to 2015. Because of the complex nature of the municipalities' financial operations, they were expressed with a selected group of indices divided into four groups in line with an approach adopted by the author. A variance analysis was performed to check whether the level of EU funds accessed had a statistically significant impact on the results regarding specific risk characteristics of the municipalities' financial operations. The author also used the descriptive and comparative methods as well as selected descriptive statistics methods and the Pearson correlation coefficient. In this study, the municipalities demonstrated different levels of access to EU funds. Generally, smaller, peripheral units proved to be more effective in accessing EU aid than larger ones located next to big urban centres. As shown by the variance analysis, the level of aid accessed has a statistically significant impact on the local government units' financial operations, in addition to financial liquidity. Note that higher absorption levels were correlated with smaller financial autonomy and greater indebtedness.","[Standar, Aldona] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Standar, A (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Poznan, Poland.",standar@up.poznan.pl,,"Standar, Aldona/0000-0001-8491-5360",National Center for Science [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/03884],"National Center for Science(National Science Centre, Poland)","The project was financed from resources of the National Center for Science, allocated pursuant to decision DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/03884.",,18,3,3,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,169,177,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.133,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500021,0

We show that, relying on recently proposed homogeneity and duality results, their approach is unnecessary for self-dual homothetic production functions, while it is inconsistent in the non-homothetic case. By stressing that for homothetic technologies the radial distance function can be correctly interpreted as a technical efficiency measure, since allocative efficiency is independent of the output level and radial input reductions leave it unchanged, we contend that for non-homothetic technologies this is not the case because optimal input demands depend on the output targeted by the firm, as does the inequality between marginal rates of substitution and market prices-allocative inefficiency. We demonstrate that a correct definition of technical efficiency corresponds to the directional distance function because its flexibility ensures that allocative efficiency is kept unchanged through movements in the input production possibility set when solving technical inefficiency, and therefore the associated cost reductions can be solely-and rightly-ascribed to technical-engineering-improvements. The new methodology allowing for a consistent decomposition of cost inefficiency is illustrated resorting to simple examples of non-homothetic production functions.","[Aparicio, Juan] Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Ctr Operat Res CIO, Alicante 03202, Spain; [Zofio, Jose L.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Anal Econ Teoria Econ & Hist Econ, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Aparicio, J (通讯作者)，Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Ctr Operat Res CIO, Alicante 03202, Spain.",j.aparicio@umh.es,"Zofío, José L./HTQ-2877-2023; Aparicio, Juan/P-6348-2015; Zofío, José Luis/K-5178-2014","Aparicio, Juan/0000-0002-0867-0004; Zofío, José Luis/0000-0003-1170-9501",Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness [MTM2013-43903-P],Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We would like to express our gratitude to two anonymous referees for their helpful comments, as well as to the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness for supporting this research under grant MTM2013-43903-P.",,37,3,3,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

In many developed countries, carbon taxes are regressive as they comprise a greater proportion of a poorer household's income. Certain socioeconomic groups are more negatively affected by these impacts than others. While inequality of incidence by income group has received great attention in the literature, a gap exists to quantify the inequality associated with socioeconomic characteristics. This information is policy-relevant as it may inform the most effective means to offset negative welfare impacts through changes to taxes and/or social transfers. This paper provides this contribution. First, the inequality of carbon tax incidence across the income spectrum is quantified using the concentration index methodology. A subsequent multivariate decomposition quantifies the contribution each socioeconomic factor makes towards this inequality of incidence. This is carried out for electricity, motor fuel and all other home fuels to elicit variation of socioeconomic incidence by source.

According to the literature, environmental proactivity defined as the tendency to go beyond compliance with basic requirements established by law or institutionalized adoption of environmental practices in industry enables firms to improve both economic and environmental outcomes. Within the framework of the resource-based view and the dynamic capabilities approach, we find that this win-win situation is far more likely when environmental proactivity is adopted in conjunction with a proactive innovation strategy. By analyzing panel data with 336 observations (42 Spanish industrial firms over an eight year period), we demonstrate that environmental proactivity generates complementarities with technological proactivity that are sustainable and especially profitable in dynamic environments. More precisely, empirical evidence reveals that complementarities between environmental and technological proactivity are sustainable in groups of firms subject to high external pressure (such as that generated in the European Union Emissions Trading System context). Complementarities are also greater for companies during a financial crisis, a period characterized by high uncertainty and dynamism of the environment. This particularly advantageous win-win situation generated by environmental proactivity justifies its interpretation as a dynamic capability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The popularity and use of the metric is increasing partially in response to new global demands for metrics that go beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, because the basic GPI accounting protocols have yet to be consistently updated to respond to theoretical critiques, new valuation methods, and new data sources a proliferation of studies at the global, national and sub-national level contain widely divergent Methodologies. Because of this, GPI practitioners have called for a new, consistent framework to guide future GPI studies - GPI 2.0. This paper is an attempt to operationalize some of the concepts that have emerged from GPI 2.0 deliberations online and at recent workshops in the form of GPI 2.0 pilot accounts for the US, State of Maryland, and City of Baltimore. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of multi-scale GPI accounts that provide a more accurate measure of current economic welfare than GDP and that incorporate new methods and sources of information to replace many of the outdated aspects of the prevailing GPI approach.

In response, the U.S. and China agreed to implement domestic ivory trade bans to complement the international trade ban. The U.S. executed this agreement on 6 July 2016. Chinese authorities announced, on 30 December 2016, that they would end the domestic ivory trade by 31 December 2017. This paper accepts that a large volume of ivory entering China illegally is being stockpiled for speculative purposes. It sketches several scenarios of how ivory speculators, as important interlocutors between supply and final demand, might respond to this domestic ban. We conclude that the optimal elephant conservation policy approach would be for Chinese authorities to provide more specific details about the scope of the ban and how it will deal with stockpiled ivory. Our game theoretic analysis suggests that the ban should be imposed indefinitely; this should be explicitly stipulated to avoid uncertainty and continued speculation. The introduction of any possibility of a future regulated trade will create strong incentives for speculators to bank on elephant extinction, and maximise poaching effort in the short run.

Results show adjacency causes decreases in housing prices between 13 and 14% for the average home. Additionally this negative effect exacerbates with basin age.

This study defines waste sorting behavior considering certain attributes and estimates the inconvenience costs associated with each attribute. The definition also considers how and when waste is disposed of as well as the hygiene of a disposal spot. We apply a conjoint analysis for data collection and latent class logit model to calculate the inconvenience costs. The model incorporates consumers' heterogeneity as a finite number of homogenous groups. The results show that the inconvenience cost for the hygiene of the disposal spot is generally higher than that of sorting itself; this tendency is strongest among young women. Moreover, older people report lower inconvenience costs than do younger ones. Further, some groups prefer manual sorting to an automated sorting service for food waste. Our findings offer policy implications considering such inconvenience costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the estimation of relative efficiency measures of their performance needs to account for the effect of contextual and exogenous variables. This should assure that the respective measures adequately reflect the portion of inefficiency that may be attributable to local authorities. In this paper, we apply time-dependent conditional frontier estimators to assess the performance of the 278 Portuguese mainland municipalities for the 2009-2014 period. By applying this nonparametric approach, we can avoid the strong assumptions on the specification of the estimated production function required by traditional two-stage methods. Furthermore, we examine the effect of contextual variables and time on the shape of the frontier and the distribution of inefficiencies. The results reveal that the local reforms do not seem to have achieved the pursued objective of improving the efficiency of local government performance. However, we can observe a small improvement in the last year of the period after the amalgamation of some civil parishes, thus it seems that this specific process might have had a certain impact in the short term. Moreover, we find that the economic and demographic indicators included as contextual variables in our model play an important role as influencing the production set, although those effects do not seem to vary much over time. This evidence is corroborated after conducting a second-stage nonparametric regression of the conditional efficiency measures over those variables.","[Cordero, Jose M.; Pedraja-Chaparro, Francisco; Polo, Cristina] Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Av Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain; [Pisaflores, Elsa C.] Camara Municipal Estremoz, Rossio Marques de Pombal 105, Estremoz, Portugal",Universidad de Extremadura,"Cordero, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Av Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",jmcordero@unex.es,"POLO, CRISTINA/GVS-7343-2022; FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/S-5567-2018","POLO, CRISTINA/0000-0001-5164-164X; FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/0000-0001-8783-6748",,,,,81,38,40,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

The resource being valued is a public project to protect salt marshes against the spread of an invasive aquatic plant in the Brest roadstead (France). Valuation uncertainty is captured through a variant of payment card format where respondents are given the opportunity to report their WTP as either a single value (Option A) or an interval of values (Option B). The ordering effect is tested using both parametric models that ignore and control for the potential sample selection bias related to the choice between Option A and Option B, as well as non-parametric models. The results suggest that (1) respondents place substantial WTP values on salt marsh conservation, and (2) the ordering effect is linked to respondent uncertainty since only uncertain respondents react differently to changes in the order of presenting bid amounts. Specifically, for uncertain respondents, putting bid amounts in ascending order yields lower welfare estimates than putting bid amounts in descending order or random order. Policy recommendations and options to deal with ordering effect are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The existence of increasing inequality creates a challenge for ecological economics. In this paper we set out some of the problems inherent in Piketty's approach and how they are addressed from the point of view of ecological economics. We use Jackson and Victor's response as a point of departure to make several points. Piketty's work involves an unreconciled inconsistency between his laws and the institutional context, which becomes problematic when one starts to think about 'inevitability'. He simply assumes away ecological problems to make future forecasts for inequality. As such, his forecasts are undermined, since ecological issues are fundamental to any viable future economy. Furthermore, Piketty effectively reproduces (rather than contests) the mainstream practice of delegating ecological issues to a sub-discipline. Jackson and Victor, meanwhile, focus on the mainstream economic aspect of Piketty's work, and construct a model to contest a model. In so doing, they provide an ideational response to what is also a problem of ideological frameworks. Though it can be important to contest an idea, they inadvertently, through family resemblance, contribute to the reproduction of the problematic position of ecological concerns within dominant ways,of conceiving economics.

We show that instability cannot be excluded when a standard money demand function is estimated, irrespectively of the use of M1 or M2. Then, we argue that the reason for possible instability resides in the omission of relevant variables, as we show that a fully stable demand for narrow money (M1) can be obtained from an augmented money demand function involving real exchange rate and its volatility as additional explanatory variables.

The method, however, trades off accuracy and precision for convenience and simplicity. This paper proposes a new threshold that uses the town size distribution together with agricultural data to derive an appropriate cutoff value. The relevance of agricultural income is integrated into the classification scheme through the differential effect of local agricultural endowments on settlement size. The threshold is chosen such that the size of towns above the cutoff is statistically not influenced by local agricultural endowments, while the size of villages, which is below the threshold, is indeed shaped by them. This new approach is practically demonstrated with an application to the urban system of the nineteenth century in the German region of Saxony. This setting is used to investigate the relevance of a different classification for the development of urbanization over time and Gibrat's law. The results demonstrate that the underlying classification scheme matters strongly for the conclusions drawn from historical urban data. They also indicate that the use of a common population threshold for a comparative analysis or temporal comparisons in a historical context increases the misclassifications of settlements.","[Ploeckl, Florian] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Ploeckl, F (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",florian.ploeckl@adelaide.edu.au,,"Ploeckl, Florian/0000-0001-8500-9028",,,,,39,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2017,11.0,2,,,,,269,287,,10.1007/s11698-016-0145-6,0.0,,,19,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,ET1IQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400021400005,0

The model adds to existing literature by focusing on direct benefits and equity and by elaborating on the role of transaction costs and management strategies in governing urban commons. Considering direct benefits allows for a complete picture of overall benefits while making governance decisions, as opposed to considering benefits received only through human effort. Focusing on power asymmetries between stakeholders highlights the inequities created in accessing benefits from urban commons. Elaborating on management strategies provides greater insight into the complexities of managing urban commons and the impacts that governance decisions can have.

The environmental good is shared by the study countries, but the countries differ substantially in their income levels and other characteristics. We compare the performance of value transfers (with or without income elasticity of willingness to pay adjustments) and function transfers that include only core variables supported by economic theory. Our results point to a new source of uncertainty associated with function transfer choosing a particular functional form. Even if only theoretically relevant explanatory variables are used, the theory offers no insights with respect to a functional relationship of the dependence (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, polynomial). We show that while different functional forms may offer improvements in model fit, this does not necessarily translate to improvements in transfer errors or minimum tolerance levels. In our case, the value transfer with constant (unit) income elasticity adjustment, corresponding to the log-log functional relationship between willingness to pay and income, performs the best, Including additional explanatory variables or using other functional forms worsens the quality of transfers. Overall, our study questions the rationale for using more complicated function transfers in international benefit transfers, as the relationships observed within a country or a group of countries does not necessarily translate to dependencies between countries.

Given the opportunity to lobby, we observe harvesters contributing to move inefficient proposed caps toward more efficient levels. However, lobbying is a public good and, consistent with Nash equilibrium, the user type with weaker preference free rides on the type with stronger preferences leading to insufficient lobbying and inefficient regulations, especially when the cap must be lowered. This highlights an important limitation to participatory governance mechanisms when participation is costly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Each of the inequality measures, which focus on unique characteristics of income distributions, is used to evaluate the arguments of different analytical approaches. Results of the longitudinal analysis for the 1997 to 2012 period indicate that state-level emissions are positively associated with the income share of the top 10%, while the effect of the Gini coefficient on emissions is non-significant. The statistically significant relationship between CO2 emissions and the concentration of income among the top 10% is consistent with analytical approaches that focus on political economy dynamics and Veblen effects, which highlight the potential political and economic power and emulative influence of the wealthy. The null effect of the Gini coefficient is generally inconsistent with the marginal propensity to emit approach, which posits that when incomes become more equally distributed, the poor will increase their consumption of energy and other carbon-intensive products as they move into the middle class.

Our attention is placed on geographical factors because of the unique geographical landscape in Bhutan, which may act as an important barrier for access to care in the country. We further analyze the pattern of multiple healthcare visits of individuals with the same health symptom. The methods employed for this study consist of binary logit and multinomial logit regressions as well as descriptive statistical approach. The results show that living in rural area, longer travel time, and residing in remote area reduce the chance of receiving formal care when ill, and among those who get formal treatment, these factors lead to higher tendency of visiting primary healthcare facilities and less propensity of getting care from secondary and tertiary providers. We also find that people with lower economic status have less access to care than their richer counterparts. By investigating the pattern of multiple outpatient visits, our analysis reveals incidence of bypassing primary care to higher level of care in Bhutan. There is also evidence of moving up to higher level of care during subsequent visits but in general people are very persistent in their provider choice.","[Damrongplasit, Kannika] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Wangdi, Tshering] Minist Hlth, Policy & Planning Div, Thimphu, Bhutan",Chulalongkorn University,"Damrongplasit, K (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",Kannika.D@chula.ac.th,"Damrongplasit, Kannika/AFT-1055-2022","Damrongplasit, Kannika/0000-0001-9434-6114",,,,,25,8,8,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Because most casual games are free to install, understanding repeat playing behavior is important for game developers as it directly drives advertising revenue. Game developers are keenly interested in benchmarking their game versus the market average, and understanding how genre and various game mechanics drive repeat playing behavior. Such cross-sectional analysis, however, is difficult to conduct because individual-level data on competitors' games are not publicly available, and that the casual gaming industry is highly fragmented with each firm making only a handful of games. I develop a Bayesian approach, based on a parsimonious Hidden Markov Model at the individual level in conjunction with data augmentation, to study repeat playing behavior using only publicly available data. After applying the proposed approach to a sample of 379 casual games, I find that the average daily attrition rate across game is around 36.5%, with an average play rate of 47.9%, resulting in an average ARPU (average revenue per user) across games of around 20.5 cents. Certain genres are linked to higher attrition rates and play rates. In addition, giving out a daily bonus or limiting the amount of time that gamers can play each day are associated with a 17.7% and 16.4% higher ARPU, respectively.","[Hui, Sam K.] Univ Houston, Bauer Coll Business, 375J Melcher Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Hui, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Bauer Coll Business, 375J Melcher Hall, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",khui@bauer.uh.edu,,,,,,,30,8,9,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

The empirical analysis focuses on an institutional setting in which empirical findings are still limited; namely on PHI covering co-payment for treatments that are only partly financed by a universal health care system. The analysis is based on Danish data recently collected specifically for this purpose, which makes identification strategies assuming selection on observables only, and on both observables and unobservables also, both plausible and possible. We find evidence of a substantial positive and significant effect of complementary PHI on the use of prescription medicine and chiropractic care, a smaller but significant effect on dental care, weaker indications of effects for physiotherapy and general practice, and finally that the use of hospital-based outpatient care is largely unaffected. This implies that complementary PHI is generally not simply a marker of a higher propensity to use health care but induces additional use of some health care services over and above what would be used in the absence of such coverage.","[Kiil, Astrid; Arendt, Jacob Nielsen] Danish Inst Local & Reg Govt Res, KORA, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Kiil, A (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Local & Reg Govt Res, KORA, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",aski@kora.dk; jacn@kora.dk,"Arendt, Jacob Nielsen/ISS-2184-2023","Arendt, Jacob Nielsen/0000-0001-5675-8564; Kiil, Astrid/0000-0003-1812-4936",Danish Health Insurance Foundation (Helsefonden),Danish Health Insurance Foundation (Helsefonden),"The collection of the data used in the article was supported financially by the Danish Health Insurance Foundation (Helsefonden).

Different approaches can be formulated to measure and decompose input-specific productivity change over time. In this paper, we highlight some problems within existing approaches and propose a new methodology based on the Principle of Least Action. In particular, this model is operationalized in the form of a non-radial Luenberger productivity indicator based on the determination of the least distance to the strongly efficient frontier of the considered production possibility sets, which are estimated by non-parametric techniques based upon Data Envelopment Analysis. In our approach, overall productivity change is the sum of input-specific productivity changes. Overall productivity change and input-specific changes are broken up into indicators of efficiency change and technical change. This decomposition enables the researcher to quantify the contributions of each production factor to productivity change and its components. In this way, the drivers of productivity development are revealed. For illustration purposes the new approach is applied to a recent dataset of Polish dairy processing firms.","[Aparicio, Juan; Sainz-Pardo, Jose L.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Ctr Operat Res, Elche 03202, Alicante, Spain; [Kapelko, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Appl Math, Dept Logist, Wroclaw, Poland; [Mahlberg, Bernhard] Inst Ind Res, Mittersteig 10-4, A-1050 Vienna, Austria; [Mahlberg, Bernhard] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Mahlberg, B (通讯作者)，Inst Ind Res, Mittersteig 10-4, A-1050 Vienna, Austria.;Mahlberg, B (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",Mahlberg@iwi.ac.at,"Mahlberg, Bernhard/AAE-8996-2020; Aparicio, Juan/P-6348-2015; Sainz-Pardo Auñón, José Luis/ABE-4611-2021; Kapelko, Magdalena/F-3788-2016","Mahlberg, Bernhard/0000-0002-0063-9264; Aparicio, Juan/0000-0002-0867-0004; Sainz-Pardo Auñón, José Luis/0000-0002-2663-9967; Kapelko, Magdalena/0000-0003-2020-2374",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/D/ HS4/00252]; Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness [MTM2013-43903-P],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","We would like to express our gratitude to the editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether preferences for specific place-based attributes might constrain or support tourism participation and tourism destination choice of distinct socioeconomic groups of visitors. To test this proposition, a large data set from the Italian Households Budget Survey for the period 1997-2007 has been used and, by means of the double-hurdle model, tourism participation and expenditure are modeled over the life-cycle of tourists. These data are next merged with location-specific attributes including natural amenities and infrastructural and regional-economic context variables. Our results show that location-specific or place-based characteristics affect intra- and interregional tourism differently, as well as destination choices. Regional differences between residents in two different macroareas in Italy (North and Center-South) are investigated. Location-specific characteristics may be either push or constraint factors for tourism participation. For families living in the North, participation in the tourism market is supported by the tourist characteristics of their home region. For families living in the central and southern regions however, economic conditions of the area where they reside appear to be more significant.","[Bernini, Cristina] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bernini, Cristina] Univ Bologna, Ctr Adv Studies Tourism, Campus Rimini, Bologna, Italy; [Cracolici, Maria Francesca] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Viale Sci Edificio 13, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Nijkamp, Peter] Tinbergen Inst Amsterdam, Gustav Mahlerplein 117, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Poznan, Poland",University of Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Palermo; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Bernini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.;Bernini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Ctr Adv Studies Tourism, Campus Rimini, Bologna, Italy.",cristina.bernini@unibo.it; mariafrancesca.cracolici@unipa.it; pnijkamp@hotmail.com,,"Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X",,,,,47,15,16,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

In the eighties of the last century, its effect on the development of the civil society was demonstrated in Italy and the USA. The most recent concepts include the approach presented by F. Fukuyama, who found that social capital means people's ability to cooperate within groups and organizations in order to achieve common goals. The concept continues to be developing and seems to be useful in the analysis of capitalist social systems. This paper attempted to indicate the role and importance of social capital in crisis management in the system of national security management with the example of volunteer dispositional groups.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper brings together two previously unrelated research streams - MFCA and restaurant waste management - with specific focus on food waste. Findings - The advantages of using MFCA for assessing food waste in the restaurant industry are derived from the joint literatures. These include simplicity and low cost of application of the tool, as well as the potential for experimentation on a case- by- case basis to demonstrate the advantages for assessing and managing food waste in the industry. Practical implications - This pragmatic research introduces the MFCA tool to the restaurant industry. It highlights the need for restaurants to implement MFCA for themselves for it to be effective. It also encourages small restaurants to work together to obtain the resource and financial advantages MFCA can deliver. Originality/value - This is the first paper to integrate the internationally recognised International Organization for Standardization 14051 MFCA literature with the problem of food waste management in restaurants.","[Christ, Katherine Leanne] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Burritt, Roger] Univ Kassel, Management Int Food Ind, Witzenhausen, Germany",University of South Australia; Universitat Kassel,"Christ, KL (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",chrkl002@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Christ, Katherine/A-8966-2019","Christ, Katherine/0000-0003-4684-2062",,,,,35,25,31,7,73,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The paper examines whether the gender of the respondent influences the set of desired employee benefits. Research was done among the students of two faculties of Mendel University in Brno - Faculty of AgriSciences, and Faculty of Business and Economics. The research was conducted in the period of 2002-2014. From the data obtained it can be concluded that the students, except for two employee benefits, do not categorically disregard various benefits provided. Students would not expect an availability of benefits like shopping tour in abroad or Christmas box of chocolates for children. There were identified eight least requested employee benefits, for which there was done the analysis of their correlation with the gender of respondents. Repeated statistical correlation was identified in the case of the following benefits: Children's nurseries and kindergartens, provision of employee-stocks, sports vouchers for swimming, Christmas box of chocolates for children.","[Duda, Jiri] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Management, Zemedelska, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Duda, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Management, Zemedelska, Brno, Czech Republic.",jiri.duda@mendelu.cz,"Duda, Jiří/A-4407-2017","Duda, Jiří/0000-0003-4488-6934",,,,,25,0,0,2,8,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,328,333,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300040,0

The model was developed for use in an on-farm decision support system (DSS) to estimate crop N and irrigation requirements. In the current version, the only inputs are daily data of air temperature inside the greenhouse, outside solar radiation, estimated or measured roof transmissivity, and the dates of the crop. To date, VegSyst has been calibrated and validated for tomato, sweet pepper and muskmelon. Given the economic importance of cucumber in south-eastern Spain, this work was conducted to calibrate VegSyst for cucumber crops grown in Mediterranean-type plastic greenhouses. Two experiments with cucumber were conducted in two different growing seasons, being grown in (a) autumn-winter and (b) spring. Large differences in solar radiation were observed between the growing periods; values of average daily integral and the accumulated solar radiation, inside the greenhouse, for each growing season were respectively 6.9 MJ m(-2) d(-1) and 546 MJ m(-2) for the autumn-winter period and 10.5 MJ m(-2) d(-1) and 888 MJ m(-2) for the spring period. The calibration parameters for the autumn-winter crop under lower radiation conditions were not suitable for the spring crop, even though the model is driven by thermal time. Data from several previous studies of cucumber were used for validation. The performance of the model to predict accumulated dry matter production (DMP) during the growing period was very good. The performance of the model to simulate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was generally acceptable; the errors associated with the estimation of ETc were larger than those with DMP. Simulated values of critical crop N uptake were generally lower than measured crop N uptake, confirming that these crops were not N-limited. Data used for validation were obtained at different sites, in different types of greenhouse, and with different varieties and planting densities from the calibration crops, demonstrating the robustness of the VegSyst model for cucumber.","[Gallardo, M.; Padilla, F.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a smartphone-based observation technique, a total of 149 consumers and 34 employees were observed at three food courts at a mid-western university in the USA. The observational tool recorded 30 sequential transactions of each individual, allowing researchers to identify the compliance rate to the rubric. Both descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis of variance were used for data analysis. Findings - This study found a low compliance rate of food safety practices among consumers and employees at university food courts. Consumers' food safety practices varied depending on gender, observed ethnicity and party size, while none of those factors was significant for employees. Specifically, females, Caucasians, and lone diners showed higher non-compliance rates than those of males, non-Caucasians and group diners. Research limitations/implications - The results of the study raise the pressing needs of developing effective risk communication strategies at university food courts for both consumers and employees in order to reduce the potential risk of foodborne illness outbreaks. Originality/value - University food courts are not only major foodservice operations for on-campus populations as well as off-campus visitors and the local public, but also the presence of shared dining area pertains the potential risk of foodborne illnesses. However, lack of attention has been paid to the food safety issues at university food courts, and especially food safety behaviors of consumers. This study extended the knowledge of previous food safety literature by adopting a smartphone-based observation technique and developing a rubric customized for consumers and employees at university food courts.","[Her, EunSol] Purdue Univ, Sch Hospitality & Tourism Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Seo, Soobin; Choi, Jihee] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Hospitality Management, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Pool, Victor; Ilic, Sanja] Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Human Nutr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Seo, S (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Human Sci, Hospitality Management, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",seo.190@osu.edu,"Her, EunSol/AAD-5770-2020; Seo, Soobin/I-8503-2012; Seo, Soobin/ITV-4708-2023; Ilic, Sanja/B-4136-2010","Her, EunSol/0000-0003-0109-7812;",,,,,33,5,6,1,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Techniques applied to crop growth models are mostly local sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation. Unfortunately, more powerful and already available global sensitivity analysis methods and data assimilation are scarcely used. Thus, firstly, the state of the art of uncertainty analysis, global sensitivity analysis, and new data assimilation approaches applied to crop growth models is summarized. Secondly, future directions to improve the overall modeling process of crop growth are addressed. In dynamic models of crops, analyzing the uncertainties related to model parameters, model structure, and input variables is critical. An uncertainty analysis can be carried out before a sensitivity analysis or once a model evaluation (validation) is performed. In any case, it relies on the definition of probability distribution functions (PDFs) to input factors. Nowadays, despite the fact that a local sensitivity analysis is generally performed on crop growth dynamic models, the modeler should use so-called global sensitivity methods such as the elementary effects method, Monte Carlo filtering, standardized regression coefficients, scatterplots, and variance-based methods. In addition, several researchers have agreed that the parameter estimation process of crop models is still an open research problem and that new solutions are needed. However, Bayesian parameter estimation, in particular, and Bayesian modeling in general are approaches that are still in their infancy in the crop modeling community. Finally, there is already some evidence for the improvement of model quality that can be achieved by applying data assimilation methods such as nonlinear Kalman filters, particle filtering, and variational data assimilation. The main conclusion of this work is that the quality of crop growth models can be raised considerably by improving either current practice of sensitivity analysis or current practice of data assimilation.","[Lopez-Cruz, I.

Design/methodology/approach - The study first develops a conceptual framework drawing the concept of mode of organization from the Transaction Cost Economics. The three research questions are coherently formulated which concern: the influence of the modes of organization on the decision to innovate and to invest in supporting instruments; the variability of this influence and the complementarity degree between the decision to innovate and to invest. The empirical analysis is carried out with respect to the olive oil sector considering a representative sample of olive millers (Umbria, Central Italy) and a complementary accidental sample drawn from an existing database. Findings - The main results of the study provide evidence for the role of modes of organization in the knowledge acquisition finalized to the process innovation. The role of the buy option is important, while the collaboration - the hybrid organization - seems to influence strongly the innovation and the related investment decision. The important role of the information sources appears effective and articulated. Finally, despite the great economic importance of the quality requirements, the millers appear to be more sensitive to the difficulties to build up a clear process vision in terms of technology. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of the study is that it refers to a specific supply system including small enterprises and does not account for the pattern of innovation in other olive oil production systems. Moreover, one of the samples that was observed and analyzed is accidental in nature and does not allow a clear and robust comparison for the representative sample. Practical implications - The findings of this study can contribute to the identification of organizational constraints to the rate on process innovation. Originality/value - The originality of the study is based on the main focus, i.e. the attention to the role of the modes of organization in the decision to innovate, which provides complementary information to the extant literature on the choice of modes of organizing the technological knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the conceptual framework and findings are connected to the current research on the variety of the agribusiness organizations which is still a partially explored field of inquiry.","[Martino, Gaetano; Marchini, Andrea; Frascarelli, Angelo] Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Food & Environm Sci, Perugia, Italy; [Rossetti, Enrica] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia; University of Perugia,"Martino, G (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Agr Food & Environm Sci, Perugia, Italy.",gaetano.martino@unipg.it,"Marchini, Andrea/D-6539-2012; Martino, Gaetano/AAA-3664-2021","Martino, Gaetano/0000-0001-6827-3185",,,,,44,9,9,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

An in-depth knowledge of the fundamental metabolic regulation and control mechanisms of these leafy vegetables to sugar starvation is beneficial in understanding how they modify their metabolism to survive in the absence of sugar. To this end, isolated lamb's lettuce cells were incubated in the dark to trigger sugar starvation at different temperatures (25, 18 and 1 degrees C) to monitor the dynamic changes in the metabolome over time. To understand which pathways were up-or downregulated, the isolated cells were preloaded with uniformly labelled C-13-glucose and the distribution of the C-13 label throughout the different metabolic pathways was monitored. The metabolite and the corresponding C-13 label data were used to construct an integrated compartmentalised central metabolic model, containing both first-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, to quantify the effect of sugar starvation on the kinetic parameters and, thus, to calculate fluxes of the respiratory metabolism and to analyse the metabolic control mechanisms that plants have to adopt upon sugar starvation as a function of storage temperature. From this study, a decrease in flux was observed in the respiratory metabolism of cells when they were incubated at 1 degrees C compared with 25 and 18 degrees C. When sugar starvation was induced at 18 and 25 degrees C, a decrease in the fluxes was observed in the glycolytic pathway metabolites as compared with that of the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites, which increased during sugar starvation. Moreover, an increased flux coming from protein and phospholipid breakdown was observed, resulting in increased concentrations of free amino and fatty acids, suggesting proteolytic and beta-oxidation reactions.","[Mbong, V.

Referring to the food and beverage (F& B) industry, the authors have investigated the adoption of an open innovation model in order to fill a gap in the existing literature. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a multi- method design linking qualitative and quantitative approaches. The quantitative study was planned in order to identify some US-listed companies, called Dividend Champions that have distributed consistently growing dividends for over 50 years and have beaten the markets. The qualitative study was designed to provide insight into the adoption or not of an open innovation model by the listed companies in the F& B industry in the US market that were selected by the quantitative analysis. Findings - The research is based on an empirical analysis undertaken with 108 listed companies in US markets. In particular, the authors underline 20 companies that over the past 50 years have systematically increased dividend paid, and at the same time, have beaten the market (Standard & Poor's 500). In all, 30 per cent of the selected companies belong to the consumer goods sector, and F& B companies represent 50 per cent of them. All of these companies (The Coca-Coca Company, Hormel Foods Corporation, and Lancaster Colony Corporation) implement an open innovation model. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first exploratory study based on value maximisation and open innovation. An open innovation model increases competitiveness and the durability of competitive advantage, which are main sources of value creation. The paper highlights evidence from the F& B industry, referred to as Dividend Champions, and the adoption of an open innovation model.","[Miglietta, Nicola; Battisti, Enrico] Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy; [Campanella, Francesco] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Econ, Caserta, Italy",University of Turin; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Battisti, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Management, Turin, Italy.",enrico.battisti@unito.it,"Battisti, Enrico/AFP-9381-2022",,,,,,80,23,25,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Findings - The findings suggest that coping capacity and adaptive capacity are indeed two different concepts, which both need to be addressed in the examination of food system vulnerability. Public and private food system governance and related decision-making processes seem to focus on building short-term coping capacity rather than strategic adaptive capacity. In fact, conservative and protective policies can be counterproductive in terms of building genuine adaptive capacity in the food system, highlighting institutional and policy failures as limiting adaptive capacity and affecting future vulnerability.

Since 1889, when the owner forerunners of today's Osijek brewery Kajetan Seper, in Osijek built hotel 'Central' on main square, with a cafe on the ground floor, it has become a regular meeting place of intellectuals, aristocrats, merchants, bankers and traders. Today, completely forgotten interior of the cafe have been reported in rare sources. In the beginning of the development of hotel industry in the city center, near to the hotel 'Central', in 1864 was built the hotel 'Grand' in the Zupanijska Street, later called 'Psunj' and in 1904 was opening of hotel 'Rayal' in the Kapucinska Street. On the main square from 1909 to 1910 was built in the first Croatian Savings Bank, housing commercial three-story building, designed by architect Dionis Sunko. Recently lost the original purpose in his ground floor - bank. Today we witness the degradation of architectural heritage with changing the original use of buildings that marked the cultural and economic life of the center of Osijek. All of these, historically and architecturally valuable buildings, recently lose its original purpose which degrades the cultural and economic life of the city. Also, a change in use, in addition to poor economic performance pulls and loss of identity and degraded urban fabric; nor hotel 'Central' can survive amputated for his cafe, which is also its link with the space and life of the main square nor First Croatian Savings Bank without its groundfloor hall for work with clients, can offer to town the quality of its original idea. Because of the importance of a cafe of hotel 'Central' in the life of the city of Osijek in the past, it is necessary to examine the possibility of returning the space to the original purpose, with appropriate presentation of original interior elements.

Design/methodology/approach - Following an initial desktop study, the categorisation was developed collaboratively with industry experts through a workshop and series of semi-structured interviews. Findings - The new categorisation developed is in Venn diagram format allowing overlapping categories. It is organised around the two major types of contamination (biological, and chemical/physical contaminants) and the two major causes of contamination (wilful deception, and transparency and awareness issues). Practical implications - The long and complex supply chains characteristic of current food production systems have resulted in a rising number of food scares. There is thus an increased emphasis on developing strategies to reduce both the number of incidents of food scares, and their associated economic, social and environmental impacts. The new categorisation developed in this study enables experts to address categories of food scares. Inclusion of the cause of contamination is particularly important as the method through which contamination occurs is key in devising food scare prevention strategies. Originality/value - The new categorisation, unlike previous categorisations, enables food scares to fall into multiple categories, as appropriate. Also, again in contrast to previous categorisations, it takes into account not only the physical problem of a food scare but also the mechanism through which it arises.","[Whitworth, Elizabeth] ADAS UK, Wolverhampton, England; [Druckman, Angela] Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Woodward, Amy] Natl Fdn Educ Res England & Wales, Slough, Berks, England",University of Surrey,"Druckman, A (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil, Guildford, Surrey, England.",a.druckman@surrey.ac.uk,,"Druckman, Angela/0000-0002-2515-0369",EPSRC Research Council [EP/H021779/1]; EPSRC [EP/H021779/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/M010163/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was supported by the EPSRC Research Council (Grant No. EP/H021779/1 (Evolution and Resilience of Industrial Ecosystems)).

Design/methodology/approach - This paper describes a concept of food agency and contrasts it with how cooking is commonly conceived in food and nutrition literature. A food agency-based pedagogy and proposals for using it are also introduced. Findings - Cooking is a complex process that may be crucial for making a difference in the contemporary problems of diet-related chronic diseases. There are two interlinked problems with present research on cooking. First, cooking has yet to be adequately conceptualized for the design and evaluation of effective public health and nutrition interventions. The context within which food-related decisions and actions occur has been neglected. Instead, the major focus has been on discrete mechanical tasks. In particular, recipes are relied upon despite no clear evidence that recipes move people from knowledge to action. Second, given the incomplete theorization and definition of this vital everyday practice, intervention designs tend to rely on assumptions over theory. This creates certain forms of tautological reasoning when claims are made about how behavior changes. A comprehensive theory of food agency provides a nuanced understanding of daily food practices and clarifies how to teach cooking skills that are generalizable throughout varied life contexts. Originality/value - This commentary is of value to academics studying cooking-related behavior and public health practitioners implementing and evaluating cooking interventions.","[Wolfson, Julia A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bostic, Stephanie] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lahne, Jacob] Drexel Univ, Dept Culinary Arts & Food Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Morgan, Caitlin; Harvey, Jean; Trubek, Amy] Univ Vermont, Dept Nutr & Food Sci, Burlington, VT USA; [Henley, Shauna C.] Univ Maryland, Baltimore Cty Extens, Cockeysville, MD USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Cornell University; Drexel University; University of Vermont,"Wolfson, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Management & Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",jwolfson@umich.edu,"Wolfson, Julia/D-9854-2018","Wolfson, Julia/0000-0001-9155-2609; Lahne, Jacob/0000-0002-2344-1816",,,,,54,38,43,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Results suggest that the minimum wage increases the probability of being obese and decreases daily fruit and vegetable intake, but also decreases days with functional limitations while having no impact on healthcare access. Subsample analyses reveal that the increase in weight and decrease in fruit and vegetable intake are driven by the older population, married, and whites.

Consequentially, it is argued that cost-benefit analysis can suggest mitigation rates that are nearly arbitrary. This article investigates how firm conclusions can be made from cost-benefit analysis if the main uncertainties are considered endogenously in the analysis and an extensive sensitivity analysis is carried out regarding the contestable assumptions. The SCORE model is used to calculate optimal emission pathways and carbon prices that hedge against climate sensitivity and damage risks using a wide range of plausible parametrization. In a vast majority of cases the near-term emissions fall between 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C emission pathways, giving thus support for the Paris Agreement targets. Sequential decision-making allows hedging against uncertainties and readjusting mitigation efforts over time to reflect new information, leading to diverse stabilization temperatures in the long-term. Assumptions on mitigation costs, climate sensitivity and damages affect optimal near-term mitigation and long-term stabilization temperature more strongly than the discount rate choice. The consideration of parametric uncertainty on climate sensitivity and damages adds a substantial risk component to carbon pricing, while learning can induce significant price volatility in a decadal timescale.","[Ekholm, Tommi] Aalto Univ, Otakaari 1, Espoo 02150, Finland",Aalto University,"Ekholm, T (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Otakaari 1, Espoo 02150, Finland.",tommi.ekholm@aalto.fi,"Ekholm, Tommi/B-6427-2015","Ekholm, Tommi/0000-0002-9124-6289",Nessling Foundation [201700487]; Academy of Finland [311010]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [311010] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Nessling Foundation; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),The research has been carried out with funding from the Nessling Foundation (grant number 201700487) and the Academy of Finland (decision number 311010).,,40,12,13,2,47,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The approach is based on origin-destination fares and aims to increase the equity of transportation supply in an urban area: routes in certain urban areas can be very well served while others may be served poorly or not at all. Yet most citizens contribute indirectly to transit systems that are often subsidized to a considerable extent by public money. The proposed method seeks to balance this asymmetry, reducing taxi fares on origin-destination pairs that are poorly served by other transportation modes. An optimisation problem based on this principle is formulated and solved. The proposed approach is tested on a small test network and on a real-scale network. Numerical results show that the approach is applicable and useful to enhance equity in transit services.","[Gallo, Mariano] Univ Sannio, Dipartimento Ingn, Piazza Roma 21, I-82100 Benevento, Italy",University of Sannio,"Gallo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sannio, Dipartimento Ingn, Piazza Roma 21, I-82100 Benevento, Italy.",gallo@unisannio.it,,,,,,,50,10,10,2,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0038-0121,,,SOCIO-ECON PLAN SCI,Socio-Econ.

Until now, historians have mainly viewed the Great Famine, and medieval famines in general, through theoretical models of the larger fourteenth-century crisis. However, this article suggests that this approach is flawed and instead applies recent theories on contemporary famines to the crisis of 1315-17 in the county of Flanders. This new perspective not only leads to a re-examination of existing explanations, such as the role of warfare, but also reveals the importance of property rights in entitlement to food: the power of elites, the relative number of large-scale landowners, and the structure of household income all influenced peasants' degree of vulnerability.","[Geens, Sam] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Geens, S (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.",Sam.Geens@uantwerpen.be,,"Geens, Sam/0000-0001-9758-3182",,,,,52,11,11,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

One way to address agriculture's impact during droughts is to use recycled water for irrigation, but little is known about how consumers will respond to information disclosing that a food product was produced with recycled water. On the positive side, irrigation with recycled water is environmentally friendly. On the negative side, there is an ick factor that might repel consumers. We conducted a framed field experiment to evaluate consumers' responses to California and French wines made from grapes produced with recycled, conventional, and an unspecified type of water for irrigation. We find that consumers prefer not to know; their willingness to pay is greatest when the wine is made from grapes irrigated with an unspecified type of water.

In 2016, over 400 ACOs participated in the CMS initiative with contracts covering an estimated 8 million Medicare beneficiaries. However, in 2014, less than one-third of ACOs achieved requirements to earn shared savings. The aim of the study was to determine whether the most technically efficient ACOs realized earned savings. A contingency theory framework helps explain how variation in two factors, use of electronic health records (EHRs) by primary care providers and inclusion of specialists, may affect the operational performance of ACOs. This inaugural study of ACOs using data envelopment analysis found less than one-fifth of ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program efficient with an average efficiency score of 0.803 for results from 2014. The most efficient ACOs are not restricted to those achieving earned savings. Of the 39 ACOs identified as efficient in this analysis, only 12 realized earned savings. The remaining 49 ACOs that earned savings in 2014 were not among the most efficient.

Carbon pricing can play a key role in meeting this objective. A cap-and-permit system, or alternatively a carbon tax indexed to a fixed emission-reduction trajectory, not only can spur cost-effective mitigation and cost-reducing innovation, but also, crucially, can ensure that emissions are held to the target level. The carbon prices needed to meet this constraint are likely to be considerably higher, however, than existing prices and conventional measures of the social cost of carbon.

Applying a non-Bayesian time-varying model approach to the fundamental equation for spot returns and the futures premium, we detect when efficiency reductions in the two major rice markets occurred. We also examine how government interventions affected the rice markets in Japan, which colonized Taiwan and Korea before the Second World War, and argue that the function of rice futures markets crucially depended on the differences in the structure of rice spot markets. Initially the increased volume of imported rice of a different variety from domestic rice disrupted the rice futures markets. Then, government intervention in the rice futures markets failed to improve the disruption. Changes in colonial rice cropping successfully mitigated the disruption, and colonial rice was promoted in order to unify the different varieties of inland and colonial rice.","[Ito, Mikio] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Maeda, Kiyotaka] Seinan Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Noda, Akihiko] Kyoto Sangyo Univ, Fac Econ, Kyoto, Japan; [Noda, Akihiko] Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Tokyo, Japan",Keio University; Kyoto Sangyo University; Keio University,"Ito, M (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Noda, Akihiko/AAV-6386-2021","Noda, Akihiko/0000-0001-8073-8686; Ito, Mikio/0000-0002-6079-3642","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17K03809, 17K03863, 15K03542]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03542, 17K03863, 17K03809, 17H02553] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank the editor Jaime Reis, three anonymous referees, Shigehiko Ioku, Makoto Kasuya, Yo Kikkawa, Kozo Kiyota, Junsoo Lee, Kris Mitchener, Tamaki Miyauchi, Chiaki Moriguchi, Toshihiro Nagahiro, Tetsuji Okazaki, Minoru Omameuda, Mototsugu Shintani, Masato Shizume, Yasuo Takatsuki, Masahiro Uemura, Tatsuma Wada, Asobu Yanagisawa, seminar participants at Doshisha University, Keio University, and Wakayama University, and conference participants at the Japanese Economics Association 2014 Autumn Meeting, and the 90th Annual Conference of the Western Economic Association International for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Clustering analysis can divide the groups constructing the strong connecting supply chain with large emissions from the global supply chain network, and structural path betweenness represents how much CO2 emissions from the supply chain paths a sector has in global supply chain network. I applied the combined method to the EORA database which covers 189 countries and focused on the whole global supply chain networks in detail. The results demonstrate that the global supply chain networks of transport equipment were well separated into emission clusters with higher emissions that consist of sectors with higher structural path betweenness. Chinese emission clusters were identified from the global supply chain networks for the five countries in question and the betweenness of Chinese sectors tend to be higher values in the supply chain networks. In this study, I suggested supply chain management of high priority sectors for a reduction in CO2 emissions of transport equipment in the producing countries.","[Tokito, Shohei] Kyushu Univ, Fac Econ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan",Kyushu University,"Tokito, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Fac Econ, Higashi Ku, 6-19-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",3EC17108N@s.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"穆, 儒/HGC-6534-2022","Tokito, Shohei/0000-0002-2850-4505",[JP17J03786]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17J03786] Funding Source: KAKEN,"; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Research Fellow JP17J03786.,,28,17,18,9,64,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

A database of 178 monetary estimates is constructed to conduct a meta-analysis that, for the first time, digs into what factors drive water related ecosystem service values in Africa. We find that the service type, biome and other socioeconomic variables are significant in explaining benefits from water related services. In order to understand the importance that benefits from water related ecosystem services have for climate change, we explore the relationship between these benefits and the countries' vulnerability and readiness to adapt to climate change. We find that countries face synergies and trade-offs in terms of how valuable their water related ecosystem services are and their potential vulnerability and adaptation capacity. While more vulnerable countries are associated with lower benefits from ecosystem services, countries with a higher readiness to adapt are also associated with lower ecosystem service values. Results are discussed in light of natural capital accounting and ecosystem-based adaptation.","[Pettinotti, Laetitia; de Ayala, Amaia] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain; [de Ayala, Amaia] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ 1, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Ojea, Elena] Univ Vigo, Future Oceans Lab, Oportunius, Gain Xunta De G, Spain",University of Basque Country; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country; Universidade de Vigo,"Pettinotti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change BC3, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain.",laetitia.pettinotti@bc3research.org; amaia.deayala@bc3research.org; elenaojea@uvigo.es,"de Ayala, Amaia/IQS-2973-2023; ojea, elena/D-3709-2018","de Ayala, Amaia/0000-0001-7329-2380; ojea, elena/0000-0003-4991-8077","Conselleria de Educacion, Xunta de Galicia","Conselleria de Educacion, Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia)","This work was undertaken as part of the Water Infrastructure Solutions from Ecosystem Services Underpinning Climate Resilient Policies and Programmes (WISE UP to Climate) project.

Households can change their food consumption habits so as to consume less polluting products such as white meat or vegetable-based food. We analyze whether or not a CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) tax policy in France can change household habits with respect to animal product purchases, and their environmental impact. Using two levels of a CO2-eq tax ((sic)56 and (sic)200 per tonne of CO2-eq) applied to the consumption of all animal products, only ruminant meats or only beef, we show that a high level of tax does not allow meeting the 20% objective threshold of GHG emissions reduction for 2020 since it would lead to a 6% decrease in GHG emissions only. Despite the weak effect of such a tax, the most efficient scenario would be to tax the consumption of beef only at a high level. Indeed, this tax policy would allow reaching a 3.2% decrease in GHG emissions, that represents 53% of the variation in GHG emissions when all products are taxed whereas it would only generate 12% of the household welfare damages.","[Bonnet, Celine; Bouamra-Mechemache, Zohra; Corre, Tifenn] Toulouse Sch Econ INRA, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; INRAE,"Bonnet, C (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ INRA, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",celine.bonnet@tse-fr.eu; zohra.bouamra@tse-fr.eu; tifenn.corre@gmail.com,"Mokhtara, Charafeddine/ACV-5174-2022",,,,,,48,50,55,3,93,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This article takes a first step toward more systemic monitoring by asking how the global use of forests by EU consumers can be accounted for. Specifically, this article builds on and develops the method of global land use accounting to account for the EU-27's consumption of primary timber between 2002 and 2011 in terms of both volume and forest area. It assesses international trade flows for around 100 commodities and converts them into a volume of primary raw timber based on conversion values. Results reveal that both imports and exports increased over the assessed time period, with primary EU-27 timber estimated to be around 1 m(3)/cap in 2011. Gaps, uncertainty and a lack of harmonization regarding especially trade data and conversion values are key challenges to further improving the robustness of the method and reliability of results. Future research may focus on improving the method to address in particular recycled and recovered flows as well as the question of whether area or volume is the most appropriate metric for further development of a forest footprint indicator.","[O'Brien, Meghan] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Wuppertal, Germany; [Bringezu, Stefan] Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"O'Brien, M (通讯作者)，Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Wuppertal, Germany.",meghan.obrien@wupperinst.org,"Bringezu, Stefan/W-6229-2018","Beck-O'Brien, Meghan/0000-0002-9306-1173",Wuppertal Institute,Wuppertal Institute,"This article is based on the dissertation thesis Timber consumption and sustainable forest use: Assessing the EU's current and expected consumption of global timber in relation to the global capacity for sustainable supply published by Kassel University Press (O'Brien, 2016) and supported by the Wuppertal Institute.",,42,28,28,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This study constitutes a first step toward understanding (i) the medium-term prospects for biobased sectors in the context of expected EU biomass policy developments and (ii) the degree of coherency with the Bioeconomy strategy in terms of identifying potential policy conflicts. A general finding is that EU bio-based sectors face important challenges, largely due to slower assumed rates of economic growth and land productivity, coupled with deeper greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Furthermore, EU policy conflicts are encountered in attempting to reconcile greenhouse gas reductions with macroeconomic growth, food security and biofuel mandates. To conclude, a more holistic public policy approach is necessary to avoid the perceived conflicts in biomass usage, whilst there is a clear need for targeted and sustained investments in EU bio-based activity to fully exploit its potential.","[Philippidis, George] Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Ave Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain; [Bartelings, Heleen; Smeets, Edward] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Wageningen Econ Res WEcR, Alexanderveld 5, NL-2585 The Hague, Netherlands; [Philippidis, George] European Commiss, JRC, IPTS, Agr & Life Sci Econ Unit, Edificio Expo C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain",Wageningen University & Research; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS),"Philippidis, G (通讯作者)，Govt Aragon, Ctr Agrofood Res & Technol CITA, Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev ARAID, Ave Montanana 930, Zaragoza 50059, Spain.",gphilippidis@aragon.es,,"Bartelings, Heleen/0000-0002-4423-3717",,,,,46,19,21,2,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In this environment, dietary changes may have the potential to reduce water used in food production. At the same time, it is well established that American diets need to change in order to align with Federal healthy eating guidelines. In this article, we examine if there are synergies between healthier diets and blue water conservation in the U.S. food system. We estimate blue water use by supply chain stage using a multi-regional environmental input-output model. Then, we link this blue water to individual food items and use mathematical optimization to model healthy diet scenarios that meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. We find that while healthier U.S. diet outcomes and blue water conservation can be synergistic, these goals may also be competing. Making minimal changes from current American consumption to a healthy omnivore or vegetarian diet, blue water use increases by 16%, but the omnivore and vegetarian diets reduce embodied blue water by 63 and 66%, respectively, when the objective is to minimize water use.","[Rehkamp, Sarah; Canning, Patrick] ERS, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave SW,Mail Stop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Rehkamp, S (通讯作者)，ERS, USDA, 1400 Independence Ave SW,Mail Stop 1800, Washington, DC 20250 USA.",sarah.rehkamp@ers.usda.gov; pcanning@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,76,26,29,0,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper investigates teaching and learning about one of the most researched, applied and contested concepts in Environmental and Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Assessment and Valuation (ESAV). It presents students' conceptions on ESAV gained through group discussions. The transcripts were analyzed with the phenomenographic and documentary method. The analysis focuses both on the way students describe ecological, social and economic aspects, and on the criteria they use to make political and management decisions. The main results are that students tend to see nature as a place for recreation and wildlife, do not see knowledge as uncertain and hardly bring up the idea of an economic valuation. Based on students' conceptions, as well as research from Ecological and Environmental Economics and Economics Education, I suggest a curriculum for ESAV.","[Beer, David Loew] Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Social Sci, Dept Econ, August Croisst Str 5, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Beer, David Loew] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies eV, IASS Potsdam, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany",University of Koblenz & Landau,"Beer, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Koblenz Landau, Inst Social Sci, Dept Econ, August Croisst Str 5, D-76829 Landau, Germany.;Beer, DL (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies eV, IASS Potsdam, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany.",David.LoewBeer@iass-potsdam.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education through Hans-Bockler foundation,German Federal Ministry of Education through Hans-Bockler foundation,This work was supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education through a PhD scholarship of the Hans-Bockler foundation.,,85,5,6,0,44,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This has spurred a surge in the creation of sustainability indicators. One of the most used sustainability indicators of recent years is the Ecological Footprint (EF). The EF uses trade flows to estimate environmental impacts of consumption. The purpose of this study was to test EF's ability to deal with a small but highly specialized economy. For this we used Iceland as a case study but the Icelandic economy is dominated by strong specialization, with fisheries dwarfing all other sectors. Global Footprint Network's standard methodology was utilized with only the addition of local data being used where these data proved more robust than international databases. The results from the two editions of the GFN calculation models, 2008 and 2014, yielded a footprint of 56.59 and 25.26 gha, per capita, respectively, for Iceland. Three main reasons were identified for the drop in the footprint between the two editions, all within the fishing grounds footprint: A much improved coverage of extraction rates, changes in fish species trophic levels and changes to aggregate errors for traded cod and halibut. A correction of CO2 intensities for exports also had a big impact but resulted in a rise in the EF for the latter edition. The study highlighted the rapid development of the methodology as a major strength while the method's main weakness was revealed as the uncertainties associated with the marine footprint. Local consumption figures from the Icelandic Directorate of Health indicated that a further drop in the marine footprint is in store with increased accuracy of the method, mainly to do with accurate allocation between export and consumption footprints. Although the indicator's accuracy has been much improved in recent years, additional improvements are thus still needed. The extremes of the Icelandic economy highlight errors to the extent that the huge footprint the calculations yielded make the country an outlier in a global context. The indicator seems in this respect not accurate enough yet to be able to deal with such a degree of specialization, especially where the main sectors are very large in relation to the population - at least not when the sector in question is the marine sector. The upside of this is that highly specialized economies may in this way be very useful for identifying and correcting inaccuracies within the methodology for their sector of specialization.","[Johannesson, S.

They filter phytoplankton from water and thereby reduce nutrients, the primary driver of eutrophication of water that can consequently harm human health. Yet, where they can provide the most ecosystem benefit is in highly eutrophic waters and being raised in these 'polluted' waters may be an unattractive attribute for consumers. In this research, we use revealed-preference dichotomous-choice field experiments to test if and under what pollution mitigation circumstances oyster consumers will pay price premiums for oysters. The results from 290 adult participants in the Mid-Atlantic of the US suggest that providing information about eutrophication and oysters' ability to filter nutrients increases participants' WTP price premiums for oysters from low-nutrient waters and decreases their WTP price premiums for oysters from eutrophic waters with more nutrients. These results illustrate an important tension in how best to market green products like oysters, as the situations where they provide the most ecosystem benefits (in eutrophic waters) are also situations, which appear to raise the highest level of concerns among consumers. These results have implications on whether oysters should be actively marketed as a green product.","[Kecinski, Maik] Univ Alberta, Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 505 GSB, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Messer, Kent D.; Peo, Audrey J.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Alberta; University of Delaware,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",kecinski@ualberta.ca; messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,United States Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA14OAR4170087]; National Science Foundation [NSF EPSCoR Rii3 1301765]; USDA-ERS [59-6000-4-0064]; USDA HATCH,United States Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); USDA-ERS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); USDA HATCH(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the United States Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NA14OAR4170087), the National Science Foundation (NSF EPSCoR Rii3 1301765), USDA-ERS funded CBEAR (award 59-6000-4-0064) and USDA HATCH.

Numerical climate coalition models provide estimates of the challenges affecting cooperation, but often resort to assuming certainty with respect to the values of model parameters. We study the impact of uncertainty on the stability of coalitions in the Model of International Climate Agreements using the technique of Monte Carlo analysis. We extend the existing literature by (1) calibrating parametric uncertainty about damages and abatement costs to estimates from meta-studies and by (2) explicitly considering uncertainty in the curvature of the damage function. We find that stability is more sensitive to uncertainty in damages than in abatement costs and most sensitive to uncertainty about the regional distribution of damages. Our calculations suggest that heterogeneity can increase stability of coalitions; however, this depends on the availability of transfers.","[Meya, Jasper N.] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Oldenburg, Germany; [Meya, Jasper N.] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Kornek, Ulrike] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Kornek, Ulrike; Lessmann, Kai] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Humboldt University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Meya, JN (通讯作者)，Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, Oldenburg, Germany.;Meya, JN (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany.",jasper.meya@hu-berlin.de,,"Meya, Jasper/0000-0003-1598-3014; Lessmann, Kai/0000-0002-8839-343X",,,,,53,5,5,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Harvest control rules and marine reserves offer two means of controlling fishing mortality, and provide managers with mechanisms through which precaution can be exercised. We incorporate the two control mechanisms into a bioeconomic model in which fishing-induced habitat damage occurs. A parameterized model is used to assess alternative ways of exercising precaution in stock recovery plans in achieving stock rebuilding, while taking into consideration the economic and socio-economic objectives of fisheries management. Results strengthen the case for using marine reserves to rebuild depleted stocks, highlighting their role in providing a hedge against negative habitat-fishery feedbacks by directly protecting biomass and indirectly preventing a decline in the carrying capacity. Overall, we show that where a fishery is characterised by fishing-induced habitat damage, a stock rebuilding strategy that incorporates both harvest control rules and marine reserves will outperform a strategy that uses the two control mechanisms individually, across all performance indicators.","[Nichols, Rachel; Yamazaki, Satoshi; Jennings, Sarah] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Nichols, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",R.L.Nichols@utas.edu.au; satoshi.yamazaki@utas.edu.au; sarah.jennings@utas.edu.au,"Yamazaki, Satoshi/J-7538-2014; Jennings, Sarah M/J-7888-2014; Nichols, Rachel/I-6385-2016","Yamazaki, Satoshi/0000-0003-1279-2706; Nichols, Rachel/0000-0001-5386-4994",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) Building Economic Capability in Fisheries Project [306/2008]; Australian Postgraduate Award,Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) Building Economic Capability in Fisheries Project(Fisheries R&D Corp); Australian Postgraduate Award(Australian Government),This work was supported by the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) Building Economic Capability in Fisheries Project (#306/2008) and the Australian Postgraduate Award.

Using cross-national panel data, we find evidence of a robust negative correlation between crude death rates and urbanization. The use of instrumental variables suggest that this relationship is causal, while historical data from the early 20th century suggest that this relationship holds in earlier periods as well. Finally, we find robust evidence that mortality decline is correlated with urbanization through the creation of new cities rather than promoting urban growth in already-extant cities.","[Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra] Queen Mary Univ London, London E1 4NS, England; [Green, Elliott] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Green, E (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",e.d.green@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,78,10,10,2,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

In this paper, I find the traded-goods multiplier falls within the range of 1.17 to 1.93, which is substantially lower than the estimate of 2.6 obtained by Moretti. I use multiple estimators in combination with two data sets, a range of controls and different ways of classifying traded industries to show the robustness and variability of local employment multiplier estimates. Finally, I demonstrate the sensitivity of Moretti's results.

The study is intended to provide better knowledge of changes in sickness claims, and to contribute to the discussion of morbidity trends. National statistics on sickness benefits are available from 1892, and are studied until the introduction of mandatory health insurance in 1955. Membership of Swedish sickness funds increased more than tenfold between 1900 and 1950. Just a small portion of members were women in 1900; however, women constituted the majority of members by 1941. There was a gender difference in morbidity, but this variation was not consistent over time. Before 1935 men had more but shorter sickness episodes; however, after 1935 women had significantly higher sickness rates. The law in 1931 meant that the recruitment of members was widened and compensation for longer periods of illness was made possible. The continuous increase in sick days can be partly explained by legislative changes; however, the increase in the period 1910-32 cannot. The study thereby highlights the importance of incorporating legislative changes into the interpretation. This increased understanding of trends in sick leave provides a sound basis for extending the study to the analysis of individual-level data.","[Castenbrandt, Helene] Univ Gothenburg, Hist, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Castenbrandt, Helene] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Gothenburg; University of Copenhagen,"Castenbrandt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Hist, Gothenburg, Sweden.;Castenbrandt, H (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",helene.castenbrandt@history.gu.se,"Castenbrandt, Helene/O-4270-2017","Castenbrandt, Helene/0000-0002-6058-0575",Swedish Research Council,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"The author is grateful for useful comments from participants at several conferences and in seminars at the SAXO Institute, University of Copenhagen.

The compliance of used frying oils with the quality standards as determined by the peroxide value (PV) and the total polar materials (TPMs) is investigated by analyzing 375 samples of oil. Design/methodology/approach - The PV was measured according to the national standard procedure number 4179, while the TPM was determined using a Testo 270 cooking oil tester. Frying oils with a PVW5 mEq/kg and a TPMW25 percent were considered to be non-edible. For a comparison of groups, the Mann-Whitney and Spearman correlation tests were used, and po0.05 was considered significant. Findings - The maximum TPM and PV recorded for frying oils in fast food restaurants were 97.5 percent and 77.9 mEq/kg, respectively. The results also revealed that 60 percent of samples were non-edible according to the TPM, while 58.9 percent of the oil samples were non-edible because of the PV. TPM and PV correlated well with each other (r = 0.99, p<0.001) and with oil replacement intervals (r = 0.90, p<0.001). The relationship between the TPM and PV was stronger in the polynomial model than the linear model. The following equation was obtained: peroxide (mEq/kg oil) = 0.0043 TPM2 (%)+0.1587 TPM (%)-0.6152. Originality/value - Considering the current limitations in official supervision by health authority, on-site self-monitoring of the TPM using the Testo 270 cooking oil tester by sellers as a solution seems a new approach. Food stores, restaurants, and confectionary stores should be equipped with TPM analyzers to determine the quality of the frying oil and the timely replacement of non-edible oils.","[Ahmadi, Ebrahim] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Tabriz, Iran; [Mosaferi, Mohammad] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Tabriz Hlth Serv Management Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Nikniaz, Leila; Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Sch Management & Med Informat, Tabriz Hlth Serv Management Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran; [Jafarabadi, Mohammad Asghari] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Dept Stat & Epidemiol, Tabriz, Iran; [Safari, Gholamhoseyn; Bargar, Mina] Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Environm Hlth Engn, Tabriz, Iran",Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science; Tabriz University of Medical Science,"Mosaferi, M (通讯作者)，Tabriz Univ Med Sci, Tabriz Hlth Serv Management Res Ctr, Tabriz, Iran.",mmosaferi@yahoo.com,"ahmadi, ebrahim/U-1991-2017; Jafarabadi, Mohammmad Asghari/A-7478-2017; Nikniaz, Leila/M-5747-2017; Mosaferi, Mohammad/L-6032-2017; Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh/L-5036-2017","ahmadi, ebrahim/0000-0002-8859-0409; Jafarabadi, Mohammmad Asghari/0000-0003-3284-9749; Nikniaz, Leila/0000-0003-2951-936X; Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh/0000-0002-1458-8672",,,,,20,7,7,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach An online questionnaire was used to elicit information on fish consumption choices among 610 German consumers using a discrete choice experiment. Mixed logit and latent class logit models were used to model consumers' preference heterogeneity. Findings Results show that consumers' preferences for fish attributes such as filets, freshness, ecolabelling and domestic production are heterogeneous and important in consumption choices. The minor share of the respondents is sensitive, while the remaining is indifferent regarding the use of insect based protein as feed in trout production. For this sensitive segment, consumption would be expected to be reduced unless the price is reduced or other attributes such as convenience aspects are improved. Research limitations/implications The implication is that firms can substitute without a significant impact on the market demand given that the majority of consumers are indifferent regarding feed sources for trout production. As a result, it provides an innovative way to ensure sustainable use of resources and reduces the threat of fish meal trap while reducing pressure on the already over-exploited marine life. Originality/value The results provide first insights into the market impact of using insects in the animal protein value chain. It is important especially with Europe's recent lift of the ban on using insect-based protein in the animal food industry.","[Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl; Olsen, Soren Boye] Univ Copenhagen, Nat & Biovidenskabelige Fak, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Ankamah-Yeboah, I (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Nat & Biovidenskabelige Fak, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",iay@ifro.ku.dk,"Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/O-3944-2019; Olsen, Søren B/M-2949-2014; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/C-9354-2015","Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/0000-0003-4587-8311; Olsen, Søren B/0000-0002-1278-3749; Jacobsen, Jette Bredahl/0000-0002-1313-6228","Green Growth and Development program (GUDP) under the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries [34009-13-0677]","Green Growth and Development program (GUDP) under the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries","This paper is made as work under the RobustFish project.

We develop a theoretical framework and empirical research approach for understanding how cultural intelligence capabilities can be used to transform relational governance to improve social sustainability in an inter-firm exchange relationship. The analysis is based on cross-sectional base survey questionnaires on a sample of 239 senior managers from four manufacturer industries using partial least squares structural equation modelling approach. Sustainability performance framework is conceived on a foundation of the theoretical body of knowledge in the literature. This study contributes by identifying key cultural intelligence capabilities; management is more likely to work effectively with their cross-border supply chain partners. The dynamic capability theory helps explain how culturally intelligent individuals are able to dynamically adjust, protecting and adapt to the partner cultural in inter-organizational collaborations.

The purpose of this paper is to identify potential antecedents of farmers' willingness to participate in SFSCs. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a sample of Greek farmers the authors examined whether farmers' citizenship behaviour, the levels of their perceived competencies and the degree to which they feel accepted by their communities affect their willingness to engage in SFSCs. Findings Results indicate that producers' citizenship behaviour does indeed have a positive impact on willingness to participate in SFSCs, whereas their perceptions of the acceptance they enjoy within their communities also significantly predict this willingness. On the contrary, self-perceived lack of communication and collaboration competencies diminishes this willingness. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to explore the role of farmers' competencies in their willingness to participate in SFSCs.

Design/methodology/approach The juices were evaluated by rheological, physical, physicochemical, nutritional and sensory acceptance analyses. The mixture design is a widely used tool for product optimization, allowing the determination of factors, combinations and levels that provide best responses. Findings The results show that using mangaba pulp negatively contributed to juice acceptance, but resulted in the highest ascorbic acid content. The treatments produced using cagaita and marolo pulps presented a greater acceptance by consumers, and contributed to higher antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds content. The juice prepared with a mixture of equivalent quantities of the three fruits had the highest -carotene and lycopene contents. Practical implications This research has shown that different fruit combinations can improve sensory and nutritional characteristics, adding value to the final product. Social implications The processing of mixed juices could increase population access to the nutrients present in Brazilian Cerrado fruits, given that they are seasonal and perishable fruits. Originality/value In recent years, there has been an increase in the development of new food products based on Cerrado native fruits, however information on the chemical and nutritional characteristics, rheological behavior, and sensory attributes of the derivative products are still limited, resulting in a lack of scientific investments in this area. In addition, it is necessary to optimize the developed products to offer the consumer a unique product, combining the characteristics of two or more fruits, which adds value to the final product.","[Evangelista Vasconcelos Schiassi, Maria Cecilia; Teixeira Lago, Amanda Maria; de Souza, Vanessa Rios; Meles, Juliana dos Santos; de Resende, Jaime Vilela; Queiroz, Fabiana] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Schiassi, MCEV (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Food Sci, Lavras, Brazil.",vasconcelosmariaufla@gmail.com,"Schiassi, Maria Cecília/AAG-2634-2019; Lago, Amanda/AAF-3677-2019; de Resende, J.V./F-9494-2010","Schiassi, Maria Cecília/0000-0001-8704-5815; Lago, Amanda/0000-0001-5533-8330; de Resende, J.V./0000-0002-2823-7304; Queiroz, Fabiana/0000-0002-8958-5476","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brasilia, Brazil); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes, Brasilia, Brazil); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) [CAG - APQ-01848-14_522847 FAPEMIG]","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brasilia, Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes, Brasilia, Brazil)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG))","The authors thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq, Brasilia, Brazil) and the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (Capes, Brasilia, Brazil) by granting the scholarship and financial support in the acquisition of equipment, and the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) by financial support for this research (CAG - APQ-01848-14_522847 FAPEMIG).",,41,12,12,3,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

No studies have been conducted in this regard, leaving a gap that needs to be filled. The study, presented below, is the first attempt to determine whether it is possible to speak of farming land as a resource subject to the phenomenon of financialization. It was found that the phenomenon of financialization in agriculture through purchase of farming land does exist. It is not possible to determine the exact scale of this phenomenon; however, it is noticeable that purchase of farming land was observed in the recent years. One of the factors that encourage investment in farming land over the long-term perspective is undoubtedly the constant - so far - tendency of increase in land prices. If the investor decided to purchase farming land several years earlier, they may consider this investment satisfactory, when a need arises to release the funds. Land is a good factor, securing the funds invested against the effects of inflation. In addition, due to its rarity, the value of this resource increases over time. An additional factor that encourages investment in farming land is the scale of aid from the European Union, connected with ownership (or at least lease) of land. This is probably an argument, which increases the real value of profit (return) on investment in farming land. In this situation, it seems that the phenomenon of financialization of economy is also taking place in agribusiness due to purchase of farming land for investment purposes.","[Franc-Dabrowska, Justyna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Franc-Dabrowska, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",justyna_franc_dabrowska@sggw.pl,"Franc-Dabrowska, Justyna/AAF-6904-2020","Franc-Dabrowska, Justyna/0000-0002-5881-0343",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,102,110,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.124,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500012,0

Identification and integrative business process building is a highly complex and responsible business management task of any organization, regardless of its size, structure or activity. In order for an organization to achieve a competitive advantage, all its functions must be interconnected or integrated. Business Process Management adds value to the organization's resources and creates a variety of goods and services that meet the diverse needs and customer requirements. From the perspective of the process, business process management is considered as a management approach to good practice that is applied to help organizations achieve and maintain competitive advantages. The purpose of this research is to analyze, synthesize and examine key business process concepts, business process management and its effects on organizational performance. At the same time, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the areas of competitive advantage and business process management. These processes lead to better organizational efficiency, greater penetration into the market and higher employability, which is one of the main preconditions for regional development. The paper uses appropriate scientific methods suitable for the analysis and processing of secondary data, some of which are in contexts, can also take on the primary character. The analysis also used data from the latest BPTrends report released in early 2018.

The second part reveals the level of farmers' income in 2014 and its differences, which were found out based on a survey done in a group of 573 Polish farmers. The income was computed in accordance with the profit and loss account used in the FADN system. The Gini coefficient was applied to find out the level of income inequality. It was concluded that the CAP instruments play an active role in supporting the level of income and eliminating income differences among farmers, which was proved by calculating the Gini coefficient. Without the CAP support instruments, it amounted to 0.745, and after applying them - 0.689. The share of support in the income accounted for 41.6 %.

Design/methodology/approach Using cluster analysis, the importance of food quality benefits (quality, taste and health) and prestige benefits (prestige quality, hedonic, uniqueness, price and social) were investigated. The consumer segments were profiled using individual consumer characteristics (involvement in luxury, willingness to pay and socio-demographics). Findings Food quality benefits are the most important benefits when buying food for a party with friends and the authors identified four distinct consumer segments based on 20 different food quality and prestige benefits: perfectionists, premium, luxury seeking and value focussed. Three of the four consumer segments (perfectionists, premium and luxury seeking) find conventional food quality benefits important but differ in the importance they attribute to the different prestige benefits. The value focussed segment is not driven by prestige consumption but wants high quality at an affordable price. Research limitations/implications This study demonstrates that consumers are driven by different food and prestige benefits when buying food for a special occasion. Originality/value This study suggest some important differences between premium consumers, looking for food quality and hedonic benefits, and luxury seeking, with a relatively higher focus on prestige quality, uniqueness and social benefits. This study also identifies a significant distinction between perfectionists and value focussed consumers.

Tamr (dried dates) is commonly consumed in various parts of the world and is believed to represent a vital component of the diet in the Arab world. Tamr and honey characterize with high nutritional and healthful benefits. The purpose of this paper is to manufacture functional fermented dairy food (Rayeb milk) which has the nutritional and health effects of goat's milk, Tamr, honey and probiotic. Design/methodology/approach - Rayeb milk was made from goat's milk fortified with Tamr (10 and 15 percent) with or without honey (1, 2, and 3 percent) using ABT culture (S. thermophiles, L. acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium). Samples of Rayeb milk were studied for their chemical composition, starter bacteria populations, and sensory attributes during 14 days of storage period. Findings - Supplementation of goat's milk with Tamr and honey decreased saturated fatty acids concentrations in Rayeb milk. The levels of carbohydrate, total solids, dietary fiber, ash, total protein (TP), unsaturated fatty acids, omega-3, omega-6, omega-9 fatty acids and antioxidants activity were higher in Rayeb milk contained Tamr and honey than those of control. Also, numbers of probiotic bacteria (L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium) greatly increased in Rayeb milk supplemented with Tamr and honey. The recommended level of 107 cfu.g(-1) of bifidobacteria as a probiotic was exceeded for these treatments. Adding Tamr and honey highly improved the sensory attributes of Rayeb milk. Originality/value - Adding 10 percent Tamr with 3 percent honey or 15 percent Tamr with 1 or 2 percent honey to goat's milk highly improved the nutritional, healthy and sensory properties of Rayeb milk.","[Ismail, Magdy] Anim Prod Res Inst, Dept Dairy Technol, Agr Res Ctr, Giza, Egypt; [Hamad, Mohamed] Damietta Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Dairy, Dumyat, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Agricultural Research Center - Egypt; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Damietta University,"Ismail, M (通讯作者)，Anim Prod Res Inst, Dept Dairy Technol, Agr Res Ctr, Giza, Egypt.",abo-omar98@hotmail.com,"Ismail, Magdy/F-3507-2016; Hamad, Mohamed Nour-Eldin Farid/AAJ-6634-2020","Ismail, Magdy/0000-0003-2165-8752; Hamad, Mohamed Nour-Eldin Farid/0000-0003-4423-0396",,,,,50,6,6,0,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The authors operationalized organizational trust by assessing the perception of trustworthiness and competence that farmers have in FB managers. The authors conducted a regression analysis of the data to answer the research questions. Findings The findings support a nuanced role of trust for performance measures of FBs. Trust matters but in limited and specific contexts. Specifically, trust does not correlate with the marketing volume of Chinese FBs and only weakly correlates with FB compliance of production standards.

The aim of the paper is to examine the efficiency of conducting fiscal rules for 28 European Union countries considering the Maastricht criteria as a prerequisite convergence rule. For that purpose the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used as a mathematical programming method for estimating the relative efficiency of countries given multiple criteria: large deviations from the Maastricht (fiscal) criteria are considered undesirable, while greater GDP growth, revenue in GDP and employment rate are desirable characteristics in terms of chosen macroeconomic indicators. DEA reveals countries that were relatively efficient or inefficient during 2000-2016, how they changed their efficiency over time and variables that can be recognized as the key strength or weakness of a country.","[Kordic, Gordana; Zaja, Maja Mihelja; Gardijan, Margareta] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Kordic, G (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",gkordic@net.efzg.hr; mmiheljaz@net.efzg.hr; mgardijan@net.efzg.hr,"Kordić, Gordana/T-9764-2019; Zaja, Maja Mihelja/H-7872-2018; Kordic, Gordana/AAX-1526-2021; Kedžo, Margareta Gardijan/U-4279-2018","Kordić, Gordana/0000-0002-1914-2784; Zaja, Maja Mihelja/0000-0003-1111-3345; Kedžo, Margareta Gardijan/0000-0001-5390-057X",,,,,22,4,4,0,11,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1014,1022,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900107,0

Their economic value is difficult to estimate. Estimating the economic value of the ecosystem services is important because it is necessary to make people realise the importance of the natural environment. The study attempts to present the pollination as an ecosystem service. The purpose of the study was to specify the market and non-market components of valuation of pollination as well as estimating the economic value of the service for the main crops in Poland. Pollination of open-pollinated plants is necessary for their reproduction. In Poland, the plant species pollinated by insects account for approx. 78 % open-pollinated plant species. They include many arable crops. The most important Polish entomophilious arable crops include the fruit plants, rape, colza, shrubs and permanent pasture, buckwheat and vegetables: tomatoes and cucumbers. The value of pollination of the plants in Poland estimated by means of the method of the value of production generated thanks to pollination increased from EUR 625 million in 2005 to EUR 1195 million in 2016. The growth resulted both from the growth of the area of the crops and the growth in the prices of buying-in prices of most of the entomophilious plants. In the structure of the value of pollination, prevailed fruit plants, accounting for 55 % of the value of pollination on average of the total plants under review in 2005-2016. The value of pollination of rape and colza amounted to 21 % on average; of fruit shrubs and permanent crops: 14.5 %; tomatoes and ground cucumbers: 7.5 %, and buckwheat: over 2 %. The method of estimating the pollination value of open-pollinated plants should be developed, in particular those related to the economic value of wild plants. In particular, the foregoing follows from the need of compensation for the ecosystem services performed, e.g. by honey bees of the apicultural farms, and also imposition and enforcement of fines if the natural environment is destroyed.","[Majewski, Janusz] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Agr Econ & Int Econ Relat, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Majewski, J (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Agr Econ & Int Econ Relat, Warsaw, Poland.",Janusz_Majewski@sggw.pl,"Majewski, Janusz/B-6133-2014","Majewski, Janusz/0000-0002-2221-462X",,,,,25,0,0,7,47,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,41,47,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.116,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500004,0

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate food allergy knowledge, attitudes and resources among restaurant employees, and identify differences based on restaurant mode of operation. Design/methodology/approach A total of 209 food-service workers were surveyed in full-service restaurants across Southern Ontario, Canada. A paper-based questionnaire was used to evaluate participants' food allergy knowledge, attitudes toward handling food allergy requests and emergencies, and the availability of food allergen resources at the restaurant. Findings Most participants were knowledgeable about food allergies, and valued being able to provide safe meals. However, there was a general lack of access to important food allergy risk management resources and training. Food allergy attitudes were significantly different between restaurant modes of operation. Also, food allergy training and resources were positively correlated with employee attitudes toward food allergies. Practical implications The results of this study show that engaging employees in food allergy training can contribute to greater levels in employee awareness and confidence in protecting health and safety of restaurant patrons with food allergies.

Humanistic management - a relatively new trend in organizational studies was initiated, among others by Polish British scholar Monika Kostera, at the beginning of this century. This trend postulates the use, both in theory and practice of management, of the paradigm of the humanities, including historical ones. It also advocates reaching for local organizing traditions. According to this approach, this text presents the possibilities of using organizational history to enrich contemporary management thinking based on good practices from the past. The authors of the text formulate the thesis that the idea of city-gardens, and especially the management practices resulting from it, were the antecedents of the prosumer movement ideology of our time. The article justifies this thesis by critically analyzing the implementation of the idea of city-gardens on examples from the areas of Warsaw and the surrounding area from the first half of the twentieth century. It shows the specificity of urban investments using the idea of Ebenezer Howard, implemented in peripheral areas in relation to the center of globalization. An example of such areas in this article are central Poland. This approach shows the possibilities of developing prosumer culture also based on local traditions. According to the authors, a reminder of good practices related to the implementation of the idea of city-gardens may be an intellectual bridge between humanistic management and the prosumer movement today.","[Ochinowski, Tomasz] Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Warsaw, Poland; [Rosinska-Wielec, Edyta] Org Hist, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Ochinowski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Management, Acad Subunit Org Sociol & Business Hist, Warsaw, Poland.",ochinto@o2.pl; edyta.rosinska@roswil.pl,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,500,507,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700055,0

Design/methodology/approach This viewpoint presents a conceptual analysis of public dismissal of nutrition science, drawing together perspectives on the relationships between science and society from the history, sociology and philosophy of science. Findings The origin of trust amongst scientists relies is actively tied to their social and moral status and science as a cultural activity is inextricably linked to institutions of power. Accordingly, trust in science relies heavily on public perceptions of those institutions, the ways in which citizens feel represented by them, and to what extent citizens consider these institutions to be held accountable. Ignoring this origin leads to expectations of science and scientists they cannot live up to and inevitable disappointment in those holding such expectations. Social implications Managing responsible expectations asks that we first dismiss dominant portrayals of science as pure, neutral, value-free and fuelled by curiosity. Second, we should pursue a reorganisation of science, favouring social inclusiveness over scientific exceptionalism. Originality/value Post-truth dynamics are a source of concern in the dissemination of nutrition science. Rather than dismissing it as a consequence of public ignorance, a comprehensive engagement with post-truth arguments allows a constructive repositioning of nutrition science organisation and communication. It asks that we design research programmes and studies differently, incorporate different voices. Above all else, it asks humility of researchers and tolerant approaches to other perspectives.","[Penders, Bart] Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Eth & Soc, Care & Publ Hlth Res Inst, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC),"Penders, B (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Hlth Eth & Soc, Care & Publ Hlth Res Inst, Maastricht, Netherlands.",b.penders@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"Penders, Bart/B-8637-2008","Penders, Bart/0000-0002-2661-9181",,,,,74,12,12,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In Latvia, the fisheries industry is related to a rational and sustainable use of living natural resources in its economic zone, territorial waters and internal waters. Therefore, research aim is to examine the key characteristics of the fishing industry in Latvia. To achieve the aim, the following specific research tasks are defined: 1) to examine the characteristics of the fishing fleets of EU Member States; 2) to analyse total catch volumes and the performance of top 10 fishing enterprises in Latvia. The present research analysed the fishing fleets of EU Member States, which are affected by fleet capacity management measures, catch quotas for Latvia, catch volumes in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga in the period 2014-2017 as well as the key performance indicators of the top 10 fishing enterprises of Latvia. The research has discovered that the fishing enterprises of Latvia are affected by catch quotas for the key fish species that were reduced on average by 1-57 % during the period 2014-2017.

Adaptations of quality standards are driven by international competition, new production technologies or environmental change. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the modifications affecting European Union (EU) Protected Designation of Origin-Protected Geographical Indication. It specifically compares the share of amendments in diverse product class, years and countries, illustrates specific cases and identifies the factors explaining the probability to amend product specifications. Design/methodology/approach - Official documents of the DOOR Database provide the material for an analysis of changes in product specifications. They also supply the data for four illustrative cheese cases and a logistic regression of all EU amendments. Findings - Amendments of GI product specifications are very frequent: 17 per cent of all 1,276 EU GIs had at least one amendment. This happens in particular for processed products (42 per cent more often than for unprocessed ones) and specific countries (GIs in Italy are six times, Spain five times and France four times more likely to have an amendment compared to GIs from other EU countries). As illustrated by contrasting cheese amendments, the diverse modifications in the product specifications range from more flexibility and innovation on the one hand to stricter rules for strengthening the product's identity on the other hand. Originality/value - For EU and national authorities, GI producers and scholars, this first systematic EU-wide analysis of amendments demonstrates that protected food GIs have to be conceptualised as evolving institutions and not as statically protected food production systems.","[Quinones-Ruiz, Xiomara Fernanda; Forster, Hanna; Penker, Marianne; Broscha, Kristina; Braito, Michael; Altenbuchner, Christine] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Belletti, Giovanni; Marescotti, Andrea] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Florence, Italy; [Scaramuzzi, Silvia] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food & Forestry Syst, Florence, Italy","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Florence; University of Florence","Quiñones-Ruiz, XF (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Vienna, Austria.",xiomara.fernanda.quinones-ruiz@boku.ac.at,"Penker, Marianne/IVV-5492-2023; Belletti, Giovanni/L-6807-2015; Pineda, Diana/K-6241-2012","Penker, Marianne/0000-0002-5185-9558; Belletti, Giovanni/0000-0002-0347-4274; Altenbuchner, Christine/0000-0002-3676-9474; Edelmann, Hanna/0000-0001-5489-8678; Quinones Ruiz, Xiomara Fernanda/0000-0001-7700-4008; SCARAMUZZI, SILVIA/0000-0002-9986-6175","Oesterreichische Nationalbank (Austrian Central Bank, Anniversary Fund) [17043]","Oesterreichische Nationalbank (Austrian Central Bank, Anniversary Fund)","This project is supported by funds of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (Austrian Central Bank, Anniversary Fund, Project Number: 17043).

Also, uneven-aged forestry may be especially attractive for non-industrial private forest owners, as it provides more regular revenues and, by taking advantage of natural regeneration, reduce installation costs. Knowledge on alternative regimes to even-aged forestry is therefore in high demand. We first add to the literature by proposing a new maritime pine forest growth model that can be readily used in optimization studies. Second, we are the first to analyze optimal uneven aged forest management for this species. Highlighting the contribution of this study, a comparison of our results with currently suggested silvicultural management scenarios is provided. We show that the economic profitability of this species significantly increases under optimal forest management and may thus present a viable alternative to rotation forests. In particular, we show that optimal forest management may entail harvesting cycles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In a nutshell, generation Z is a new generation and its members were generally born after the middle of the last decade. (Google, 2017, 13). Based on their behavioural features relating to the new tools of digital technology, this generation is usually called the first digital generation (Google, 2017, 11). The Z generation uses the internet as daily platform for communication, social interactions and even for shopping. This generation is open to receive almost everything through internet, however, they need interactive communication and require fast responses in this digital environment. The smart phone is their most valuable tool to step into the virtual community. They use platforms that were not even known ten years ago. They tend to express their feelings, emotions and thoughts in a very fast way using apps. These apps influence their behaviour and may lead to new changes in their attitude to the education system and later on, even the work they want to pursue. The labour market will have to face up to new challenges and demands of this generation regarding flexibility and digital work environment. They also might wish to follow their dreams in their work. This paper does summarize the main attributes of generation Z and identify the possible challenges that their involvement may trigger in the labour market (Tulgan, 2013, 25). The paper is based on literature survey as research method. The main research questions of this article will be focused on the causes and effects of the behavioural features of Generation Z members.

This method, called try-it-yourself, is the most prevalent method where universal design in taught in the Nordic region. While the exercise is often praised for ensuring an effective 'eye-opening' outcome, the ethical aspects, the absence of the users themselves or the possibilities of alternative methods for teaching user needs appear to be non-existing. The article is based on literature studies and 1:1 experience gained from our Master program in universal design, where the try-it-yourself exercise is analyzed and discussed. The article argues that the exercise, as opposed to its original intention, appears to increase disability stigma and ethical dilemmas. Hence, it needs to be challenged as the prevalent exercise used for teaching universal design and accessibility. The article also discusses alternative methods for teaching user needs. Furthermore, the article discusses the tacit cultural acceptance of the exercise, as well as the ethical dilemmas in the non-existing debate of what is actually being tried-yourself in the exercise. The article also presents possible reasons for the significant absence of an open critical debate about the pros and cons of the exercise, as it is being used non-critically in the Nordic region.","[Ryhl, Camilla] Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Ryhl, C (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Danish Bldg Res Inst, Copenhagen, Denmark.",car@sbi.aau.dk,"Ryhl, Camilla/AAR-2663-2021","Ryhl, Camilla/0000-0003-2788-7927",,,,,11,4,4,0,9,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,572,578,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-572,0.0,,,7,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371417.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100054,0

The Accessible India Campaign comprises of the following key components:- (i) Create Mass Awareness;(ii) Capacity Building;(iii) Interventions (Technology solutions, Legal framework, Resource generation);(iv) Leverage corporate sector efforts including CSR resources;(v) Leadership endorsements [1] . In the key components stated above two major components are; 1. Mass Awareness and 2. Capacity Building. To achieve both these components, the need is to develop a knowledge base through which stakeholders associated with built environment development and creation can be brought at one platform and awareness towards universal accessibility can be created among the people at large. Thus this study is an attempt to identify the possibilities to make the Accessible India Campaign a success through Universal Design Education and to establish and validate the need of universal design in making the Accessible India Campaign a success.

An insight into history was made in order to discover the beginnings of wines in the space between the Carpathian Mountains, the Black Sea and the Danube. Studies have been carried out to show the current state of harvesting, grape processing and the level of wine production in Romania comparing with other countries successful in this wonderful field, both in Europe and other continents such as Australia or South America. I also presented the wine-growing areas of Romania, the country's great vineyards and some very tasty local wine varieties. Among the conclusions related to wine production are the following: Romania has a glorious past, a present disappointing by the drop of exports (especially due to the lack of coherent legislation in this respect), but the future seems promising if we will follow the examples of the countries who have succeeded in this field such as: France, Italy or Spain from Europe, Chile from South America or South Africa (Continent Africa).

The perception of Italian stakeholders,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Innovation; Tradition; Stakeholders' perception; Qualitative approach; Italian wine chain,INDUSTRY,"Purpose The wine market in Italy has been through several changes in the last decade. Actors in the supply chain need to find new strategies or tools in order to remain competitive in what has become a fiercely competitive sector. Innovation is one of the tools which have been successfully used in the New World wine market, hence innovation might also be a useful resource for actors in the Old World wine market, such as in Italy. The purpose of this paper is to explore stakeholders' perception of such innovation, including how its usefulness in the Italian wine production and distribution chain is perceived. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were carried out in Emilia-Romagna with a wide range of actors in the Italian wine chain and consumer focus groups and the resulting data were analyzed using the content-summarizing approach. Findings These stakeholders agreed that innovation is needed for production and processing as well as in quality control, but only on condition that it should maintain the quality and value of traditional wines. Innovative wine products tend to be unacceptable to consumers. Most stakeholders associate innovation with communication as producers and distributors seek innovative ways to convey information regarding the value of wines to final consumers. Research limitations/implications The findings are qualitative and based on a small group of Italian wine industry players and consumers who operate mainly in a domestic context. Practical implications The paper provides industrialists with information useful in the search to find the right strategies to make them more competitive in the Italian wine market. It is crucial to find and adopt innovative approaches toward communication throughout the chain. Information appealing to tradition and sentiment could be highly effective ways to reach the consumer. Originality/value This is the first in-depth study of the perceptions of all stakeholders (from producers to consumers) regarding innovation in the Italian wine chain; of particular importance as the industry is currently in transition toward globalization.","[Wongprawmas, Rungsaran; Spadoni, Roberta] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Wongprawmas, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, Bologna, Italy.",rungsaran.wongprawmas80@gmail.com; roberta.spadoni@unibo.it,,,,,,,51,10,11,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Those additional efforts can be rather expensive and time consuming. The aim of the paper is to inspect whether the use of different pictures could have an impact on response rates in web business surveysto be conducted using enterprises from Eastern Croatia as a sample. In order to observe the abovenamed issue, the web survey about the use of statistical methods in limited liability enterprises from five Eastern Croatian counties was conducted. Three different questionnaire versionswere developed: without, with positive and with negative pictures. The research results have shown that out of 3,861 Eastern Croatian enterprises that were contactedonly 125 or 3.2% enterprises opened and started providing answers to the survey questions. However, out of those 125 enterprises 68 or 54.4% enterprises completed the web questionnaire resulting in the overall response rate of 1.8%. If response rates are analysed with reference to pictures, it can be concluded that presence or absence of pictures does not have astatistically significant impact on the response rates. However, this conclusion was made on a rather small sample of enterprises. Therefore, such research should be repeated using a bigger sample and questionnaires including more pictures. What should also be investigated is the impact of different pictures on responses.","[Zmuk, Berislav] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Zmuk, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",bzmuk@efzg.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-9402],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been in part supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project STatistical Modelling for REspoNse to Crisis and Economic GrowTH in WeStern Balkan Countries - STRENGTHS (project no.

Water scarcity may therefore go beyond having important consequences for people, society and ecological systems but may also pose a threat to economic growth. Using the latest IPCC RCP projections and the OECD Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) for population growth and economic output, we develop a multi-regional input-output model to estimate future demand for water resources across different countries and sectors of the global economy. Model results show that most countries will experience declining water availability, particularly those countries that experience a confluence of factors including low fresh water availability, high climate change impacts, and growing consumption patterns. We show that virtual water trade and improved water efficiency has potential to alleviate the worst effects of water scarcity for wealthy countries but may have limited effect on poorer countries. The analysis concludes that the most important driver of future water scarcity is economic growth, which overwhelms any realistic savings that can be made from increased technological progress and improvements to water efficiency. Population growth and climate change are also shown to be important drivers of future water scarcity, particularly over the long-run. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the restrictions had devastating impacts on Britain's consumer durables industries, preventing firms from fully exploiting economies of scale, reducing output growth and international competitiveness, and eroding industrial relations.

In the context of multi-objective forest management, these frontiers, or the set of non-dominated solutions for a set of objectives at varying levels of output, provide quantitative measures of trade-offs between competing ecosystem services and changes in the best-possible management outcomes for different climate change scenarios. We used outputs from a forest growth-and-yield model that simulated wildfire and management to examine three types of Pareto frontier analyses: 1) carbon storage maximization under changing budgetary constraints with and without wildfire effects, 2) minimization of undesirable wildfire effects under changing budgetary constraints, and 3) minimization of undesirable wildfire effects at varying constrained carbon storage levels. We found that over 45 years climate change reduced the average amount of carbon stored, whether or not we simulated a wildfire on the 23,204 ha study area despite our best management efforts. Climate change also adversely affected the trade-off rate, or slope of the frontiers, between carbon storage and wildfire effects. We illustrate how the application of a methodology typically used in economics can reveal insights in forest ecosystem management otherwise hidden to decision-makers.

Scholars call for more research on the combined effects of these variables, to explain pro-environmental behavior. In this regard, this study presents a model of electric car adoption intention, in which personal values determine green self-identity, which in turn influences consumer intention to adopt electric cars directly and also indirectly via ethical motives of ecological care and moral obligation. Second, this work explores how personal values moderate the relationships between green self-identity, ecological care, moral obligation and electric car adoption intention. Data were collected through a survey in a sample of 2005 car drivers residing in Belgium, Denmark and Italy. Results confirm that four value domains (i.e., self-transcendence, self-enhancement, openness-to-change and conservation) influence green self-identity, which in turn determines consumer intention to adopt electric cars both directly and indirectly via ecological care and moral obligation motivations. Furthermore, consumers who find self-transcendent and openness-to-change values important tend to express their green self-identity directly into intentions and through moral obligation evaluations. Conversely, individuals who find self-enhancement values important express their green self-identity directly into intentions, while they take the ecological and moral considerations to behave green less into account. Finally, consumers who find conservation values important translate their green self-identity less into intentions to adopt electric cars, and tend to consider less the ecological and moral aspects of consumption choices.

Moreover, the promotion of SOC is increasingly advocated as a measure to sustain ably increase crop yields and reduce agricultural production risks. Applying an incentivized extra-laboratory experiment, we evaluate the factors and policy measures that affect the decision to promote SOC using a sample of German farmers. Our results reveal that farmers were highly motivated to promote SOC. Political fostering through subsidy payments increased farmers' efforts to build SOC. Efforts remained constant if economically equal payments were designated as certificates rather than subsidies. Surprisingly, certificates with uncertain payments increased farmers' efforts to enhance SOC to a similar degree as subsidy and certificate scenarios, which provided fixed and therefore certain payments. Thus, these results contribute valuable information regarding the effectiveness of market-based policy measures which aim to include farmers in climate protection strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Labour productivity, mine dynamics, and rationalization in interwar Ruhr coal mining",ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,OWNERSHIP; CORPORATION,"Throughout the late 1920s, German coal mining saw an exceptional surge in labour productivity, led by the performance of the Ruhr coal mines. It is commonly accepted in the relevant literature that the economy-wide 'rationalization boom' explains that pattern. This study tests the related hypothesis that 'negative rationalization', in the form of a massive wave of mine closures over the period 1924-9, played a significant role in stimulating aggregate labour productivity in the Ruhr coal district. Using an original dataset for the totality of Ruhr coal mines, the causes of productivity change over the broader period 1913-38 are identified, using the decomposition method of Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan. Results suggest that labour productivity was driven largely by improvements at individual mines, attributable to the intensified mechanization of underground operations. In sharp contrast, turnover effects were marginal, overall, compared to the effects stemming from the producer dynamics among surviving mines. Thus, the practical productivity implications ofmine closures during the rationalization boom are negligible and overrated in the literature. These findings indicate the necessity of testing the relative importance of 'negative rationalization' in the form of plant closures in other branches of the Weimar economy.","[Jopp, Tobias A.] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Jopp, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,39,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

We use a database compiling certain attributes of the houses that exchanged hands and their price. In order to understand the complex relationships that can exist between explanatory variables and housing price, we consider not only the direct effects of air pollution and noise on the price of around 3000 houses sold in Nantes and its metropolitan area from 2002 to 2008, but also the way some location attributes of the dwellings may affect air pollution and noise. We demonstrate that even if air pollution may be affected by some location characteristics of the house, this variable has no significant impact on the price, in the end. Noise is affected by the location of the house and exerts some significant effect on housing price. However, whilst air pollution does not impact at a global level, people who have lived in an air polluted county before coming to Nantes are sensitive to air quality, whereas those who come from a low air polluted county tend to choose low noise exposure dwellings.

Moreover, the paper pays special attention to the role played by public funding for research and innovation. The empirical results suggest that there are significant spillovers to productivity from public sector R&D spending on research agencies and higher education. No evidence is found for productivity spillovers from indirect public funding for the business enterprise sector, civil sector or defence R&D.

Due to macroeconomic feedback mechanisms, this methodology - besides induced intermediate demand - also quantifies: (i) private consumption induced in the other household groups, (ii) impacts on other endogenous final demand components, and (iii) negative feedback effects due to output price effects of household demand. The carbon footprint is calculated separately for the consumption vector of each of the five income groups. The simulation results yield a non-linear income elasticity of direct and indirect emissions at each income level: the value of the direct footprint income elasticity decreases from 1.32 (first quintile) to 0.69 (fourth quintile). The value of the indirect footprint income elasticity is always below unity and decreases from 0.89 to 0.62. The results in general reveal a relative decoupling effect: the share of the top income group in income (45%) is much larger than its share in the carbon footprint (37%) and vice versa for the bottom income group (6% in income and 8% in footprint).

By the end of the war outstanding balances were equivalent to 60 per cent of British net receipts under Lend-Lease. Of the total sterling balances, about a third was accumulated by India. This article seeks to evaluate the costs incurred by India in the reduction of balances after the war. The accumulation of balances and their use to repatriate India's sterling debt is described. British efforts to convince India to accept a partial cancellation of the balances are analysed, singling out the crucial role of Keynes. The negotiations after independence are detailed, including releases, transfers to Pakistan, settlement of pensions, purchase of military stores, and gold sales. The possible contribution of British divestment to reduce outstanding balances is assessed. The Indian case is compared with those of other holders, such as Portugal, Brazil, Argentina, and Egypt. The links between the accumulation of sterling balances and inflation are considered. In the end there was a significant reduction in the purchasing power of sterling balances, but not for the reasons anticipated by London.","[Abreu, Marcelo de Paiva] Pontif Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",,"Abreu, MD (通讯作者)，Pontif Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,"Abreu, Marcelo/0000-0002-9693-7134","CNPq, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development [306910/2014-4]","CNPq, National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","The author is grateful for comments and/or help from A.

Although direct evidence about interest rates is scattered and anecdotal, there is much more surviving information about exchange rates. Since both contemporaries and historians have suggested that exchange and rechange transactions could be used to disguise the charging of interest in order to circumvent the usury prohibition, it should be possible to back out implied interest rates from exchange rates. The analysis presented in this article is based on a new dataset of medieval exchange rates collected from commercial correspondence in the archive of Francesco di Marco Datini of Prato, c. 1383-1411. It demonstrates that the time value of money was consistently incorporated into market exchange rates. Moreover, these implicit interest rates are broadly comparable to those received from other types of commercial loan and investment. Although on average profitable, the return on any individual exchange and rechange transaction did involve a degree of uncertainty that may have justified their non-usurious nature. However, there were also practical reasons why medieval merchants may have used foreign exchange transactions as a means of extending credit.","[Bell, Adrian R.; Brooks, Chris; Moore, Tony K.] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Bell, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, ICMA Ctr, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England.",,"Brooks, Chris/ABF-4040-2021; Brooks, Chris/C-9033-2016","Bell, Adrian/0000-0003-4531-0072; Brooks, Chris/0000-0002-2668-1153",Leverhulme Trust [RPG-193],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),We would like to thank Francesco Bettarini and Helen Bradley for their assistance in collecting the exchange rate data.

The challenge then lies in sustaining cooperative mitigation against the temptation to free-ride on others' contributions, which can undermine public endeavours. When all possible future scenarios entail costs, however, the rationale for contributing to a public good changes from altruistic sacrifice of personal profit to necessary investment in minimizing personal debt. Here we demonstrate analytically how an economic framework of costly adaptation to climate change can sustain cooperative mitigation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We develop game-theoretic scenarios from existing examples of insurance for adaptation to natural hazards exacerbated by climate-change that bring the debt burden from future climate events into the present. We model the as-yet untried potential for leveraging public contributions to mitigation from personal costs of adaptation insurance, by discounting the insurance premium in proportion to progress towards a mitigation target We show that collective mitigation targets are feasible for individuals as well as nations, provided that the premium for adaptation insurance in the event of no mitigation is at least four times larger than the mitigation target per player. This prediction is robust to players having unequal vulnerabilities, wealth, and abilities to pay. We enumerate the effects of these inequalities on payoffs to players under various sub-optimal conditions. We conclude that progress in mitigation is hindered by its current association with a social dilemma, which disappears upon confronting the bleak consequences of inaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using the business letter books of Daniel Eccleston of Lancaster, covering January 1780 to December 1781, the article shows how he used trust-building activities and developed open networks in Britain and the West Indies in order to build, sustain, maintain, and diversify his commercial activities to reduce risk and develop new opportunities. Eccleston's letters illustrate a competitive market in which entrepreneurs helped drive the industrial revolution through stimulating demand and encouraging trade. They show that mutual trust was the foundation of strong networks, and that networks were significant in underpinning entrepreneurial success through allowing the mitigation of business risk and offering the opportunity for diversification supported by the network.

Despite the need for objectively comparable monetary standards to include biodiversity arguments in policymaking, research on the relationship between species diversity and its valuation from a societal perspective is still scarce. In this paper, a methodological framework for the valuation of natural predators based on their ecological role in the agroecosystem is introduced. The framework integrates a dynamic ecological model simulating interactions between species with an economic model, thereby quantifying the effect of reduced numbers of natural predators on the net farm income. The model attributes an objective monetary value to increased species diversity through the changes in the provisioning of a marketable good. Results indicate that the loss of three predators could decrease net farm income with 88.86 sic ha(-1) to 2186.5 sic ha(-1). For the pear production sector in Flanders in 2011, this constitutes to an indirect use value of 0,68 million for one predator and 16.63 million for the presence of three predators. The aim is to provide a justification for the argument for biodiversity conservation, based on the ecological function of species, through the delivery of comparable monetary standards.

Generally, with an increase in income, households tend to consume more food items that are high-value, enriched foods and protein, such as meat and fish, by substituting for cereals. However, consumers also substitute when it comes to grain quality. For example, cereals, such as rice, are available in a range of qualities from the ordinary type (coarse-grain) to the premium type (fine grain). The authors postulate that as household incomes increase, households may consume more premium-type rice (or fine-grain rice), while overall consuming less rice or fewer carbohydrates. Design/methodology/approach - Using the Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000, 2005, and 2010, and applying multivariate probit and seemingly unrelated regression estimation procedures, this study quantifies the impact of income, household demographics, and urbanization on rice consumption by rice grain types (coarse-grain, medium-grain, and fine-grain types). Findings - The results show that urban, wealthy households and, households headed by educated heads and spouses, are more likely to consume fine-grain rice than their counterparts. Originality/value - After yield, grain type is the second most important factor for farmers when considering the adoption of a new variety. The price of rice and other cereals is highly associated with the grain type. This study concludes that plant breeding programs of major cereals, such as rice and wheat, should take into account the consumer grain-type preferences when developing new varieties.","[Abdul Mottaleb, Khondoker; Bahadur Rahut, Dil] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Mesa, AZ USA",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Arizona State University,"Mottaleb, KA (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Texcoco, Mexico.",k.mottaleb@cgiar.org,"Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/AAD-8370-2022; Mottaleb, Khondoker A./I-1103-2019","Rahut, Dil Bahadur Bahadur/0000-0002-7505-5271; Mottaleb, Khondoker A./0000-0002-2666-1152",,,,,40,15,17,2,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

From a first analysis, it transpires that sustainable tourism can be interpreted in different ways depending on the stakeholder perspective, and these ways can generate conflicting definitions. In any case, it is widely accepted that sustainable tourism derives from the sustainable development concept which has started to spread in the 1980s, even before tourism policies had been seriously taken into consideration at European and international level. However, since 1995 the concept of sustainable tourism has inspired the adoption of a considerable number of recommendations, communications, set of indicators and criteria which have been developed at a European and International level. Despite the worldwide interest and awareness on sustainable tourism, concrete progress has been weak due to the inability to transform policies into action. Indeed, sustainable tourism remains a relatively niche sector of the market, and it is not yet been included in some destinations planning and management, especially in some developing countries. In order to maximize the benefits of applying sustainable principles and criteria in tourism, the study looks at the need for key tourism stakeholders to apply a solid framework such as PM4SD in the daily management of projects related to cultural sites, destinations, enterprises and locally centred initiatives. In order to highlight the benefits of PM4SD, the CoLeadTourism Project, where the methodology has been applied, is looked into.","[Cardia, Giusy; Jones, Andrew] Univ Malta, Msida, Malta",University of Malta,"Cardia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Malta, Msida, Malta.",giuseppina.cardia@um.edu.mt,"Jones, Andy/ABB-9742-2021","Jones, Andy/0000-0002-3130-9313",Co-Operating for Leadership in Tourism under ERASMUS + Programme,Co-Operating for Leadership in Tourism under ERASMUS + Programme,This work was supported by the Co-Operating for Leadership in Tourism under ERASMUS + Programme.,,47,2,2,1,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-47732-9; 978-3-319-47731-2,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,275,292,,10.1007/978-3-319-47732-9_19,0.0,,,18,"Business; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI3AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410645700018,0

The goal of each company, as well as the economy, should be the creation of competitive advantage, and gaining of unique market position.

This paper will provide an overview of heritage, and an overview of development and economic situation over the last hundred years. At the beginning of the industrial revolution began also development of the economy in Croatia, which had previously been oriented as agricultural and rural country. Historical trends and events have a major impact on the orientation and direction of today's development. Respectively, new trends are a sort of continuation of the historical heritage, but for competitiveness, country needs to turn to new industries, knowledge and markets.

The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative evidence documenting the position of farmers and to explain variation in farm gate prices in the dairy supply chain by using unique micro-survey data from Poland. Design/methodology/approach - The bargaining power of farmers is elicited from their self-reported assessment about how confident they feel in their relationships with both the processing industry and input suppliers. Findings - Using econometric modelling, it is shown that farmers who perceive themselves as having a relatively strong position in the food chain receive a higher milk price from dairy companies. Research limitations/implications - While this result comes with some caveats, it suggests that the self-reported beliefs farmers hold about relations with their contractors may reveal additional insights into the distribution of power throughout the food chain. Originality/value - Compared to the existing studies, the paper offers two innovations. First, to construct a proxy for farmers' bargaining power, their subjective opinion on how easy they could be substituted for by their contractors is used. In effect, the paper goes beyond the standard measures which focus on farm size or its location. Second, it investigates farmers' relationships vis-a-vis both processing industry and input suppliers. Consequently, this paper is the first to analyze power relationships by explicitly taking into account three stages of the supply chain.","[Falkowski, Jan] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Malak-Rawlikowska, Agata] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Milczarek-Andrzejewska, Dominika] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Rural & Agr Dev, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Rural & Agricultural Development PAS,"Falkowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",jfalkowski@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Milczarek-Andrzejewska, Dominika/J-4878-2019; Fałkowski, Jan/ABE-9726-2020; MALAK-RAWLIKOWSKA, AGATA/G-7117-2019","Milczarek-Andrzejewska, Dominika/0000-0002-9624-1591; Fałkowski, Jan/0000-0001-6921-6342; MALAK-RAWLIKOWSKA, AGATA/0000-0002-1484-0989","Seventh EU Framework Programme project titled COMPETE (International comparisons of product supply chains in the agri-food sectors: determinants of their competitiveness and performance on EU and international markets); Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Republic of Poland","Seventh EU Framework Programme project titled COMPETE (International comparisons of product supply chains in the agri-food sectors: determinants of their competitiveness and performance on EU and international markets); Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Republic of Poland(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","The research was conducted within the Seventh EU Framework Programme project titled COMPETE (International comparisons of product supply chains in the agri-food sectors: determinants of their competitiveness and performance on EU and international markets) and co-financed by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Republic of Poland.

Apple fruits are often treated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a structural analogue of ethylene that blocks the action of ethylene by binding ethylene receptors, to prolong the shelf life. The current study aims to translate the concepts behind the inhibition mechanism of 1-MCP into a kinetic model. Ethylene was assumed to regulate quality changes by binding its receptors and triggering a cascade of reactions that results in the production of ethylene response factors (ERF). The ERFs activate the expression of genes encoding quality-degrading enzymes, such as polygalacturonase 1 and chlorophyllase 1, leading to the synthesis of enzymes that break down cell-wall pectin and chlorophyll. A differential equation model was developed. Moreover, the effect of the climacteric state of the fruit, representing a transition from system I to system II ethylene production, was incorporated in the model. Two important apple quality indicators, firmness and background colour, were considered. To calibrate the model, 'Jonagold' apples were harvested at different maturities. Fruit were cooled immediately after harvest. Some of the fruit were stored directly under controlled atmosphere (CA), while others were treated with 1-MCP immediately after cooling to 1 degrees C. The fruit were stored under CA for 6 months at 1 degrees C, followed by exposure to shelf-life for 7 weeks at 18 degrees C. The ethylene production, skin background colour and firmness were measured weekly throughout shelf life. The model could explain more than 96% of the total variation in the evolution of ethylene production, firmness and skin background colour.","[Gwanpua, S. G.; Hertog, M. L. A. T. M.; Nicolai, B.

One of its significant elements nowadays are modern warehouse facilities. They are used both to perform logistics functions and also for manufacturing activities to a larger and larger extent. Over the last several decades, a significant increase in the modern, commercial warehouse space market resources has been seen in Europe and beyond. It applies also to Poland which, similarly to many Central and Eastern European countries, was characterized by significant backwardness in this respect, due to historical and geopolitical reasons. The dynamic development of this market in Poland began in the early years of this century, and gained specific momentum after Poland's accession to the EU in 2004. Currently, the modern, commercial warehouse and industrial space resources are more than 11.2 million m(2). In the next decade it is forecasted that this space will double due to the needs of tenants from various sectors, including in particular e-commerce. Therefore, the main objective of the article is to show the experience gained from the development of the modern, commercial warehouse space market in Poland. This development and its effects, also in regional terms, are discussed from the quantitative and qualitative viewpoint. Research of literature, analysis of statistical data, analysis of reports and information published by agencies and consultants operating in the real estate market and by warehouse developers were conducted to accomplish the main objective of the article. The performed analysis has made it possible to discuss, inter alia, changes in the size of the warehouse space market resources in Poland and its regions. The number of warehouse space developers and their share in the market resources has been indicated in respect of the supply. Regularities related to the share of individual sectors in the volume of market transactions have been outlined in respect of the demand. From the qualitative perspective, the analysis has made it possible to outline factors which have influenced the existing development of the Polish warehouse market and those that will set its direction in the future. The analysis reveals also universal regularities that may serve as examples for other countries.","[Miklinska, Joanna] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Miklinska, J (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland.",j.miklinska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Miklinska, Joanna/R-3338-2018","Miklinska, Joanna/0000-0003-1450-9273",,,,,23,2,2,1,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,888,898,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500086,0

Today's crab populations suffer from habitat degradation, disease, and increasing fishing pressure. Crabs are sold alive on local and regional markets, or traded as processed meat and the market chains typically involve intermediaries (i.e. traders). The present study examined the relationship between crab harvesters and the intermediaries, and the socio-ecological implications thereof. The research was performed between September 2013 and October 2014 in the Mamanguape River estuary, northeastern Brazil. Socioeconomic information and data regarding the catch (sex and carapace width of the crabs), the processing of U. cordatus meat and the commercial relationship between harvesters and intermediaries were obtained through structured (questionnaires) and semi-structured interviews and direct observations. The crab harvesters exist under precarious socioeconomic conditions that place them at the edge of society and therefore often seek loans offered by the intermediaries, generating loyalty and dependence that guarantees the intermediaries a stable supply of crabs needed to supply an avid market. Within this relationship, the intermediaries create pressure on natural crab populations by stimulating non-selective captures, as they buy specimens below the legal size limit (6 cm wide carapace) for meat processing. During crab meat processing, the intermediaries themselves report that the meat is often mixed with cooked and shredded of other marine vertebrates, such as spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) and nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum), to increase the weight of the final product. As with the crab harvesters, the women involved in processing the crabmeat often accept loans, resulting in the same type of dependence and loyalty to the intermediaries. The intermediaries, with their strong influence on the crab harvesting, are directly linked to the commercial, social and ecological implications of these harvesting activities, together with the crab harvesters themselves. Hence, to ensure sustainability of the U. cordatus fishery and maintain (better improve) dependant livelihoods, all actors involved in the production chain of U. cordatus must be considered when developing management strategies, rather than the current approach of considering the crab harvesters only. We advise the development and implementation of fisheries associations to give the crab harvesters (and regulating bodies) greater control over and capital gains from their catches.

However, a question arises regarding the aspects of everyday life and the types of economic activities on which renewable energy could have an adverse as well as a positive impact. This papers aims to examine both the advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy within a tourist destination. An analysis is conducted to identify all positive, potential and/or anticipated negative effects of renewable energy within the existing social and economic structure of a tourist destination. On the side of advantages, there are direct (primary) positive effects that can be quantitatively assessed and expressed in value with relative certainty, such as increase in the production of goods and services as a result of building new RE facilities, and benefits from savings on transportation costs. It is harder, however, to quantify or express in value the indirect (secondary) benefits, which most often occur in the form of external economies (external positive effects). Many of these benefits cannot be measured or assessed in value, as for example the increase of local activities, growing competition, importance to national security, enjoying the environment and clean air as a result of reduced pollution, etc. Certain disadvantages such as the expensive production of equipment and materials, impact on the soil or inconsistency can also be hard to quantify. Hence, on both sides there are indirect effects that cannot be measured (intangibles). In this sense and in terms of methodology, the paper has a descriptive, conceptual and analytic cognitive function. Cost-benefit analysis is used to demonstrate RE benefits and costs in the tourist destination. The authors conclude that the introduction of renewable energy contributes to the conservation of economic, ecological and social values and helps to enhance the destination's potential for economic development and sustainability.","[Nizic, Marinela Krstinic; Grdic, Zvonimira Sverko; Endres, Renata] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Primorska 42 C, Opatija 51410, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Nizic, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Primorska 42 C, Opatija 51410, Croatia.",marikn@fthm.hr; zgrdic@fthm.hr; renatad@fthm.hr,"Grdic, Zvonimira Sverko/T-4012-2018",,University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 4/16],University of Rijeka,"This paper has been financially supported by the University of Rijeka, for the project ZP UNIRI 4/16.",,33,0,0,0,8,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,634,646,,,,,,13,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500061,0

Design/methodology/approach - This paper used a qualitative and exploratory approach through the collection and analysis of data from a sample of 30 companies operating in the online delivery sector in Brazil. Reviews of their websites have also been conducted through parameters involving aspects of content, usability and functionality. Findings - The Brazilian main platforms received large foreign investment, growing with the acquisition of companies, making them market leaders. There was a greater presence of these companies on social networks, publicizing and interacting with their customers, increasing business visibility and attracting new prospects.

Design/methodology/approach - Case studies were used to deeply investigate the menu planning process of five star hotels. Data were drawn from in situ interviews and documentation, which were examined via content analysis. After the coding process, themes and categories were extracted and corroborated by direct quotations. Findings - The findings revealed that the menu planning process can be classified into five major categories. The first category consists of the prerequisites of planning a menu. The second category is key issues and encapsulates the managerial, consumer, gastronomic, marketing and external aspects of menu planning. The third category highlights key actors' responsibilities in the menu planning process, while the fourth category, trial and improvement, elaborates on the iterative process of menu design and the key players and issues involved with it. Finally, the last category outlines the difficulties of menu planning. Originality/value - In the existing academic literature, most research conducted about menu planning only provides conceptual framework while empirical information remains unexamined. However, this qualitative study aims to clarify the components of menu planning in more detail in terms of five star hotel firms that offer various food and beverage operations.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the farmers' selection behavior of vegetable marketing channels, and to determine the key factors which affected farmer' decision making. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 191 valid questionnaires were collected from 50 villages in seven main vegetable production districts in Beijing urban areas from September to December 2015, yielding a response rate of 86.8 percent. The multinomial logit model was used for analysis in this study. Findings - The results revealed that the farmers mainly selected farmers' market, cooperative, and wholesaler to sell their vegetables, which comprised 96.57 percent of total vegetable sales. Estimation results showed that cooperative, vegetable acreage, price satisfaction, and slow sales were most important factors which influence positively the probability of opting to sell vegetables at a cooperative rather than at the farmer's market. For wholesalers, gender of the household head and cooperative had most significantly negative effect, and age had a positive impact on farmer's choice of market channels. Originality/value - The results and implications obtained in the present study could help policymakers to establish a scientific-based and reasonable policy to encourage vegetable producers to participate in the circulation of vegetables in Beijing and guarantee their income in vegetable supply chain. The suggestions of this study could also be used for the improvement of the vegetable sector in other cities facing similar issues.","[Zhang, Biao; Fu, Zetian; Wang, Jieqiong; Tang, Xiaolin; Zhang, Lingxian] China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Fu, Zetian] Beijing Lab Food Qual & Safety, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yousen] Beijing Municipal Bur Agr, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zlx131@163.com,,"Zhang, Biao/0000-0001-7053-8066",National Social Science Foundation of China [14AJY019],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),This research was made possible through the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 14AJY019).,,43,25,25,1,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Prior to this, a pilot program, total patient revenue (TPR), was established for 8 rural hospitals in 2010. Using financial hospital report data from the Health Services Cost Review Commission from 2007 to 2013, we examined the hospitals' financial results including revenue, costs, and profit/loss margins to explore the impact of the adoption of the TPR pilot global budget program relative to the remaining hospitals in the state. We analyze financial results for both regulated (included in the global budget and subject to rate-setting) and unregulated services in order to capture a holistic image of the hospitals' actual revenue, cost and margin structures. Common size and difference-in-differences analyses of the data suggest that regulated profit ratios for treatment hospitals increased (from 5% in 2007 to 8% in 2013) and regulated expense-to-gross patient revenue ratios decreased (75% in 2007 and 68% in 2013) relative to the controls. Simultaneously, the profit margins for treatment hospitals' unregulated services decreased (-12% in 2007 and -17% in 2013), which reduced the overall margin significantly. This analysis therefore indicates cost shifting and less profit gain from the program than identified by solely focusing on the regulated margins.","[Malmmose, Margit; Holm, Claus] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business & Social Sci, Fuglesangsalle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Mortensen, Karoline] Sch Business Adm, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",Aarhus University,"Malmmose, M (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Sch Business & Social Sci, Fuglesangsalle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",mmalmmose@econ.au.dk; kmortensen@bus.miami.edu; hoc@econ.au.dk,"Holm, Claus Michael/GWN-0757-2022; Mortensen, Karoline/F-4289-2014","Holm, Claus/0000-0001-7428-9036; Mortensen, Karoline/0000-0002-9549-7288",,,,,31,10,11,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

This occurs in a context where air pollution and its effects on human health are of major concern. This paper investigates whether the proliferation and depth of environmental provisions (EPs) in RTAs are associated with lower concentration levels of particulate matter. We present an index of EPs in RTAs that measures the breadth and depth of the provisions and use it to estimate the effect of ratifying RTAs with different levels of EPs on changes in PM2.5 concentration levels in a panel of OECD countries over the 1999-2011 period. Using an instrumental variables strategy, we find that countries that have ratified RTAs with EPs show lower levels of PM2.5 concentrations when we control for scale, composition and technique effects and for national environmental regulations. Moreover, the PM2.5 concentration levels in the pairs of countries that belong to an RTA with EPs tend to converge for the country sample. The results also hold for a longer period of time (1990-2011) and a broader sample of 173 countries as well as for other pollutants, namely CO2 and NO2.","[Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [Oueslati, Walid] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Environm Directorate, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France",University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Martínez-Zarzoso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;Martínez-Zarzoso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Spain.",imartin@uni-goettingen.de; walid.oueslati@oecd.org,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014; OUESLATI, Walid/D-1454-2015","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557; OUESLATI, Walid/0000-0001-5611-0362",University Jaume I [UJI-B2017-33]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2017-83255-C3-3-P]; OECD,University Jaume I; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); OECD,"The funding was provided by OECD, University Jaume I (UJI-B2017-33) and Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Grant Number ECO2017-83255-C3-3-P).We would like to thank the editor and two anonymousreviewers for their comments and suggesting andShunta Yamaguchi for his very helpfulcomments on an earlydraft.We also thank the participants at the INTECO andETSG conferences for their insightful comments.",,57,18,20,5,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Recognising these potential benefits, CA is widely promoted in efforts towards sustainable agricultural intensification. However, there has been an intense debate about its suitability in smallholder farming environments, and this has stimulated a growing interest in the adoption and impacts of CA technologies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using survey data from maize-growing households in nine SSA countries, this paper seeks to add to the extant literature by examining the drivers and welfare impacts of individual and combined implementation of the three components of CA. We employ inverse-probability-weighting regression-adjustment and propensity score matching with multiple treatment estimators. Overall, results show that adoption of a CA technology significantly increases total household income and income per adult equivalent. Disaggregating the CA components, we find that adoption of the components in combination is associated with larger income gains than when the components are adopted in isolation, and the largest effect is achieved when households implement the three practices jointly. Nevertheless, implementation of the full CA package among the sampled households is very low, with an average adoption rate of 8%.

It is now clear that climate change and its devastating impacts cannot be resolved by new technology or governance alone. They require a broader, cultural shift. As a result, the role of human beings 'inner dimensions' and related transformations is attracting increased attention from researchers. Recent advances in neuroscience suggest for instance that mindfulness can open new pathways towards sustainability. However, the role of mindfulness in climate adaptation has been largely ignored. This paper is the first exploratory empirical investigation into linking individuals' intrinsic mindfulness (as opposed to outside mindfulness interventions) to pro- and reactive climate adaptation. Based on a survey of citizens at risk from severe climate events, we explore if, and how individual mindfulness is correlated with climate adaptation at different scales. The results show that individual mindfulness coincides with higher motivation to take climate adaptation actions or to support them, especially actions that are 'other-focused' or support pro-environmental behaviour. Mindfulness may also corroborate the acknowledgement of climate change and associated risk perception, and it may steer people away from fatalistic attitudes. We conclude with a call for more research into the relationship between human beings' inner dimensions and climate adaptation in the wider public domain.","[Warnsler, Christine; Brink, Ebba] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Global Dev Inst, Global Urbanism Res Grp, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Warnsler, Christine] Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci CNDS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Warnsler, Christine] Lund Univ, CRAM, Lund, Sweden",Lund University; Centre of Natural Hazards & Disaster Science (CNDS); Lund University,"Warnsler, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, LUCSUS, Box 170, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",christine.warrisler@lucsus.lu.se,,,Swedish Research Council FORMAS through the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project [2011-901],Swedish Research Council FORMAS through the Sustainable Urban Transformation for Climate Change Adaptation project,"This research has been conducted in the context of the Contemplative Sustainable Futures Program at LUCSUS, Lund University.

We examine the plant or animal origin of food products, as an indicator of the environmental and health impacts of sales, and their degree of processing, as an indicator of their health impact. The results indicate that sales of organic food products are more plant-based and less processed in specialised organic stores than in conventional retail stores, two criteria for a better health and environmental impact. In conventional stores, organic sales are more plant-based and less processed than conventional sales. Organic sales in conventional stores show some specificity, having the highest share of particular product ranges lacking a clear health or environmental impact, such as processed culinary ingredients or unprocessed or minimally processed animal products. Building a typology of buyers in conventional stores, we find that even purchases by buyers with the highest organic purchase intensity in conventional stores are less plant-based and more processed than average purchases in specialised organic stores.

Forty-six studies assessed PES livelihood impacts. The assessments presented more positive livelihood impacts than negative ones, focusing on financial benefits. Non monetary and non-material impacts of PES were largely understudied. Most reviews focused on ES providers, hindering the understanding of broader societal impacts. The review yielded examples where participants lost from their participation or where improvements in one livelihood dimension paralleled deterioration in another. Consequently, we identified key research gaps in: i) understanding the social and cultural impacts of PES, ii) evaluating environmental and economic additionality from improving other ES at the expense of cultural ones, iii) and assessing PES impacts in terms of trade-offs between multiple livelihood dimensions. Moreover, increased knowledge is needed on the impact of PES on changes in household expenditure and choice, and on trade-offs between household income and inequality in ES provider communities. Finally, if PES schemes are implemented to sustainably improve livelihoods, targeting disaggregated populations, understanding equity and social power relations within and between ES providers and users, and better monitoring and evaluation systems that consider locally relevant livelihood dimensions are needed.","[Blundo-Canto, Genowefa] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Decis & Policy Anal Res Area, Ave La Molina 1895,La Molina Apartado Postal 1558, Lima, Peru; [Blundo-Canto, Genowefa] CIRAD, UMR Innovat, 73 Ave Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Blundo-Canto, Genowefa] Univ Montpellier, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Bax, Vincent] Univ Ciencias & Humanidades, Av Univ 5175, Lima 39, Peru; [Bax, Vincent; Quintero, Marcela; Cruz-Garcia, Gisella S.; Perez-Marulanda, Lisset] Int Ctr Trop Agr, Decis & Policy Anal Res Area, Km 17 Recta Cali Palmira,Apartado Aereo 6713, Cali, Colombia; [Groeneveld, Rolf A.] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; Universidad de Ciencias y Humanidades; Alliance; International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT; Wageningen University & Research,"Blundo-Canto, G (通讯作者)，CIRAD, UMR Innovat, 73 Ave Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",genowefa.blundo_canto@cirad.fr,"Cruz-Garcia, Gisella S./AAO-5525-2021","Cruz-Garcia, Gisella S./0000-0002-2699-3157; Blundo Canto, Genowefa/0000-0003-4182-3663; Bax, Vincent/0000-0003-0690-8135","CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE); CGIAR Fund donors","CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund donors(CGIAR)","We thank the two anonymous reviewers who helped us considerably improve the paper.

We develop a hybrid environmentally extended input-output model that links the single-region input-output analysis on domestic processes with a multiregional input-output analysis to derive the indirect emissions associated with imports and part of the domestic production. We apply Almon's algorithm to transform the domestic emissions from industries to product groups. The indirect and direct emission intensities of more than hundred consumption items are then linked to expenditures of almost 3000 individual households to compute the total emissions for each household. We find that emissions attributable to households are not distributed evenly - while the first expenditure decile of households is responsible for less than 4% of all emissions, the tenth decile is responsible for 20-24%. Consumption of services and goods is least emission intensive, while use of electricity, heating, and transportation remains responsible for the major part of emissions. The most important factor of emissions attributable to household consumption is total expenditures; the expenditure elasticity of emissions is about 0.8, but we identify consumption groups which emissions are less sensitive to total expenditures (electricity, heating and food) and more sensitive (transportation, goods).","[Mach, Radomir] Charles Univ Prague, Environm Ctr, Fac Humanities, Jose Martiho 407-2, Prague 6, Czech Republic; [Weinzettel, Jan; Scasny, Milan] Charles Univ Prague, Environm Ctr, Jose Martiho 407-2, Prague 6, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague,"Mach, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Environm Ctr, Fac Humanities, Jose Martiho 407-2, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",radomir.mach@gmail.com,"Scasny, Milan/F-7394-2012; Weinzettel, Jan/A-3422-2010","Scasny, Milan/0000-0001-5040-1281; Weinzettel, Jan/0000-0001-8977-8385",Charles University Grant Agency GA UK [1286214]; Czech Science Foundation [17-07140S]; H-MSCA-RISE project GEMCLIME [681228]; [PRIMUS/HUM/29],Charles University Grant Agency GA UK; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); H-MSCA-RISE project GEMCLIME;,"This paper was supported by Charles University Grant Agency GA UK no. 1286214 (R.M.), Czech Science Foundation grant no. 17-07140S (J.W. and R.M.), PRIMUS/HUM/29 (M.S.) and H2020-MSCA-RISE project GEMCLIME-2020 under GA no. 681228 (J.W., M.S.).

An AMU admits acute patients, mainly arriving via the emergency department, for further assessment, care and treatment for a maximum designated period. Thereafter, patients who require additional care are transferred to regular wards that also admit elective patients. The literature reports several benefits (including reductions in inpatient mortality and in the length of stay), with these conclusions mostly based on empirical findings from studies focused on acute patient performance only. This paper sheds light on the potential hospital-wide impact of implementing a range of AMU designs in terms of length of the designated period, size and transfer policy. A simulation study is performed based on data from a large Dutch hospital. When establishing an AMU, hospitals usually transfer resources from existing wards to the new AMU. This seems logical since these wards receive fewer acute admissions once an AMU is in place. However, our research shows that this transfer of resources decreases the overall performance (of the AMU and the wards) for all the AMU designs investigated. We report on the scale of these negative effects and the required reduction in the length of acute patients' stays required to compensate for these effects. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The judicial system, like many other sectors of the public administration, is an industry producing a specific good - justice - and, accordingly, it can be studied by using the customary tools of production theory. The paper applies the two-stage analysis by Simar and Wilson (2007) and the Malmquist index to the judiciary, in order to better understand the impact of a specific policy on the productivity of the Italian tax judiciary. The results highlight strong heterogeneity among courts, depending on their geographical location, with North-West and North-East of Italy as the most efficient macro areas. Moreover, by decomposing the index into change in efficiency and change in technology, this work provides a further glimpse into the judiciary's production organization. Interestingly, the evidence shows that a reduction in the number of active sections has had a negative impact on the overall performance of the courts (i.e., a negative change in efficiency of 0.0103, with a p-value < 0.01), although the reorganization of the residual sections has possibly determined a more effective use of the remaining resources (i.e., a positive change in technology of 0.00285, with a p-value < 0.01). Hence, technology does not fully replace the productive role of the judges. The overall results suggest that adjudication is a labor-intensive activity and, although fine-tuning their organization can indeed enhance the productivity of the courts, the role of the judges still remains pivotal. There might indeed be ways to increase the efforts made by judges and a suitable policy should create incentives aimed at boosting their productivity. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The framework is applied to study a degrowth society where a subset of agents voluntarily limit their material consumption, thereby complying with voluntary simplicity (VS). At micro-level, the utility-maximization problems of asymmetric agents are formulated and solved for optimal labour supplies. New macro-level equilibrium solutions, accounting for wealth inequality, are presented based on different labour supply models. The equilibrium welfare is measured using a Sernoully-Nash aggregate. An increase in the share of the VS-type agents implies a degrowth transition to a lower level of average consumption. Analysis of the equilibrium framework shows that degrowth, whereby average market based consumption falls, improves the equilibrium welfare, assuming the VS-type agents have sufficient resources, enabling a reduction in labour supplies. Sharing, collaborative consumption and basic income support welfare-increasing degrowth. Any growing economy can eventually reach the size at which degrowth would improve the welfare. Simulations suggest that degrowth can also yield a Pareto-improvement in welfare.","[Heikkinen, Tiina] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Heikkinen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.",tiina.m.heikkinen@elisanet.fi,,,,,,,24,6,7,2,25,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

An Econometric Analysis of Cost Functions of Private Forests in Vietnam,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forest ecosystem service; Trade-off; Marginal cost; Translog cost function; Cost complementarity; Vietnam,TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY; BIODIVERSITY; JOINTNESS; PAYMENTS; TIMBER; DUALITY,"Forest ecosystem service (FES) provisioning and management in Vietnam is a priority in the Vietnamese environmental agenda. The main rationale of private forest management is to maximise profits from timber and non-timber forest product (NTFP) production. From a social point of view an under-supply of positive forest externalities (or non-marketed ecosystem services) exists. This paper therefore contributes to the ecosystem service (ES) literature by assessing the production cost structure, in other words, the cost of marketed production and provision of carbon and biodiversity, based on a survey of private forest owners in Hoa Binh Province in Vietnam. The econometric analysis was carried out using a dual cost function approach to analyse the trade-off between forestry costs and ecological performance. This is, to our knowledge, the first time such an approach has been used to estimate the production relationship between marketed outputs and non-marketed ES in the forest sector. This approach appears to be appropriate for handling the multiple joint outputs of forest production and allows us to estimate marginal costs and other cost measures such as cost complementarities in the production of multiple ES. Our results indicate that there is complementarity in the provision of timber and carbon sequestration and, consequently, policies that enhance carbon sequestration in private forests in Vietnam can be implemented without additional costs for the forest owner. We also found that keeping deadwood (to favour biodiversity) had no significant cost and was complementary with NTFP (also an indicator of biodiversity in our study), but could increase the marginal cost of producing timber. This means that biodiversity can be enhanced at no additional cost, provided that the quantity of deadwood does not significantly increase.","[Lambini, Cosmas Kombat; Tenhunen, John] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Lambini, Cosmas Kombat] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Grad Sch Math & Nat Sci BayNAT, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany; [Trung Thanh Nguyen] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Abildtrup, Jens; Garcia, Serge] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRA, BETA, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Van Dien Pham] Forestry Univ, Dept Silviculture, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth; Leibniz University Hannover; INRAE; AgroParisTech; Universite de Lorraine; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA),"Lambini, CK (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",cosmas.lambini@bvng.org,"Nguyen, Trung Thanh/D-3448-2009; Kombat, Cosmas/AAL-1141-2020; Garcia, Serge/A-1102-2014","Nguyen, Trung Thanh/0000-0003-4507-724X; Garcia, Serge/0000-0001-5161-0085; Abildtrup, Jens/0000-0003-4964-7123; Lambini, Cosmas Kombat/0000-0003-3642-836X","Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD); Forestry University, Vietnam (FUV); TERRECO Project at Bayreuth University, Germany [DFGGRK 1565]; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir programme [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]","Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD); Forestry University, Vietnam (FUV); TERRECO Project at Bayreuth University, Germany; French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the Investissements d'Avenir programme(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","Many thanks to the private forest owners and farmers in Hoa Birth Province who devoted their valuable time to the lengthy field interviews.

Managing these predators to protect threatened species should involve careful consideration of biological, geographic, economic, and social aspects to ensure informed and effective decision-making. This study investigates peoples preferences for the ways in which foxes and feral cats are managed at a conservation site in Western Australia using a discrete choice experiment. We further aim to quantify the non-market values of two native threatened species protected by management; Numbats and Woylies. The attributes evaluated in the survey included: increased populations of Numbats and Woylies, cost of management, and a range of invasive feral predator management strategies (1080 baiting, fencing, trapping, and community engagement). Results show that respondents prefer a combination of management strategies over the strategy of 1080 baiting that is currently being implemented, particularly combinations that include trapping and community engagement. There is also strong public support for increased Numbat and Woylie populations. Willingness to pay was, on average, $21.76 for 100 Numbats and $7.95 for 1000 Woylies. Including images of the threatened species in the choice sets does not influence willingness-to-pay estimates. We further discuss how familiarity with the species influences value. Our results feed into the conservation decision making process about feral species management in the region.","[Subroy, Vandana; Rogers, Abbie A.; Kragt, Marit E.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Subroy, Vandana; Rogers, Abbie A.; Kragt, Marit E.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Rogers, Abbie A.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia,"Subroy, V (通讯作者)，M087-35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",vandana.subroy@research.uwa.edu.au; abbie.rogers@uwa.edu.au; marit.kragt@uwa.edu.au,"Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011; Rogers, Abbie/H-5739-2014","Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817; Rogers, Abbie/0000-0002-7611-7593; Subroy, Vandana/0000-0002-8478-6295",University of Western Australia on behalf of the Australian Government's Research Training Program (RTP) scheme; Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program through the Threatened Species Recovery Hub,University of Western Australia on behalf of the Australian Government's Research Training Program (RTP) scheme; Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program through the Threatened Species Recovery Hub(Australian Government),"Ms. Vandana Subroy would like to gratefully acknowledge PhD scholarship funding from the University of Western Australia on behalf of the Australian Government's Research Training Program (RTP) scheme, as well as top-up and fieldwork funding from the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Program through the Threatened Species Recovery Hub to carry out the choice experiment.",,65,24,27,1,58,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This question has been explored on a few different macroeconomic models, and both 'yes' and 'no' answers have been obtained. However, economies can become unstable whether or not there is ongoing underlying growth in productivity with which to sustain growth in output. Here we attempt, for the first time, to assess via a model the relative stability of growth versus no-growth scenarios. The model employed draws from Keen's model of the Minsky financial instability hypothesis. The analysis focuses on dynamics as opposed to equilibrium, and scenarios of growth and no-growth of output (GDP) are obtained by tweaking a productivity growth input parameter. We confirm that, with or without growth, there can be both stable and unstable scenarios. To maintain stability, firms must not change their debt levels or target debt levels too quickly. Further, according to the model, the wages share is higher for zero-growth scenarios, although there are more frequent substantial drops in employment.","[Barrett, Adam B.] Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England; [Barrett, Adam B.] Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex; University of Sussex,"Barrett, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sackler Ctr Consciousness Sci, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.;Barrett, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Brighton BN1 9QJ, E Sussex, England.",adam.barrett@sussex.ac.uk,,,EPSRC [EP/L005131/1]; Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation; EPSRC [EP/L005131/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/L005131/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"ABB is funded by EPSRC grant EP/L005131/1.

Drawing on contemporary critical political economy scholarship, this article identifies four prerequisites for socio-economic paradigm shifts: deep crisis, an alternative political project, a comprehensive coalition of social forces promoting the project in political struggles, and broad-based consent. It is argued that, on the one hand, there is much to suggest that current crises cannot be resolved under existing institutional frameworks and that degrowth is a political project that provides solutions to some of the key problems currently facing humanity. On the other hand, the prospects for a de growth paradigm shift remain bleak: unlike political projects that became hegemonic in the past, degrowth has neither support from a comprehensive coalition of social forces nor any consent to its agenda among the broader population.","[Buch-Hansen, Hubert] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenshaven 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",,"Buch-Hansen, H (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenshaven 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",hb.dbp@cbs.dk,,"Buch-Hansen, Hubert/0000-0002-8279-4179",,,,,83,70,71,2,51,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

As one of the most heavily visited U.S. Wilderness areas, the BWCAW represents an ecosystem managed primarily for conservation values that also has a substantial regional economic impact. This combination of high visitation and strong conservation management represents a sustainable symbiotic relationship where visitor expenditures help maintain ecosystem protection. To investigate this symbiotic relationship, the regional economic impacts of the BWCAW were estimated. Multiplier effects were calculated and the sustainability and tradeoffs associated with BWCAW tourism were examined, as was the export nature of BWCAW recreation. Data collection consisted of surveying 2016 summer BWCAW visitors. Visitor regional expenditures were extrapolated to overall visitation data and entered into IMPLAN impact analysis software. Based on 513 completed surveys, and an overall survey response rate of 40%, out-of-region visitors spent over $56 million in the three counties surrounding the BWCAW in 2016, generating $78 million in total economic output and creating 1100 full and part-time jobs. Estimated economic impacts of outdoor recreation and their sustainability can be helpful for informing regional economic development policy for conservation areas world-wide.","[Hjerpe, Evan E.] Conservat Econ Inst, Boise, ID 83701 USA",,"Hjerpe, EE (通讯作者)，Conservat Econ Inst, Boise, ID 83701 USA.",evan@conservationecon.org,,"Hjerpe, Evan/0009-0002-5479-6422",,,,,36,17,21,1,52,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In areas where aquifers are primary sources of fresh water, kiawe control has the potential to be an integral component of water management planning. We develop an analytical dynamic framework for the joint management of kiawe and groundwater, and show that optimal water management depends on expected kiawe damages, while optimal kiawe removal depends on groundwater scarcity and removal cost. Using data from the Kiholo aquifer on the west coast of Hawaii Island, we solve for joint management decisions with corresponding parameters related to kiawe damage and water scarcity. With 1.5% water demand growth, Kiawe should be removed if the removal cost is below $1884/ha. Our numerical results indicate that kiawe damage is nonlinear in the rate of water demand growth. The damage costs can be attributed to three main factors. When demand growth is low, kiawe damage is driven by a higher water extraction cost. For moderate growth, the effect is compounded by anticipated future scarcity. Damage is amplified by a backstop cost effect when the growth rate is high.","[Pongkijvorasin, Sittidaj] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Burnett, Kimberly; Wada, Christopher] Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, 2424 Maile Way,Saunders Hall 540, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",Chulalongkorn University; University of Hawaii System,"Burnett, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, Econ Res Org, 2424 Maile Way,Saunders Hall 540, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kburnett@hawaii.edu,"Burnett, Kimberly/CAF-0517-2022; Wada, Christopher/I-8105-2016","Wada, Christopher/0000-0002-4916-9769","Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; National Science Foundation EPSCoR Grant [EPS-0903833]","Chulalongkorn University, Thailand(Chulalongkorn University); National Science Foundation EPSCoR Grant","This research was funded in part by a travel grant from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, and National Science Foundation EPSCoR Grant No. EPS-0903833.

I consider a model in which countries suffer from two pollutants with different externality characteristics and attempt to cooperate by sequentially negotiating on IEAs. The membership outcome depends on the environmental concern, abatement technology, spillover effect and most importantly the correlation between pollutants as either substitutes or complements. I find that cooperation in the first stage can facilitate later negotiations and that countries are prone to cooperate on a pollutant of common concern. Moreover, except for symmetric countries, different negotiation agendas may result in distinctive participation outcomes when pollutants are complements. Therefore, with systematic policy design, the negotiation sequence can serve as another method to encourage participation and cooperation in IEAs.","[Xu, Jing] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Xu, J (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",xuj@swufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,32,2,2,1,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We find that Objective 1 funds are characterized by strong spatial externalities and a positive and concave effect on the growth of GDP per worker, which reaches a peak at the ratio funds/GDP of approximately 3 percent and becomes non-significant after 4 percent. Objective 2 and Cohesion funds have nonsignificant effects, while all the other funds exert a positive and significant effect, but their size is very limited.

Lopez and Harry Miskimin on one hand and Carlo M. Cipolla on the other. More than half a century later, this topic can be reconsidered in the light of much wider information on the late medieval/early modern Italian economy. Using data on population, urbanization, prices, wages, and GDP, this article outlines the macroeconomic trends in central and northern Italy in the age of the Renaissance (1350-1550). The frequent plagues during the early Renaissancethat is, between 1348 and 1450decimated the population, probably causing more deaths than in other European countries. Hence resources per worker increased and labour productivity, incomes, and standards of living improved remarkably. A favourable economic environment thus seems to have been a pre-condition for the Renaissance in culture, art, and politics and the spread of new kinds of consumer demand. From the middle of the fifteenth century, living standards gradually worsened and eventually reached the low levels that had prevailed prior to the Renaissance.","[Malanima, Paolo] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy",Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro,"Malanima, P (通讯作者)，Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.",mala1950@hotmail.it,,,,,,,166,12,13,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Yet, contemporary economic valuation is constrained to the appraisal of simple goods that generate benefits that accrue to individuals, neglecting complex goods that generate benefits that accrue to society more broadly. Methodological barriers to the valuation of complex social goods have led to their frequent omission from natural resource management deliberations. The prevailing valuation paradigm that focuses on simple individual goods may erode conservation efforts by crowding out the institutions and behaviours that support socially constructed ecosystem service values. Erosion of these values ultimately harms the environment and society as a whole. The institutionalisation of appropriate methods for estimating the value of complex social goods alongside existing methods for valuing simple individual goods within international conservation, development and policy making discourses, is therefore an important evolution for sustainable natural resource management (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Securitization has experienced a real boom in its application in the first decade of this century. Long-term credit mortgages with poor quality are grouped into bundles and converted into securities that are sold in the financial market. This creates a secondary mortgage market. The developed, regulated and standardized primary mortgage market is prerequisite for the development of the secondary mortgage market and securitization. Stimulating the approval of mortgage lending or risky products to less solvent parties is now considered to be the most important cause of speculation and inflow of the real estate market and consequently the emergence of the first global financial crisis of the 21st century. Because of the negative effects of globalization, the crisis has spread rapidly from the USA to the rest of the world and has produced negative effects, primarily in financial markets and then indirectly in other sectors of national economies. As far as Croatia is concerned, it can be said that the bank lending was the main instrument of financing in the Croatian market. Secondary financial markets have not really taken root in Croatia, and consequently nor securitization process. Also, in Croatia, the mortgage market is a relatively small market with a very small share of issued mortgage loans from total loans to households. Therefore, this paper examines the justification for encouraging the development of the mortgage market in Croatia. Taking into account the emergence of securitization as a result of the existence of a mortgage market as well as the explicit dominance of bank loans in the Croatian financial market, the authors find that there is no economic justification for that in a medium term. Instead, it is necessary to develop further the infrastructure and legislative framework in order to achieve greater investor safety. That would indirectly lead to achievement of greater liquidity and efficiency of the entire Croatian financial market.","[Buterin, Vesna] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia; [Buterin, Denis; Lukezic, Ester] Polytech Rijeka, Vukovarska 58, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; Polytechnic Rijeka,"Buterin, V (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",vesna.buterin@efri.hr; denis.buterin@veleri.hr; ester.lukezic@gmail.com,"Buterin, Denis/S-6257-2018; Buterin, Vesna/Q-8705-2018","Buterin, Vesna/0000-0002-1090-6549",University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 3/17],University of Rijeka,This paper has been supported by University of Rijeka under the project number ZP UNIRI 3/17 (Development and Perspectives of Institutional Investors in the Republic of Croatia),,16,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,960,968,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900101,0

To reflect this, the right of access to information was raised to the constitutional level in 2010 and constitutes one of the basic human rights. This paper will present the legal framework for exercising the right of access to information in accordance with the Act on the Right of Access to Information (lex specialis). Competent authorities will be highlighted and teleological, grammatical and logical interpretation methods will be used to analyze procedural provisions regulating the implementation of special administrative procedures related to provision of information. Furthermore, after a decision by the information commissioner and a possible appeal procedure, dissatisfied parties may obtain the next level of legal protection by initiating an administrative dispute by appealing before the High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia. The decision on particular administrative matters is exempted from the jurisdiction of first instance administrative courts by a regulation from 2010 whereby it is transferred to a hierarchically higher court instance. The said exemption from first instance jurisdiction does not constitute a rule in domestic or comparative law of European countries. The High Administrative Court of the Republic of Croatia rules primarily as a second instance court, so special attention will be given to the specificity of its role and position in providing court protection in this special administrative area. By analyzing specific court cases from administrative law practice using the casuistic method, we will provide insight into its decision-making process. As part of the above, we will conclude by trying to determine the legislator's reasons, as well as the justification for transferring decisionmaking and handling cases in a single instance before the highest specialized court within the administrative judiciary.","[Ceko, Ana Danic] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair Adm Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Ceko, AD (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair Adm Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",adjanic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,451,461,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900047,0

China's urban households are becoming the key driving force behind a surge in mutton consumption. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of mutton demand in urban China. Design/methodology/approach Based on a sample of 32,910 urban households across six provinces and autonomous regions, an inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) double-hurdle model is estimated, by maximum likelihood estimation, to reveal the determinants of mutton consumption-at-home. Findings The empirical results indicate that, first, household income has a positive effect on mutton consumption, and higher income households have a higher income elasticity; second, wet weather increases probability, but reduces conditional level and unconditional level; finally, minority group households consume more mutton than Han group households. Practical implications It is necessary for policymakers to develop a long-term outlook in relation to the increase of China's mutton appetite and to shift from a domestic perspective to a global one and develop diversified import strategies. Furthermore, policymakers require to make a practicable emergency preplan for tackling short-term agglomeration of demand for mutton, attributed to festivals, and religious events of a minority ethnic group. Originality/value This is a major work based on a large sample of 32,910 urban households conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. This paper uses an IHS double-hurdle model to quantify the determinants of mutton consumption; it sheds light on the climatic, regional, and ethnic characteristics of mutton consumption in urban China.","[Chen, Yongfu; Zhu, Wenbo] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ziyuan] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Beijing Normal Univ, United Int Coll, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Beijing Normal University - Hong Kong Baptist University United International College; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University Zhuhai; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Chen, YF (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chenyf@cau.edu.cn; zhuwenbo@cau.edu.cn; l630001009@mail.uic.edu.hk,,"Zhu, Wenbo/0000-0003-1324-8411",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473251],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to the editor and the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions to improve the quality of this paper.

A single visit destination can involve many factors, including access to information: the project A Region for All, promoted by Promoturismo FVG in collaboration with CRAD FVG and the University of Trieste, focused on this issue. Promoturismo FVG is a semipublic destination management organization. Its mission is to develop the regional tourism system collaborating with all the active subjects to improve the promotion and to optimize the resources by concentrating the efforts. The organization pursues its objectives by planning and organizing the offer through specific tourism products. In 2016 a mapping process has been started to investigate the usability of the relevant services to tourists / visitors with special needs along the itinerary of eight tourist centers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region. To date, more than 200 facilities (bars, restaurants, pharmacies, cash machines...) have been detected. The paper will present the development of the work conducted by TrIAL - Trieste Inclusion & Accessibility Lab at Department of Engineering and Architecture within the University of Trieste for the management of the mapping process. On the strength of the mapping experience developed during the previous project LabAc (Laboratory of Accessibility) for the Province of Trieste and the project Trieste for All for the Municipality of Trieste (from 2013 to 2016), the research group has adopted and set a series of digital tools, has identified specific indicators and has focused on an efficient return of data to Promoturismo FVG.

Employees deal directly with customers on an everyday basis. Therefore, the human capital of an organisation has a key role in delivering high-quality customer service. In order to improve the quality of services, internal marketing was introduced as a marketing strategy where employees are approached as internal customers. It represents a concept for managing the human capital of a company by focusing on the processes of recruitment, retention, motivation, training and internal communication, thus affecting the work dedication and devotion of employees. High employee engagement - the level of commitment of employees in fulfilling their job requirements and delivering quality customer service - will pave the way for company success. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between internal marketing and employee engagement in the hospitality industry. The study aims to analyse and determine the influence internal marketing practices have on the level of employee engagement. Based on an extensive literature review, a conceptual research model was created to explore the relationship between motivation and retention, as a multidimensional internal marketing concept, and employee engagement, observed as cognitive engagement. The data were collected using questionnaires among hotel employees in the Croatian hotel industry. The paper offers managerial implications for hotel managers on developing employee engagement and, consequently, improving service quality. It will expand the current knowledge on internal marketing practices and its influence on employee engagement in the hospitality industry. To enhance future employee engagement it is recommended that hotel management should place more emphasis on internal marketing practices and programs thereby enhancing the quality of the employees' work. This will consequently improve service quality. Also, limitations and ideas for further research are offered.","[Dlacic, Jasmina] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, HR-51000 Rijeka, Croatia; [Crnjar, Kristina] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, HR-51410 Opatija, Croatia; [Lazaric, Marin] Univ Rijeka, Imperial Dd, Fac Econ, Jurja Barakovica 2, HR-51280 Rab, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Dlacic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, HR-51000 Rijeka, Croatia.",jasmina.dlacic@efri.hr; kcrnjar@fthm.hr; marin.lazaric@imperial.hr,"Črnjar, Kristina/S-9155-2018; Dlacic, Jasmina/I-4874-2018","Dlacic, Jasmina/0000-0002-3592-1876; Crnjar, Kristina/0000-0002-7137-4232",University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 9/17],University of Rijeka,This paper has been financially supported by the University of Rijeka for project ZP UNIRI 9/17.,,26,0,0,1,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,785,794,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900081,0

An underlying barrier may be that insects are lumped together as one group, while consumers typically try specific insects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ways in which Dutch consumers, with and without insect tasting experience, are more or less willing to eat different insects. Design/methodology/approach In a quasi-experimental study (n=140), the participants with and without prior experience in eating insects were asked to give their willingness to eat a range of insects, and their attitudes and disgust towards eating insects. Findings Insects promoted in the market were more preferred than the less marketed insects, and a subgroup of preferred insects for participants with experience in eating insects was formed. Research limitations/implications Although well-known insects were more preferred, general willingness to eat remained low for all participants. The results indicate that in future research on insects as food the specific insects used should be taken into account. Practical implications Continued promotion of specific, carefully targeted, insects may not lead to short-term uptake of insects as food, but may contribute to willingness to eat insects as human food in the long term. Originality/value The paper shows substantial differences between consumers who have and who have not previously tasted insects, with higher acceptance of people with experience in tasting insects for the specific insects that are frequently promoted beyond their generally more positive attitude towards eating insects.","[Fischer, Arnout R.

We wanted to explore the possibilities and challenges of using a social robot as an assistive tool for learning and training of basic concepts and words. Robots are considered promising tools in language training because they can contribute to systematic interaction and repetition. A prototype was developed using an Aldebaran NAO robot combined with pictures that could be presented on a tablet, PC or on the wall using a projector. The prototype was piloted in two pre-projects with different groups of children learning Norwegian. One project targeted second language learners in a kindergarten and the other targeted young primary school pupils with autism spectrum disorder. Both of these groups need more systematic training than they usually get during the normal kindergarten and school schedule. We wanted to study whether and how the use of a social robot could contribute to more systematic training, increased learning intensity, more repetitions and ultimately more effective language learning. In this paper we present experiences from developing, implementing and using the prototype in the two different settings. The prototype is described, as well as the pedagogical settings of the two pilots. We present results from observations of the children and interviews with teachers and supporting personnel. We discuss differences between the two cases and methodological limitations.

Unfortunately, for individuals with disabilities, these settings can have a negative impact if the physical environment or the social interactions with docents impede individuals' abilities to function and benefit from this type of community engagement. The principles of universal design (UD) can transform these negative experiences into positive ones that benefit the individuals and the community settings. One public institution of higher education in the United States, Worcester State University in Worcester, Massachusetts has a unique partnership with a nearby art museum. This partnership allowed two separate projects from two health-related professions to be conducted using the principles of UD. One project from the Occupational Therapy Department examined the physical environment in the context of an undergraduate course, and the other project from the Communication and Sciences Department investigated the delivery of docents' presentations for individuals with communication disorders, such as hearing loss.

Psychology of work records a strong development in knowledge from the field of study of work motivation and impact on work efficiency. Between the forms of work motivation, personal potential for innovation and work efficiency, there is a strong causal and consequent logical connection. The on-going task of top management in dynamic business processes and constant changes in the outside world is to build and maintain an extrinsically motivating work environment as a prerequisite for the growth of the organizational innovation capacity and growth of business efficiency or competitiveness of the company. Although intrinsic form of work motivation is most desirable, it is a rare and individual case, mainly at the level of larger centres of accountability, because it is very difficult to design an organization in which a significant population is made up of employees with high autonomy in business and the ability to create a working environment. On the other hand, there is a lingering challenge to design an organization where employees accept work assignments where motivation is primarily influenced by their desire, and only then the obligation to perform the task. Such positive working environment can significantly affect on the company efficiency and competitiveness. The underlying problem that is addressed by this work is the lack of an integrative approach to the recognition of key factors of various work motivation theories to which management of the enterprise can influence through the design of the efficiency measurement system and the reward system.","[Grebenar, Vladimir] Vinkoprom Ltd, Univ Coll Nikola Subic Zrinski, Zlatana Sremca 47, Vinkovci 32100, Croatia; [Grebenar, Vladimir] Selska Cesta 119, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Britvic, Josip] Top Consult Grp Ltd, MP Miskine 88, P Sesvete 48363, Croatia",,"Grebenar, V (通讯作者)，Vinkoprom Ltd, Univ Coll Nikola Subic Zrinski, Zlatana Sremca 47, Vinkovci 32100, Croatia.;Grebenar, V (通讯作者)，Selska Cesta 119, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",vladimir.grebenar@gmail.com; josip.britvic@top-consult-grupa.hr,"Britvic, Josip JB/E-4111-2018; Britvic, Josip/AGO-2173-2022",,,,,,13,0,0,1,9,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,300,309,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900031,0

Marketing Quality Marks promoted by Croatian Agricultural Agency are: Honey from our beautiful, Controlled quality, Croatian island product, Egg of Croatian farms, Meat of Croatian farms, Milk of Croatian farms. Quality Marks of the European Union for Agricultural and Food Products (Ministry of Agriculture) are: Protected designation of origin, protected designation of geographical origin, Traditional specialty guaranteed. The Croatian Chamber of Commerce is behind the branding of products bearing the inscriptions Croatian Quality and Original Croatian. Zagreb trademarks were protected as the intellectual property of a producer association: Zagreb's fresh cow cheese (ZG sirek), Jagodica purgerica (Strawberry Purgerica), Zagreb puslek, Zagreb cherry. Branding an agricultural product means creating a certain awareness among consumers, making it recognizable on the market. In order to achieve that, it is important to involve agricultural experts from the beginning of the production preparation process through soil treatments (strict control of chemical substances) and environmental protection. Methodology used is historical, analysis and synthesis as well as quantitative and qualitative primary research. Quantitative method was conducted through questionnaire distributed to random sample of Croatian consumers with response of 920 collected responses. The research shows how many users of quality agricultural products at the EU level or users of marketing quality labels at the Croatian level are familiar with the labels, whether the quality labels are sufficiently commercially promoted and how it influences consumers buying preferences. Qualitative research was conducted by interviewing Assistant Minister at Ministry of Agriculture and Deputy Head of City Office for Agriculture and Forestry at City of Zagreb. The research results show that promotion of national agricultural products with labels of quality is extremely important for consumers but still not sufficient and needs to be improved on all levels; by producers, Ministry of Agriculture, City of Zagreb and all stakeholders.","[Gregoric, Marina; Zeman, Silvija] Medimurje Polytech Cakovec, Bana Josipa Jelac 22A, Cakovec, Croatia; [Haleus, Jasenka] Univ Coll Nikola Sub Zrinski, Selska Cesta 119, Zagreb, Croatia; [Korze, Ana Vovk] Univ Maribor, Koroska C 160, Maribor 2000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Gregoric, M (通讯作者)，Medimurje Polytech Cakovec, Bana Josipa Jelac 22A, Cakovec, Croatia.",marina.gregoric@mev.hr; jasenka2102@gmail.com; szeman@mev.hr; ana.vovk@um.si,"Gregoric, Marina/T-7151-2017; Gregoric, Marina/AAI-5438-2021","Gregoric, Marina/0000-0003-0741-2908; Gregoric, Marina/0000-0003-0741-2908",,,,,6,0,0,2,5,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,111,119,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900010,0

Furthermore, what are the potential benefits of introducing the new form - Societas Unius Personae? Special focus will be put on similar forms of companies in national company laws, the number of registered companies in the national court register, and problems that arise in everyday national and cross-border operations. In April 2014, the European Commission, as part of its package on corporate governance and company law, published a proposal for a directive on single-member private companies with limited liability, the so-called Societas Unius Personae (SUP). As part of the Europe 2020 growth strategy, its main objective was to make it easier and less costly to set up of companies across the EU, as well as to facilitate cross-border trade. According to the proposal, the SUPs would have only one share and one shareholder. The Member States would be required to provide for its online registration, giving the possibility to SUP founders to incorporate and register an SUP from their computer, without a need to travel to the country of registration. In addition, the minimum capital requirement to set up an SUP would be 1 EUR. The Directive was especially intended to benefit small and middle-size enterprises active outside their country of incorporation. Such objectives are commendable; however, some stakeholders expressed concerns regarding the actual implementation of such a proposal. In October 2017, the proposed Directive has been withdrawn, and so the author will propose possible practical solutions and further steps.","[Horak, Hana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Horak, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",,"Horak, Hana/I-3769-2018",,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,180,186,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600021,0

Countless cruise ships dock here and the world renowned Ultra music festival has been held here for years now. Tourism has developed to the extent that people started to move out of their homes (at least during summer months) and stay with their families in order to rent their apartments to tourists. One of the most important components for economy of a country is precisely tourism. In the last few months, Split citizens have been faced with the rehabilitation of the largest landfill south of Zagreb, Karepovac in Split. Due to the rehabilitation in Split, especially when the wind blows, there is an unbearable stench. The smell is so strong that in certain parts of the city peoYple must wear protective masks on their face. The legal framework in a regulated state must contain a solution for such situations. This means determining who is entitled to request that such a situation be disrupted and / or to compensate for the damage as well as deciding who is entitled to compensation. In conclusion-who will pay for all of it? Formally in the foreground is the municipal utility company and, consequently, its founders. However, the Republic of Croatia cannot be released from responsibility, because its bodies formally forced the City of Split and Karepovac to accept garbage from a number of other municipalities and cities, despite the opposition of the utility company and the City of Split. The aim of this paper is to analyse the solutions in the Croatian legal framework de lege lata, in particular the Ownership and Other Rights in Rem Act and the Civil Obligations Act and de lege ferenda to provide suggestions where necessary and to encourage discussion on this topic among others in order to analyse the situation in their countries. If there is place for prognosis, this whole case would probably represent a cash cow for Croatian lawyers, but also a huge burden on the judiciary system.","[Kacer, Blanka] Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Kacer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Domovinskog Rata 8, Split, Croatia.",blanka.kacer@pravst.hr,,,,,,,3,0,0,1,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,47,53,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600005,0

The aim of performed research is to assess the financial health of Lithuanian state universities. The research is carried out according to publicly announced financial reports of 2011-2016 of fourteen Lithuanian universities. The financial health of universities is assessed calculating Financial health index (FHI), which consists of four indices: primary reserve ratio, viability ratio, return on net assets ratio and net operating revenues ratio. These indices allow evaluating different aspects of financial health of universities. The four ratios are weighted and combined to determine FHI. FHI statistic indices (mean, minimum, maximum) are calculated applying SPSS software. With reference to FHI of each university, universities are divided to four groups that reflect different level of financial health. The level of FHI of different years and average FHI meanings showed that financial health of most universities was satisfactory in analysed period.","[Kazlauskiene, Vilma; Legenzova, Renata] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Kazlauskiene, V (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilma.kazlauskiene@vdu.lt; renata.legenzova@vdu.lt,"Kazlauskienė, Vilma/JZT-6390-2024; Legenzova, Renata/X-5448-2019","Kazlauskienė, Vilma/0000-0003-0295-6543; Legenzova, Renata/0000-0002-5987-033X",,,,,13,0,0,2,11,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,117,123,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.126,0.0,,,7,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500014,0

Design/methodology/approachL. paracasei cells were encapsulated through unique pH triggered gelation technique using combination of sodium caseinate-gellan gum as protective shell material. MPC was also used to improve physico-chemical indices of probiotic yogurt at different levels (0-3 percent). Findings The results showed that yogurt samples containing encapsulated L. paracasei showed lower post-acidification and higher viability. Samples containing encapsulated L. paracasei showed less syneresis amount, due to possible hydration of shell material, also application of MPC could reduce this attribute during storage time. The numbers of probiotic bacteria were remained above the recommended therapeutic minimum throughout the samples. Practical implications The findings suggest a practical ingredient in probiotic dairy product. Simultaneous usage of this kind of encapsulation via MPC enhanced sensorial and physical properties of probiotic yogurt while of no reduction in viable counts survival.

Marketing cooperatives in the agricultural sector are hotly debated worldwide. The main benefits of collective actions can include the benefits of size, sharing of knowledge and information, effective solution of local problems. To support collective actions the governments of all these three countries had decided to support the creation of marketing organisations after joining the EU. For that reason they provided public financial support for newly established producer groups and the allocation was realized on the basis of the Rural Development Programme with the aim, among others, to increase market share potential of individual farmers. Based on data obtained from paying agencies, it can be concluded that there were not established a large number of market-significant groups within individual states and commodity groups. Only in Slovakia, under the first programming period, there were groups with a significant share, i.e. a share above 15%. In the next period, as in other countries, only cooperatives with a low share on the relevant market were supported. At the same time it was found that the rate of sales of active entities did not change significantly between Czech and Slovak entities. In most cases, sales are in the range of (sic) 1-5 million.

Bitcoins are part of financial activities directly connected to IT sector, but due to the challenges they have recently caused they became the subject of legislative interest. The greatest problem of cryptocurrencies is the lack of specific legal regulation. The national legislation of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina on prevention of money laundering did not include virtual money as a potential means of money laundering yet. When something is not regulated it is the opportunity for frauds and other malversations. The authors elaborate procedures of obtaining the evidences on money laundering and point out future challenges and difficulties of possible money laundering throughout the cryptocurrencies on national and international level. They emphasize the role of the insurance industry in recognition of cryptocurrencies as the new industry and part of financial market.

An additional aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the measure used to assess food-related self-control in order to reveal potential multi-dimensionality. Design/methodology/approach - A web-based survey was conducted among 694 Norwegian high school students. Multiple logistic regression was used to explore associations between the independent variables and SSB consumption. Psychometric evaluation of the self-control measure included factor analysis and internal consistency reliability. Findings - Factor analysis resulted in two food-related self-control dimensions: resistance and avoidance. Multiple logistic regression showed that intentions was the strongest predictor of SSB consumption in the sample. Avoidance and descriptive peer norms appeared as weaker predictors. Research limitations/implications - Based on the findings, the authors suggest that future studies may consider developing guiding principles on how to create health-promoting eating intentions in adolescents, how to deal with peer norms related to foods and beverages and how to avoid tempting stimuli in the environment. Such strategies may be helpful when structural changes in the environment are not feasible in the near future. Originality/value - An original aspect of the present study is that it includes a psychometric analysis of a supposedly one-dimensional self-control measure. Further, it adds to the knowledge about variables associated with adolescent SSB consumption in a school lunch context.","[Melbye, Elisabeth Lind] Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, Stavanger, Norway; [Helland, Merete Hagen] Univ Stavanger, Fac Arts & Educ, Dept Educ & Sports Sci, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Melbye, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, Stavanger, Norway.",elisabeth.l.malbye@uis.no,,"Helland, Merete Hagen/0000-0002-7470-6335",,,,,68,3,3,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach Classic quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) and temporal dominance of sensations (TDS) were applied to four brands of bottled mineral water and the liking of the products was evaluated by consumers. Findings The dissolved mineral concentration is highly correlated to the liking and influences the sensory profile of the samples in a substantial way. The higher the mineral content, the lowest is the liking. Refreshing, residual plastic taste, musty, metallic taste, medicine taste and viscosity were relevant attributes to the samples differentiation through the static evaluation, while refreshing and viscosity were dominant in the dynamic monitoring. Some information might have been lost by the nature of the TDS method, based on dominance concept. Sweet taste contributed positively and musty taste negatively to the acceptance.

These aspects lead to the fact that individuals and families find themselves in poverty, which is accompanied by social exclusion. In the Slovak Republic, we are seeing an increasing incidence of visible poverty caused by a change in the nature of poverty, from horizontal to vertical. The causes of poverty are mainly related to the loss of work. Loss of regular income leads to people's inability to secure basic living needs. New poverty affects the unemployed, people who are disadvantaged on the labor market, and people with low earnings - working poor. The disadvantaged groups on the labor market include people with health problems, with reduced working capacity, with low skills, ethnic groups, especially Roma.

The purpose of this paper is to describe secondary school students' perceptions of Indian school canteens. Design/methodology/approach - Convenience sampling informed the recruitment of 1,026 year 9 students from nine private schools in Kolkata, India, and data were collected through self-completion of paper-based questionnaires. Frequencies and chi(2) analyses were computed. Findings - The school children reported that energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods like French fries (90.4 per cent), pizza (79.5 per cent) and cakes (69.2 per cent) were frequently available in the school canteens. However, only a few students (10.2 per cent) acknowledged the availability of nutritious foods like fruits. Only a small proportion of students were content with the nutritional quality of food supplied in the canteens (3.6 per cent), the cost of food (8.7 per cent) and availability of fresh foods like fruits (5.5 per cent). The provision of healthy foods in the school canteen was supported by two-thirds of the respondents (65.9 per cent); however, only a small proportion (18.3 per cent) supported the restriction of fried foods in school canteens. Practical implications - These findings underscore the need for the design and implementation of healthy school canteen policies to foster healthy eating habits among Indian adolescents.

Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey of 141 consumers reveals their opinions about TTSs. In addition, semi-structured interviews with seven retail managers, four government officials and one blockchain service provider (Project Provenance Ltd) provide expert insights. Findings The results demonstrate that consumers are overwhelmed by the amount and complexity of certification labels. As a TTS, BCT implementation appears to have significant positive influences on consumers' purchasing decisions, mediated by consumers' quality perceptions. This study reveals the discordant perspectives of different stakeholders with regard to the importance of a BCT-based TTS. Originality/value This study investigates current TTSs and certification labels, and probes customer perception of a potential BCT-based solution for meat traceability. Changes to supply chains' mentality and the active establishment of trust in BCT applications are needed.

The adoption of BCT, in combination with DNA coding, seems promising as a solution to many of the issues that currently plague TTSs.","[Sander, Fabian] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Semeijn, Janjaap] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Mkt & SCM, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Mahr, Dominik] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Serv Sci Factory, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Sander, F (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Maastricht, Netherlands.",fabian-sander@outlook.com; j.semeijn@maastrichtuniversity.nl; d.mahr@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"semeijn, janjaap/A-8675-2017",,,,,,34,133,138,4,255,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The research object is stroke survivors' family caregivers. Two methods - survey and qualitative content analysis - were applied in this study. Total of 51 caregiver in the survey completed a self-administered questionnaire, and 100 articles in the Internet have been analysed. The study results show that the Internet is an important source to obtain information about stroke and caregivers who search information on the Internet feel less informed about several stroke related issues.

Knowledge and scientific knowledge are an important attribute of the present era, which increases the importance of human capital development. Each of us has an impact on the lives of people around the world, and people in other parts of the world are also influencing our lives. In order to better know these connections and to be able to positively change the environment around us and the whole planet, it is essential to innovate all forms of education so that the acquired education is a prerequisite for ensuring a quality life. Based on the results of sociological research, insufficient education makes it impossible to get better work and thus a higher standard of living. People with lower education buy statistically unhealthy food, which is cheaper, have a demanding manual job, and are often unable to provide quality housing that allows personality development. People who have just the knowledge they need to live their lives can fulfill their lives by doing what they want to achieve. However, if they live in a society where higher education is a vision for a better life, the educational factor has an impact on overall quality life. The contribution focuses on the analysis of the level of education, the level of income and the possibility to live in the Slovak Republic in the context of global differences. The level and differentiation of employees' salaries in the context of globalization processes has been a problem for a longer time. Inadequate income make a polarization within society, degrades the behavior of households, their economy, and consequently the economy of public institutions, the functioning of organizations and the entire economic system. As the real estate prices do not coincide with local revenues in the economy, the real economy is exposed to credit-deformation distortions, which has an impact on the distortion of financial flows.","[Vidova, Jarmila] Univ Econ, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85104, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Vidova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Econ Policy, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85104, Slovakia.",vidova@euba.sk,,,[VEGA 1/0002/16],,The scientific article is the solution of the research project VEGA 1/0002/16 Socio-economic aspects of housing policy in the context of migration workforce.,,18,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,211,218,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600025,0

Evidence through the early 1990s suggested these banks are relatively inefficient. This study updates that research, using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and panel data from 2003 to 2014 on minority owned banks and other banks. It is, as far as we know, the first such study to exclude outliers in SFA estimation, while recovering the outliers for efficiency estimation. Initial results identify a disruption in cost efficiency during 2008, with statistically distinct regimes for 2003-2007 and 2009-2014. Including recovered observations alters the patterns of MOB efficiency in significant ways, and leads us to conclude that current MOB inefficiency is mainly limited to Asian American owned and Multi-racial and minority serving banks. Tests for the effects of government deposits under a U.S. Treasury program suggest these did not adversely effect efficiency among covered MOBs, but may have improved survival rates for those MOBs subsequent to the financial collapse.","[Kashian, Russell; McGregory, Richard] Univ Wisconsin Whitewater, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Drago, Robert] Precis Numer, 464 Dickinson St,Suite 5, Springfield, MA 01108 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Whitewater,"Kashian, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Whitewater, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",kashianr@uww.edu; mcgregor@uww.edu; robert.drago44@gmail.com,"McGregory, Richard/ABG-9636-2021","McGregory, Richard/0000-0002-1664-2724",,,,,77,7,10,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-562X,1573-0441,,J PROD ANAL,J.

Regional studies of this kind are rare, and this is only the second-ever attempt at covering such a long period. Consistent with recent research conducted on other European areas, during the early modern period we find clear indications of a tendency for economic inequality to grow continually, a finding that for Tuscany cannot be explained as the consequence of economic growth. Furthermore, the exceptionally old sources we use allow us to demonstrate that a phase of declining inequality, lasting about one century, was triggered by the Black Death from 1348 to 1349. This finding challenges earlier scholarship and significantly alters our understanding of the economic consequences of the Black Death.","[Alfani, Guido] PAM Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, Milan, Italy; [Alfani, Guido] IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Ammannati, Francesco] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Alfani, G (通讯作者)，PAM Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, Milan, Italy.;Alfani, G (通讯作者)，IGIER, Milan, Italy.",,"Ammannati, Francesco/IZE-9234-2023; Alfani, Guido/AAF-6090-2020","Ammannati, Francesco/0000-0002-4820-4390; ALFANI, GUIDO/0000-0001-5534-8694",European Research Council under the European Union [283802]; European Research Council (ERC) [283802] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Conchita D'Ambrosio, Richard Goldthwaite, Paolo Malanima, Branko Milanovic, Tommy Murphy, John Padgett, Marco Percoco, Giuliano Pinto, Jaime Reis, Wouter Ryckbosch, Francesco Scalone, Federico Tadei, participants at the conference session 'Economic inequality and population dynamics' (European Social Science History Conference, Vienna, Austria, April 2014) and seminar participants at Bocconi University, at the University of Pisa, and at Utrecht University for their many helpful comments.

It develops a legitimacy framework that builds on elements of Scharpf (J Eur Pub Policy 4(1):18-36, 1997) input and output legitimacy concept and the political economy lens described by Brockhaus and Angelsen (Analysing REDD+: Challenges and choices, CIFOR, Bogor, 2012). Using data collected through key informant interviews and focus groups, we identify and explore stakeholder perceptions of legitimacy. The analysis reveals a complex interplay between input and output legitimacy, finding that state, non-state and hybrid actors perceive output legitimacy (i.e. project outcomes) as highly dependent on the level of input legitimacy achieved during the governance process. Non-state actors perceive proxies for input legitimacy, such as participation and inclusion of local people, as goals in themselves. In the main, they perceive inclusion to be integral to the empowerment of local people. They perceive output legitimacy as less important because of the intangibility of REDD+ outcomes at this stage in the process. The findings also highlight the challenges associated with measuring the legitimacy of REDD+ governance in Indonesia.","[Glover, Adelaide; Schroeder, Heike] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Glover, A (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",adelaide.glover@gmail.com,,"Schroeder, Heike/0000-0003-2342-2030",,,,,42,7,7,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The distance function approach allows the researcher to estimate technical efficiency including both on-field and off-field production, which is important in the case of English football where clubs are generally thought to maximize something other than profit. On-field production is measured using total league points, and off-field production is measured using total revenue. The data set consists of 2177 club-level observations on 88 clubs that competed in the four divisions of professional football in England over the 29-season period from 1981/82 to 2009/10. The results show evidence of three separate productivity classes in English football. As might be expected, technical efficiency estimated using the latent class model is, on average, higher than technical efficiency using an alternative method which confines heterogeneity to the intercept coefficient. Specifically, average efficiency for the sample is 87.3 and 93.2% for the random-intercept model and the latent class model respectively.","[Jewell, R.

By including carbon offsets directly in the objective function of a Markov decision process (MDP) model, we find long-term trade-offs exist between economic and ecological outcomes. An economic supply schedule is provided, which shows an exponential increase in the cost of sequestration. Moderate carbon prices effectively sequester additional CO2 from the atmosphere while having a positive impact on ecological indicators such as size and species diversity. In contrast, high carbon prices promote more of a monoculture in order to maximize expected forest value in the long run from carbon sequestration. This study finds evidence that the optimal adaptive decisions are sensitive to the magnitude of carbon prices, and consequently, so too are ecological outcomes. While some governments acknowledge the influence carbon markets have on the ecological integrity of the forest, fluctuations in carbon prices within a cap-and-trade market likely influence the optimal decision making of the forest manager, and thus, the ecological landscape of the forest itself.

It uses previously unexploited data consisting of the incomes and household details of some 500 civil servants. An extension of Becker's model of household production is set out and an ordered probit statistical model of servant demand is estimated. The results confirm the importance of income but also show that the demographic composition of the household was of significance. These results are interpreted in terms of age-and gender-related differences in the supply of labour and the demand for market goods. The results are consistent with the view that middle-class Edwardian households should be understood as sites of production as well as consumption. A comparison of the statistical results with contemporary recommendations in manuals of household management suggests that those recommendations were typically over-optimistic. The article presents a 'ready reckoner' whereby household income may be estimated from the number of resident servants, but caution in its use is urged.","[Outram, Quentin] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Outram, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",,"Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023",,,,,,57,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Combining the new series with information from other parts of Europe establishes two stages of real wage divergence during the seventeenth to nineteenth century. The first occurred in the middle of the seventeenth century when real wages in centres of trade and finance located on the rim of the North Sea rose far above the level prevailing in their hinterland. The second stage unfolded from the second quarter of the eighteenth century when the real wage in south England, northern and central Italy, and Germany began to diverge; Germany followed a middle path between the other two countries. The second commercial revolution, which improved business techniques and promoted Smithian growth, goes a long way towards accounting for this development.","[Pfister, Ulrich] Westfal Wilhelms Univ, Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Pfister, U (通讯作者)，Westfal Wilhelms Univ, Munster, Germany.",,,,,,,,0,23,24,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Taking Wealth into Account,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,HOUSEHOLD WEALTH; CARBON TAX; CONSUMPTION; LIFETIME; CLIMATE; ENERGY; PAYS,"Poterba(1991a) has much influenced the literature on the distributional effects of carbon pricing. Poterba argues that the incidence of energy/environmental taxes across households is better appreciated if the relative tax burdens are measured against total expenditure, interpreted as a proxy for lifetime income, instead of annual-income. This way, however, since the distribution of total expenditure is structurally more uniform, the incidence of energy price increases is always less regressive than when annual income is used. This outcome is often taken to lessen the relevance of equity concerns regarding carbon pricing. Almost twenty-five years after Poterba (1991a), Piketty (2014) revived the idea that wealth is a dimension of economic welfare constituting an increasingly important source of inequality. We show that omitting wealth in measuring ability to pay means underestimating the regressivity of carbon pricing and its inequity towards younger people. Using household-level data and statistical matching, we revisit Poterba's application and compare the distributional incidence of the US gasoline tax for different measures of ability to pay: total expenditure, income and wealth-adjusted income. Regressivity is not a reason to forgo carbon pricing as a cost-effective approach to climate mitigation, but calls for consideration and compensation of the distributional effects.

Failure to balance mitigation measures targeting dissolved inorganic P (DIP) and Pin eroded soil (PP) may lead to economically inefficient measures at best, and to aggravated eutrophication at worst. We model dynamically optimal eutrophication management in a P-limited and SO4-containing water body by taking into account the O-2 available and the coupling between the C, Fe, S and P cycles. We show that optimal management would put more weight on mitigating DIP than PP, and that the emphasis on DIP should be particularly strong in eutrophic water bodies. To foster influential and cost-efficient policies, we urge defining water body-specific multipliers to commensurate the main P forms into eutrophying phosphorus, much as greenhouse gases are converted to their CO2 equivalents.

Health care is supplied for free by the public health sector, but patients can choose to address their demand elsewhere by stipulating a private health care insurance policy to avoid restrictions. Our model shows that if the individual response to treatment is independent of income and cannot be observed by the patient, the choice of opting out simply depends on income, and the redistributive effects of both instruments are quite similar. In general, restrictions may only improve welfare of relatively rich individuals, usually those that opt out of the public health care system.

A unique data set on harvests, deaths, marriages and births going back to 1630 is used to calculate cumulative elasticities of vital rates with respect to harvest. While earlier studies have mostly focused on the impact of real wage, this study uses the calorie content of per capita harvests as an indicator of living standards. It finds that there indeed was a response of vital rates to harvest fluctuations, but there were important structural breaks. While positive checks attenuated after 1720, preventive checks were strengthened. After 1870 preventive checks disappeared, and possibly also positive checks. The results are robust to different models and trend specifications, with one crucial difference: while the distributed lag model shows that positive checks were significant up to 1920, the SVAR model shows that positive checks disappeared after 1870.","[Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin] Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Stockholm, Sweden; [Edvinsson, Rodney Benjamin] Swedish Coll Adv Study, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study (SCAS),"Edvinsson, RB (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ Hist, Stockholm, Sweden.;Edvinsson, RB (通讯作者)，Swedish Coll Adv Study, Uppsala, Sweden.",rodney.edvinsson@ekohist.su.se,,"Edvinsson, Rodney/0000-0002-3069-3819",Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse; Ragnar Soderbergs stiftelse; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study; Vetenskapsradet,Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse; Ragnar Soderbergs stiftelse; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study; Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council),"The author is grateful for financial support from Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse, Ragnar Soderbergs stiftelse, Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study, and Vetenskapsradet.

The emerging field of neuroeconomics, which assesses the neuroscience underlying decision-making, plots a promising course to explore the mechanisms underlying complex environmental valuation decisions. Neuroeconomic methods offer a unique capacity to isolate value components that contribute to willingness-to-pay (WTP), separating an individual's response to natural resource attributes that are of interest to economists from other attributes or influences on the decision process. Neuroimaging data can also aid in understanding differences in response between preference elicitation techniques and identifying the use of different decision processes and heuristics during valuation. This article surveys the benefits and limitations of using neuroeconomics methods to assess the value of environmental goods, and focuses on three examples where neuroeconomics may inform environmental valuation: protest responses, comparison of hypothetical and consequential choice contexts, and the evaluation of environmental attributes and optimization of study design in stated choice experiments. Neuroeconomics methods offer a foundation for positive collaboration between environmental economists and cognitive neuroscientists, yielding metrics that complement and augment current stated preference methods of determining environmental valuation.

Since its entry into force, the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) has stimulated tremendous investments in renewable energy capacities by guaranteeing investors a fixed price per kWh as well as a preferred feed into the grid over electricity from conventional sources. The policy measures are financed by a surcharge on electricity prices. In recent years, a controversy has arisen about potentially negative regional and social distribution effects. In this paper, multiregional price and quantity input-output models with endogenous heterogeneous households are used to trace the indirect impacts of the EEG on value added and disposable income through the complex network of regional value chains. Our findings suggest that the generation of electricity from renewable sources itself leads to small positive impacts on industries, but leads to a significant drain on household income and'has regressive distributive effects. However, investment in new capacities may possibly transform these negative impacts into a positive direction for the majority of households. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The use and validity of human rights norms in UN climate negotiations,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; UNFCCC; Human rights; International negotiations; Linkages; Frame alignment,ISSUE-LINKAGE; REGIMES; STATES,"Since its inception, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has been inclined to natural scientific and technocratic perceptions of climate change challenges and policy solutions. Furthermore, states have traditionally been depicted as the main subjects of international climate politics. Only in 2010, concrete references to human rights were incorporated into UN climate agreements. This has a double binding force: First, states thereby re-emphasize the principal validity of those standards that they have acknowledged-qua signature and/or ratification-as guiding their actions: the social and political rights that are captured in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the two binding human rights covenants. Second, the incorporation of human rights norms into UN climate agreements officially and formally broadens the normative scope of negotiating and implementing these policies. However, after 2010, states have neither substantiated this engagement nor further built on it argumentatively. In contrast, human rights references are-again-mostly absent from states' positioning in UNFCCC politics. In this article, we aim at explaining this empirical puzzle. In the first part, we elaborate our theoretical approach and carve out the functional, political and legal linkages between human rights and climate politics. Building upon participatory observation, expert interviews and analysis of primary and secondary documents, this will then be followed by explaining parties' anew reluctance to further apply a human rights-based approach in climate politics.","[Wallbott, Linda] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany; [Schapper, Andrea] Univ Stirling, Stirling, Scotland",University of Munster; University of Stirling,"Wallbott, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Munster, Germany.",wallbott@uni-muenster.de; andrea.schapper@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,79,8,8,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

To what extent is this decline the result of water policy vs. other exogenous changes? Many municipalities implement multiple water-focused policies simultaneously - while still subject to other exogenous drivers - so it is important to pair policy evaluations with approaches that examine multiple drivers of water use. The importance of water policy, infrastructure change, and broader technological and demographic trends in influencing water demand has not been measured. We demonstrate a novel method for decomposing multiple drivers of consumption using a dataset of neighborhood water consumption, home infrastructure characteristics, and vegetation in Las Vegas. The largest measureable factor driving conservation for Las Vegas as a whole is lower consumption from new homes, while in established neighborhoods it is declining vegetation area. However, factors we measure directly account for only half of the observed consumption decline. This provides indirect evidence that consumption declines coincident with a drought alert, increased water waste enforcement, and other policy responses also played an important role in conservation. An array of approaches directed at both infrastructure and behavior can effectively reduce consumption. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Epistemic ambiguity in the climate finance system,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate finance; Adaptation; Ambiguity; Principal; agent theory; Delegation,INTERNATIONAL-ORGANIZATIONS; MONEY,"Over the past decade developed states have committed significant public financing for climate change adaptation. Much of this public financing flows through international development organizations. States have delegated the implementation and monitoring of adaptation to existing international organizations such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Scholars have noted that states delegate discretion to specialized organizations to perform a task on their behalf, but have not explored how uncertainties about the nature of the task affect delegation. This article addresses this gap by distinguishing the concept of epistemic ambiguity (when states are uncertain about the exact nature of a task) from strategic ambiguity (when states do not reach consensus over a task due to political differences) in order to address the question: how have states and international organizations defined and implemented adaptation activities? The question is answered through case studies of: (1) adaptation projects administered by the United Nations Development Programme and the International Organization for Migration in Kenya; and (2) states' and international organizations' attempts to develop methodologies for reporting adaptation financing. The case studies are based on: primary documents published by states and international organizations, secondary literature on climate finance, and interviews with adaptation experts. This article argues that states have not precisely defined adaptation, and that this is substantially due to epistemic ambiguity. It then identifies two consequences of epistemic ambiguity: a proliferation of activities labelled as adaptation, and difficulties tracking and monitoring adaptation assistance.","[Hall, Nina] Hertie Sch Governance, 180 Friedrichstr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Hertie School,"Hall, N (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, 180 Friedrichstr, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",hall@hertie-school.org,"Hall, Nina/AAQ-2987-2020","Hall, Nina/0000-0002-6318-9029",,,,,54,29,32,5,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - The AHP was used as amulti-criteria decision analysis. Data were obtained from a face-to-face questionnaire completed by 122 consumers in a controlled environment in Cataluna (Spain). Findings - Results showed the capacity of the AHP to analyse consumers' acceptance and preferences. An agreement between the AHP and the nine-point scale was found showing that n-3 enriched eggs had lower flavour acceptance, conventional eggs had higher yolk colour acceptance, and conventional and the free-range eggs had similar and higher odour acceptance than the other egg types. The most important attributes that determine preferences for egg purchase were the type and the egg price followed by the origin and the egg size. Research limitations/implications - The AHP approach seems to be a reliable tool to evaluate consumers' hedonic preferences. However, further testing on other food products with larger sample size is needed. Originality/value - The AHP methodology has been widely used in many fields in the last decades, but to the knowledge, not in the sensory field. In the Spanish market, studies that analyse consumers' preferences and acceptance of eggs are scarce, and new insights are needed particularly regarding n-3 enriched eggs.","[Baba, Yasmina] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Inst Sostenibilidad, Barcelona, Spain; [Kallas, Zein] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, Barcelona, Spain; [Realini, Carolina] Univ Republ Uruguay, Fac Ciencias, Polo Rumiantes, Salto, Uruguay","Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Kallas, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, Ctr Agrofood Econ & Dev, Barcelona, Spain.",zein.kallas@upc.edu,"kallas, zein/G-5620-2010","kallas, zein/0000-0003-2870-3691; Realini, Carolina/0000-0003-2036-316X",,,,,41,6,8,2,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Air velocity was simulated and the predicted air velocity field in the container was validated by velocity measurements in the real storage container using a thermal anemometer. Subsequently, O-2 gas transport was simulated using the validated velocity field. The gas transport model was validated based on measurements of the O-2 partial pressure as a function of time at a fixed position in the storage container. The model was used to simulate the spatiotemporal O-2 gas evolution in the storage container during a respiration quotient (RQ) measurement period. Gas gradients in the container atmosphere were found to be negligible. Large O-2 concentration gradients were found inside the stored fruit.","[Bessemans, N.; Delele, M.

To establish the causal relationship between education and green behaviours, we exploit the instrumental variables strategy using the supply of state primary schooling i.e. the corresponding number of teachers per 1000 children, which varies over time and across regions as the instrument, while controlling for regional, cohort and income effects. We find that more years of schooling lead to a greater probability of taking knowledge-based environmentally-friendly actions a great deal, but not cost-saving pro-environmental actions.

There was a growing controversy of objectivists vs. relativists. The objectivists have stated that values are universal, and therefore the same for all people (the same values are respected and despised by all). Relativists, in turn, recognized that everything is subjective (depending on personal preferences and needs) and relative (has value, but only with other factors). This dispute has not been resolved. Disputes on this subject continue to this day, although they do not create conflicts like in the past. The aim of the paper is to discuss the theoretical assumptions of the objectivist and relativistic viewpoint, and to try to determine, based on the results of the research, which is more often represented by the employees. This will allow us to determine the morality of the studied population, which is to determine what it depends on, what is appreciated, what is acceptable and what is unacceptable, and whether the researched staff is inclined to bend the rules in the name of ad hoc benefits. Defining these ethical standards has important implications in the management of people and should therefore be an important aspect of personnel management.","[Czarnecka, Aleksandra; Albrychiewicz-Slocinska, Anna; Skiba, Lukasz] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Sociol & Psychol Management Dept, Fac Management, Ul Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland; [Poor, Jozsef] Szent Istvan Univ, Pater K U 1,Room 4027, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Paven, Ionela Gavrila] 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Str Gabriel Bethlen 5, Alba Iulia 510009, Romania",Technical University Czestochowa; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; 1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia,"Czarnecka, A (通讯作者)，Czestochowa Tech Univ, Sociol & Psychol Management Dept, Fac Management, Ul Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland.",aczar11@tlen.pl; slocinska@wp.pl; ionelapaven@yahoo.com; poorjf@t-online.hu; lukabi@wp.pl,"Czarnecka, Aleksandra/AAN-1695-2021; Poór, József/AAL-4421-2021; Ionela, Gavrila-Paven/A-7696-2019","Poór, József/0000-0002-6873-0646; Czarnecka, Aleksandra/0000-0003-1477-9468",,,,,15,0,0,0,5,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,313,320,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300038,0

But the high price of wheat in the global market puts financial stress on low-income people, especially on those living in tropical regions, where wheat does not thrive well. They depend solely on imported wheat, which is expensive due to importation cost, or seek other relatively less-nutritious cereals. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of supplementing wheat flour with flour from relatively cheap and easy-to-produce root tuber, such as cassava, potato and sweet potato. Design/methodology/approach - Strong-, medium- and weak-gluten wheat flours were supplemented with flour from cassava, potato and sweet potato at 10, 20 and 30 percent. Strong gluten composites were used to make bread, whereas medium and weak gluten composites were used for cookie and noodle production, respectively. Protein, ash, fat, crude fiber, moisture, carbohydrate, gluten, zeleny and energy contents of each composite were tested. Findings - The nutritional and sensory quality of bread, cookies and noodles made from wheat flour supplemented with root tuber flour at 10, 20 and 30 percent was assessed. Results revealed that mixing wheat flour and root tuber flour has important effects on the moisture, protein, carbohydrate, fat, ash, gluten, zeleny sedimentation value and crude fiber content of the resulting mixture. Moisture and carbohydrate increased while protein and fat significantly (p<0.05) decreased with increasing root tuber flour levels in formulations. Gluten content also decreased significantly with rising root tuber flour concentrations. There was a mild reduction in bread's general acceptability at 10 and 20 percent in potato composites; thus potato flour was still acceptable at 20 percent. Cassava flour composite also topped with a general acceptability score of 69.26 at 20 percent in cookies, whereas sweet potato composite achieved a score of 84.81 in noodles. Originality/value - This work has successfully confirmed that wheat flour could be supplemented up to 20 percent with root tuber flour without compromising the nutritional and sensory quality of products. It has also demonstrated that different products require different root tuber flour substitution for optimum results. Potato at 10 percent substitution was found to be best for bread production. Cassava and sweet potato at 10 percent substitution were also best for cookies and noodles, respectively. With respect to protein content only, sweet potato substitution is better than cassava and potato.","[Dankwa, Kwame Obeng; Liu, Yu-Jiao] Sichuan Agr Univ, Triticeae Res Inst, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Pu, Zhi-En] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Sichuan Agricultural University; Sichuan Agricultural University,"Pu, ZE (通讯作者)，Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",puzhien@sicau.edu.cn,,"Dankwa, Kwame Obeng/0000-0002-3284-2689","National Basic Research Program of China [2014CB147200]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31171555, 31230053, 31571654]",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors would like to offer a special thanks to Dr Ji-Rui Wang for supervising this work.

We then track the evolution of the sampled working skills across three centuries of English history, from 1550 to 1850. We observe a modest rise in the share of 'high-quality workmen' deemed necessary by Mokyr and others to facilitate the Industrial Revolution, including machine erectors and operators. But we also find remarkable growth in the share of unskilled workers, rising from 20 % in the late sixteenth century to nearly 40 % in the early nineteenth century, caused mainly by falling shares of semi-skilled, blue-collar workers. Close inspection of the occupational structures within the main sectors of production suggests that deskilling occurred in agriculture and industry alike, prompted by land concentration in agriculture and workshop-to-factory changes in industry.","[de Pleijt, Alexandra M.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [de Pleijt, Alexandra M.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Weisdorf, Jacob L.] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; [Weisdorf, Jacob L.] CEPR, London, England",Utrecht University; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Southern Denmark; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"de Pleijt, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.;de Pleijt, AM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England.",A.M.dePleijt@uu.nl; jacobw@sam.sdu.dk,,,ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,40,26,26,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,JAN,2017,11.0,1,,,,,1,30,,10.1007/s11698-016-0140-y,0.0,,,30,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,EK0BL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393591300001,0

While this opens opportunities for entrepreneurs, concerns with regards to sustainability in terms of water, energy and economy need attention. Water is scarce at some places, fossil energy is expensive, and profits and costs that are associated with greenhouse types and production levels determine the economic sustainability. The environmental and economic sustainability of greenhouses with different technological levels in the states of Aguascalientes, Queretaro and Sinaloa in Mexico was investigated. Aguascalientes and Queretaro are located in central Mexico at high altitudes, and Sinaloa is located along the north-western coast. Their climates differ substantially. Seven scenarios were assessed, ranging from a naturally ventilated greenhouse with a soil-grown crop to a greenhouse with much technology. The 'adaptive greenhouse approach' was used, combining the KASPRO greenhouse simulation model, the INTKAM simulation model for crop growth and development, and a financial model. Increasing technology results in increased production. With increased technology, water consumption increases (except at the highest level of technology), but energy consumption decreases (except in a greenhouse with a screen and a glass-covered greenhouse). Net income is highest for a glass-covered greenhouse for Aguascalientes and Queretaro, and for a plastic film greenhouse with heating, CO2, misting and screens for Sinaloa. If the most simple and most advanced greenhouses for Aguascalientes and Queretaro are excluded (as they are of very different technological levels), then pay-back periods for the remaining scenarios do not differ much. The pay-back period for Sinaloa is shortest for a plastic greenhouse with heating and CO2. Developmental opportunities exist in the (further) introduction of recirculation systems (water saving), heating (production, net income), screens and glass greenhouse cover (energy saving, production, net income), geothermal energy and solar panels (renewable energy).","[Elings, A.; Speetjens, B.; Victoria, N.

Particular micro enterprises accounted for almost 93% of all enterprises in the non-financial business sector and generated for 37% of the growth in total employmentin 2015. In recent years micro and young SMEs of no more than nine years of age were the main net employment creators. But, as new businesses being born every year, many of them fail in their early years. Some were closed voluntarily, while many of them were liquidated or went bankrupt. Moreover, despite previous business failure, many entrepreneurs, so called re-starters would like to create a new business, but they face numerous obstacles in doing so. Consequently, it produces negative effects on economic growth and employment creation in the European economy. In response to such concerns and to stimulate entrepreneurship, the European Commission launched in 2014 Recommendation on a new approach to business failure and insolvency, following a second chance principle of the Small Business Act for the Europe adopted in 2008. Using newly gathered data from the SME Performance Review Annual Report on European SMEs 2015/2016 and Special Study accompanying Annual Report, this paper outlines the main features and challenges faced by re-starters. The results of this study suggests that further progress in implementing the second chance principle, primarily, reducing the discharge from bankruptcy for honest entrepreneurs is essential in creating new businesses.","[Harc, Martina] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Sci Res & Artist Work Osijek, F Kuhaca 29-I, Osijek 3100, Croatia",Croatian Academy of Sciences & Arts,"Harc, M (通讯作者)，Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Sci Res & Artist Work Osijek, F Kuhaca 29-I, Osijek 3100, Croatia.",harcm@hazu.hr,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,183,191,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500016,0

Furthermore, the study examines the role of health consciousness in achieving life equilibrium. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework was developed based on previous research and tested through a quantitative study with end consumers. The hypothesized relationships were tested using structural equation modelling. Findings - The results obtained from this study show that the perceived quality associated with the intrinsic attributes of organic food mediates a positive influence of life equilibrium on consumers' organic food purchase intentions. The study also confirms that life equilibrium mediates the effects of health consciousness on the evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic food quality attributes. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical contributions of the paper lie in uncovering the complex relationships that exist among health consciousness, life equilibrium, perceived organic food quality dimensions and purchase intentions and providing new evidence showing which perceived intrinsic organic food quality dimensions are relevant in shaping consumers' purchase intentions. Practical implications - The research results suggest that organic food managers should focus on developing stronger value propositions that are based more on intrinsic food quality characteristics and less on extrinsic ones. Originality/value - This study recognizes the relevance of life equilibrium as a specific consumer lifestyle form, which drives organic food consumption through extrinsic and intrinsic food quality attributes.","[Husic-Mehmedovic, Melika; Arslanagic-Kalajdzic, Maja; Kadic-Maglajlic, Selma; Vajnberger, Zlatan] Univ Sarajevu, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Husic-Mehmedovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevu, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",melika.husic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Husic-Mehmedovic, Melika/C-3420-2019; Arslanagic-Kalajdzic, Maja/V-1582-2018; Kadic-Maglajlic, Selma/D-1594-2012","Husic-Mehmedovic, Melika/0000-0002-0802-2752; Arslanagic-Kalajdzic, Maja/0000-0002-4954-782X; Kadic-Maglajlic, Selma/0000-0002-1169-1623",,,,,60,29,29,2,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Specific climatic gradients can cause significant differences in terms of yield, productivity, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the plants, as well as the development of various diseases. This work presents the development of a distributed monitoring system using a wireless sensor network (WSN) in a commercial greenhouse, towards the realization of a spatially distributed control methodology, based on specific spatial variations of the measured environmental variables. The distributed measurements acquired by the wireless nodes are analysed to represent the spatial variation of the environmental conditions inside the greenhouse, which can subsequently be used to develop precise control strategies that could lead to more uniform conditions throughout the entire cultivation area and better control of crop needs. In this way, uniform quantity and quality of produce can be achieved, while the risk of diseases at specific problematic regions of the greenhouse could be minimized. Analysis based on WSN measurements during summer and winter periods showed significant spatial variability in temperature and humidity, but also in transpiration and conditions that favour condensation on leaves surface.","[Katsoulas, N.; Tzounis, A.; Kittas, C.] Univ Thessaly, Dept Agr Crop Prod & Rural Environm, Volos, Greece; [Katsoulas, N.; Ferentinos, K.

EXTRACTS; GREEN TEA,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential of fruit waste materials from fruit industry as sources of powerful natural antioxidants. Design/methodology/approach - The peels of mango, rambutan, and santol were extracted and analyzed for their antioxidant activity. Pork ball samples were prepared and treated with different natural extracts at various concentrations, namely 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20% (v/w), compared with the control (no natural extract), and then stored at 4 degrees C. The samples were investigated at the zeroth, third, fifth, eighth and tenth day to find out the antioxidant activity of the total phenolic content and lipid oxidation including the evaluation of the change of rancid flavor and color during storage. All statistical results were analyzed by RCBD using SPSS at p <= 0.05. Findings - During storage, the amount of phenolic compound in a pork ball by adding fruit extracts at various concentrations slightly decreased, while the lipid oxidation slightly increased. Mango extract showed the best efficiency to delay lipid oxidation in the pork ball for ten days followed by santol extract and rambutan extract. For sensory evaluation, the pork ball with fruit extract at various concentrations showed the lower rancidity development than control, and mango extract at 0.20% (v/w) showed the best delaying rancidity during ten-day storage. Thus, mango peel extract at 0.20% (v/w) showed the highest effectiveness of antioxidant activity against lipid oxidation in pork ball. Originality/value - This study was continued from the previous research which investigated the best extraction condition for by-products of mango, rambutan, and santol. From that study, the authors found that the crude extracts need further research on their antioxidant property in foods. The research findings have provided information regarding the interesting new natural antioxidant that can be applied into lipid-containing foods to delay the rancidity and extend the shelf life.","[Klinjapo, Roungdao; Areerat, Kamonchanok] Assumption Univ, Fac Biotechnol, Dept Food Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Sutthirak, Pornpong] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Sci & Ind Technol, Surat Thani, Thailand",Prince of Songkla University,"Klinjapo, R (通讯作者)，Assumption Univ, Fac Biotechnol, Dept Food Technol, Bangkok, Thailand.",roungdao@hotmail.com,,,,,,,51,4,5,3,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The usage of many different modelling tools and the creation of personal models for research and analyses, as well as the protective state of mind of many developers, have led to a large number of simulation models and models coded in software that is not available to public. Although researchers openly present model structures, simulation scenarios and sometimes even printed code, the existence of a common development platform for model IT development is still lacking. The solution is a module-based system, where simulation models are decomposed into coherent functional parts, in order to achieve a flexible modelling system with opportunity for re-use and joint development of model modules. We propose an accessible, module-based, open-source model platform for sharing, application and further development of greenhouse horticultural models. A prototype of a decision-support system with selectable model options in an online toolbox for the greenhouse horticultural sector was created within the Universal Simulator, a software package for collaborative ecological modelling. The code within the Universal Simulator-created toolbox based on C++ code is accessible via XML scripts and can be used as the basis for the creation of greenhouse climate and crop cultivation modelling. The toolbox, which is a further development of the earlier published Virtual Greenhouse, contains detailed model scripts of all major physical greenhouse processes and some crop growth models, and it was created with independent, freely selectable models. This enables the building of simulation models composed of existing model components, e.g., a tomato crop growth model with given inputs and a combination of selected greenhouse set-ups. Using the tomato crop growth simulator as an example, we show the strength of the modular open-source structure for scientific use, education and commercial applications in evaluation study.","[Korner, O.] Danish Technol Inst, Taastrup, Denmark; [Holst, N.] Aarhus Univ, Flakkebjerg, Denmark",Danish Technological Institute; Aarhus University,"Körner, O (通讯作者)，Danish Technol Inst, Taastrup, Denmark.",olk@teknologisk.dk,"Körner, Oliver/AAG-9942-2021","Körner, Oliver/0000-0002-3241-481X; Holst, Niels/0000-0002-8414-6773",,,,,15,8,9,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-50-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2017,1154.0,,,,,,241,248,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1154.32,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BK1IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431840500032,0

The supply chain consists of farms, abattoirs and retailers. The purpose of this paper is to determine a cost-effective trade-off decision obtained from a developed multi-criteria optimization model based on three objectives. These objectives include customer satisfaction in percentage of product quantity as requested by customers, product quality in numbers of meat products and the total implementation cost. Furthermore, this work was aimed at determining the number and locations of farms and abattoirs that should be established and quantities of products that need to be transported between entities of the proposed supply chain. Design/methodology/approach - To this aim, a tri-criteria optimization model was developed. The considered criteria were used for minimizing the total implementation cost and maximizing customer satisfaction and product quality. In order to obtain Pareto solutions based on the developed model, four solution approaches were employed. Subsequently, a new decision-making algorithm was developed to select the superior solution approach in terms of values of the three criteria. Findings - A case study was applied to examine the applicability of the developed model and the performance of the proposed solution approaches. The computational results proved the applicability of the developed model in obtaining a trade-off among the considered criteria and solving the RFID-based meat supply chain design problem. Practical implications - The developed tri-criteria optimization model can be used by decision makers as an aid to design and optimize food supply chains. Originality/value - This paper presents a development of first, a cost-effective optimization approach for a proposed RFID-based meat supply chain seeking a trade-off among three conflicting criteria; and second, a new decision-making algorithm which can be used for any multi-criteria problem to select the best Pareto solution.","[Mohammed, Ahmed; Wang, Qian] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Engn, Portsmouth, Hants, England",University of Portsmouth,"Mohammed, A (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Sch Engn, Portsmouth, Hants, England.",ahmed.mohammed@port.ac.uk,"Mohammed, Ahmed/U-3258-2019","Mohammed, Ahmed/0000-0002-8474-9208",Higher Committee for Education Development (HCED) in Iraq,Higher Committee for Education Development (HCED) in Iraq,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Higher Committee for Education Development (HCED) in Iraq for the financial support in this study.

In order to increase the effectiveness of their commercial efforts, nowadays many corporations use additional promotion strategies (to the traditional communication mix methods alternative), such as sponsoring or product placement (Schumacher, 2007). Therefore many scientific studies on product placements in TV and printed media have been conducted (Glaeser, 2014). However, the embedment of products into the content of internet- based entertainment sequences, especially YouTube tutorials, has received little to no consideration (Hardy, 2010). Often, the recipient of amusement presentations is not aware of the commercial intent of the production because of the subtle product-incorporation into the editorial section of the entertainment story (Schueller, 2017). This hindrance of consumption withdrawal is said to be one of the major advantages of product placements for the broadcasting- and printed media (Cowley & Barron, 2008). Additionally cost reduction, the avoidance of legal restrictions on air-time, a higher credibility and other factors are scientifically proven benefits of product placements for traditional media (Balakrishnan et al., 2012). Because of these gains the advertising industry also uses YouTube tutorials as a carrier of their commercial messages (Heinemann, 2014). YouTube stars, also known as influencers or opinion leaders, directly appeal to potential buyers via their tutorials (Chaffey & Ellis-Chadwick, 2012). Due to their reputation and credibility they are supposed to maximize the efficacy of the product advertisement (Reichwald & Piller, 2009). But yet a comprehensive survey of the effectiveness of product placements in YouTube tutorials is missing. The research approach aims to fill the gap of scientific knowledge of the potencies of product placements in YouTube tutorials regarding the advertised product and also product-category by conducting an empirical survey on part of the main target group of YouTube, specifically students. Since the integration of ICTs, especially social media such as YouTube, is known to be a crucial element of the consumer's value creation process and also identified to increase firms' competitiveness and productivity (Vilaseca-Requena et al., 2007), the topic reveals its great importance to any operating business. This research in progress gives an overview of different methods and approaches of various scientific studies to determine the effectiveness of product placements in traditional media and how these may be transferred to social media, such as YouTube tutorials.","[Schueller, Ariane-Tabea] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany",Universitat Greifswald,"Schüller, AT (通讯作者)，Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.",tabea.schueller@uni-greifswald.de,,,,,,,53,0,0,1,2,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,71,83,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500005,0

By their activity, which is manifested through their cultural, educational and information functions, libraries contribute to the economic development of society. Since eastern Croatia faces difficulties in launching diverse economic development, activation of all available resources could help the revival of the economy. This paper analyzes the possible usage of library heritage to create new cultural and tourism attractions in order to develop and enrich the tourist offer. Tourism is one of the economic industries that can contribute to the positive economic results for the local residents and community. It is especially important for eastern Croatia to use all available natural, traditional and cultural resources for tourism development, because less than 2% of the total tourist traffic in Croatia takes place in the continental part of the Croatia, 2% in Zagreb, while about 96% takes place in seven coastal counties. Concept of sustainability and selective forms of tourism such as the cultural one is recently increasingly emphasized. Researches show that tourists show an interest both for natural resources and for local cultural and traditional attractions in Croatia. The evaluated and properly presented library resources can significantly contribute to the development of tourism in eastern Croatia. Research from 2013 shows that libraries participate in tourism in several ways: as theoretical infrastructure, as a cultural center for the local community, and through their educational function. In addition, library facilities (library building, specific contents of the library, presentation of local heritage, various cultural events, concerts, films, exhibitions of photographs and pictures) could be interesting as tourist attractions in several aspects. Cultural identity with the heritage as its essential component makes a tourist product more attractive. This paper brings concrete examples of libraries in eastern Croatia as well, with their resources that have the potential to create new tourist cultural attractions","[Tokic, Ksenija] Inst Tourism, Vrhovec 5, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Tokic, Ivo] Croatian Informat & Documentat Soc, Bijenicka 54, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute for Tourism - Croatia,"Tokic, K (通讯作者)，Inst Tourism, Vrhovec 5, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",ksenija.tokic@iztzg.hr; ivo.tokic@ina.hr,,,,,,,15,5,5,0,8,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,123,132,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500010,0

Surveys based on answers to the question: 'how satisfied are you with your life?' have allowed increased understanding of the factors affecting perceived life satisfaction. We use the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to analyse the relationship between self-reported `subjective' explanatory variables and 'objective' variables that measure similar domains in explaining overall life satisfaction. We explain about 49% of the variation in individual overall life satisfaction when using 8 of the subjective satisfaction variables included in HILDA, but only about 12% when using 19 of the objective variables covering similar domains. This is partly due to the differences between objective life situations and individual's perceptions of them. Understanding the relationships between objective and subjective variables is imperative for better policy. We find that individual's perceptions of the full range of objective conditions that support their wellbeing is quite limited. An integrated understanding of wellbeing is needed that can incorporate both what individuals do perceive and value and the factors that they do not perceive well but that are nonetheless valuable in supporting their wellbeing.","[Kubiszewski, Ida; Costanza, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Zakariyya, Nabeeh] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University,"Kubiszewski, I (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",ida.kub@gmail.com,"Costanza, Robert/A-4912-2008; Costanza, Robert/AAJ-3546-2021; Kubiszewski, Ida/A-5146-2012","Costanza, Robert/0000-0001-6348-8734; Kubiszewski, Ida/0000-0003-3264-7899; Zakariyya, Nabeeh/0000-0001-8656-0153",Australian Government through the Australian Research Council on a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE150100494]; Australian Research Council [DE150100494] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Government through the Australian Research Council on a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was partially funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council on a Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (Project ID: DE150100494).

The results of an Internet-based survey (N = 1021) showed that around half of the respondents often or occasionally both buycotted and boycotted foods. Multinomial regression models indicated that women, the highly educated, the political left, those who donated for charity, those whose food choices were motivated by domestic origin and ethical food production, and those who trusted that consumption choices, institutional actors and the media can advance ethical food production and consumption, were most likely to be active in buycotting and boycotting. Buycotters/boycotters were very active in buying local food but less eager, for instance, to buy organic or Fair Trade products or to reduce the use of meat or milk. The article concludes by critically assessing the complex relationship between buycotting/boycotting and sustainable practices and suggesting that consumers may be more willing to transform their eating patterns if other societal actors, too, make an effort to influence ethical food consumption.","[Niva, Mari] Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, POB 9,Siltavuorenpenger 10, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Jallinoja, Piia] Univ Tampere, Fac Social Sci, POB 100, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland",University of Helsinki; Tampere University,"Niva, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Fac Educ Sci, POB 9,Siltavuorenpenger 10, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",mari.niva@helsinki.fl; piia.jallinoja@uta.fi,,"Jallinoja, Piia/0000-0002-3889-2636; Niva, Mari/0000-0003-3288-7163",Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry [1857/212/2012],Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,This work was supported by the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (grant 1857/212/2012).,,78,16,16,2,45,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This paper shows that development banks operating in the Americas are falling far short of playing the key role they need to assume in filling these gaps. According to our estimates, development banks provide just $7 billion per year in terms of green finance in general, and climate finance in particular is just $4.4 billion per year. A corresponding econometric analysis shows green financial flows tend to go to countries with higher human development scores and left of center governments, and derive from development banks where the majority of the shareholder governments have strong environmental performance in their home country.","[Yuan, Fei] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gallagher, Kevin P.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Harvard University; Boston University,"Yuan, F (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",fyuan@g.harvard.edu,,,,,,,37,25,28,5,66,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We adopt a hybrid economic input-output and life cycle assessment model, in order to examine the crop-specific embodied energy intensity (EEI) and energy consumption related greenhouse gas intensity (ECR-GHGI) of 29 staple crops from 1990 to 2010. A sensitivity analysis is employed to investigate the relationship between ECR-GHGI and the different components of EEI. We further determine, via a structural path analysis, product-specific energy management priorities for each agricultural production input (API). Our findings indicate the following: (1) The EEI and ECR-GHGI of cash crops are greater than those of grain crops. (2) The EEI and ECR-GHGI of most grain crops increased during the sample period, while the EEI and ECR-GHGI of most cash crops decreased. (3) Energy consumption of synthetic fertilizers is the primary driver of ECR-GHGI across the full range of crops. Agricultural machinery and pesticides are also important factors. (4) Potential energy-savings practices in the API production processes should be taken seriously. (5) Different actions should be implemented to reduce energy consumption levels and ECR-GHG emissions in terms of the production processes of different APIs.","[Zhen, Wei; Qin, Quande] Shenzhen Univ, Dept Management Sci, Coll Management, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Zhen, Wei] Shenzhen Univ, China Ctr Special Econ Zone Res, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Qin, Quande; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Qin, Quande; Wei, Yi-Ming] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Qian, Xiaoying] East China Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Ctr Modern Chinese City Studies, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; East China Normal University,"Qin, QD (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Dept Management Sci, Coll Management, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",qinquande@gmail.com,"; Qian, Xiaoying/M-1247-2018","Qin, Quande/0000-0003-0943-9151; Zhen, Wei/0000-0002-7211-5355; Qian, Xiaoying/0000-0002-7683-5237",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620381]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402103]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2015A030313556],China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"The authors thank two anonymous referees and editors of this journal for their valuable comments.

Applying a short-term time horizon to an agreement on water allocation can make it easier for the riparian states to update the terms of their cooperation periodically, and thus, adapt them to changes in water availability resulting from climate change. However, agreements with a pre-agreed termination date can only increase the efficiency of water use if they lead to a stable cooperation. In this paper, I analyze how riparian states' previous knowledge of the termination date of a water allocation agreement affects the agreement's stability. The results show that when riparian states are aware of the agreement's termination date, there is a higher chance for them to free-ride. However, certain cases may occur in which previous knowledge of the agreement's termination date can contribute to the stability of an agreement by enforcing compliance.","[Jafroudi, Maryam] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Jafroudi, M (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands.",mjafrudi@uvt.nl,,"Jafroudi, Maryam/0000-0001-5549-6275",,,,,37,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

ES bundles (ESBs), which closely link ES trade-offs and synergies, provide a comprehensive approach to exploring the relationship between natural ecosystems and human well-being. In this study, we quantified eight ES in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural services using geographical data and other available information (both ecological and social) in the Pearl River Delta, China. We identified ESBs based on IC-means clustering and redundancy analysis. The results showed that spatial patterns of each ES were quite heterogeneous at watershed level. Provisioning services were mainly distributed in watersheds with high proportion of cultivated land and waterbody. Remote forest areas provided high regulating services. Moreover, densely populated urban areas provide high cultural services. Five ESBs were detected ranging from 2941 to 16,249 km(2). According to the Pearson correlations and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), we detected the trade-offs between provisioning and cultural services, and between regulating and cultural services, and synergies happened within regulating services. Intensive land-use and management in urban areas contributed to ES trade-offs. These results provide deeper understanding of the relationship between ES and land-use type at watershed level and detailed guidelines for ecosystem management.","[Zhao, Mingyue; Peng, Jian; Li, Tianyi; Wang, Yanglin] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yuanxin] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES),"Wang, YL (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",ylwang@pku.edu.cn,"zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023; XU, Lin/JDM-5554-2023; Peng, Jian/AAO-6397-2020","XU, Lin/0000-0003-1781-1638; Liu, Yuanxin/0000-0002-0673-4887",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41330747],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41330747).,,74,85,98,22,229,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This is difficult given the limited availability of program outcome data and analytical feedback exchange between providers. Moreover, the temporal nature of the effects of scheduled interventions on patient health raises the question of selecting and applying methodological tools appropriate for scientific research in this area. Our aim is to provide such methodological guidance and assist analysts, healthcare providers, and policy makers with extracting meaningful insights regarding the impact of care transition programs based on available data. We explore two well-known modeling approaches, Cox models and Markov chains, and using an illustrative example, demonstrate how they can be translated into informative analytic models with sufficient flexibility to analyze programs with diverse structures. We show that Cox Proportional Hazard models are particularly useful for identifying variables with the greatest impact on readmissions and quantifying the benefits of patient participation in a readmission reducing program. Extended Cox models provide an understanding of the effects of influential variables on readmissions as they change throughout the recovery period, allowing assessment of the relative benefits of care transition programs on different patient populations at specific times following a hospital discharge. Discrete Time Markov Chain models are particularly useful for assessing the impact of care transition programs in terms of expected time to readmission, facilitating the comparison of alternative program designs on patient outcomes.","[Casucci, Sabrina; Lin, Li; Nikolaev, Alexander] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Casucci, S (通讯作者)，Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Bell Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",scasucci@buffalo.edu; indlin@buffalo.edu; anikolae@buffalo.edu,,"Casucci, Sabrina/0000-0003-4977-4229",,,,,30,3,4,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0038-0121,,,SOCIO-ECON PLAN SCI,Socio-Econ.

This study reviews the literature linking source water quality to DWTP expenditures. For each study, we report information on the modeling approach, data structure, definition of treatment costs and water quality, and statistical methods. We then extract elasticities indicating the percentage change in drinking water treatment costs resulting from a 1% change in water quality. Forty-six elasticities are obtained for various water quality parameters, such as turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, sediment loading, and phosphorus loading. An additional 29 elasticities are obtained for land use classification (e.g., forest, agricultural, urban), which often proxy source water quality. Findings indicate relatively large ranges in the estimated elasticities of most parameters and land use classifications. However, average elasticities are smaller and ranges typically narrower for studies that incorporated control variables consistent with economic theory in their models. We discuss the implications of these findings for a DWTP's incentive to engage in source water protection and highlight gaps in the literature.","[Price, James I.; Heberling, Matthew T.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA",United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Price, JI (通讯作者)，US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA.",Price.James@epa.gov; Heberling.Matt@epa.gov,"Price, James/ABA-8945-2021","Price, James/0000-0001-9670-5731; Heberling, Matthew/0000-0003-1120-612X",Intramural EPA [EPA999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural EPA,,,64,53,61,6,66,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

While relative decoupling has occurred - that is, resource use has grown less quickly than the economy - absolute decoupling has not, raising the question whether it is possible. This paper proposes a novel explanation for why decoupling has not happened historically, drawing on a recent theory of cost-share induced productivity change and an extension of post-Keynesian pricing theory to natural resources. Cost-share induced productivity change and pricing behavior set up two halves of a dynamic, which we explore from a post-Keynesian perspective. In this dynamic, resource costs as a share of GDP move toward a stable level, at which the growth rate of resource productivity is typically less than the growth rate of GDP. This provides a parsimonious explanation of the prevalence of relative over absolute decoupling. The paper then presents some illustrative applications of the theory.","[Kemp-Benedict, Eric] Stockholm Environm Inst, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA",,"Kemp-Benedict, E (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, 11 Curtis Ave, Somerville, MA 02144 USA.",eric.kemp-benedict@sei.org,,"Kemp-Benedict, Eric/0000-0001-5794-7172",Stockholm Environment Institute from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) [41266],Stockholm Environment Institute from Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),"The author would like to thank Peter Erickson, Sivan Kartha, Juan Antonio Montecino, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments at different stages of the writing.

Sorghum has proven to be an adaptable and resilient crop despite limited funding for crop development. Recent breeding efforts target hybrid and perennial technologies that may facilitate adaptation to climate change. Advantages of perennial crops over their annual counterparts include improved soil quality and water conservation and reduced inputs and labor requirements. In contrast, hybrid crops are often bred for improved grain yield and earlier maturation to avoid variable conditions. We use discrete choice experiments to model adoption of sorghum as a function of attributes that differ between these technologies and traditional varieties in Mali. Overall, the main perceived advantage of perennial crops is agricultural ecosystem services such as soil improvement, while adoption of hybrid crops is hampered by the inability to reuse seed. Women farmers are less concerned about higher labor requirements associated with perennial crops and the ability to reuse hybrids seeds than male farmers. Farmers prefer traditional sorghum to perennial sorghum and are indifferent between traditional and hybrid sorghum. These findings have important policy implications for understanding tradeoffs that are central to farmer decision making when it comes to breeding technologies for climate adaptation.","[Waldman, Kurt B.] Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Richardson, Robert B.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Community Sustainabil, 480 Wilson Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Michigan State University,"Waldman, KB (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Geog, 513 N Pk Ave, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",kbwaldma@iu.edu; rbr@msu.edu,,"Waldman, Kurt/0000-0002-9643-8378; Richardson, Robert/0000-0001-7113-3896",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1076311]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1076311] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),This work was supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under Grant OPP1076311.,,45,16,19,6,58,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Here, we study the roles of profit-sharing in plantation management strategy in a dynamic game model. The model assumes that the owner chooses the age of the trees to be harvested and the local people choose their level of monitoring effort to prevent illegal logging with surveillance. After the trees are removed, the owner hires local people to replant young trees. We derived recursive formulas for determining the value of a site with trees of age t, and solved them by iteration. Under the pressure of illegal logging, the owner may find it profitable to share harvesting profits with the local people to enhance their surveillance effort. A higher rate of natural disturbance shortens the mean tree age, leading the owner to invest more to suppress illegal logging by increasing the profit-sharing rate. A lower future discount rate leads to older trees being harvested and decreases the profit-sharing rate. If the cost of replanting is increased, the local people are reluctant to participate in surveillance activities, and the owner increases the profit-sharing rate to encourage their participation. We discuss the policy implications of these results.","[Lee, Joung Hun; Kubo, Yuki; Iwasa, Yoh] Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Lee, Joung Hun] Kyushu Univ, Inst Decis Sci Sustainable Soc, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Fujiwara, Takahiro] Kyushu Univ, Fac Agr, Higashi Ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Septiana, Ratih Madya; Riyanto, Slamet] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Forestry, Jl Agro 1, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia",Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Gadjah Mada University,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",clinamen2013@gmail.com,"Septiana, Ratih Madya/GLV-5097-2022; Lee, Joung Hun/ABH-1992-2020; Iwasa, Yoh/G-5368-2010","Septiana, Ratih Madya/0000-0001-6182-9670; Iwasa, Yoh/0000-0003-0691-1852","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15H04423]; Leading Graduate School Program for Decision Science of MEXT, Japan; [15 J02857]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H05122, 15J02857] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Leading Graduate School Program for Decision Science of MEXT, Japan; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Basic Scientific Research (B) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (No. 15H04423) to YI, and by a Grant-in-Aid for a JSPS Fellow (No. 15 J02857) to YK.

Results indicate that the fertilizer management knowledge of field-guidance farmers improved by almost 40%. However, such knowledge acquisition did not occur for curriculum-trained farmers.

This paper presents a meta-analysis of computable general equilibrium (CGE) studies published between 2006 and 2017 on the effect of biofuel production on economic development worldwide. Using 30 CGE studies, we found that biofuel-supportive policies generated significant impacts on GDP and household incomes. CGE studies included in our database reported an average 0.25 percentage point increase in GDP and a 0.49 percentage point increase in household incomes. We also found that results were driven by several key features of the CGE studies included in our database. We investigated features such as biofuel type, geographic area, and characteristics of the CGE models employed. We found that biofuel expansion has heterogeneous effects in developed versus emerging countries. Simulations on longer time periods and in multi-country studies led to results that indicate higher impacts of biofuel expansion on GDP growth and household incomes. Moreover, simulations with an increase in agricultural productivity indicate positive welfare impact gains, unlike simulations with land expansion. Lastly, we found that biodiesel development leads to higher welfare impact gains than that of bioethanol.","[Nkolo, Johanna Choumert] Econ Dev Initiat EDI Ltd, 38 Crendon St, High Wycombe HP13 6LA, Bucks, England; [Motel, Pascale Combes] Univ Clermont Auvergne, Sch Econ, 65 Bd Francois Mitterrand, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand 1, France; [Motel, Pascale Combes] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CERDI UMR CNRS 6587, 65 Bd Francois Mitterrand, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand 1, France; [Djimeli, Charlain Guegang] Minist Econ Planning & Reg Dev Cameroon, DPPP DGEPIP MINEPAT, BP 660, Yaounde, Cameroon",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Nkolo, JC (通讯作者)，Econ Dev Initiat EDI Ltd, 38 Crendon St, High Wycombe HP13 6LA, Bucks, England.",j.choumert.nkolo@surveybe.com; pascale.motel_combes@udamail.fr,"Combes Motel, Pascale/ABE-9633-2021","Combes Motel, Pascale/0000-0002-3532-2339",ANR (project REVE) [ANR-14-CE05-0008]; French Ministry of Research,"ANR (project REVE)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); French Ministry of Research(Ministry of Research, France)","We would like to thank the ANR (project REVE, ANR-14-CE05-0008) and the French Ministry of Research for their financial support.

How to shape formal geoengineering governance mechanisms is an issue of debate. This paper describes and analyses the geoengineering governance landscape that has developed in the absence of explicit geoengineering regulation. An Earth System Governance perspective provides insight into the formation of norms resulting from an overlap in international treaties and from the actions of engaged non-state agents. Specifically, the paper explores the instruments and actors having effect in existing formal and informal geoengineering governance mechanisms. It finds that geoengineering is subject to a form of 'governance-by-default'. This is due to a situation in which state actors have not resolved the tension between two legal norms: that of 'precaution' and that of 'harm minimisation'. This governance-by-default is characterised by uneven regulation from existing multilateral agreements established for other purposes, an absence of regulation specifically focused on geoengineering, guidance from an international ambition to hold global average warming below 2 A degrees C and to achieve net-zero emissions in the second half of the century, and strong normative engagement by the research community. Governance-by-default is likely to be a stopgap development until more enduring and focused governance emerges.","[Talberg, Anita; Karoly, David] Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Christoff, Peter] Univ Melbourne, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Thomas, Sebastian] Univ Melbourne, Sustainabil Sci Lab, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Thomas, Sebastian] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Karoly, David] Univ Melbourne, Sch Earth Sci, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne,"Talberg, A (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Australian German Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",anita.talberg@unimelb.edu.au,"; Karoly, David/C-8262-2011","Talberg, Anita/0000-0002-4762-2355; Karoly, David/0000-0002-8671-2994; Thomas, Sebastian/0000-0002-3345-9120",,,,,74,24,26,0,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

So far, the literature has reported mixed results on the relationship between corporate sustainability and financial performance. Drawing on instrumental stakeholder theory, we develop a focal hypothesis arguing that the financial effect of corporate sustainability performance is negatively impacted by country-level sustainability performance because stakeholders will take a firm's sustainability improvement for granted in countries with good social and environmental performance. We test this focal hypothesis in a cross-country setting drawing on the 6th International Manufacturing Strategy Survey. The current study supplements these data with secondary data drawn from the Human Development Index and the Environmental Performance Index. The results support our hypothesis that firms in countries with higher levels of sustainability performance generally find it more difficult to capitalize on corporate sustainability performance than do their counterparts in countries with relatively low levels of sustainability performance. This outcome helps to explain the mixed findings in the literature. Moreover, our study suggests that sustainability management can be a source of competitive advantage for firms located in emerging and developing countries, where in general the level of sustainability performance is relatively","[Xiao, Chengyong; Wang, Qian] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Zhongguancun Donglu 80, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Chengyong; van der Vaart, Taco; van Donk, Dirk Pieter] Univ Groningen, Dept Operat, Fac Econ & Business, Nettlebosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Groningen","Xiao, CY (通讯作者)，Dui 651,Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",c.xiao@rug.nl; qianwang@ucas.ac.cn; j.t.van.der.vaart@rug.nl; d.p.van.donk@rug.nl,"Wang, Qian/AFY-9644-2022; van donk, Dirk/A-5255-2010; Van der Vaart, Taco/A-5236-2010","Wang, Qian/0000-0001-5986-6595; Xiao, Chengyong/0000-0002-3225-4465; Van der Vaart, Taco/0000-0002-3102-9426; van Donk, Dirk Pieter/0000-0001-8861-1188",National Science Foundation of China [71371178],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors acknowledge the financial support for this study provided by National Science Foundation of China under the grant 71371178.,,78,62,65,10,126,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We favor the former by arguing against the economic viability of the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) branch of geoengineering. This is of course not a question of either or, but we argue that the perception of CDR as a viable option reduces the willingness to reduce CO2 emissions. Using the recently developed approach of risk-reward nexus (RRN) in the economics of innovation, we question the economic viability of CDR. The main argument is simple: if one uses the new framework of RRN in evaluating the innovations involved in the CDR branch of geoengineering, not only does one include more areas of risk but also one has to consider a broader base for distributing the rewards. Consequently, from RRN's point of view, it would be less likely to find investing in CDR economically viable for the investor firms. Although the core argument of the paper concerns the economics of CDR, in a final section the paper tries to show that the economic argument has also ethical implications against relying on CDR.","[Faran, Turaj S.; Olsson, Lennart] Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Olsson, L (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Sustainabil Studies, LUCSUS, Lund, Sweden.",lennart.olsson@lucsus.lu.se,,,Swedish Research Council Formas [259-2008-1718]; EU FP-7 Research project: OPERAs [308393],Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); EU FP-7 Research project: OPERAs(European Union (EU)),"The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council Formas, Contract No. 259-2008-1718, and the EU FP-7 Research project: OPERAs (Contract No. 308393).",,64,13,13,6,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Following Kapp, Polanyi and others, this article argues that 'substantive economics' is interested in the biophysical and politico-institutional structure of the economy rather than in correct prices within a particular axiomatic conformity, as in 'formal economics'. After outlining the history of the substantive vs. formal dichotomy, we point out that socio-metabolic analyses are ecological economics' most significant contribution towards substantive economics. The core of this article then compares what could be today's two best candidates for offering a distinctive foundation to ecological economics as substantive economics: Material and Energy Flows Analyses (MEFA) and Multi-Scale Integrated Analyses of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM). While MEFA is more easily comparative and historical, MuSIASEM is more integrative and comprehensive. Yet we also argue that socio-metabolic analyses represent one of the three pillars of substantive economics and that both MEFA and MuSIASEM are still weak in integrating the politico-institutional structure (second pillar) and a theory of needs (third pillar). If such an integration was done, ecological economics would be in a position to offer a full-fledge, alternative 'substantive economic theory'.","[Gerber, Julien-Francois; Scheidel, Arnim] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Gerber, JF (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",gerber@iss.nl,"Scheidel, Arnim/C-3105-2018","Scheidel, Arnim/0000-0001-9764-685X; Gerber, Julien-Francois/0000-0002-4024-2480",Catalan Beatriu de Pinos fellowship [2014 BP_A 00129],Catalan Beatriu de Pinos fellowship,Funding is acknowledged from a Catalan Beatriu de Pinos fellowship grant (Grant-No. 2014 BP_A 00129).

Dynamic managerial inefficiency refers to the distance to the firms' group-specific dynamic frontier of best practices, and dynamic program inefficiency measures the difference between the group-specific dynamic frontier and the pooled dynamic frontier. The empirical application focuses on panel data of large meat processing firms in Eastern, Western and Southern Europe over the period 2005-2012. The results show that Eastern European firms have the highest dynamic managerial inefficiency for all inputs, but have the smallest values for dynamic program inefficiency. Western European firms perform worst in terms of program inefficiency for all inputs, while Southern European firms are the best with regard to dynamic managerial inefficiency. The results also reveal that regardless the dynamic inefficiency dimension considered, investments is the most inefficient input, followed by labor, and materials.","[Kapelko, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Appl Math, Dept Logist, Wroclaw, Poland; [Lansink, Alfons Oude] Wageningen Univ, Business Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Wageningen University & Research,"Kapelko, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Inst Appl Math, Dept Logist, Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.kapelko@ue.wroc.pl,"Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/H-8840-2012; Kapelko, Magdalena/F-3788-2016","Oude Lansink, Alfons GJM/0000-0002-9273-6044; Kapelko, Magdalena/0000-0003-2020-2374",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/00252],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research has been funded by the National Science Centre in Poland, decision number DEC-2013/11/D/HS4/00252.

However, deep uncertainty characterizes their design and their potential effects on growth, financial and credit market stability, and inequality. We develop the EIRIN flow-of-funds behavioural model to simulate the introduction of green fiscal policies and green sovereign bonds, and we display their effects on firms' investments in the brown and green sector, on unemployment, on the credit and bonds market. EIRIN is Stock Flow Consistent and is rooted on a balance sheet approach. It adopts a Leontief production function with no substitution of the production factors, i.e., Labour, Capital, and Raw Materials. Its sectors are endowed with adaptive behaviours and expectations, and interact with the others and the foreign sector through a set of markets. Simulations show that green public policies can promote green growth by influencing firms' expectations and the credit market. Green sovereign bonds represent a short-term win-win solution, while green fiscal measures have higher immediate distributive effects that induce negative feedbacks on the economy. These results are influenced by the conditions (fiscal, budgetary and public debt/GDP) in which both measures are implemented.","[Monasterolo, Irene] Vienna Univ Econ & Business WU, Vienna, Austria; [Monasterolo, Irene] Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Ctr Study Longer Range Future, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Raberto, Marco] Univ Genoa UNIGE, DIME, Genoa, Italy",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Boston University,"Monasterolo, I (通讯作者)，Welthandelspl 1-D5, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",irene.monasterolo@wu.ac.at; marco.raberto@unige.it,,"Raberto, Marco/0000-0002-0624-5709",IRCRES-CNR; Frederick S.

The reactions are based on consumer complaining behavior in the Turkish food industry. Design/methodology/approach In total, 16 brands from the food industry with the highest complaint rates were selected as cases of the study. The consumer complaints from these brands were analyzed through a qualitative content analysis. In this analysis, four categories which are beverage group, food preparation group, junk food group, and delicatessen group were observed as the top complained sectors. Findings The authors made up five semantic categories and one emoticon category which are AC/boycott tendency discourse, bad hygiene, bad servicescape, deceptive advertisement and defective products based on consumer complaints and disappointed, astonished, devil, pouting, confounded, angel. The results imply that especially unfamiliar objects in food products, unconcerned customer services, deceptive campaigns and spoiled products make consumers exhibit AC behavior. In addition, consumers coded with emoticons as pouting, devil and disappointed are more inclined than others to stop purchasing, respectively. Research limitations/implications Due to the qualitative nature of the study, the authors do not make a generalization for the field. AC behavior, deceptive campaign, spoiled products, brand lose confidence and children sensitivity can be investigated with a quantitative study. And a new scale for this field can be developed. Through this scale development, researchers can reach new dimensions and expand the literature about the AC behaviors. Practical implications An important implication which the authors got from the cases of the study is Hygiene. Although all cases have hygiene standards such as hazard analysis and critical control point, International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9001), etc., BH and spoiled products codes have high ranks among the cases. Due to this reason, companies should pay attention to their hygiene standards and increase the control period of the production process. Through the empowerment of the hygiene standards, they can fix their bad image on the customers and increase their dependability among the consumers. Social implications In the context of this case study, customer service emerges as an important problem and concept. Insufficient customer service infrastructure should be developed and their institutionalization processes should be empowered by the firms. The authors believe that the deficiency of the institutionalization plays an important role on these problems. And the institutionalization level on the field among the cases of the firms particularly should be investigated by the researchers. Furthermore, companies can increase their complaint management efficiency by joining new complaint websites. Through this manner, they can learn how to deal with different problems and increase their problem-solving skills. Originality/value This study provides a comprehensive insight into consumers' AC behavior. It reveals detailed drivers which may lead to AC behavior and contributes to the existing literature by determining the possible antecedents of AC behavior.","[Arslan, Yusuf; Yildirim, Emre; Dincer, Mustafa Abdul Metin; Barutcu, Merve Tuerkmen] Sakarya Univ, Sch Business, Sakarya, Turkey",Sakarya University,"Arslan, Y (通讯作者)，Sakarya Univ, Sch Business, Sakarya, Turkey.",yusufarslan@sakarya.edu.tr; emreyildirim@sakarya.edu.tr; mtindincer79@gmail.com; mturkmen@sakarya.edu.tr,"Arslan, Yusuf/A-8451-2016; Yıldırım, Emre/JMR-2580-2023; Yildirim, Emre/HSG-1335-2023; Arslan, Yusuf/HJH-6539-2023; Dinçer, Metin/ABC-4388-2021; Dinçer, Mustafa Abdül Metin/AAV-8391-2021; Arslan, Yusuf/AAH-5723-2020","Yıldırım, Emre/0000-0001-9074-3534; Yildirim, Emre/0000-0001-8703-7743; Arslan, Yusuf/0000-0002-7621-6671; Dinçer, Metin/0000-0002-1065-963X; Arslan, Yusuf/0000-0002-1873-7567",,,,,44,6,6,1,24,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Demographically, it was found that these consumers are an attractive part of the beer market in terms of age, schooling and, more importantly, in terms of income, factors that indicate the probability of continued growth in the sector. Research limitations/implications - The research was limited to craft beer consumers in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte/MG, Brazil. Practical implications - The results obtained are important, as they can help new craft breweries, as well as help established industry managers to create strategies related to marketing four Ps in order to increase the consumption of its products, with competitive advantages to the market. Originality/value - This research presents the characteristics of the consumers of craft beer, a market segment in evident rise in Brazil, about which there are few studies. In addition, it provides valuable information to both the new beverage manufacturers as well as to the already established entrepreneurs in the market so that they can increase the consumption of their products in a strategic way.","[Carvalho, Naiara Barbosa] Univ Fed Vicosa, Inst Exact & Technol Sci, Florestal, Brazil; [Minim, Luis Antonio; Rodrigues Minim, Valeria Paula] Univ Fed Vicosa, Ctr Exact & Technol Sci, Dept Food Technol, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Nascimento, Moyses] Univ Fed Vicosa, Ctr Exact & Technol Sci, Dept Stat, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [de Castro Ferreira, Gustavo Henrique] Univ Fed Vicosa, Inst Exact & Technol Sci, Florestal, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Universidade Federal de Vicosa,"Carvalho, NB (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Vicosa, Inst Exact & Technol Sci, Florestal, Brazil.",naiara.carvalho@ufv.br,"Ferreira, Gustavo Henrique Cepolini/AAV-5993-2021; Nascimento, Moyses MN/I-5256-2017; Nascimento, Moyses/Y-8767-2019; Minim, Luis Antonio/F-7428-2012","Ferreira, Gustavo Henrique Cepolini/0000-0003-1010-501X; Nascimento, Moyses/0000-0001-5886-9540; Minim, Valeria/0000-0001-7143-2060; Minim, Luis Antonio/0000-0002-1584-9117",,,,,35,34,38,3,78,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

These groups demand that business adapts to their understanding of corporate social responsibility (CSR). They are secondary or discretionary stakeholders who serve as a rudder for the company, acting as social and political agents that endorse organizational activities, making them socially acceptable and business-credible. This is a consequence of rising role and significance of NGOs, who are now promoting wider social issues, as well as providing the necessary products and services. Authors argue that this is a result of the smaller role of the government, which opens up more space for CSR and greater involvement of companiesand NGOs. For this reason, companies around the world enter into partnerships with their stakeholders, especially NGOs, in order to carry out their CSR activities. The aim of the paper is to explain the entity of cross-sectoral partnership, with emphasis on CSR and market-oriented public sector. In addition to the theoretical considerations of cross-sectoral partnership, the paper will offer results of the research of attitudes of NGO representatives Tuzla canton, about their relationship with local companies.

A comparison of the results highlights a divergence between the perceived contribution to the problem and more objective measurements. Design/methodology/approach Self-reported quantities, collected by means of a postal survey sent out to a random sample of the French- and German-speaking Swiss population, were compared to extrapolations from a national waste compositional analysis report. Findings The results of the self-reported survey showed 8.9kg of avoidable and possibly avoidable household food waste per capita per year, whereas calculations based on the second method resulted in a total of 89.4kg of mostly avoidable household food waste per capita per year. Research limitations/implications This striking tenfold discrepancy between the two sets of results highlights the extent of under-reporting in self-assessment and speaks in favour of using more objective methods to quantify food waste, building on the example of the second method used in this study. Practical implications The discrepancy highlighted here could be used as a hook in an awareness-raising campaign to highlight everyone's contribution to the food waste issue and encourage citizens to reconsider their behaviour and adopt recommended behavioural changes. Originality/value By highlighting the divergence between self-reported and actual waste management facts and figures, this paper justifies the need to develop measures to encourage citizens to reconsider their attitudes and practices.","[Delley, Mathilde; Brunner, Thomas A.] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Dept Food Sci & Management, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci HAFL, Bern, Switzerland",,"Delley, M (通讯作者)，Bern Univ Appl Sci, Dept Food Sci & Management, Sch Agr Forest & Food Sci HAFL, Bern, Switzerland.",mathilde.delley@bfh.ch,"Delley, Mathilde/AGT-9582-2022; Brunner, Thomas/P-4515-2018","Delley, Mathilde/0000-0003-3701-1881; Brunner, Thomas/0000-0002-6770-6548",,,,,42,44,50,3,42,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This significant value SMEs has in total businesses is translated in corresponding contribution in economy. They are important as they generate the biggest number of new ideas, affecting this way the innovation generated by a country. On the same time it is essential to take into consideration the structure of SMEs themselves. There are businesses that go bankruptcy after a while their entrance in the market. This happens as their entry in the market is not the right way, they don't bring anything new in the market and they do not survive as there are a lot of similar companies already in the market.

Design/methodology/approach Five focus groups were conducted with students (aged 12-14) from Calgary, AB. Participants were asked what food safety means to them and probed about their views on the relationship between food safety and packaged foods. Grounded theorizing informed the analysis. Findings Food safety was described as located within the system, located within the individual and located within the edible. Key to these teenagers' understanding of food safety is the theme of food deception - a deception promulgated by food producers, manufacturers and advertisers who lack transparency about what they are actually selling. Teenagers draw attention to the risks associated with living in an industrialized food environment, and to the tension between safety and the industry-driven motive to sell. Originality/value Individuals start to make independent decisions around food preparation and consumption as teenagers; as present and future consumers, it is valuable to learn their perspectives and knowledge about food safety. More importantly, food safety is not only simply a health-related issue but also a semantic one. This study moves beyond the knowledge deficit approach characterizing most research on the topic. Instead, it probes the range of meanings associated with food safety and how they are worked out, revealing that the teenagers' construction of food as risk objects reveals different links to harm than the food safety interventions typically directed to them.","[Elliott, Charlene; Ellison, Kirsten] Univ Calgary, Fac Arts, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Elliott, C (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Fac Arts, Calgary, AB, Canada.",charlene.elliott@ucalgary.ca; klelliso@ucalgary.ca,"Ellison, Kirsten/HTO-0409-2023","Elliott, Charlene/0000-0003-2615-2144",Alberta Innovates Health Solutions [2012Q001R]; Canada Research Chairs Program [2012Q001R],Alberta Innovates Health Solutions; Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs),no potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.

It is also of interest to derive the demand curve for organic milk based on the consumers' stated preferences. Design/methodology/approach The data used in this search are based on a face-to-face consumer survey that asked the respondents about how much they are willing to pay for organic milk and what factors affect their purchasing decision. A variant approach is applied where the determinants selected include both product/market characteristics and household-specific demographic factors. The data are analyzed by means of tabular analysis, summary tables, contingent valuation, stepwise regression, (2) tests and logistic discrete-choice modeling. Findings The tabular analysis suggests that price, packaging and brand image are the primary milk characteristics that affect consumers' decision. According to the contingent valuation analysis, consumers are willing to pay substantial premiums for milk products. The stepwise regression, (2) tests and logistic regression results unanimously suggest that educational attainment is the only significant indicator. Households with university education are twice more likely to purchase organic milk. Research limitations/implications The data used in this research are based on stated preferences which might be different than actual shopping behavior. Originality/value This paper presents a pioneer study on the characteristics of Turkish organic milk consumers and represents a credible, empirical case study to complement existing literature.

However, the scientific and research content of the CE concept is superficial and unorganized. CE seems to be a collection of vague and separate ideas from several fields and semi scientific concepts. The objective of this article is to contribute to the scientific research on CE. First, we will define the concept of CE from the perspective of WCED sustainable development and sustainability science. Second, we will conduct a critical analysis of the concept from the perspective of environmental sustainability. The analysis identifies six challenges, for example those of thermodynamics and system boundaries, that need to be resolved for CE to be able to contribute to global net sustainability. These six challenges also serve as research themes and objectives for scholars interested in making progress in sustainable development through the usage of circular economy. CE is important for its power to attract both the business community and policy-making community to sustainability work, but it needs scientific research to secure that the actual environmental impacts of CE work toward sustainability.

Financial risk tolerance is an individual characteristic of each financial market participant. Awareness of individual risk tolerance provides the opportunity of selecting suitable financial products and investment strategies. This field draws attention of wide scientific and professional community, but still without general conclusion. The assessment of risk tolerance is also subject of various financial studies that have considered the structure of the individual investor's portfolio and his risk tolerance. They also tested different demographic, social and psychological characteristics and their interdependence to risk tolerance. This paper studies the factors that might affect the risk tolerance among students in Croatia. The research considers the influence of socio-demographic characteristics, financial literacy, field of study and student level of education to risk tolerance on the convenience sample of students. The survey was conducted among 458 students, of which 238 students were from the Catholic University of Croatia and 220 students from the Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb. Regression analysis results indicated that risk tolerance is associated with gender, field of study and financial literacy. In addition, findings suggest that students in field of economy are characterized by higher risk tolerance than students in other fields of study. Furthermore, the discussion in the paper addresses the factors that influence the identified level of student risk tolerance. This research indicates the importance of deepening financial literacy among students with the intention to raise awareness about the existence of different types of financial risks and to recognize their inherent risk tolerance.

Agriculture and livestock are among the most climate sensitive economic sectors in developing countries, while rural communities are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is real and is happening now. In this context, risk management in managing the effects of climate change is a useful and extremely important leverage.","[Mocuta, Dorina Nicoleta] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Mocuta, DN (通讯作者)，Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest, Romania.",dorinamocuta@yahoo.com,,,,,,,5,4,4,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,316,321,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700036,0

Design/methodology/approach A total of 90 students between 17 and 19 years of age, 12 teachers, and 12 training classrooms intended for practical lessons, which were divided into six observation sessions in the field of catering and six observation sessions in the field of food processing (bakery, confectionery, and butchery), were observed. Findings Both proper and inappropriate food-handling practices were observed among teachers and students. Comparing the hygienic-technical conditions of the training classrooms with teachers' and students' behaviour revealed several interconnected situations increasing the risk of food contamination during the production process. Research limitations/implications Data were collected by one observer who was not part of the class. The sample size was small, limiting the generalisability of the results. Practical implications The results indicate the weaknesses in the formal vocational education of future professional food handlers. Social implications Good food safety practices among food handlers reduce societal costs related to health-care systems and food industry economic losses. Originality/value The study provides an insight into the education and training of future professional food handlers in a controlled environment in educational institutions.","[Ovca, Andrej; Jevsnik, Mojca; Raspor, Peter] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Hlth Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Raspor, P (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Hlth Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",andrej.ovca@zf.uni-lj.si; mojca.jevsnik@zf.uni-lj.si; peter.raspor@guest.arnes.si,"Ovca, Andrej/P-3525-2019","Ovca, Andrej/0000-0001-7465-948X",Slovenian Research Agency [P3-0388],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Slovenian Research Agency (research core funding No. P3-0388).

Owners, management, employees, present and potential investors, lenders and other creditors, as well as other users, seek certain accounting information. While preparing the statements, accountants apply specific financial reporting standards. Not only accountants are responsible for the accounting information presented in the financial statements, but also there are management and supervisory bodies who are collectively responsible for such information too. The fact is that the professional knowledge of management and supervisory bodies' members, and other users of accounting information is not always related to the accounting field and that could cause some problems in understanding. Furthermore, principal financial statements are general purpose financial statements. Understandability as a qualitative characteristic of accounting information, according to the IFRS Framework, presumes that financial statements are prepared for the users with a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. Still, sometimes for the primary users of the statements it is very hard to interpret some accounting information properly. The accounting practice has shown that this problem can result in misunderstanding, wrong interpretation and consequently in making wrong business decisions. This was an incentive for the research of main problems in understanding accounting terminology used in the disclosed financial statements. The research methodology includes the preparation and processing the corpus of accounting language used in the financial statements. The content of the balance sheet, income statement, the statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and the notes to the financial statements form the corpus for the investigation. In order to address this issue, a survey was conducted on a sample of Croatian companies, whereby the target population comprised small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) whose primary activity is production and trade. Respondents were primary owners and managers, i.e. persons belonging to the management structure of the company. The goals of the research are to investigate whether the owners and managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in Croatia know and to what extent they understand the accounting terms from the principal financial statements. The results of the research provide a good insight into the existing knowledge and understanding of the accounting terminology used in the general purpose financial statements and indicate that there is a need for additional education of the company's management structures.","[Sacer, Ivana Mamic; Decman, Nikolina; Rep, Ana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Sacer, IM (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",imamic@efzg.hr; ndecman@efzg.hr; arep@efzg.hr,"Rep, Ana/H-7980-2018; Sačer, Ivana Mamić/H-9069-2018","Rep, Ana/0000-0003-0769-6656;",Croatian Science Foundation [1794],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been fully supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 1794 entitled Construction of Croatian Accounting Terminology.,,7,1,1,0,10,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1077,1085,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900113,0

By considering this case, we need to highlight that the Romanian GDP has doubled. Besides this, in the year 2017, the Romanian economy growth reached 7%, marking the highest level of post-crisis economic growth which makes it the 16th economy of the UE28. However, the GDP per capita remains the second lowest in the UE, after Bulgaria. At the regional level, 7 regions from 8th, have a GDP per capita below the 60%. This indicates an increase in terms of disparities between the capital region, Bucharest-Ilfov, who exceeds the EU average, around 140% with the rest of the country.

Knowledge modeling skills are in keeping with the principles of Universal Design for instruction. Learners are empowered with the regulation of cognition as they become more aware of their own development. This semantic student approach was trialed with a group of 3rd year Computer Engineering Students taking a module on computer architecture. An enquiry-based group learning activity was developed to help learners meet selected module learning outcomes. Learners were required to use semantic feature analysis and linked data principles to create a visual model of their knowledge structure. Results show that overall student attainment was increased when knowledge modeling activities were included as part of the learning process. A recommendation for practice to incorporate knowledge modeling as a learning strategy within an overall engineering curriculum framework is described.

Design/methodology/approach - A quadratic programming approach applied to expected mean-variance models is used to analyze the impact of risk on decision to invest when the resources must be allocated to different type of production that have different risk levels. The model is calibrated using monthly data from 2009 to 2016. Findings - Results indicated multiple uncertainty sources (technological, cost of production, price of eggs) that vary according to the types of eggs. Given risk aversion parameters, producer would favor production modes with the lowest producers' price variance, which correspond to free-run eggs. Results also indicated that in response to a greater intensity of risk aversion, the course of action producers may choose is to increase the relative production of free-run eggs. Research limitations/implications - The empirical limits of this research are found in the lack of quality data on producer prices and costs for specialty eggs. Future research could explore the relationship between the growing impact of egg for processing, which price is based on the US price, and its relationship with specialty eggs. Practical implications - The findings of the study will be useful for policy makers and managers of eggs supply chain. This is important, given the recent announcement by Canadian's large retailers and fast food companies to increase cage free eggs offering and, in some cases, eventually only selling these types of eggs. Originality/value - This study adds to the understanding of the role of risk and uncertainty in the investment decision of egg producers and different mode of production, as well as in the development of the growing production of specialty eggs in Canada. It fills a gap in the literature regarding the impact of risk in Canadian egg production. This gap is likely explained by the perception of a lack of risk in this supply managed sector in Canada and its small size relative to other supply managed sector.","[Tamini, Lota D.; Doyon, Maurice] Laval Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Zan, Micheline M.] Laval Univ, Ctr Res Econ Environm Agrifood Transports & Energ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Laval University; Laval University,"Tamini, LD (通讯作者)，Laval Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Consumer Sci, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",lota.tamini@eac.ulaval.ca,,"Tamini, Lota D./0000-0003-3423-3155; Doyon, Maurice/0000-0001-6581-3078",,,,,18,6,6,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Verify if clusters were theoretically significant with major pork quality categories. Verify if classificatory parameter values of quality attributes determined a posteriori may be used for following categorization. Design/methodology/approach In total, 60 pork loins were classified into pale, soft and exudative, reddish-pink, soft and exudative, RFN and dark, firm and dry by reference criteria and hierarchical cluster analyses were performed to identify groups of samples with different attributes, based on only pH45min and on pHu, L* and drip loss. Findings Cluster analysis divided total samples into different (p<0.05) smaller groups. Two groups were formed based on only pH45min and five groups were formed based on pHu, L* and drip loss. By these five groups, L* of 44 and 52 distinguished between dark, reddish-pink and pale meat colors and drip loss of 2 and 6 percent distinguished between dry, non-exudative and exudative meats. Cluster analyses identify pork groups with different attributes and the proposed parameters can be used to distinguish between groups theoretically similar to major pork quality categories. Originality/value To decide the best destination to pork carcass and to reduce economic losses, the correctly classify of the pork quality is decisive. This study proves that cluster analysis is able to classify pork into groups with significantly different quality attributes, which are significant with major pork quality categories, without unclassified samples.","[Tones Filho, Robledo de Almeida; da Silva, Vanelle Maria] Univ Fed Vicosa, Inst Ciencias Exatas & Tecnol, Campus UFV Florestal, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Rodrigues, Lorena Mendes; Fontes, Paulo Rogerio; Souza Ramos, Alcineia de Lemos; Ramos, Eduardo Mendes] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Ciencia Alimentos, Lavras, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Ramos, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Ciencia Alimentos, Lavras, Brazil.",emramos@dca.ufla.br,"Ramos, Eduardo Mendes/AAD-4402-2019","Ramos, Eduardo Mendes/0000-0002-8240-8151; Silva, Vanelle/0000-0002-0692-8382",Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - (CNPq); FAPEMIG; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPEMIG(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),"The authors would like to thank the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) and the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - (CNPq) for their financial support and the FAPEMIG and the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) for the scholarship granted to the third (PIBIC/CNPq) and fourth (post-doctoral PMPD II, CAPES/FAPEMIG) authors.",,35,5,5,2,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Developers in the private residential sector have consistently, and successfully, argued for the status quo to remain. Developers' claims of cost and lack of demand have swayed governments that are in favor of letting the market decide. Disability- and age-specific housing and one-off projects have included many features that are considered universal design. So, the technical details are not an issue. The house-building sector in Australia consists of many parts, all held together by regulations and professional codes and norms of practice. Calls for accessible housing were heard by the Australian Government in 2010 and a set of voluntary guidelines were developed jointly by industry and disability advocacy groups. These became the Livable Housing Design Guidelines. It was understood that industry needed time to reorganize to bring about the changes needed. Consequently, it was agreed to progressively introduce accessible features over ten years so that by 2020 all new homes should be built to a basic level of accessibility. However, it was obvious in 2017 that this goal was unachievable with voluntary guidelines. Mandating these guidelines has been shunned at every turn, but the need to mandate could no longer be ignored. Through community advocacy efforts, the body that regulates the National Construction Code has been brought to the negotiating table to discuss mandating basic access features in all new homes. This paper reports on the processes and progress of these negotiations and the outcomes to date.","[Ward, Margaret] Australian Network Universal Housing Design, Strawberry Hills, NSW, Australia; [Bringolf, Jane] Ctr Universal Design Australia, Strawberry Hills, NSW, Australia",,"Ward, M (通讯作者)，Australian Network Universal Housing Design, C People Disabil Australia, POB 666, Strawberry Hills, NSW 2012, Australia.",anuhd@anuhd.org,,"Ward, Margaret Louise/0000-0001-9903-446X",,,,,37,1,2,1,7,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,299,306,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-299,0.0,,,8,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371489.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100028,0

Similar attempts have either not yet been tested in the Croatian capital market or have failed, as in the case of Maximum Sharpe Ratio (MSR) portfolio estimation, which can be attributed to the illiquid and undeveloped market. However, research can be found suggesting that it makes sense to use Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio as a proxy for the optimal benchmark portfolio (MSR) if the out-of-sample estimation of such benchmark involves a high level of estimation risk. In this paper we explore this possibility with the main goal of testing an investment strategy which could offer a better risk-reward ratio to investors relative to CROBEX index. The research examined CROBEX index revisions in the period from March 2005 till September 2017 and the results show an improvement over MSR portfolio out-of-sample estimation. However, overall the improvement is still not significant enough to outperform the cap-weighted CROBEX index. Also, the results vary significantly with the change in restrictions imposed on the portfolio weights in the optimization process. The greatest concern regarding this issue is that the increase in performance can occur at the expense of level of deconcentration in portfolio which can be significantly below the level of CROBEX index leading to high exposures to few stocks, especially in undeveloped market. Moreover, unlike for the developed markets our findings suggest that it is not possible to improve portfolio performance (and therefore also its' deconcentration) by combining GMV portfolio with MSR or naive, equally-weighted portfolios. However, based on the obtained results and other research we propose approaches to efficient benchmark estimation which could be used in combination with the GMV portfolio.","[Zoricic, Davor; Dolinar, Denis; Golubic, Zrinka Lovretin] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Zoricic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Kennedy Sq 6, Zagreb, Croatia.",dzoricic@efzg.hr; ddolinar@efzg.hr; zlovretin@efzg.hr,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,8,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1165,1173,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900122,0

This article uses mobilization for WWII to test the big push hypothesis in the context of postwar industrialization in the American South.

Despite a boom in manufacturing activity during the war, the evidence is not consistent with differential postwar growth in counties that received more investment. This does not rule out positive effects of mobilization on firms or sectors, but a decisive role for wartime capital deepening in the South's postwar industrial development should be viewed more skeptically.","[Jaworski, Taylor] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, UCB 256, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Jaworski, T (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, UCB 256, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",tjaworski@gmail.com,,,"Queen's University; National Science Foundation [1155957]; John E.

European metropoles extracted raw materials and tropical commodities from their overseas territories, and in turn indigenous consumers bought their industrial products, textiles in particular. This article investigates three of the assumptions of Ricardian trade theory that are often behind the de-industrialization narrative. In this article it is argued that, at least for colonial Java's textile industry, these assumptions should be reconsidered. Adverse trade policies imposed by the Dutch and a prolonged terms-of-trade boom in favour of primary commodities make colonial Java a unique case for exploring the merits of the de-industrialization thesis. Here it is demonstrated that Javanese households resourcefully responded to changing market circumstances, in the first place by flexible allocation of female labour. Moreover, indigenous textile producers specialized in certain niches that catered for local demand. Because of these factors, local textile production in Java appears to have been much more resilient than most of the historical literature suggests. These findings not only shed new light on the social and economic history of colonial Indonesia, but also contribute to the recent literature on alternative, labour-intensive paths of industrialization in the non-western world.","[Meerkerk, Elise van Nederveen] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Meerkerk, EV (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands.",,,"van Nederveen Meerkerk, Elise/0000-0003-1527-5798",,,,,102,15,16,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

This paper draws on institutional economics and accounts of international regime formation to develop an ideal-type model of the evolution of transnational polycentric governance. In particular, the model highlights systematically different transaction costs across different phases of polycentric governance evolution. These costs result in important trade-offs between building a broad coalition during agenda setting and addressing complexity in implementation. The plausibility of the model is probed using the case of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), drawing on global-level data on REDD+ collaboration, as well as fieldwork in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This case suggests that low transaction costs in the agenda-setting phase led to a confused vision for what REDD+ should be, ultimately hampering implementation.","[Gallemore, Caleb] NE Illinois Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, BBH 344C,5200 N St Louis Ave, Chicago, IL 60625 USA",,"Gallemore, C (通讯作者)，NE Illinois Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, BBH 344C,5200 N St Louis Ave, Chicago, IL 60625 USA.",ctgallem@neiu.edu,,,"Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation; European Communities; United Kingdom Department for International Development; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia, through the Center for International Forestry Research's Global Comparative Study on REDD+ (GCS-REDD+); Environmental Policy Initiative at The Ohio State University; Mershon Center for International Security Studies at The Ohio State University","Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); European Communities(European Union (EU)); United Kingdom Department for International Development; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia, through the Center for International Forestry Research's Global Comparative Study on REDD+ (GCS-REDD+); Environmental Policy Initiative at The Ohio State University; Mershon Center for International Security Studies at The Ohio State University","Funding for this research was provided by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, the European Communities, the United Kingdom Department for International Development, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia, through the Center for International Forestry Research's Global Comparative Study on REDD+ (GCS-REDD+), which developed the methodology for fieldwork in Central Kalimantan.

Export-led growth does not necessarily imply a rise in inequality, while the import-substitution industrialisation efforts did not translate into a more egalitarian distribution of income.

Data collected from publicly available databases are analysed using hypothesis tests. Ten variables from 89 pilot initiatives approved by the Voluntary Carbon Market or the Fundo Amazonia (Amazon Fund) are examined. Findings show that initiatives under each funding model have distinct characteristics in terms of stakeholders, criteria for incentive concession, time frames, geographical reach, as well as Measurement, Report and Verification (MRV) practices. Differences are consistent with distinct theoretical conceptions on incentive-based economic instruments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

First, we discuss empirical evidence, methodological problems and theoretical shortcomings of subjective well-being concepts. While data for one country over time suggest a flattening of the happiness curve relative to GDP growth, cross country comparisons reveal that the richest and most environmentally unsustainable countries are also the 'happiest'. Methodologically, we point to the issue of adaptability. A limitation in the use of 'positional goods' is unlikely to be accompanied by short-term increases in subjective well-being. Theoretically, we question 'happiness', where it helps promote growth and disguise structural relationships of inequality. Secondly, we sketch out an alternative degrowth research agenda oriented at the satisfaction of human needs. Here, Doyal and Gough's theory of human needs is especially useful due to its systematic account of environmental limits and the 'policy-auditing' approach that follows from it. Finally, we illustrate such a needs-based research agenda at the example of food by reviewing recent research on the environmental impacts of different diets and kinds of food production and on how these forms compare in terms of scale and land-use.

This generated adverse economic impacts in the areas. Unlike previous studies of impacts of changes in fisheries, which often rely on single-region economic impact models, this study uses a multi-regional social accounting matrix (MRSAM) model of three US regions Alaska, West Coast, and the rest of US - to calculate the multi-regional economic impacts of the Chinook salmon fishery failures, considering the countervailing effects of federal disaster funds paid to commercial salmon fishermen. To estimate the negative effects of the reduced salmon harvest, this study uses adjusted demand-driven MRSAM model, which avoids the double-counting problem encountered when a demand-driven model is used to compute the effects of exogenous output change, and overcomes the weakness of Ghosh (1958) approach in estimating the forward-linkage effects. To calculate the positive effects of federal relief payments, this study uses a Leontief demand-driven MRSAM model. Results indicate that the salmon fishery failures have significant adverse economic impacts including both intra-regional (Alaska) and inter-regional (West Coast and the rest of US) impacts, and that the disaster relief mitigates only a small portion of the adverse impacts.

This study assesses the human capital of different occupational groups in the early modern period and partially confirms this finding: skilled and professional groups had higher levels of numeracy and literacy than persons in unskilled occupations. However, there was another large group that developed substantial human capital and represented around one-third of the total population: farmers. By analysing numeracy and literacy evidence from six countries in Europe and Latin America, we argue that farmers contributed significantly to the formation of human capital and, consequently, to modern economic growth.","[Tollnek, Franziska; Baten, Joerg] Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Tollnek, F (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.",,,", Joerg/0000-0001-5029-501X",,,,,88,19,19,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Using the case of low-carbon vehicle technologies in the US passenger vehicle sector (ethanol, plug-in electric and hydrogen), we develop a technology adoption simulation model that represents increasing returns to adoption in both financial costs and consumer preferences, representing uncertainty through Monte Carlo analysis. We compare the policy costs ($/tonne CO2 out to 2050) of: i) a technology-neutral carbon tax, ii) a somewhat neutral vehicle standard requiring low carbon vehicle sales, but allowing competition among technologies, and iii) technology-specific vehicle standards requiring sales of just one technology. On average across simulations, the carbon tax is twice as cost-effective as the best vehicle standard, in part because the tax more substantially affects vehicle use rates. Among the vehicle standards, a technology-specific standard that selects the right winner (plug-in electric vehicles) is more cost-effective than the neutral standard, as it more quickly stimulates technology improvement. However, there is risk in a technology-specific approach; mistakenly forcing a loser technology (hydrogen) results in policy costs that are 2 to 5 times higher than other policies. Results can help policymakers trade-off the costs and risks of different climate policy options. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite a variety of ecological benefits and promising grain productivity, applications are scarce among farmers in developed countries. In consideration of MC's potential this study interviews farm managers to profile characteristics of adopters. The transtheoretical model (TTM) is applied to capture adoption and adoption tendencies. The results point to a significant positive role of land owned vs. leased, adoption of reduced tillage and adoption intensity of legumes in general. The perception of technical barriers and the perception of MC's usefulness are also major drivers that proponents need to address. In general, the TTM provides a gradual measure of farmer's willingness to adopt, leading to more variance than binary classifications, which makes TTM especially useful to adoption research of marginalized ecological practices.

To do so, we employed the discourse analysis approach of Q methodology, where 33 researchers ranked 39 statements on ES derived from the literature. Factor analysis of the Q sorts allowed for the interpretation of five main perspectives on ES: a pragmatic view on nature conservation, seeing ES as useful tool (Non-Economic Utilitarian), a strongly value-focused perspective with a skeptical view on ES (Critical Idealist), an opposition to a utilitarian approach to nature conservation but seeing ES as more encompassing approach (Anti-Utilitarian), a focus on a methodological rather than a critical approach to ES (Methodologist), and a rather economic approach to environmental decision-making, in which ES is a useful tool (Moderate Economist). We see this plurality as illustrating both the potential of the ES concept to serve as a boundary object for collaboration, but also the threat of ineffective collaboration due to the lack of a common conceptual ground. However, as pluralism can be fruitful if handled transparently, we suggest the need for open dialogue about underlying assumptions when using a value-laden concept like ES. (C) 2017 The Authors.

It is disputed whether such a 'growth imperative' is located within the current monetary system, creating conflicts with sustainability. To examine the claim that compound interest compels economies to grow, we present five post-Keynesian models and show how to perform a stability analysis in the parameter space. A stationary state with zero net saving and investment can be reached with positive interest rates, if the parameter 'consumption out of wealth' is above a threshold that rises with the interest rate. The other claim that retained profits from the interest revenues of banks create an imperative is based on circuitist models that we consider refutable. Their accounting is inconsistent, and a modeling assumption central for a growth imperative is not underpinned theoretically: Bank's equity capital has to increase even if debt does not. This is a discrepancy between the authors' intentions in their texts and their actual models. We conclude that a monetary system based on interest-bearing debt-money with private banks does not lead to an 'inherent' growth imperative. If the stationary state is unstable, it is caused by agents' decisions, not by structural inevitableness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents new operational approaches to quantify and map demand for three non-commodity ES on a global scale: animal pollination, wild medicinal plants and outdoor recreation. We show how the demand for these ES differs between beneficiaries and world regions. While the demand for animal pollination is accounted for via the consumption preferences for pollinator-dependent crop products, the demand for wild medicinal plants is quantified by the direct reliance on wild medicinal plants for basic healthcare needs. The demand for outdoor recreation is represented by the possibility and interest to participate in related activities. For animal pollination and outdoor recreation, demand is highest in industrial countries; demand for wild medicinal plants is highest in least developed countries, given their direct reliance on this ES for healthcare. Spatial demand-supply mismatches can cause trade-offs between ES in distant provisioning areas and can lead to unintended impacts on human well-being. The study reveals that quantifying and mapping spatial patterns of ES demand on a global scale requires clear conceptualization and operationalization of specific ES to select the most appropriate methods and arrive at meaningful results.

However, a wave of forest pests and pathogens is threatening this worldwide. In this paper we examine the effect of disease on the optimal rotation length of a single-aged, single rotation forest when a payment for non-timber benefits, which is offered to private forest owners to partly internalise the social values of forest management, is included. Using a generalisable bioeconomic framework we show how this payment counteracts the negative economic effect of disease by increasing the optimal rotation length, and under some restrictive conditions, even makes it optimal to never harvest the forest. The analysis shows a range of complex interactions between factors including the rate of spread of infection and the impact of disease on the value of harvested timber and non-timber benefits. A key result is that the effect of disease on the optimal rotation length is dependent on whether the disease affects the timber benefit only compared to when it affects both timber and non-timber benefits. Our framework can be extended to incorporate multiple ecosystem services delivered by forests and details of how disease can affect their production, thus facilitating a wide range of applications.

The conceptual framework of dynamic transboundary water interaction that it presents integrates theories about change and counter-hegemony to ascertain coercive, leverage, and liberating mechanisms through which contest and transformation of an arrangement occur. While the mechanisms can be active through sociopolitical processes either of compliance or of contest of the arrangement, most transboundary water interaction is found to contain elements of both. The role of power asymmetry is interpreted through classification of intervention strategies that seek to either influence or challenge the arrangements. Coexisting contest and compliance serve to explain in part the stasis on the Jordan and Ganges rivers (where the non-hegemons have in effect consented to the arrangement), as well as the changes on the Tigris and Mekong rivers, and even more rapid changes on the Amu Darya and Nile rivers (where the non-hegemons have confronted power asymmetry through influence and challenge). The framework also stresses how transboundary water events that may appear isolated are more accurately read within the many sociopolitical processes and arrangements they are shaped by. By clarifying the typically murky dynamics of interstate relations over transboundary waters, furthermore, the framework exposes a new suite of entry points for hydro-diplomatic initiatives.","[Zeitoun, Mark] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Zeitoun, Mark] UEA Water Secur Res Ctr, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Cascao, Ana Elisa] Stockholm Int Water Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Warner, Jeroen] Wageningen Univ, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Mirumachi, Naho; Farnum, Rebecca] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Matthews, Nathanial] CGIAR Program Water Land & Ecosyst, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Menga, Filippo] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of East Anglia; Wageningen University & Research; University of London; King's College London; CGIAR; University of Manchester,"Zeitoun, M (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England.;Zeitoun, M (通讯作者)，UEA Water Secur Res Ctr, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",m.zeitoun@uea.ac.uk,"Menga, Filippo/I-3157-2019; Mirumachi, Naho/J-8811-2016","Menga, Filippo/0000-0001-5712-7748; Matthews, Nathanial/0000-0002-1512-1142",,,,,129,46,51,2,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Economic assessments of drought impacts require a framework capable of accounting for its unique and particular characteristics. Traditional conceptual frameworks used to assess the impacts of natural hazards do not adequately capture all of the factors that contribute to the economic impacts of droughts, such as: the importance of the level, and composition, of hydraulic capital; the dispersion of economic impacts across different economic activities and agents; the temporality of drought events; and the critical importance of policy-making in shaping the short and long-term economic impacts of droughts. Nor do traditional frameworks take account of the complex interaction between factors within the domain of decision-making and underlying climate conditions. We propose a new conceptual framework based around two sources of economic impact: 'green water' and 'blue water', and argue that because each source of drought impacts the economy in different ways, they must be differentiated in any assessment of economic impact.

First, the study documents gender wage gaps are narrower in larger U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000 and 2010. Skill agglomerations are then considered to explain this. Specifically, if men and women employ heterogeneous skills, and these skills have differential productivities across city sizes, agglomerative forces may differentially reward men and women. Occupational data show that women are concentrated in jobs relatively more intensive in interactive and cognitive skills, while men are comparatively in physical skill-intensive jobs. Decomposing the gender wage gap shows that explanatory factors (education, skills, and location) predict women would outearn men. Instead, agglomerative skill returns account for majority of the gap. These estimates suggest that even as women employ skills rewarded in agglomeration economies, they benefit less from agglomerations than men, resulting in the observed gap.","[Bacolod, Marigee] Naval Postgrad Sch, Grad Sch Business & Publ Policy, 555 Dyer Rd, Monterey, CA 93943 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Bacolod, M (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, Grad Sch Business & Publ Policy, 555 Dyer Rd, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",mbacolod@nps.edu,,,,,,,31,16,26,2,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the usefulness of decomposition analysis in combination with consumer research in the new food product development process. Design/methodology/approach - A survey concerning nutritional habits of consumers based on 339 respondents and an analysis of the sensory and nutritional properties of products available on the market have been performed. Findings - It has been indicated that owing to the proposed research methods, a niche in the market can be found. It was found that products currently available on the market do not fully fulfil the essential nutritional and/or sensory criteria. Practical implications - The set of methods used in the study provides a valuable input into the new food product development process. The results of the research show that a company that will deliver a low-caloric bakery savoury snack of high nutritional quality and successfully present its properties to customers may gain a competitive advantage.

It includes relations between higher and lower political-territorial units concerning authorisation for establishing and incorporating certain sources of public revenue which finance their expenditure and which consequently have great effect on economic development of specific regional and local self-government unit. Fiscal federalism is relevant part of the theory of public finances which deals with problems of decision making process, capabilities of assessment of liability for taxation and usage of collected means in public sector with two or more levels of fiscal government. Use of fiscal decentralisation in theory and in practise varies from each country to another. It is dependant of system of government, territorial constitution, economic and social development, historical and political circumstances which in the end determine entire configuration of public finances. Which sources of fiscal revenue, in what capacity and in what way to distribute are the main problems that all federative states encounter frequently. However, states that are not federative, but have developed system of regional and local self-government encounter the same problems because of the high level of decentralisation of public functions. If the distribution of public functions (expenditure) is more decentralised, than there is larger disproportion between costs of its performance (i.e. production of public goods) and public revenue by which a certain political-territorial unit disposes of. So, it is necessary to ensure additional means. This is the way to ensure coherence between needs for means (of expenditure) and financial capacities (revenue) in all levels of fiscal government. Fiscal disbalance occurs when there is discrepancy between public expenditure and derivative public revenue. It usually occurs when we talk about lower political-territorial units and we firstly think about horizontal fiscal disbalance. Horizonatal fiscal disbalance means existance of differences in fiscal capacities and fiscal needs of political-territorial units of the same level. Thereupon occur certain migrations of citizens from poorer and economic underdeveloped political-territorial units to wealthier and economic developed political-territorial units where they can enjoy that amount of public goods that will satisfy their needs which brings to big disproportion when we talk about economic development of the certain regional and local self-government unit that must recognised and dealt with in time. Aim of this paper is to show the benefits of fiscal federalism and to draw attention to the problems concernig revenue collection or the lack o fit when the local and regional self-government unita are in question.","[Jerkovic, Emina] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Dept Financial Sci, Radiceva 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jerkovic, E (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Dept Financial Sci, Radiceva 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",ekonjic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,7,3,3,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,496,505,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500047,0

The role of the Pfeiffers in the selection process (awarded (inter)nationally, Vienna 1873 and 1905) has not been fully investigated. Although it was the most important and numerous breed in Slavonia until the first half of 20th century, there is a lack of information from the historical, economical, cultural and ethnological point of view. Since agriculture's importance in our country's history can be easy to forget, information about the history of the breed should be more available to scholars, students, tourists and others. After WWII, namely, its population drastically decreased and reached the critical survival level. Threfore, the Black Slavonian Pig preservation program was started in 1996. Today, the breed is included in the National program of preservation of autochthonous and protected breeds of domestic animals in Croatia and is kept in almost all continental counties in Croatia. In the last fifteen years, the number of fajfericas has increased significantly: breeders were led primarily by economic interests, but also by their love towards tradition. Following the traces of national cultural heritage (songs, pastoral games and folk costumes) an unusual combination was born, where tradition and art meet agriculture (from acorn grazing to naive art, sculpture and literature). In this paper, methods of description and comparative analysis were applied in the investigation of private and public collections (LAM institutions) in order to reach the conclusion on the impact of black Slavonian breed on Osijek and Eastern Slavonia in the European context.","[Kuharic, Darija; Margeta, Vladimir] Poljoprivredni Fak Osijeku, V Preloga 1, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia; [Vinaj, Marina] Muzej Slavonije, Trg Svetog Trojstva 6, Osijek, Croatia",,"Kuharic, D (通讯作者)，Poljoprivredni Fak Osijeku, V Preloga 1, HR-31000 Osijek, Croatia.",dkuharic@pfos.hr; marina.vinaj@mso.hr; vladimir.margeta@pfos.hr,"KUHARIC, DARIJA/AAC-2203-2022",,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,80,89,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500006,0

One of the most important faces of globalization seems to be migration. People migrate to various countries and with various objectives and reasons and under various circumstances (Oetzel, 2008; Kowal & Paliwoda-Pekosz, 2017). Most individuals in the world are currently linked with each other through various means of communication which has crossed borders as well as cultures in a more extended level. It is now difficult to find culturally homogenous civilizations currently which beside the captivating picture of diversity, generates problems to help everyday life in such conditions effortless as well as effective. Taking that into account, one can conclude that there are two main subjects that are related to migration which is under deliberation in many multicultural civilizations, namely integration and intercultural communication. One should consider the fact that what makes the process of integration probable and seems to be of great importance in enabling the difficult process of integration appears to be 'communication' that is crucial in the integration process. The main objective of this study is to find how intercultural communication can enable integration of foreigners, with concentrate on international students in Polish universities. Moreover, the aim of this paper is to contribute to increase the level of consciousness among students with various cultural backgrounds. This paper aims at studying the importance of intercultural communication and its significances on the integration of foreign students (Erasmus Exchange Program) in some Polish universities. This study tries to exemplify the importance of intercultural communication between foreign students as well as other students within Polish universities. Looking for the relation between intercultural communication as well as integration, the paper is divided into two main parts. The first part introduces the background knowledge concerning the theoretical aspects of the aforementioned issue. The second part discusses how intercultural communication is perceived within a culturally varied environment as Polish universities providing some examples and analysis.","[Kuzio, Anna] Univ Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland; [Wawrzak-Chodaczek, Miroslawa] Univ Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Zielona Gora; University of Wroclaw,"Kuzio, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland.",a.kuzio@in.uz.zgora.pl; miroslawa.wawrzak-chodaczek@uwr.edu.pl,"Kuzio, Anna/AAJ-3726-2021",,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,468,469,,,,,,2,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500040,0

Exploring one's surroundings is prevalent at birth. A child will wander around looking with keen interest at his/her environment. As people grow older, they feel the need to see different parts of their world. For example, many young people will embark on an overseas trip during or after completing their education. The older population has the time to travel and experience the world that may have eluded them during the years of raising a family or pursuing career commitments. Higher income enables greater exploration. The United Nations (1948, Article 24) have declared that everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay, with everyone assumed to have the right to leisure for developing every aspect of his/her personality and furthering social integration (European Commission 2006). However, the recent report on Demographic Change and Tourism (DCT) by the World Tourism Organization & European Travel Commission (Demographic change and tourism. World Tourism Organization & European Travel Commission, Madrid 2010) has highlighted that the demographic changes in modern societies have created new challenges for the development of tourism due to their implications on tourism participation behaviour (see also Nickerson 2000; Reece 2004). Litrell, Paige, and Song 2004) described senior travelers as becoming an important travel segment because of their level of wealth, higher discretionary income, lower consumer debt, greater free time to travel, and their tendency to travel greater distances and for longer lengths of time. Huang and Tsai 2003) found that seniors will soon be one of the largest prospective market segments for the hospitality and travel industries. A marked shift in interests from beach and shopping to culture, nature and food opens additional business prospects to accommodate those who now enjoy the extension of a long-term hobby or the opportunity to try something entirely new.

Consumer understanding and choices,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Focus group; Environment; Food attributes; Logistic approach; Sustainable products; Virtuous consumers,FOOD-PRODUCTS; ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES; FOCUS GROUPS; HEALTHY; NUTRITION; BELIEFS; IMPROVE; AGE,"Purpose - This is an exploratory study on consumer information and behaviour towards green, health, local, social and environmental credentials on labels. It focusses on many dimensions of sustainability in the food products that affect consumer choices with a dual purpose: to identify and define sustainable consumption behaviour in broad sense and to investigate empirically the factors affecting the real consumption behaviours. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on consumers' understanding, motivation and use of sustainable labelling in order to understand the role sustainability information plays in the food products market. Design/methodology/approach - Two focus groups in order to investigate consumer motivation and behaviour in-depth and to prepare the questionnaire. Identification of the outcomes that could summarize sustainable consumption combining: purchase of local products, consume only seasonal fruit, prefer products with recyclable packaging, attention to the fat content in foods, give importance to traceability and purchase products only in the place of origin. Identification of the at risk virtuous consumer, using a binary logistic regression approach, taking into account demographic characteristics, the food and nutrition value system, experience, knowledge, institutional factors and marketing. Findings - Results from the focus groups are mainly in line with the empirical analysis, highlighting the key role of education in influencing consumer attitude and behaviour. Consumers give little attention to information provided on the label for sustainable food consumption and environmental protection and have little knowledge of environmental problems. The virtuous consumer appears to give importance to a better food nutrition value system, to pay more attention to ingredients and instructions on the label, to be more attentive to environmental and sustainable attributes, to be concerned about product quality and to be slightly influenced by brands and special offers. Research limitations/implications - The findings from the empirical analysis confirm the results from focus groups even if it was not possible from the empirical analysis to investigate in-depth the marketing aspects concerning the food choice. This limit probably comes from the low number of observations. Further research will focus on these marketing aspects. Practical implications - Products with sustainable attributes can become a strategic variable and allow companies to gain a competitive advantage, especially for small-and medium-sized enterprises. This may encourage the development of new marketing channels based on the direct relationship between producer and the new consumer demand, increasingly sensitive to the food security issues. Social implications - There is a potential interest and sensitiveness to having sustainable behaviour in a broad sense, but there is a lack of knowledge about how to behave to be sustainable. In the absence of binding rules, it is necessary that government promote information and campaigns to generate greater awareness on sustainability, aiming at increasing knowledge to drive the consumer's choices. This may lead to virtuous results in terms of reducing social costs related to an unhealthy diet, food waste and unsustainable consumption. Originality/value - The results show that despite the appearance of attention to the environment and to healthy food which is associated with this emerging critical consumer in the literature, there remains the problem of the consumer giving little attention to information provided on the label for sustainable food consumption and environmental protection. This is the problem of rules of thumb in purchasing decisions that prevail in the following situations: when consumers have an overload of information that exceeds their processing limits; when they tend to base their decision making on heuristics, focussing their choices on brands as a proxy for high-quality, product-related characteristics.","[Mancini, Paola; Simeone, Mariarosaria] Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Benevento, Italy; [Marchini, Andrea] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimentari & Ambientali, Perugia, Italy",University of Sannio; University of Perugia,"Mancini, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods, Benevento, Italy.",pmancini@unisannio.it,"Marchini, Andrea/D-6539-2012","Mancini, Paola/0000-0002-6481-1481",,,,,44,48,49,13,186,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The results show that wealthier households use more wildlife resources in total than do relatively poor households. However, poorer households derive greater proportional benefit than wealthier households from the use of wildlife resources. Excluding wildlife understates the relative contribution of environmental resources while at the same time overstating the relative contribution of farm and wage income. Wildlife income alone accounts for about a 5.5% reduction in the proportion of people living below the poverty line. Furthermore, wildlife income has an equalizing effect, bringing about a 5.4% reduction in measured inequality. Regression analysis suggests that the likelihood of belonging to a wealthier category of income increases with an increase in environmental income. As expected, household wealth significantly and positively affects environmental income generated by households. This seems to suggest that wildlife-based land reform also needs to empower poor households in the area of capital accumulation while imposing restraints on the use of capital investments by well-off households to harvest wildlife.

Design/methodology/approach - Fieldwork conducted over nine months included; participant observation of lunch times (n = 56) and cooking one-to-one with trainees (n = 27), semi-structured interviews (n = 23) and a photo-dialogue focus group with trainees (n = 5) and staff (n = 2). Findings - Commensality is beneficial for offenders' health and well-being. Further, preparing, cooking, serving and sharing food is a powerful means of improving self-esteem and developing a pro-social identity. Research limitations/implications - The original focus of the research was commensality; it was during the study that the potential for cooking as an additional tool for health and well-being emerged. A future longitudinal intervention would be beneficial to examine whether the men continued to cook for others once released from prison and/or finished at the resettlement scheme. Practical implications - Everyday cooking to share with others is an invaluable tool for improving self-worth. It has the potential to build pro-social self-concepts and improve human, social and cultural capital. Social implications - Cooking lunch for others is a part of strengths-based approach to resettlement that values community involvement.

Findings - Wine product involvement deepens with age but low involvement consumers perceiving risk in making the wrong product choice may well purchase fine wines for situations where self-concept is a moderating factor. In the case of low involvement wine consumers a positive association exists between situational wine choice and self-concept but no significant differences exist for self-concept across any of the consumption occasions. Age and self-concept were both confirmed as linked to levels of consumption. The findings support the notion that wine consumers aged 45 years and older are significantly more disposed to purchase fine wine products. Originality/value - This study is the first to examine the extent to which consumer self-concept and product involvement influences the wine purchase decision at the retail level given the anticipated consumption occasion.","[Roe, David] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Bruwer, Johan] Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, Ehrenberg Bass Inst Mkt Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide; University of South Australia,"Bruwer, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Mkt, Ehrenberg Bass Inst Mkt Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",johan.bruwer@unisa.edu.au,"Bruwer, Johan/L-1280-2013","Bruwer, Johan/0000-0001-7568-605X",,,,,54,31,33,8,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative content analysis was carried out of 16 key informant interviews involved in the SFP, or in agriculture production related to SFP planning, development and supply. The resulting categories were used to construct a quantitative analysis protocol for school menus for three years both prior to and after (n = 130 days) procurement of the SFP with food from family farms. The studied variables were the presence (yes/no) of vegetables, fruits, legumes and concentrated foods. Monthly frequency and contrast of proportions were calculated for each variable during the years studied. Findings - The interviewees recognized that the proximity between food production and the school increased the variety of fresh, natural and organic foods in school menus. The direct supply of the SFP with foods from local family farms resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the frequency of vegetables, fruits and legumes in school menus as well as a progressive reduction in concentrated foods. Originality/value - The design of food and agriculture policy increases the availability of healthy foods in school menus and has beneficial results for promoting healthy meals in schools.","[Soares, Panmela] Univ Alicante, Publ Hlth Res Grp, Alicante, Spain; [Martinelli, Suellen Secchi] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nutr Foodserv Res Ctr, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Melgarejo, Leonardo] Assoc Gaucha Protecao Ao Ambiente Nat AGAPAN, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Cavalli, Suzi Barletto] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nutr Dept, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Cavalli, Suzi Barletto] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Nutr Postgrad Program, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Carmen Davo-Blanes, Mari] Univ Alicante, Dept Community Nursing Prevent Med & Publ Hlth &, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universitat d'Alacant,"Soares, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Publ Hlth Res Grp, Alicante, Spain.",panmela_soares@yahoo.com.br,"Soares, Panmela/GSN-9544-2022; Davo-Blanes, Mª Carmen/ABC-5041-2021; Cavalli, Suzi Barletto/GYD-5406-2022","Soares, Panmela/0000-0002-2449-6886; Cavalli, Suzi Barletto/0000-0002-2835-9424; Davo-Blanes, M.

Design/methodology/approach - Student members of a national commercial slimming programme completed an online survey about cooking ability, weight gain, eating habits and physical activity levels. Non-parametric statistical tests and regression analysis were employed to examine factors associated with weight gain. Findings - The data set comprised 272 current students. The majority of students (67 per cent) reported weight gain between 3.2 and 12.7 kg during studying in university: 20.4 per cent reported to have gained > 12.7 kg. Students commonly attributed their weight gain to academic stress and nearly all identified with needing support to learn to cook on a budget. Students reporting greatest weight gain had most frequent consumption of ready meals & convenience foods, take-away & fast foods and least frequent consumption of fruits & vegetables. Weight-stable students reported lowest consumption of alcohol and were most able to cook complex meals. Students who reported greatest weight gain reported lower physical activity levels. There were inter-correlations between cooking ability and lifestyle factors. In a multivariate model, low physical activity and frequent consumption of ready meals and convenience food independently predicted weight gain. Weight gain was inversely associated with diet quality, cooking ability and physical activity with reliance on ready meals & convenience food and low physical activity particularly important. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these cross-sectional associations and to explore how the university setting may contribute to the effect. Originality/value - The study adds additional perspective to understanding student weight gain at university in that it focuses on a body weight-conscious sub-group of the student population, as opposed to the general population of students.","[Sprake, Eleanor] Univ Sheffield, Dept Oncol & Metab, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Lavin, Jacquie; Featherstone, Megan] Slimming World, Alfreton, England; [Grabowski, Peter] Univ Sheffield, Dept Oncol, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Russell, Jean] Univ Sheffield, Dept Corp Informat & Comp, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Barker, Margo] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Business Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield; Sheffield Hallam University,"Barker, M (通讯作者)，Sheffield Hallam Univ, Business Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",margo.barker@shu.ac.uk,,"Barker, Margo/0000-0002-1016-5787",,,,,44,9,10,4,43,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Future trends are discussed. Design/methodology/approach - The description and case study approach highlight how sensory scientists must be involved during development as a research partner to develop appropriate study objectives, comprehensive research plans, and conduct studies in collaboration with other groups. This approach shows ways to deliver deeper understanding of the product and category through appropriate study execution and development of actionable insights. Findings - The present review demonstrates ways that sensory scientists, including those focused mainly on consumer evaluation, interact with other groups within the research and development organization. This paper is focused on providing information about sensory science to non-sensory scientists and developers. Examples are shown. Practical implications - This paper presents a guide for applying sensory and consumer science in an industrial setting that can be used by both industry and educational institutions who train students. It refers to current literature, presents real case studies in an abbreviated form, and traces the use of sensory in ways that may not usually be covered in some guides and books that focus on the more traditional uses of sensory in areas such as quality control. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need for contributions of sensory scientists to the product success continuum and the influence of getting appropriate sensory data to support research, development, and marketing decisions.

Our study is based on the nutritional characteristics of the 403 most consumed food products in the Netherlands. Metabolic energy density,(1) nutrient density (Nutrient Rich Foods index: NRF) and Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGEs) of the products were calculated. Low GHGE intensity per 100 g correlated with positive nutritional characteristics of food products. This is true for low energy density, and high nutrient density, expressed as the well-established NRF9.3 index. This index was improved to include the contribution of food products to GHGEs. GHGEs of product groups correlate more strongly with the proposed Sustainable Nutrient Rich Foods index (SNRF). This SNRF summarizes six distinctive nutrients (three which should be encouraged and three limited), as well as (metabolic) energy density. Including such an index on food product labels could assist consumers in making better informed food choices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Because the ban has been in effect for 40 years, it is unclear how potential legal horn trade should be structured to attain rhino conservation on private lands. We sought to fill this gap by eliciting the preferences of South African private wildlife industry members (who conserve a third of South Africa's rhinoceroses) for international trade in rhino horn. We used a combination of best-worst scaling and dichotomous choice experiments to determine wildlife industry members' preferences for three features of legal trade: market structure; payment/kg horn; and whether landowners should be required to conserve a minimum amount of land per rhino before they may enter the market. Results indicate that respondents preferred payments of at least ZAR 150,000/kg (USD $11,500) and that legal trade not be regulated by government organizations. Respondents did not have clear preferences about whether market participants should be required to meet a minimum land requirement per rhino. Our results provide insights into how potential horn trade policy may be structured to meet the financial needs of private landowners, while securing the conservation of rhinos on private lands.","[Rubino, Elena C.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 103 Black Hall,POB 116455, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pienaar, Elizabeth F.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Pienaar, Elizabeth F.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Pretoria, South Africa; [Soto, Jose R.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Pretoria; University of Arizona,"Rubino, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, 103 Black Hall,POB 116455, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",elenacrubino@gmail.com; efpienaar@ufl.edu; jrs@email.arizona.edu,,"Soto, Jose/0000-0001-8971-1623; Pienaar, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0343-080X",Dallas Safari Club Foundation,Dallas Safari Club Foundation,"We thank everyone who participated in our survey and the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa and the South African Hunters and Game Conservation Association for helping us distribute our survey.

We also determine that omitting food sales tax rates when studying general sales tax effects on employment does not bias estimates.","[Greenhalgh-Stanley, Nadia; Rohlin, Shawn] Kent State Univ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Thompson, Jeff] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, New England Publ Policy Ctr, Boston, MA 02210 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston,"Rohlin, S (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Coll Business Adm 462, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",srohlin@kent.edu,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Market halls were the most visible manifestation of this, and were important public buildings. This article looks beyond the imposing architecture to take a more critical view of their function and justification. It argues that while most were well-managed and earned income in excess of current expenditure, very substantial investment in large and elaborate buildings was hard to justify in purely financial terms. The return on capital was often negligible. Food and drink traders were the largest group in almost all markets, but there were significant numbers of traders selling clothing, textiles, and household goods. There was some justification to complaints that local authorities were providing publicly financed miscellaneous shops in competition with rent- and rate-paying shopkeepers. Most retailers supplying basic necessities operated from shops rather than markets. Saturday night markets were important in working-class culture and as a source of cheap food, but most day-to-day necessities were purchased from local shops or street traders.","[Mitchell, Ian] Univ Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England",University of Wolverhampton,"Mitchell, I (通讯作者)，Univ Wolverhampton, Wolverhampton, W Midlands, England.",I.Mitchell@wlv.ac.uk,,,Economic History Society's Carnevali Small Research Grants Scheme,Economic History Society's Carnevali Small Research Grants Scheme,This research was supported by a grant from the Economic History Society's Carnevali Small Research Grants Scheme.

This period has received considerable attention in relation to the development of the British Empire, but little is known about how merchants and other commercial actors invested in and contributed to these organizations. Using a newly developed dataset of membership and investment in overseas activities, this article reconstructs the individual portfolios of East India Company members in 1599, 1613, and 1624. This analysis reveals that investors took advantage of opportunities across the globe, and diverse portfolios were common. The implications of this are two-fold. First, this article makes clear that our current understanding of the East India Company as closely connected with the Levant Company is not sustained with evidence from investment patterns. Second, the interests of London's commercial community suggest new avenues for understanding the early British Empire as a tightly connected, globally focused set of institutions, people, and networks.","[Smith, Edmond] Univ Kent, Ctr Polit Econ Int Commerce, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Smith, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Ctr Polit Econ Int Commerce, Canterbury, Kent, England.",E.J.Smith@kent.ac.uk,"Smith, Edmond/DJX-1860-2022","Smith, Edmond/0000-0002-8330-5218",Leverhulme Trust,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"Catia Antunes, Richard Blakemore, D'Maris Coffman, William O'Reilly, Philip Stern, and Phil Withington all read versions of this material and offered valuable guidance-thank you all.

Recent evidence suggests that by removing seed dispersing vertebrates, overhunting can induce shifts in tree species composition that reduce the amount of carbon stored in the forest. I developed a bioeconomic model to assess the conditions under which hunting might lead to the loss of forest carbon, and to compare the revenue lost via carbon erosion to that gained from bushmeat procurement. The potential long-term decline in forest biomass and the uncertain degree of ecological complementarity among frugivore species had the strongest influence on the amount of carbon lost via overhunting. Parameters related to frugivore population dynamics and the economics of the hunting system had relatively little influence. Total revenue in the system was maximized when hunter effort and the opportunity costs of hunting were low, suggesting that limiting hunting effort could maximize income for hunters by avoiding the depletion of both game species and potentially saleable carbon credits. These results highlight that enhanced understanding of long-term carbon responses to hunting in different tropical forests could help increase revenue for forest-dwelling people and contribute to global climate change mitigation efforts.","[Brodie, Jedediah F.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Brodie, Jedediah F.] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Brodie, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",jedediah.brodie@mso.umt.edu,,,University of Montana,University of Montana,This project was supported by the University of Montana.

However, investigation of the relationship between poverty, climate variability and water-related disasters is complex. This article investigates the relationship between disaster risk, poverty, and the associated vulnerability of households and communities. The case study on which the article is based was carried out in Sri Lanka, a developing country prone to disasters. Data collected from household surveys conducted in North Central province, Sri Lanka, was examined with the use of cross tabulation and regression analysis techniques. Our study is novel because it considers floods and droughts together and compares their economic impact on socioeconomic groups at a local level. Our findings show that households depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihood, and that those with low income suffer greater losses from floods and droughts than households with high income. On the other hand flood impact is higher on households depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihood, and having lower income. The study uses survey data to examine the relationship between disaster frequency and localized poverty, an issue rarely considered in past literature. We show that low income households that depend fully on natural resources for their livelihood are exposed to more frequent disasters and most vulnerable to financial losses incurred through floods and droughts. To combat the effects of disasters, the Sri Lankan government might encourage members of poor households to seek at least some income from non-agricultural endeavors.","[De Silva, M. M. G.

In this paper two new DDF approaches are considered. The first one uses an exogenous directional vector and a multi-stage methodology that at each step uses the projection along the input and output dimensions of the directional vector that can be improved. This lexicographic DDF approach also computes a directional efficiency score and a directional inefficiency indicator for each input and output variable. The second approach is a non-linear optimization model that endogenously determines the directional vector so that the smallest improvement required to reach the efficient frontier is computed.,"[Lozano, Sebastian] Univ Seville, Dept Ind Management, Seville, Spain; [Soltani, Narges] Kharazmi Univ, Dept Math, Tehran, Iran",University of Sevilla; Kharazmi University,"Lozano, S (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Ind Management, Seville, Spain.",slozano@us.es,"Soltani, Narges/ABE-9287-2020; Lozano, Sebastián/E-7807-2010","Soltani, Narges/0000-0001-8175-7192;","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness [DPI2017-85343-P]; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of the Islamic Republic of Iran","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness; Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of the Islamic Republic of Iran","This research was carried out with the financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, DPI2017-85343-P.

We use the PROMETHEE II outranking method to analyse data from a survey in which farmers and experts were asked to evaluate adaptation options based on potentially conflicting criteria. Adaptation options for soil and land management, such as crop rotation and composting, score high based on two sets of criteria for assessing adaptation options for agriculture. River diversion, preventing leaching and erosion, and drip irrigation are ranked highest as adaptation options for water management. Regarding natural resource management, the highest ranked adaptation options are afforestation, water retention and maximizing crop yield. Rankings by farmers and by experts are weakly correlated for agriculture and water management, and negatively correlated for natural resource management, which shows the importance of extension services and of involving farmers in the decision-making process to ensure the feasibility of adaptation options.","[Nigussie, Yalemzewd; van der Werf, Edwin; Zhu, Xueqin; van Ierland, Ekko C.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands; [Nigussie, Yalemzewd; Simane, Belay] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Dev Studies, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [van der Werf, Edwin] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Wageningen University & Research; Addis Ababa University; Ifo Institut,"van der Werf, E (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",,"; Zhu, Xueqin/K-9471-2013","van der Werf, Edwin/0000-0001-7609-9340; Zhu, Xueqin/0000-0002-5772-1090",Netherlands Fellowship Programmes [CF8195/2012],Netherlands Fellowship Programmes,Nigussie is grateful to Netherlands Fellowship Programmes for funding through Grant CF8195/2012.,,53,16,16,3,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

In the present work, the residents' perception of quality of life depends on personal characteristics, the presence of amenities (manmade and natural), and the actual use of those amenities. Residents of an Italian town were surveyed via face-to-face structured interviews.

After 1870, infant mortality in Bavaria began a sustained decline. This decline, which was impressive in urban areas, was even more dramatic in Bavaria's capital, Munich. From a peak of 40 deaths per 100 births in the 1860s, infant mortality had fallen two-thirds by 1914. This article examines the causes of infant mortality in rural and urban districts of Bavaria from 1880 to 1910 and in Munich from 1825 up to shortly before the First World War. In rural Bavaria, structural change in agriculture lowered infant mortality, even as stark differences in infant survival driven by income gaps and deficient infant care remained. In urban areas, high fertility was strongly associated with high infant mortality. Individual-level data from Munich reveal that infant care, fertility, and incomes mattered. Even prior to industrialization, occupational status influenced infant survival. Munich's growth into a leading industrial centre after 1875 apparently widened the gap between rich and poor. Families at the top of the occupational distribution and couples able to acquire real property saw the steepest declines in infant mortality. The poorest one-third without property saw little improvement.","[Brown, John C.] Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Guinnane, Timothy W.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Clark University; Yale University,"Brown, JC (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",JBrown@clarku.edu,,,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R-01-HD29834]; Economic Growth Center at Yale University,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Economic Growth Center at Yale University,"An earlier version of this article was presented at University of Chicago Center for Population Economics and the Population Association of America 2015 Annual Meeting.

We find that stock market liquidity trended upwards but bond market liquidity did not increase over the sample period. Stock market liquidity during our sample period was partially influenced by the bond market, rather than fluctuations in economic output. In our analysis of the cross-sectional determinants of individual stock liquidity, we find that firm size and the number of issued shares were important determinants of liquidity. Finally, we find little evidence of an illiquidity premium, which is consistent with the view that investors did not price liquidity in this nascent market.","[Campbell, Gareth; Turner, John D.] Queens Univ Belfast, Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Ye, Qing] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Queens University Belfast; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Ye, Q (通讯作者)，Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",Qing.Ye@xjtlu.edu.cn,,,ESRC [RES-000-22-1391]; ESRC [RES-000-22-1391] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-22-1391] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Thanks to the ESRC (RES-000-22-1391) for financial support and Graeme Acheson for his input into this project.,,60,8,8,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

In this paper, we present a game-theoretic perspective on the challenge of triggering such investments. The question of climate change mitigation is often related to the prisoner's dilemma, a game with one Nash equilibrium. However, the authors perceive investment for mitigation and adaptation as a coordination problem of selecting among multiple equilibria. To illustrate this, we model a non-cooperative coordination game, related to the stag hunt, with a brown equilibrium with lower payoffs that can be achieved single-handedly and a green equilibrium with higher payoffs that requires coordination. As multiple experiments show, in such games actors often fail to coordinate on a payoff dominant equilibrium due to uncertainty. Thus, we discuss how uncertainty could be reduced along two options: one that concerns a change in the payoff structure of the game and another that concerns subjective probabilities.","[Mielke, Jahel; Steudle, Gesine A.] GCF, Berlin, Germany; [Mielke, Jahel] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",University of Potsdam,"Mielke, J (通讯作者)，GCF, Berlin, Germany.",jahel.mielke@globalclimateforum.org,,"Mielke, Jahel/0000-0002-1216-0760","EU Horizon 2020 programme, DOLFINS project [640772]","EU Horizon 2020 programme, DOLFINS project","The authors are grateful to Carlo Jaeger for extensive and valuable discussions on our work, They thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions and Andrea Wiesholzer for her editing support.

Looking at MNCs with core business activities linked to deforestation, this article analyses private governance activities focused on sustainability that occur at firm level. These activities include newly enacted, concrete policies and activities aimed at climate protection, such as the concept of carbon insetting. The current body of the literature on global governance focuses largely on collective action, with activities at firm level still under-researched and under-conceptualized. To better understand (a) what drives MNCs to undertake such activities and (b) why their performance differs both within and between industry sectors, three motives are proposed-preventing reputational damage, building resilience and assuming ethical responsibility-with the latter indicating a revival of the Honourable Merchant, an economic role model created in the early 16th century. The empirical analysis is, therefore, embedded in a theoretical framework that seeks to capture the complexity of corporate rationality.","[Weber, Anne-Kathrin] Univ Freiburg, Dept Polit Sci, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Weber, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Polit Sci, Freiburg, Germany.",anne-kathrin.weber@politik.uni-freiburg.de,,"Sacherer, Anne-Kathrin/0000-0002-3037-0841",,,,,89,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Unfortunately, some landowners choose to remain silent about imperiled species on their lands, which challenges government efforts to track species recovery. It is often assumed that landowner resistance towards wildlife regulations is economic in nature. However, when motivations for certain management behaviors are not economic in nature, the effectiveness of governmental regulations and incentives are not well understood. This paper is the first to investigate the economic and intrinsic motivations of family forest owners to protect imperiled wildlife species by defining landownership as a cultural ecosystem service, giving rise to personal identity benefits. We used a choice experiment format and Likert scale questions to characterize the personal identity constructs of family forest owners and their response to wildlife policies. We found many family forest owners are skeptical of government involvement, despite offers of a cost-share and a regulatory assurance. We conclude that when costs are low, or not well understood, forest owners' are more often motivated by the cultural values that uphold their personal identity constructs. Key in explaining changes in forest owner welfare was the importance placed on autonomy in making management decisions.","[Kreye, Melissa M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 334 Forest Resources Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Adams, Damian C.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, POB 110410, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ober, Holly K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, POB 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Kreye, MM (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, 334 Forest Resources Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mkreye@ufl.edu; dcadams@ufl.edu; holly.ober@ufl.edu,,"Ober, Holly/0000-0003-3780-6297; Adams, Damian/0000-0002-5858-0015",Conserved Forest Ecosystems: Outreach and Research at the University of Florida; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; Florida Forestry Association; Florida Forest Stewardship Program,Conserved Forest Ecosystems: Outreach and Research at the University of Florida; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; Florida Forestry Association; Florida Forest Stewardship Program,"We would like to thank the organizations and people who supported this study including, the cooperative for Conserved Forest Ecosystems: Outreach and Research at the University of Florida, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Florida Forestry Association, the Florida Forest Stewardship Program, Zhang Xue Mo, Chris Demers, and Michael Andreu.",,74,19,21,0,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The present work assesses the economic impact of the Eucalyptus snout beetle, Gonipterus platensis, and the benefits resulting from its biological control with Anaphes niter's in Portugal, over a 20-year period. Comparisons were made between the real situation (with A. niter's) and three scenarios without biological control: 1) replacement of Eucalyptus globulus by resistant eucalypts; 2) insecticide use; and 3) offset of yield losses by imported wood. A cost-benefit analysis was performed to evaluate a programme that aimed to accelerate A. nitens establishment. Although A. nitens provides adequate pest control in several regions, 46% of the area planted with eucalypts is affected by the beetle, causing wood losses of 648 M euros over 20 years. Losses in the three hypothetical scenarios were estimated at 2451 M-7164 M euros, resulting in benefits from biological control of 1803 M-6516 M euros, despite the fact that only partial success was achieved. Anticipating biological control by just one, two, or three years resulted in benefit-cost ratios of 67, 190, and 347, respectively. Because nonmarket values were not accounted for, these figures are likely underestimated.","[Valente, Carlos; Goncalves, Catarina I.; Monteiro, Fernanda; Gaspar, Joao; Silva, Margarida] RAIZ Inst Invest Floresta & Papel, Apartado 15, P-3801501 Aveiro, Portugal; [Sottomayor, Miguel] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Paiva, Maria Rosa] Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE, DCEA, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Branco, Manuela] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Estudos Florestais, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Centro de Estudos Florestais,"Valente, C (通讯作者)，RAIZ Inst Invest Floresta & Papel, Apartado 15, P-3801501 Aveiro, Portugal.",carlos.valente@thenavigatorcompany.com; msottomayor@porto.ucp.pt; mrp@fct.unl.pt; mrbranco@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Silva, Margarida/JPY-3246-2023; Silva, Margarida/HGU-5898-2022; Branco, Manuela/D-5274-2011; Gonçalves, Catarina/JNT-4272-2023; Goncalves, Catarina/HJY-6821-2023","Branco, Manuela/0000-0002-8140-1257; Valente, Carlos/0000-0001-8982-330X; Sottomayor, Miguel/0000-0002-1304-9087; Gaspar, Joao Filipe/0000-0003-2115-7181; Mendes-Silva, Margarida/0000-0002-4868-7329",,,,,61,31,33,0,32,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Specifically, we analyze four nudge like interventions referred to as social comparison, commitment devices, goal setting, and labeling in 44 international studies comprising 105 treatments. This paper differs from previous systematic reviews by solely focusing on studies that permit the identification of causal effects. We find that all four interventions have the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption of private households, yet effect sizes vary immensely.

The findings reveal that, on average and among the macro-areas of the country, the level of efficiency does not change significantly among estimation approaches, which produce different rankings, instead.

In this context, this study focuses on the legal nature of an agreement, which is linked to audience costs primarily at the domestic level that occur in case of non-compliance and are felt especially by democracies. Eventually, more legalized (hard-law) treaties make compliance potentially more challenging and as democratic leaders may anticipate the corresponding audience costs, the likelihood that democracies select themselves into such treaties decreases. The empirical implication of our theory is that environmental agreements with a larger share of democratic members are less likely to be characterized by hard law. Results from quantitative analyses strongly support our argument, shed new light on the relationship between participation in international agreements and the form of government, and also have implications for the words-deeds debate in international environmental policy-making.","[Bohmelt, Tobias] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Butkute, Edita] UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Essex; University of London; University College London,"Böhmelt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",tbohmelt@essex.ac.uk; edi.btk@gmail.com,"Böhmelt, Tobias/N-5347-2014",,,,,,67,10,10,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We trace the transmission of the crisis from New York City trust companies to the New York City national banks through direct and indirect interconnections. Trust companies held cash balances at national banks and these balances were liquidated as trust companies suffered depositor runs. Secondly, trust companies and national banks were notable creditors to the New York Stock Exchange; when trusts were suffering runs, the call loan market on the stock exchange seized. The crisis spread to the interior banks after the New York Clearing House banks restricted the convertibility of deposits into cash. Bond returns were sharply negative in the 2 weeks following the suspension. The suspension of convertibility produced a currency premium, which in turn attracted gold imports from Europe. The New York Clearing House had only limited capability to fight the panic through its use of clearing house loan certificates. The gold imports ultimately restored liquidity to financial markets.","[Tallman, Ellis W.] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Res Dept, POB 6387,1455 East Sixth St, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Moen, Jon R.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, University, MS 38677 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; University of Mississippi,"Tallman, EW (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Res Dept, POB 6387,1455 East Sixth St, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA.",ellis.tallman@clev.frb.org,"Tallman, Ellis W./AAG-3312-2021","Tallman, Ellis/0000-0001-8387-2768",Norges Bank,Norges Bank,"This paper was written for the conference entitled The Sub-Prime Crisis and how it Changed the Past'' sponsored by the Norges Bank and hosted by the Graduate Institute, Geneva, scheduled for February 3, 2011.

In this paper, we estimate the behavioral response of drivers to dynamic pricing in an HOT lane. The challenge in estimation lies in the simultaneity of price and demand: the structure of dynamic tolling ensures that prices increase as more drivers enter the HOT lane. Prior research has found that higher prices in HOT lanes increase usage. We find that after controlling for simultaneity HOT drivers instead respond to tolls in a manner consistent with economic theory. The average response to a 10 percent increase in the toll is a 1.6 percent reduction in usage. Drivers primarily value travel reliability over time savings, although there is heterogeneity in the relative values of time and reliability based on time of day and destination to or from work. The results highlight the importance of both controlling for simultaneity when estimating demand for dynamically priced toll roads and treating HOT lanes with dynamic prices as a differentiated product with bundled attributes.","[Brent, Daniel A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, 2300 Business Educ Complex, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Gross, Austin] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Brent, DA (通讯作者)，Louisiana State Univ, Dept Econ, 2300 Business Educ Complex, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.",dbrent@lsu.edu,,"Brent, Daniel/0000-0002-7088-8629",,,,,49,10,13,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Many believe that the modern day busyness of life and lack of spare time have kept people from acting according to their values and behaving more pro-environmentally. This study uses microdata from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) to investigate the relation between pro-environmental behaviour, environmental self-perception and work-life balance. Pro-environmental behaviour covers 21 behaviours relating to home energy, personal transport, recycling and shopping. Work-life balance is defined with relation to the availability of discretionary time using both objective and subjective measures. The results from the regression models of overall pro-environmental behaviour suggest that work-life imbalance does not appear to affect, neither directly nor indirectly through environmental values and attitudes, pro-environmental behaviour. The main factors determining the extent of pro-environmental behaviour relate to individuals attitudes towards the environment, age, educational attainment, household income and the presence of young children. The sensitivity analysis looking at differing time demanding behaviours reveals that actual availability of discretionary time does not seem to affect pro-environmental behaviour, while the subjective experience of work-life imbalance can have a negative direct effect particularly for more time demanding pro-environmental behaviours.","[Melo, Patricia C.] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Melo, Patricia C.] UECE Res Unit Complex & Econ, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal; [Melo, Patricia C.; Craig, Tony] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geograph Sci Grp, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Ge, Jiaqi] James Hutton Inst, Informat & Computat Sci Grp, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Brewer, Mark J.] Biomath & Stat Scotland, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Thronicker, Ines] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Environm Polit, Leipzig, Germany",Universidade de Lisboa; James Hutton Institute; James Hutton Institute; James Hutton Institute; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Melo, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal.",pmelo@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Ge, Jiaqi/HKM-6467-2023; Brewer, Mark/I-7226-2013; Craig, Tony/I-8353-2012; Melo, Patricia/G-9132-2017","Ge, Jiaqi/0000-0001-6491-3851; Brewer, Mark/0000-0001-7559-389X; Craig, Tony/0000-0001-9552-1682; Melo, Patricia/0000-0001-6722-1914","project Green Lifestyles, Alternative Models and Up-scaling Regional Sustainability (GLAMURS) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme","project Green Lifestyles, Alternative Models and Up-scaling Regional Sustainability (GLAMURS) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme","The research leading to these results has received funding from the project Green Lifestyles, Alternative Models and Up-scaling Regional Sustainability (GLAMURS) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7.

Nevertheless, the applied concepts of ES are rather vague and many methodologies have been proposed to construct ES indicators. Among these, composite indicators are very popular despite being affected by several methodological choices that often result in lack of robustness of the rankings involved. From a critical analysis of the methodological characteristic of ES composite indicators this study contributes to the debate on the construction of ES composite indicators by providing a better understanding of the various methods that are available. The analysis frames the ES definitions employed on multidimensional indicators and deals with the methodological implications of including the concept of sustainability.","[Valdes, Javier] Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara,"Valdés, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dipartimento Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",vldjm@unife.it,,,,,,,72,28,29,3,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

One option to improve the sector's competitiveness is to increase cost efficiency. The goal of this study is to quantify the level of persistent and transient cost efficiency of individual firms by applying the generalized true random effects (GTRE) model introduced by Colombi et al. (Journal of Productivity Analysis 42(2): 123-136, 2014) and Filippini and Greene (Journal of Productivity Analysis 45(2): 187-196, 2016). Applying this newly developed GTRE model to a total cost function, the level of cost efficiency of 65 Swiss hydropower firms is analyzed for the period between 2000 and 2013. A true random effects specification is estimated as a benchmark for the transient level of cost efficiency. The results show the presence of both transient as well as persistent cost inefficiencies. The GTREM predicts the aggregate level of cost inefficiency to amount to 21.8% (8.0% transient, 13.8% persistent) on average between 2000 and 2013. These two components differ in interpretation and implication. From an individual firm's perspective, the two types of cost inefficiencies might require a firm's management to respond with different improvement strategies. The existing level of persistent inefficiency could prevent the hydropower firms from adjusting their production processes to new market environments. From a regulatory point of view, the results of this study could be used in the scope and determination of the amount of financial support given to struggling firms.","[Filippini, Massimo; Geissmann, Thomas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Filippini, Massimo] Univ Lugano, Dept Econ, Lugano, Switzerland; [Geissmann, Thomas] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Greene, William H.] NYU, Dept Econ, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); New York University,"Geissmann, T (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Ctr Energy Policy & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.;Geissmann, T (通讯作者)，MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",tgeissmann@ethz.ch,"Filippini, Massimo/K-8155-2013","Filippini, Massimo/0000-0002-5972-4439; Geissmann, Thomas/0000-0003-4577-5937",Bundesamt fur Energie (BFE),Bundesamt fur Energie (BFE),"We are grateful to the Bundesamt fur Energie (BFE) for financially supporting a large study on the cost structure of the Swiss hydro power firms.

A technological catch-up model is estimated for the period 1995-2007. We use the spatial lag of X (SLX) model to capture possible spatial interactions across spatial units. Our empirical findings show that lower levels of regulation are associated with higher TFP growth. Lower barriers to entrepreneurship and lower bureaucratic costs have a positive effect on productivity growth. Corruption raises operational costs, distorts the allocation of resources and negatively affects innovation activities, thereby reducing TFP growth. Further liberalization in the labour market (in terms of hiring and firing regulation, working hours regulation and employment protection legislation) has a significant positive effect on the growth of TFP. In addition, both regional technological and regional human capital have a positive impact on the TFP growth in European regional economies.","[Javier Escriba-Perez, Francisco; Jose Murgui-Garcia, Maria] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Anal, Av Tarongers S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Murgui-García, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Anal, Av Tarongers S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",Francisco.j.escriba@uv.es; Maria.j.murgui@uv.es,"Murgui-Garcia, Maria Jose/H-1617-2015","Murgui-Garcia, Maria Jose/0000-0003-2712-1278","ERDF; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEO/2016/097]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad [ECO2015-65049-C2-1-P]","ERDF(European Union (EU)); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)); Spanish Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad(Spanish Government)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the ERDF as well as from the Generalitat Valenciana PROMETEO/2016/097.

By such alternative regulation of process capabilities, Croatia joined the legal systems that had fully implemented conciliatory way of completing the criminal procedure as de iure as well as de facto. In this paper the author will try to analyze and point out the occurrence of so-called concealed agreement, since our legislator limits the possibility of achieving a strictly formal settlement under the Plea guilty and sanctions Agreement cogently to the phase of accusations exposure. However, in judicial practice the possibility of concealed negotiation and informal settlements has proved to be effective and has taken up a significant percentage of the total number of criminal proceedings. Analyzing the final judgments of the Municipal and County Courts in Split, it is logical to conclude that all those judgments that became valid after the first-instance decision, that is, without the appellant's or prosecution's appeal, are essentially the result of the concealed agreement or settlement. At European and global levels, the achievement of a formal or informal, out of court settlement has proven to be the most effective model of finishing criminal proceedings. In spite of its noticable restrictions, such as the lack of  specific mitigation of punishment, reserved for formal Plea guilty and sanctions Agreement, concealed agreement has become implemented through practice in a strictly formal court proceeding, overcoming this legal gap. This paper attempts to point out a legal disadvantage caused by a strictly formal limitation of possibility for achieving Plea guilty and sanctions Agreement at a certain stage of the proceedings, since the courts praxis has shown that, at some point, during the lengthy court proceedings, partially derived evidence and financial burden of defense costs, defendant would like to conclude a procedure by formal settlement. A settlement that appllies the principle of specific mitigation of punishment, which would be appropriate at all stages of criminal proceedings, with the appliance of the principle of guilt individualization and compliance with the basic principle of legality. Such a model would represent a step towards modern tendencies of mixing, at a glance, the essentially different principles of legality and opportunism.","[Aljinovic, Nevena] Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Aljinovic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Split, Croatia.",nevena.aljinovic@gmail.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,2,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,347,357,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600040,0

The Michigan experience provides an example of the effect of widespread exchange brokers in an economy. We use econometric models to explain the determinants of the numbers of private banks in the state. We find that private banks were substitutes for locally issued state bank currency and were complements with adjacent states' bank currency. With the demise of heterogeneous currencies, private banks transitioned their core business from exchange brokering to general banking. In both the antebellum and postbellum eras, private banks tended to exist when and where larger incorporated banks did not. Following the collapse of free banking in Michigan in the antebellum years, this was virtually the entire state.

The usage of lightweight analytical tools can be explained by the observation that simple methods disrupt minimally established organizational decision-making processes and modeling of routine decisions usually seek to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness.(Luoma, 2016). Herchel (2007) identified so-called the execution gap showing that corporations' ability to collect data is increasing faster than ability to use the data. Decision management systems (DMS) try to fill that gap by incorporating descriptive, prescriptive and predictive analytic models in order to automate operational and some tactical business decisions. Resulting models standardized routine decisions with inserting programmable logic into automated business processes, presenting explicit form of institutional default heuristic. Decision engineering can be considered as an activities' assemblage that involve discovering and modelling decisions, building and deploying ICT components that combine advanced analytics with business rules and optimization. Decision engineers are a new kind of facilitators, who build decision requirements models of operational decisions in business processes. These models serve as a foundation for managers' and modelers' understandings when and which type of modeling should or should not be made part of organizational decision making process. Bearing in mind that humans shape their tools and then that tools shape humans and that ICT will always support the how and not the what, we try better to understand the ways that the modern decision management tools influence the decision making behavior. Differently put, could the design and implementation of decision management systems in organizations serve as a lean decision modelling approach that improve behavioral fit of modern managers?","[Bevanda, Vanja] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Bevanda, V (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Pula, Croatia.",vbevanda@unipu.hr,,,,,,,20,0,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,93,102,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700011,0

Accordingly, this research aims at examining the potential of textual data in transportation. For this purpose, a case study was designed on public opinion towards the adoption of driverless cars. This case study was framed together with the Danish road directorate, which is, in this case, the problem owner. Traditionally, public opinion is often captured by means of surveys. However, this paper provides demonstrations in which public opinion towards the adoption of driverless cars is examined through the exploitation of newspaper articles and tweets using topic modelling, document classification and sentiment analysis. These analyses have for instance shown that Text Analytics may be a supplementary tool to surveys, since they may extract additional knowledge which may not be captured through the application of surveys. In this case, the Danish Road Directorate can use these result to supplement their strategies and expectations towards the adoption of driverless cars by incorporating the public's opinion more carefully.","[Buch, Rasmus; Kinra, Aseem] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Operat Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Beheshti-Kashi, Samaneh] Univ Bremen, Int Grad Sch Dynam Logist IGS, Bremen, Germany; [Nielsen, Thomas Alexander Sick] Danish Rd Directorate, Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; University of Bremen,"Beheshti-Kashi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Int Grad Sch Dynam Logist IGS, Bremen, Germany.",rabu12ab@student.cbs.dk; bek@biba.uni-bremen.de; tasn@vd.dk; aki.om@cbs.dk,"Nielsen, Thomas Sick/F-1701-2016","Kinra, Aseem/0000-0003-0157-3735",,,,,9,2,2,1,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-8917,,978-3-319-74225-0; 978-3-319-74224-3,LECT NOTES LOGISTICS,,,2018,,,,,,,347,351,,10.1007/978-3-319-74225-0_47,0.0,,,5,Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BL3JG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449752500047,0

Design/methodology/approach This is preliminary study, so eight samples from each cultivar of pumpkin used in this study were obtained from local farms from Poland. The following pumpkin cultivars were used: Australian butter, Flat white boer, Garbo, Golden delicious, Golden nugget, Hokkaido, Solor and Zapallito de tronco. In pumpkins elements, dry matter, ash and crude protein were determined. All elements were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer. Content of dry matter, ash and crude protein according to AOAC methods. Findings The fruit of Cucurbita maxima, irrespective of cultivar, is a good means of supplementing the diet with highly beneficial fibre, and minerals such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sulphur, silicon, iron and zinc. The pumpkins richest in minerals are those of the Australian butter cultivar (calcium, manganese, iron), Flat white boer (sodium, silicon, chromium, nickel), Hokkaido (potassium, phosphorus, zinc, chromium) and Solor (magnesium, sulphur, copper), while the Garbo, Golden Delicious and Zapallito de tronco cultivars had the lowest concentrations of minerals. Originality/value The results obtained indicate that depending on the consumer's expectations, pumpkins of various cultivars can be a dietary component that corrects deficiencies in the diet.

In this respect, the purpose of this paper is to highlight the concept of ethical food and the nature of kosher food production, assessing common traits and the main differences between the two. A literature review was undertaken in order to verify the direction in which further studies might proceed. Design/methodology/approach A research review on current literature was carried out exploring concepts of ethical food and food certification underpinning kosher businesses by means of an analysis of both producers' and consumers' perspectives. In order to proceed with an accurate analysis, the paper matches both the conceptual analysis and the bibliometric one. The overlap between these two forms of analysis makes results robust and useful for future research. Findings This review reveals common points between ethical and kosher food because attention is given to both processes and products and the way the market perceives them as expressions of trustworthy and safe production. Furthermore, the analysis reveals an under emphasis on kosher food in the academic world and the results reveal the importance of empirical analysis. Research limitations/implications The analysis is focused mainly on kosher food production as an expression of ethical food. It would be interesting, however, to expand the analysis to other types of ethical certification such as Halal food, for example, in order to perform comparative evaluations. Practical implications From a practical point of view, it is interesting to note that kosher food is conceived as very safe food and that non-religious people are sensitive to this, which opens new horizons for ethical food. It also offers the possibility that firms that have never considered entering the field of ethical food certification may do so to expand their businesses. This implication also reveals that there is a higher attention on sustainability and safety in agro-food market. Therefore there are great opportunities of expansion for ethical food. Social implications From a social point of view, this paper is of importance for several reasons. It deals with a relatively new and relatively unexplored issue; it points out the relevance of sustainability and safety in food market and consumer behavior, it presents the possibility of exploring knowledge interactions between different perspectives (multidisciplinary approach) and cultures which, in the opinion, will present significant challenge in relation to agro-food business research in the future. Originality/value The originality of this work is that of systematizing a literature review of ethical food, enlarging its scope and boundaries with specific reference to kosher food. It also highlights the need to focus on both management and marketing, since up to now there has been a lack of academic contributions to these areas of research. Directions for further research are outlined.","[Della Corte, Valentina; Sepe, Fabiana] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management & Inst, Naples, Italy; [Del Gaudio, Giovanna] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Della Corte, V (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ Management & Inst, Naples, Italy.",valentina.dellacorte@unina.it,"Sepe, Fabiana/ABD-5248-2020; Della Corte, Valentina/T-2877-2018","Della Corte, Valentina/0000-0001-7113-3167",,,,,77,29,29,2,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Lotfi E. Zadeh published his basic work on the theory of the fuzzy sets in 1965 and opened up a new area of research, activities and thinking. The first proven practical applications of the fuzzy logic followed in the 1970s. Zadeh, and others later, have prepared a fuzzy mathematical apparatus that allows the use of vague expressions and formulations (such as Little Slow, Usually Wrong, Very Cold or Seldom Red), which in strictly mathematical defined rules map the domain of imprecision of human thought and expression in the codomain of real solutions. Concisely, fuzzy logic mathematically emulates human thinking. Fuzzy logic is a tool that releases the possibility of exploiting subjective knowledge in the integration of knowledge, which is discussed in the paper through an overview of the simpler and complex problems we face in the process control. Although fuzzy logic is often associated with controllers and tackling with technical problems characterized by nonlinearity, it shows its flexibility and suitability in solving process management problems as well as in other areas of human interest. The paper proposes potent directions of application of fuzzy logic in process management, especially for tackling with decision-making problems. Appropriate lay out of fuzzy variables and fuzzy functions and formation a set of fuzzy rules enables decisions based on a smaller amount of information, than it is the case with conventional methods. In a business environment, the paradigm of fuzzy logic brings human subjectivity into objectivity of science and business processes, and as a method by which we can use subjective human knowledge and to use it as it is, without complex abstractions which indeed cause quality deterioration of the final solution.","[Galzina, Vjekoslav; Kolar, Emina Berbic] Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Educ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Lujic, Roberto] Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Mech Engn Fac Slavonski Brod, Trg Ivana Brl Mazuran 2, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Slavonski Brod; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Galzina, V (通讯作者)，Univ Josip Juraj Strossmayer Osijek, Fac Educ, Cara Hadrijana 10, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",vgalzina@foozos.hr; ebkolar@foozos.hr; rlujic@sfsb.hr,"Lujić, Roberto/AAM-4145-2021",,,,,,20,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,103,110,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900009,0

This is a promising strategy for improving of plant absorption of potassium and reducing the use of chemical fertilizers. The objective of this study was to evaluated the ability of fifteen KSRB isolates that isolated from maize rhizosphere to dissolve potassium. Potassium dissolution activity by KSRB isolate was observed using Khandeparkar's selection ratio (modified) by measuring the diameter of the clear zone around the colony compared with the colony diameter on Aleksandrov solid medium (K-feldspar powder as sole potassium source) and pH measurement in Aleksandrov liquid medium. All KSRB isolates were capable of solubilizing K-feldspar powder in solid and liquid medium. There was a high negative correlation between Khandeparkar's selection ratio and pH (r = -0.90**). The highest potassium dissolution activity was shown by RBPK-DHJ3-3150, RBPK-DHJ1-4125, and RBPK-DHJ2-5250 KSRB isolates, which showed Khandeparkar's selection ratio of 5.97, 5.40, and 4.00 while pH 3.34, 3.28, and 3.64 respectively, so these three KSRB isolates were selected as the superior isolates based on the simple scoring and ranking method.","[Herdiyantoro, D.; Setiawati, M.

It was found that all the respondents have a positive statement about the political stability in the micro region and the political stability in the micro region is also perceived as the most important criteria influencing the cooperation within the council. The potential for further development of the micro region is seen by their representatives at first in the development of the tourism; on the contrary, the greatest threat is perceived in high level of bureaucracy, the lack of transport infrastructure, the migration of young people out of the region and a high degree of protection of nature and landscape.","[Kalabisova, Jana; Plzakova, Lucie] Inst Hospitality Management, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Kalabisová, J (通讯作者)，Inst Hospitality Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",kalabisova@vsh.cz; plzakova@vsh.cz,"Plzáková, Lucie/AAE-4027-2021","Plzáková, Lucie/0000-0002-0750-7643",,,,,19,0,0,0,0,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-700-8,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,1,,,,388,398,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL2ZZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443500038,0

What kind of ISP model could truly motivate students? Based on graduate feedback we know that students feel they should have learned more about project management. That observation led to integrating project planning and management elements with individual study planning into the Personal Development Project Plan (PDPP) in a course setting. PDPP was co-designed with students. The aim was to design something that would help students track their achievements and plan their personal development, i.e. match personal development with project planning. PDPP puts all the focus on the individual level. Through an iterative and incremental process, students are intended to find their own personal targets and design the means and tools to track how they're advancing towards set targets. We see PDPP as a way to manage the expectations one faces as well as a tool for managing one's well-being. Through the PDPP process, students learn how they can take ownership of their studies. This should result in students having improved time management skills and the ability to reach 60 ECTS credits per academic year while increasing their probability of completing their degrees in the normative timeframe. These factors are also elements of the university's funding model, thus the use of PDPP could be seen as an investment. To date, we have early non-formal results indicating that more credits are completed by the students who have participated in PDPP compared to those who have not.

Settlements, especially out-of-court settlements are an efficient and cheap way to resolve disputes, but it requires using other alternative dispute resolution methods. For example, mediation proved effective as a stand-alone procedure and as an additional measure to help with peace settlements in courts. Arbitration is another useful alternative dispute resolution forum. Going online makes these methods even more efficient and easier to use and in some cases even leads to resolving disputes without participation of lawyers. The article is an in-depth research of this field, aiming to provide understanding of different forms of online dispute resolution, online mediation and electronic arbitration in particular and legal framework behind these forms of dispute resolution. Uses, strengths and weaknesses of online dispute resolution are being discussed. Some countries already provide necessary legal background for wide array of possibilities in online dispute resolution, while other countries could benefit from changes to legislation. The established European regulations and national legislation are being compared with Russian law; the author researches possible avenues for further advancing online dispute resolution specifically in Russia, and factors that may assist or hinder development of online dispute resolution in Russia considering recent arbitration reform. Online dispute resolution lessens the burden on courts in any country and greatly helps the public as a whole. Part of the article is dedicated to the problem of consumer rights dispute. High cost of court procedure compared to alternative dispute resolution makes it unviable to continue with established Russian trend of keeping consumer disputes in courts. Possible solutions to this problem are being discussed with focus on finding implementable solutions within current legislation framework. This development is necessary to ensure economic growth and investment attractiveness of Russia.","[Liubin, Ivan] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Liubin, I (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",Lubin.I@jurfak.spb.ru,"Lyubin, Ivan/G-5164-2015","Lyubin, Ivan/0000-0001-6805-8928",,,,,3,0,0,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,197,203,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600023,0

The fact is that illegal cash flows may endanger the stability of the financial system as a whole or a specific sector of that system. This can undermine the stability of the European Union's internal market. For this reason, Directive (EU) 2015/849, the fourth dealing with money laundering, has guidelines to protect society against criminal activities such as money laundering and the protection of the stability of the European Union market as well as the markets of each of its members separately. An important part in this process is the national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing that has the purpose of identifying Member States money laundering risks and setting specific targets in the fight against these same threats. In order to do so, it is important to have quality information in a timely manner, statistically based and complemented by intelligence agencies, expert opinions and clear data from the private and public sector. In order to facilitate Member States transitional period for the implementation of the Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering or terrorist financing, the Financial Action Task Force on money laundering and terrorist financing (FATF) establishes certain standards and recommendations for easier implementation of the Directive. Accordingly, it is important to distinguish key concepts such as risk, threat, vulnerability, and consequence, so that the money laundering risk assessment itself could be applied in further steps to mitigate and prevent such risks.","[Primorac, Damir] Univ Mostar, Fac Law, Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg; [Miletic, Nenad] Municipal Civil Court Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Pilic, Marko] Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Split, Croatia",University of Mostar; University of Split,"Primorac, D (通讯作者)，Univ Mostar, Fac Law, Univ Split, Univ Dept Forens Sci, Mostar, Bosnia & Herceg.",damir.primorac@primorac-partners.com; nenadmltc@yahoo.com; mpilic@unist.hr,"Pilić, Marko/D-4671-2018","Pilić, Marko/0000-0002-4418-9306",,,,,15,0,0,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,67,78,,,,,,12,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600007,0

It also examines consumers' online purchase preferences for specific food categories and the consumer segments shopping for food online in China. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected through a web-based survey (n=643, in three cities: Beijing, Guangzhou and Chongqing). Descriptive analysis, cluster analysis, factor analysis and structural equation modeling were employed for data analysis. Findings Participants had strong online purchase intentions toward snack and imported food, while they had weak online purchase intentions toward fresh food products such as meat, eggs, vegetables, fish and seafood. Two consumer segments were found: online-food-conservative (42 percent) and online-food-pioneer (58 percent). Factor analysis resulted in an adjusted factorial structure of the innovation-adoption characteristics, which was considered more appropriate within the context of Chinese consumers when shopping for food online. Path analysis found that Chinese consumers' attitudes and/or purchase intentions were positively linked to their perceived incentives and negatively associated with their perceived complexity for online food shopping.

Companies seeking new solutions for their products identify the need for cooperation with suppliers of components and technologies from different parts of the world. This determines configuring international supply chains that are particularly vulnerable to the business uncertainty and environmental turbulence. The main aim of the paper is to evaluate the role of purchasing decisions in New Product Development (NPD) processes and Supplier Involvement for configuring resilient processes and the structure of a supply chain. The study is based on two methods. First, there was a systematic literature review on papers covering SCRES (supply chain resilience) to obtain the key SCRES attributes. In the second stage of the research, a case study of NPD in the cosmetics' packaging supply chain is presented. This concerns the cooperation between the company providing packaging solutions, its first-tier suppliers and the main customer (which is a manufacturer of cosmetics products). Further, the purchasing decisions and SI practice were linked with identified SCRES elements, which are: flexibility (the most common attribute), redundancy, transparency and visibility, agility, collaboration and information sharing. The importance and possibility of taking into account resilience as early as during the design of the supply chain of a new product was confirmed.

In particular, our study examines regulated facilities' perceptions of the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement efforts for inducing compliance and the influence of these perceptions on facilities' responses to actual inspections and enforcement actions. No previous study explores this influence. For our conceptual analysis, we extend standard deterrence theory by incorporating the behavioral dimension of intrinsic motivation. For our empirical analysis, we examine chemical manufacturing facilities permitted under the Clean Water Act during the years 2002 to 2004. Using an original survey, we collect data on facilities' perceptions. We then compare responses to government interventions between facilities that perceive enforcement as effective and those that do not. For facilities perceiving enforcement as effective, increased deterrence of any type generates little gain. In contrast, for those facilities who perceive enforcement as Ineffective, increased deterrence from inspections improves compliance with the Clean Water Act. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic Network DEA was used to compute efficiency scores for hospital sub-divisions i.e. medical/surgical care (patient visits, surgeries and discharges) and quality. Pearson's correlation test was performed to assess if there are trade-offs or synergies between the efficiency of producing quality and efficiency of producing medical/surgical care. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to determine hospital and market characteristics that contribute to efficiency in production of quality outputs. Efficiency of quality production improved significantly between 2009 and 2013 with no trade-off between efficiency of producing quality outputs and efficiency of producing medical care. Urban and teaching hospitals were less likely to improve efficiency of quality production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although residential relocation from the cites at risk is one of the effective risk reduction measures, the relocation incurs mobility costs of developing social capital such as communities or searching public services such as education and medical institutions. The estimation results showed that the residents in the disaster cites of 2011 Fukushima incident can tolerate higher risks of radiation exposure when they have attachment to the original residence or higher demands for the public services, and can stay in the cites at risks consequently. Because the tolerance level can depend on the information associated with the risks, the results imply that the authorities' providing the correct information is one of the keys for the disaster risk reduction in short run.","[Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Sch Engn, Dept Urban Engn,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan; [Managi, Shunsuke] Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Sch Engn, Dept Environm Engn,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Managi, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Sch Engn, Dept Urban Engn,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.;Managi, S (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Urban Inst, Sch Engn, Dept Environm Engn,Nishi Ku, 744 Motooka, Fukuoka 8190395, Japan.",managi@doc.kyushu-u.ac.jp,"Managi, Shunsuke/G-1740-2013","Managi, Shunsuke/0000-0001-7883-1427","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan (MEXT) [26000001, 26780139]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26000001, 26780139] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan (MEXT)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank the three referees and editor of the journal for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Across Sub-Saharan Africa, however, there have been low rates of adoption with fierce debate over its attractiveness for resource-poor farmers. Farm-level economics has been a key component of this debate with several authors questioning whether short-term benefits can occur with CA and advocating the need for more sophisticated economic analysis when comparing CA and conventional agriculture. This has included the importance placed upon more detailed farm-level data gathering as opposed to on-farm/on-station research. This study uses farm-level budget data gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 197 farmers, for the 2013/2014 season, within a district situated in Cabo Delgado Mozambique, to compare the underlying economics of CA and conventional agriculture. The study is enriched by having observations reflecting each year of CA use i.e. first, second and third year. Probabilistic cash flow analysis is used to compare the net present value of CA compared to conventional cropping over the short and longer term for differing crop mixes. Benefits are found in the short-term under CA but these are largely dependent on crop mix and the opportunity cost of labour assumed. We further employ Monte-Carlo simulations to compare the poorest farmers' net returns under different crop mixes and risk tolerance levels. Contrary to previous research, which has mostly suggested that better-off farmers are more likely to find CA useful, we find evidence that for the cohort of farmers under study the poorest are likely to find CA beneficial for a variety of crop mixes and risk-levels including under extreme risk aversion with the full opportunity cost of labour and mulch accounted for. These findings suggest that CA can be an attractive option for a wide variety of resource levels and crop mixes including those of the very poor in similar farming systems elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa.

In this paper, we study potential spatial accessibility of home healthcare services. Accessibility is a measure of the supply of and demand for home healthcare resources and the interaction between supply and demand within and between geographic regions. Home healthcare is unique in that the spatial interactions result from service regions selected by agencies, rather than from the distances between supply and demand locations. A new measure that simultaneously considers both staffing levels and eligible populations is developed and demonstrated via a case study using the state of Arkansas. To the best of our knowledge, no previous measure has been proposed to quantify potential spatial accessibility of home healthcare services within a geographic region. The results of the case study reveal disparities across the study area for each home healthcare service type. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We proceed in three steps. First, we present the concept of common patrimony and we distinguish it from common property and common-pool resources. We show that the notion of common patrimony allows identity, historical, territorial and institutional dimensions to be taken into account as it places social dimension at the center of the analysis. Second, we illustrate the common patrimony concept by using the case of water management policy in France.

In 2010, five of the six largest publishers simultaneously adopted the agency model of book sales, allowing them to directly set retail prices. This led the Department of Justice to file suit against the publishers in 2012, the settlement of which prevents the publishers from interfering with retailers' ability to set e-book prices. Using a unique dataset of daily e-book prices for a large sample of books across major online retailers, we exploit cross-publisher variation in the timing of the return to the wholesale model to estimate its effect on retail prices. We find that e-book prices for titles that were previously sold using the agency model decreased by 18 percent at Amazon and 8 percent at Barnes & Noble. Our results are robust to different specifications, placebo tests, and synthetic control groups. Our findings illustrate a case where upstream firms prefer to set higher retail prices than retailers and help to clarify conflicting theoretical predictions on agency versus wholesale models.","[De los Santos, Babur] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Wildenbeest, Matthijs R.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN USA",Clemson University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"De los Santos, B (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",babur@clemson.edu; mwildenb@indiana.edu,,,NET Institute,NET Institute,"We thank Tobias Klein, Daniel O'Brien, Ricard Gill, Jeff Prince, and Arun Sundararajan for their useful comments and suggestions.

An important debate concerns the levels of governance at which deforestation can be reduced effectively. Political economic theory and evidence suggests that national governments are more likely than subnational governments in agricultural frontiers to adopt restrictive forest conservation policies, due to differences in political constituencies and capacity. Here we examine the validity of this claim using an impact study of provincial-level land use planning in Argentina's main deforestation frontier, the Dry Chaco. In 2007, Argentina's provinces were obliged to define land use zoning for their native forests, but had considerable leeway in its implementation. We use data from 30,126 properties in the provinces of Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Chaco, and a rigorous counterfactual estimation strategy to quantify the extent to which adopted zoning plans affected deforestation. We find evidence that provincial-level land use zoning reduced deforestation in all three provinces, but not in all zones and periods. Differences in impact are associated with differences in the location of zones and the timing of planning. Our findings suggest that subnational governments can make important contributions to reducing large-scale deforestation in agricultural frontiers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Most of the approaches so far have been using very restrictive fully parametric specified models, both for the frontier function and for the components of the stochastic terms. Recently, local MLE approaches were introduced to relax these parametric hypotheses. In this work we show that most of the benefits of the local MLE approach can be obtained with less assumptions and involving much easier, faster and numerically more robust computations, by using nonparametric least-squares methods. Our approach can also be viewed as a semi-parametric generalization of the so-called modified OLS that was introduced in the parametric setup. If the final evaluation of individual efficiencies requires, as in the local MLE approach, the local specification of the distributions of noise and inefficiencies, it is shown that a lot can be learned on the production process without such specifications. Even elasticities of the mean inefficiency can be analyzed with unspecified noise distribution and a general class of local one-parameter scale family for inefficiencies. This allows to discuss the variation in inefficiency levels with respect to explanatory variables with minimal assumptions on the Data Generating Process.","[Simar, Leopold; Van Keilegom, Ingrid] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, Voie Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Zelenyuk, Valentin] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Zelenyuk, Valentin] Univ Queensland, Ctr Efficiency & Prod Anal, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Simar, L (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Stat Biostat & Sci Actuarielles, Voie Roman Pays 20, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",leopold.simar@uclouvain.be; ingrid.vankeilegom@uclouvain.be; v.zelenyuk@uq.edu.au,"Zelenyuk, Valentin/L-3687-2019","Van Keilegom, Ingrid/0000-0001-8827-7642",IAP Research Network of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy) [P7/06]; European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) ERC [203650]; contract Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concertees (ARC) of the Communaute francaise de Belgique - Academie universitaire Louvain [11/16-039]; ARC [DP130101022],IAP Research Network of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); European Research Council under the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); contract Projet d'Actions de Recherche Concertees (ARC) of the Communaute francaise de Belgique - Academie universitaire Louvain; ARC(Australian Research Council),"This research was supported by IAP Research Network P7/06 of the Belgian State (Belgian Science Policy).

Evidence Regarding the Risks Associated with this Wetland Offset Arrangement in Florida,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY; ECONOMICS; MARKETS,"This paper describes and analyzes the risks associated with using mitigation banking for the conservation of wetlands in Florida in the United States. First, we attempt to identify and summarize the main ecological and socioeconomic risks regarding mitigation banking that have been discussed in previous studies. Then we analyze the institutional responses adopted by US regulators to limit these risks. We have used empirical evidence including interviews and data analysis to assess the effectiveness of these responses. Our main findings are that the recent regulatory responses adopted to face risks associated with mitigation banking seem to be more effective than what is often assumed. These responses are underpinned by the emergence of a hybrid mode of governance that combines market characteristics and regulatory constraints, and which contributes to enforcing wetland compensation in Florida. However, we also observed some risks inherent in this system, in particular the redistribution of ecosystem services, as the distance between impact sites and compensation sites seems to have increased in Florida in the last several years. In addition, the question is still pending regarding whether or not No Net Loss of wetlands is really achieved through mitigation banking. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The impact of consensual science on global environmental policy-making is determined, inter alia, by a number of multidimensional factors. Some of these factors are closely associated with the nature and content of the usable scientific knowledge base. This article introduces the concept of gradated scientific validity and demonstrates how different types and aspects of consensual scientific information affect variously the negotiation process of international environmental agreements. Drawing on the negotiation of the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean against Pollution from Land-Based Sources (1980), it shows that the thorough examination and in-depth analysis of the content and basic characteristics of the available scientific knowledge play a pivotal role in the elaboration and formulation of effective implementing measures of an environmental agreement. It is argued that the prominence of consensual science and subsequently its influence on environmental negotiations are substantially determined by the dynamic role of two interrelated variables of gradated scientific validity: the high or low degree of consensus in relation to the significance and value of the provided scientific information (degree of consensus), and the expanding or narrow scientific consensus on distinct underlying aspects of a negotiating problem, including its causes, extent and consequences (content of consensus). This article indicates that the extensive analysis of the nature, content and distinct characteristics of a consensual knowledge base lays the groundwork for comprehensively understanding the role of consensual science in the negotiation and implementation of an international environmental agreement.","[Kailis, Alexandros] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Int European & Area Studies, MEPIELAN Ctr Mediterranean Programme Int Environm, Athens, Greece",Panteion University,"Kailis, A (通讯作者)，Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Dept Int European & Area Studies, MEPIELAN Ctr Mediterranean Programme Int Environm, Athens, Greece.",alexkailis76@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

Data included 3,180,578 hospital discharges in Norway covering the period 1999-2008. For reimbursement purposes, all discharges are grouped in diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). We examined pairs of DRGs where the addition of one or more specific diagnoses places the patient in a complicated rather than an uncomplicated group, yielding higher reimbursement. The economic incentive was measured as the potential gain in income by coding a patient as complicated, and we analysed the association between this gain and the share of complicated discharges within the DRG pairs. Using multilevel linear regression modelling, we estimated both differences between hospitals for each DRG pair and changes within hospitals for each DRG pair over time. Over the whole period, a one-DRG-point difference in price was associated with an increased share of complicated discharges of 14.2 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 11.2-17.2) percentage points. However, a one-DRG-point change in prices between years was only associated with a 0.4 (95 % CI to 1.8) percentage point change of discharges into the most complicated diagnostic category. Although there was a strong increase in complicated discharges over time, this was not as closely related to price changes as expected.","[Anthun, Kjartan Sarheim; Bjorngaard, Johan Hakon; Magnussen, Jon] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth & Gen Practice, NTNU, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Anthun, Kjartan Sarheim] SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Hlth Res, Trondheim, Norway; [Bjorngaard, Johan Hakon] St Olavs Univ Hosp Trondheim, Forens Dept, Trondheim, Norway; [Bjorngaard, Johan Hakon] St Olavs Univ Hosp Trondheim, Res Ctr Broset, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); SINTEF; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Anthun, KS (通讯作者)，Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth & Gen Practice, NTNU, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.;Anthun, KS (通讯作者)，SINTEF Technol & Soc, Dept Hlth Res, Trondheim, Norway.",Kjartan.Anthun@ntnu.no,"Anthun, Kjartan S/F-9746-2012",,Norwegian research council [214338],Norwegian research council(Research Council of Norway),This study was funded by the Norwegian research council (Grant number 214338).,,28,14,14,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

Unlike Danish dairy cooperatives, whose success before the First World War was linked to their ability to improve product quality and compete in high-value niche markets, wine cooperatives are often associated with the production of large volumes of low-quality products. This article argues that the initial slow diffusion of wine cooperatives was caused by the difficulties of improving quality due to environmental conditions in European vineyards (terroir') and measurement problems, rather than institutional shortcomings. Cooperatives only became widespread when the state found them a useful instrument to regulate markets, especially after 1950. The problems associated with poor wine quality were never resolved, and cooperatives have become increasingly uncompetitive in the market place, especially following the major decline in per capita consumption and shift towards premium wines from the 1980s.","[Fernandez, Eva] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Getafe, Spain; Inst Figuerola, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Fernández, E (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Getafe, Spain.",,"FERNANDEZ, EVA/AAA-7570-2019","FERNANDEZ GARCIA, Eva/0000-0002-7729-7792",Spanish government [ECO2012-36213]; Fundacion Ramon Areces,Spanish government(Spanish Government); Fundacion Ramon Areces,Financial assistance was provided by the Spanish government (ECO2012-36213) and Fundacion Ramon Areces ('Desigualdad and Conflicto' Project).,,83,17,17,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The investigation aims to analyze the problem of value appropriation comparing the payment based on carcass index with live weight mode under the perspective of bovine for slaughtering as a multidimensional product with various attributes. Design/methodology/approach - This study employs a generalized order logistic regression model in a survey with 69 cattle breeders' interview to conduct the empirical analysis. Findings - The empirical results show that measurement difficulties and collective actions influence farmers' choice to a less efficient payment system in quality terms and value appropriation problems, while the trust level in the slaughterhouse pushes to a more efficient system. Furthermore, trust was presented as more important than technological aspects and long-time relationship as well as collective action corroborates to increase bargaining power and to solve conflicts. In sum, trust, measurement and bargaining power brought traditional and alternative solutions to solve conflicts such as well-designed payment indicators, collective actions and transaction costs. Originality/value - This study used first-hand survey and proxy variables on cattle farmers' payment system choices. Another contribution is the focus on two regions with two different payment systems in the same institutional environment in a way to suggest mechanisms of private strategies and public policy to reduce opportunistic value appropriation as well as decreasing conflict.","[de Oliveira, Gustavo Magalhaes] Univ Sao Paulo FEA USP, Sch Econ Business & Accounting, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Queiroz Caleman, Silvia Morales; Puperi, Morenise] Fed Univ Mato Grosso Sul UFMS, Sch Business Adm, Campo Grande, Brazil; [da Cunha, Christiano Franca] Univ Campinas UNICAMP, Sch Business Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"de Oliveira, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo FEA USP, Sch Econ Business & Accounting, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",gustavomoliv@gmail.com,"de Queiroz Caleman, Silvia Morales/H-9993-2017; Cunha, Christiano/N-3310-2014","de Queiroz Caleman, Silvia Morales/0000-0001-7560-5141; Cunha, Christiano/0000-0002-2590-3818",,,,,31,7,8,1,4,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

An empirical evaluation using best-worst method,BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Food labels; Preferences; Best-worst approach,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; NUTRITION; PREFERENCES; PRODUCTS; CHEESE; WELFARE; CLAIMS; FAT; INFORMATION; CONSUMPTION,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate Spanish consumer preferences for several food-labelling schemes on semi-cured, pasteurised sheep milk cheese. In particular, the authors used three labels regulated by the European Union regulation (European organic logo, protected denomination of origin (PDO) and nutritional fat content), and the remaining four have been introduced to the European food market by private initiatives (local, carbon footprint, food miles and animal welfare). Design/methodology/approach - A Best-Worst Discrete Choice approach was applied in Spain during Fall 2011 by administrating a survey to 549 consumers. Findings - The results suggest that the most valued labels are the PDO, followed by the organic logo and the nutritional panel. The least valued are food-miles labelling and carbon foodprint labels, while local-origin labels and animal welfare are in the middle position. Originality/value - This study is the first to value consumer preferences for cheese products bearing several public and private European food-labelling schemes since literature on consumer preferences for food labels has only dealt with a comparison of a few (two or at most three) food-labelling schemes. In addition, the added value of this paper is also the use of the BWC approach that has the advantage of providing the best way to discriminate the degree of importance given by respondents to each food labels by overcoming the problem of bias caused by differences in the use of rating scales.","[de-Magistris, Tiziana; Gracia, Azucena] Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon, Unidad Econ Agr, Zaragoza, Spain; [de-Magistris, Tiziana; Gracia, Azucena] Univ Zaragoza, CITA, IA2, Zaragoza, Spain; [Barreiro-Hurle, Jesus] European Commiss, JRC, Econ Agr Unit D4, Directorate Sustainable Resources D, Seville, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"de-Magistris, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest & Tecnol Agroalimentaria Aragon, Unidad Econ Agr, Zaragoza, Spain.;de-Magistris, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, CITA, IA2, Zaragoza, Spain.",tmagistris@gmail.com,", Azucena/N-6263-2019; barreiro-hurle, jesus/A-7042-2008","barreiro-hurle, jesus/0000-0002-6422-6047; de Magistris, Tiziana/0000-0001-5480-183X",EU Marie Curie Project [FOODLABELS_PIOF-GA-2009-253323],EU Marie Curie Project(European Union (EU)),"This study has been funded by the EU Marie Curie Project, FOODLABELS_PIOF-GA-2009-253323, The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the European Commission.",,67,36,36,4,67,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The project started in the academic year 2014/2015 and is currently in its last year of implementation. The general objective of the project is to improve education regarding European integration issues and contribute to a greater visibility of EU studies at the national and international level. Among other target groups, the project is of relevance to students who are not exposed to European law studies, for whom a specific activity was conceived: a seminar on the protection of the rights of individuals in EU law. The seminar set specific objectives: to provide participants with the opportunity to hear about and discuss basic topics of EU law as well as understand the importance of having a basic knowledge of EU law; to give an overview of a number of EU legal documents; to equip participants with knowledge of the rights of individuals within EU law and encourage participants to disseminate their knowledge to their colleagues. The main aim of this paper is to answer whether the specific objectives of the seminar on the protection of the rights of individuals in EU law have been achieved and how (and if) it contributes to the general objectives of the project. The research question arising from the set objectives: Has seminar participation increased participants' awareness of their rights deriving from EU law? To answer the research question, a survey was conducted on the participants of the five seminars held from the beginning of the project.","[Duic, Dunja; Petrasevic, Tunjica] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair European Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Duic, D (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair European Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia.",dduic@pravos.hr; tpetrase@pravos.hr,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,454,462,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500043,0

However recent experimental evidence highlights the potential for synergies between participatory rulemaking and enforcement. This paper therefore seeks to build upon these findings to explore the relationship between local rulemaking, local monitoring and compliance in field settings. The results which draw upon data about the behavior of 93 fuelwood user groups in state-owned forest commons in Asia, Africa and Latin America suggest that the average group is more likely to comply with rules when local rulemaking is combined with local monitoring. However, in some contexts it appears that local rulemaking in particular and other institutional arrangements in general may yield similar results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Even though a few attempts have been made to analyse whether market potential might influence urban structures, this period is especially interesting because it is characterised by advances in the economic integration of the national market together with an intense process of industrialisation. By using an elaborated measure of market potential at the city level, our results show a positive influence of this market potential on city growth, although this influence is heterogeneous over time.

Traditional investment management focuses on the combination of multiple securities, but it puts more emphasis on individual security, as the simple assembly of individual management. Investment combination theory regards combination as one entity, and pays attention to the balance between earnings and risks of the combination entity. As an extremely complex system, on the security market, securities' earnings and risks are both characterized with uncertainty, which is difficulty in decision-making analysis researches. Moreover, uncertainty of events mainly has two presentation forms: First, uncertainty whether the events happen or not, i.e., randomness. Second, uncertainty of event's state, i.e., fuzziness. Investment combination selection is about investor's investment decision-making in the uncertain environment. Now, the researches on investment combination based on random uncertainty have been well-improved, and those based on fuzzy uncertainty have gradually obtained extensive understanding and concerns. The paper focuses on investor's internal uncertainty. The investor may be optimistic, pessimistic or compromising, and even more elaborate. The paper will conduct modeling analysis of different investors' thoughts, aiming at effectively combining interval number theory and investment combination theory.","[Guo, Xuemeng; Zhang, Qiming] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Zhang, QM (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xmguo@bjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-0995-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ6EQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426596000073,0

There is little knowledge about whether DACCs affect only a small area or the complete container load. In seven tests in containers from Costa Rica to Europe since 2009, we observed a high level of spatial temperature variation. Banana pallets are not a perfect rectangular shape and they do not completely fit the inward container dimension, resulting in large variations of gap widths. The effect is enhanced by the biological variance of respiration activity. We set up a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation for the airflow and temperature in a container loaded with bananas to provide a better understanding of DACC effects, because detailed experimental evaluation was not feasible in a commercial cold chain. The complex geometrics of a container with 960 boxes had to be reduced to a two-dimensional model. Almost all DACCs had a predominant local effect. For the following DACCs, cooling was slower only in some affected boxes: (a) blocking of a horizontal channel in one pallet and (b) narrow vertical gaps. Double heat generation by higher respiration activity in part of one pallet also had a predominant local effect. The temperature was between 1.7 and 4.7 degrees C higher than for the reference case with normal airflow conditions at 48 h after the start of cooling. Only circulation bypasses by packing mistakes and a reduction of inlet air speed had a significant effect on the average container temperature, of + 0.6 degrees C maximum. Quality problems and losses of full container loads, as regularly reported in ocean transport, cannot be explained by a single DACC according to our simulation results. A combination of at least two DACCs is necessary to cause severe quality problems.","[Jedermann, R.; Lang, W.] Univ Bremen, Inst Microsensors Actors & Syst IMSAS, Bremen, Germany; [Lang, W.] MCB, Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen; University of Bremen,"Jedermann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Microsensors Actors & Syst IMSAS, Bremen, Germany.",rjedermann@imsas.uni-bremen.de,"Jedermann, Reiner/ABA-6297-2021; Lang, Walter/G-3835-2011","Jedermann, Reiner/0000-0002-0390-9143; Lang, Walter/0000-0002-9813-5231","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany [01IA10001]; German Research Foundation (DFG) [Je722/1]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research was supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany under reference number 01IA10001 'The Intelligent Container' and by the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the project 'In-network data analysis of spatially distributed quantities' under grant Je722/1.

The above legislation thus became the foundation of the establishment of a new social and legal order. The process of nationalization strongly affected the legal status of individual manorial estates in eastern Slavonia. Although listed manors had lost their distinctive shape and size of the property by the agrarian legislation adopted between the two World Wars, the application of regulations on nationalization resulted in a weakening of economic activity and some proprietary issues that are still trying to be solved by the application of The Act on Restitution/Compensation of Property Confiscated During the Yugoslav Communist Rule.

Canada ranks second in gasoline consumption among OECD countries and Canadian gasoline expenditure share has been increasing since the 1990s. Fuel efficiency policies aim to decrease gasoline consumption; however, the effect can be mitigated by changes in consumer behavior such as traveling more distances-a rebound effect. Thus, the effectiveness of fuel efficiency policy is dependent on the magnitude of the rebound effect. In this paper, we estimate the rebound effect for personal transportation in Canada using data from the household spending survey for the period 1997-2009. The model includes a system of expenditure share equations for gasoline, other energy goods, and non-energy goods specified by AIDS and QUAIDS models and estimated by the nonlinear SUR method. Our estimation results show a rather high average rebound effect of 82-88% but with significant heterogeneity across income groups, provinces, and gasoline prices. Specifically, the rebound effect ranges from 63 to 96% across income groups and provinces and increases with gasoline prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Businesses should work by using the sources of information that are most appropriate in terms of business while conducting innovation activities. Innovative projects to be undertaken in this area are crucial for the development of companies as well as for the global scale of e-commerce. The design and implementation of an effective management strategy along with innovation is crucial for the ability of the business to regularly control its own performance and update the operating systems of the company in this respect. At the time when technological developments are rapidly entering our lives, businesses that cannot keep up with the developments will fall into a disadvantageous situation in terms of competition. The use of resources from domestic and foreign sources in innovation activities will ensure faster inclusion in the process. If these conditions are met, it should always be remembered that businesses will be in an advantageous position in terms of competition. All companies that want to gain competitive advantage in a dynamic sector should invest in electronic commerce and bring all their products and services to the customer in virtual environment. Nowadays this is no longer an option, it is a necessity. Electronic commerce will increase the speed of doing business, delivering products to the customers at a lower cost through the internet, and reducing the costs to a great extent by allowing them to enter the world markets more competitively. This will expand the market space and make it easier to reach potential customers. At this point, companies will gain a core competitive advantage and both sales capacities and annual sales will be increased with the dynamism brought by the internet. Considering that the internet has also reduced stock and inventory costs, it can be said that electronic commerce has a direct and positive effect on business performance if it is perceived and used correctly. In this study, the interaction of innovation management and electronic commerce will be examined in this direction.","[Onalan, Mehmet Sercan] Szent Istvan Univ, Management & Business Adm, Pater Karoly U 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Önalan, MS (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Management & Business Adm, Pater Karoly U 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",sercanonalan@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,864,871,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300108,0

One of the primary constraints for its production is the lack of information regarding oil extraction from an industrial perspective. The purpose of this paper is to ensure the success of pistachio oil production at a commercial scale, attention should be paid to the effect of the main extraction procedures on the characteristics of oil, the consumer acceptance of these oils and their production cost. Design/methodology/approach - Comparison and evaluation of the physicochemical and sensory characteristics and production cost of oil extracted using two different production lines ( hydraulic press and screw press) are considered here. Findings - Slight differences were found in the physicochemical analysis, but significant differences were identified in the sensory analysis. Consumer judges preferred the oil extracted with the hydraulic press. According to production costs, the break-even value that makes screw press extraction sustainable is (sic)70.4 per litre, while for the hydraulic press it is (sic)91.0 per litre, mainly due to a lower extraction yield and the longer extraction time required. As production costs of both methods are high, pistachio oil quality should prevail, making the use of the hydraulic press more advisable. Originality/value - Although significant research has been conducted to analyse pistachio oil composition and nutritional value, little attention has been paid to differences that appear regarding consumer preferences and production costs depending on the production method used. This paper provides a comprehensive approach to high-quality pistachio oil production from an industrial perspective.","[Rabadan, Adrian; Alvarez-Orti, Manuel; Pardo, Jose E.; Gomez, Ricardo; Olmeda, Miguel] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Higher Tech Sch Agr & Forestry Engn, Albacete, Spain; [Pardo-Gimenez, Arturo] Mushroom Res Experimentat & Serv Ctr, Quintanar Del Rey, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Rabadán, A (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Higher Tech Sch Agr & Forestry Engn, Albacete, Spain.",adrian.rabadan@uclm.es,"Rabadan, Adrian/A-7878-2019; Pardo-Giménez, Arturo/K-5534-2018; PARDO, JOSE EMILIO/K-9269-2014; Alvarez-Orti, Manuel/K-1212-2014","Rabadan, Adrian/0000-0002-8276-5407; Pardo-Giménez, Arturo/0000-0002-1820-0372; PARDO, JOSE EMILIO/0000-0002-4335-6475; Gomez Ladron de Guevara, Ricardo/0000-0003-3430-0346; Alvarez-Orti, Manuel/0000-0002-5759-1580",,,,,34,15,15,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

One is a reference greenhouse, the other is a semi-closed greenhouse, called a solar collector. Both greenhouses have a surface area of 307 m(2), and they are equipped with a phytomonitoring system for measuring physiological variables. In addition, the facility has a meteorological station for measuring climatological variables. Accumulative weekly solar radiation, transpiration and CO2 fixation were the input variables and tomato yield the output variable. Tomato 'Pannovy' yields were recorded from calendar week 17 to 40; data from weeks 17-32 were used for training, validation and testing the neural network, and weeks 33-40 were used to test the ability of the model as a yield predictor. A layered digital neural network (LDDN), a type of dynamic neural network, was applied, which includes delay lines between the layers, so the output also depends on previous inputs and/or previous states of the network. The best LDDN model was chosen on the basis of a suitable architecture (i.e., a minimum number of hidden layers and neurons connected to an output layer). Also, two statistical measures were used to examine the goodness of fit between measured and predicted yields, the correlation coefficient (R) and the mean absolute error (MAE). Results show that an LDDN with one hidden layer with four nodes, six delays for the inputs and four delays for the output variable gives the best performance. The most influencing variable for tomato yield prediction was CO2 fixation, and the less important variable was transpiration. This work shows the power of the LDDN for prediction purposes, which can be used to predict yields in both greenhouses one week in advance.","[Salazar, R.; Lopez, I.; Rojano, A.] Autonomous Univ Chapingo, Km 38-5 Carr, Mexico Texcoco 56230, Edo Mexico, Mexico; [Dannehl, D.; Schmidt, U.] Biosyst Engn Div, Albrecht Thaer Weg 3, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",,"Salazar, R (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Chapingo, Km 38-5 Carr, Mexico Texcoco 56230, Edo Mexico, Mexico.",raquels60@hotmail.com,,"Salazar Moreno, Raquel/0000-0001-6429-3824",,,,,13,3,3,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-50-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2017,1154.0,,,,,,83,89,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1154.11,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BK1IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431840500011,0

To achieve this objective, a wide range of literature from different information sources, for example, books, magazines, journals, online blogs, brochures and websites were analyzed. There has been increase in disability literature in last few years but authors faced dearth of quality publications in context to person first language. After an in-depth review, authors present results into two categories, (a) examples of what to say and not to while referring individuals with disabilities, and (b) a review on the terminology adopted by various authors in their research to address them. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for future research in educational and professional institutions to assess the knowledge of people with no disabilities in regards to people-first language.

Design/methodology/approach - A salad cream formulation mainly composing of edible oil, egg and vinegar was formulated. Ratios of egg yolk and soy oil were replaced by tofu and coconut oil, respectively. The formulated salad creams were determined for pH, color, viscosity, protein and fat. Sensory acceptances of formulated products was evaluated by using a seven-point hedonic scale test and untrained panelists (n = 30). The formulated salad creams were stored in a refrigerator for 14 days and determined for pH, color and viscosity. Findings - The results showed that the formulated salad creams using the mixture of 50 percent tofu and 50 percent egg yolk (RE) by weight of egg yolk ratio in control presented 4.25 + 0.01 of pH which was comparable to control. The highest scores in the sensory test were obtained in the formula using 37 percent coconut oil by weight of salad cream. The formulated salad creams using tofu and coconut oil (REC) presented 4.42 + 0.03 of pH, 4.25 + 0.05 cm. of viscosity, and 87.36 + 0.44 (L), -1.13 + 0.04 (a), 16.32 + 0.22 (b) of color values. Protein and fat contents were 4.79 and 27.59 percent (w/w) in the REC, respectively. After storage under refrigerated, pH, color and viscosity of the modified product were less changed. Originality/value - Replacement of egg yolk and soy oil with tofu and coconut oil in salad creams was feasible. The REC was less changed in its quality both fresh and after storage. It was accepted in sensory evaluation. The REC could prepare at home and being a food choice for consumers.","[Sirison, Jiraporn] King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Fac Agroind, Bangkok, Thailand; [Rirermwong, Awika] CPRAM Co Ltd, Bangkok, Thailand; [Tanwisuit, Nattawadee] Synergy Flavours Thailand Ltd, Samut Prakan, Thailand; [Meaksan, Taviyaporn] Amcor Flexibles Bangkok Publ Co Ltd, Dept Qual Syst, Samut Prakan, Thailand",King Mongkuts Institute of Technology Ladkrabang,"Sirison, J (通讯作者)，King Mongkuts Inst Technol Ladkrabang, Fac Agroind, Bangkok, Thailand.",jsirison@yahoo.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,4,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Prior studies suggest that as employee age increases, their attitudes towards computers tend to be more negative. In addition, with age work capacity changes and older employees experience decline in physical abilities and decreased perception and work pace. Therefore, in the light of a widespread use of information and communication technology (ICT) in today's organizations and an ageing workforce it is essential to investigate considerations of ICT acceptance by older workers. In doing so, the current papers focuses on enterprise systems (ES), which are very complex ICT-related systems supporting the management and integration of the whole company. The main goal of the current paper is to better understand considerations of ICT adoption by older workers. To this end, the study draws from investigations performed among ES practitioners in Poland. The analyzed considerations include impediments, failure factors, problem solutions, and recommendations for improvement perceived by older workers. The findings suggest that the most critical issues perceived by older workers include system and data quality, organizational and system fit, trainings, finance, and project preparation.","[Soja, Piotr] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Soja, P (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Comp Sci, Krakow, Poland.",eisoja@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Soja, Piotr/R-7293-2019","Soja, Piotr/0000-0002-7274-3327",,,,,18,0,0,0,4,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,178,188,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500014,0

However, Mexico's vulnerability to climate change impacts is a major motivating factor behind its announced intended contributions at COP21 to cut its baseline emissions by at least 25% in 2030. We analyze the macroeconomic impacts of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) process undertaken in the Mexican border state of Baja California (BC). We adapt a state-of-the-art regional macroeconometric model to analyze the BC economy-wide impacts of 22 GHG mitigation policy options recommended in the Baja California CAP. The combined effects include an average annual increase of 1680 new jobs (or about 0.11% of the average annual employment in the baseline economic forecast) and a Gross State Product (GSP) increase of $9.85 billion pesos in NPV over the 2015-2030 planning horizon. Although the main objective of GHG mitigation is to reduce atmospheric concentrations, and hence future potential damages of these pollutants, the stimulus to the BC economy from the implementation of its CAP represents a valuable co-benefit. Moreover, it is a tangible one that will take place in the near-term, in contrast to the more long-term and more uncertain benefits associated with reducing climate change damages.

Interestingly, big retailers vary in their policies regarding whether to allow their salespeople to receive manufacturer SPIFF (Sales Person Incentive Funding Formula) payments, which motivate salespeople advising at no cost of the retailer. In this study, we investigate a big retailer's incentive to block manufacturer SPIFF programs, which has the consequence of demotivating salespeople from advising customers, from the perspective of vertical channel interactions. We scrutinize a big retailer's decision to maximize its profit through managing its channel interactions with upstream manufacturers offering horizontally differentiated products, customers uncertain about true fits with competing products, and its salesperson who can match customers with suitable products through offering purchase advice. Our analysis shows that motivating the salesperson to advise customers is profitable for the retailer only if the such advising has moderate effectiveness in matching consumers and suitable products, and only in this case would the retailer collaborate on manufacturer SPIFF programs. Otherwise, salesperson advising hurts retailer profit and the big retailer benefits from blocking manufacturer SPIFF programs. Our study reveals the interesting theoretical insight that the incentives of a big retailer and upstream manufacturers to motivate sales advising reside in their incentives to battle for a more favorable channel status.","[Gu, Zheyin (Jane)] Univ Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd,UNIT 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Liu, Yunchuan] Univ Illinois, 415 Wohlers Hall,1206 South Sixth St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Gu, ZY (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, 2100 Hillside Rd,UNIT 1041, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",jane.gu@business.uconn.edu; liuf@illinois.edu,,"GU, ZHEYIN (Jane)/0000-0002-8166-0144",,,,,32,2,2,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

This paper argues that the control and capture of water resources are not solely for economic development but rather for geopolitical reasons that serve the security interests of the actors involved, particularly outside-basin powers like the US and India. The Afghan Government similarly views dams as symbols of nation-building and a way of staying in power. In the absence of a lasting trilateral agreement, the existing nature of the geopolitical dynamics of the basin has led upstream Afghanistan and downstream Iran and Turkmenistan to unilaterally establish their rights to control the rules of the game. This paper suggests that sustainable solutions will not be reached unless the geopolitical nature of the basin and outside interventions can center on a normative understanding of the regional interests, identities, and commonalities of all the riparian states.","[Nagheeby, Mohsen] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Warner, Jeroen] Wageningen Univ, Disaster Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands",Northumbria University; Wageningen University & Research,"Nagheeby, M (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",mohsen.nagheeby@northumbria.ac.uk,,,,,,,101,22,28,4,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

These communities' remoteness, insularity and the small size of the local economy make the fishery production sensitive to the way in which fishers interact with other community members and to local environmental changes. This paper investigates how social capital and environmental threats to local fishing activities are associated with fishery productivity using the data collected in a small-island fishing community in Indonesia. We estimate the technical efficiency and capacity utilization, and examine how these measures are related to the social capital built around the island community. The impacts of environmental changes that are perceived as threats to local fishing activities are also evaluated. We find that inefficiency in the fisheries' production is correlated with whether fishers are tied to community members outside their own fishing groups and whether they are exposed to environmental threats, the sources of which are internal and external to the fisheries system. The underutilization of existing capacity is evident for fishers who receive government aid for fishing equipment and those who perceive population growth and aquaculture development as a threat to their fishing activities.","[Yamazaki, Satoshi; Hoshino, Eriko] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Yamazaki, Satoshi] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Resosudarmo, Budy P.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Indonesia Project, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Girsang, Wardis] Univ Pattimura, Fac Agr, Nusaniwe, Indonesia; [Hoshino, Eriko] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Australian National University; Universitas Pattimura; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Yamazaki, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Private Bag 84, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",Satoshi.Yamazaki@utas.edu.au,"Hoshino, Eriko/N-7557-2013; Yamazaki, Satoshi/J-7538-2014; GIRSANG, Wardis/AAB-6221-2021; Resosudarmo, Budy P/K-1129-2017","Yamazaki, Satoshi/0000-0003-1279-2706; GIRSANG, Wardis/0000-0002-4104-2325;",University of Tasmania's Research Enhancement Grant Scheme [Y0020940]; Australia Indonesia Centre's small project grant [01ASP1ANUResoHAS009],University of Tasmania's Research Enhancement Grant Scheme; Australia Indonesia Centre's small project grant,"The authors are grateful to Ir.

In this study, we present a scheduling and routing model that aims at simultaneously selecting a visit combination for each food provider and welfare agency, and designing routes to meet their required service levels minimizing the total transportation cost, while satisfying certain operational constraints. This problem is driven by food relief operations in Sydney. Our specific goals are to develop an integrated linear programming model and to propose a Tabu Search based heuristic solution approach for this scheduling and routing problem. We also implement the algorithm in a realistic food rescue and delivery network in Sydney. We test our heuristic algorithm on instances taken from literature and on small instances generated similar to that of Cordeau's benchmark instances and validate our solution approach against the optimal solutions obtained through the exact method before implementing it on food rescue and delivery network. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing heuristics and is able to solve the real-world scenarios using significantly fewer resources than are employed in practice.

Thanks to a between design allowing to increase the degree of plants' identifiability, we test whether IVE is likely to enhance farmers' participation in a conservation program, using mail survey data among a sample of French farmers located in the Vaucluse area. Unlike humans and animals, we found that IVE does not matter regarding plants, as farmer willingness to participate in the compensation measures was found to decrease as the (plant) victim(s) become more identifiable.

It was still a commercial bank, albeit one that had acquired some central bank functions. The war period was decisive in removing this ambiguity. The change was caused mostly by an unusually large influx of international means of payment (gold and foreign exchange) as a consequence of Portugal's neutrality during the war. However, all of this happened during a very troubled period for the BoP, thanks to the collapse of the gold-exchange standard. The BoP adapted quickly to the new environment of discretion, government interference, and nationalism, although in a relatively original way: it followed the trend but at the same time retained certain features of a central bank still committed to gold standard principles. The two essential objectives of the BoP were to keep the value of the Portuguese currency stable and to keep interest rates low in order to encourage economic growth. The bank was successful on both counts during the war and the postwar period using a series of non-conventional instruments.","[Amaral, Luciano] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Amaral, L (通讯作者)，Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",lamaral@novasbe.pt,,"Amaral, Luciano/0000-0001-9606-5738",Bank of Portugal,Bank of Portugal,"Research pursued with a grant conceded by the Bank of Portugal.

As this happens, inequality is expected first to increase and then to decline in what is known as the Kuznets inverted-U. But the literature has not paid much attention to differences in the absolute size of cities potentially affecting economy-wide inequality. Building on insights from the urban economics literature, this paper studies the relationship between the size and distribution of cities and income inequality at country level. Results show that beyond Kuznets' hypothesis there is a U-shaped relationship between average city size and inequality; inequality first falls and then increases with average city size. This result is robust to a long list of controls, different estimation techniques, and identification strategies.","[Castells-Quintana, David] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Edificio B,Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Castells-Quintana, D (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Edificio B,Campus UAB, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain.",David.Castells.Quintana@uab.ca,"Castells-Quintana, David/Z-2511-2019","Castells-Quintana, David/0000-0002-0250-7214",[ECO2016-75805-R]; [ECO2016-76855-P]; ESRC [ES/P006299/1] Funding Source: UKRI,; ; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I want to thank Vicente Royuela, Paolo Veneri, Oriol Roca, Rosella Nicolini, Jens Suedekum, and two anonymous referees for their comments.

Hedonic regressions on real prices allowed me to advance evidence that the market was competitive and that an important determinant of artistic innovation was driven by economic incentives. Price differentials reflected quality differentials between painters as perceived at the time (whose proxy is the length of the biography of Vasari) and did not depend on regional destinations, as expected under monopolistic competition with free entry. An inverse-U relation between prices and age of execution is consistent with reputational theories of artistic effort, and prices increased since the 1420s.","[Etro, Federico] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Fond Ta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Etro, F (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Fond Ta S Giobbe 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",federico.etro@unive.it,,,,,,,71,12,13,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-0507,1471-6372,,J ECON HIST,J.

However, the successful implementation and sustainability of such initiatives depends on resource users' willingness to engage. Some studies claim that resource users will only participate and invest their time in management when the financial benefits received exceed the costs. However, evidence suggests that people cooperate and may volunteer even when not directly rewarded. We evaluated whether economic benefits earned from resource exploitation or cooperative behavior better explained the likelihood of peoples voluntary participation in monitoring. We studied an Amazonian forest community in Brazil, who harvested and traded a commercially-important non-timber forest product (NTFP), and gathered data using the following procedures: a survey applied to 166 adults in order to estimate peoples NTFP dependence, cooperative behavior and intention to engage in monitoring tasks; and the implementation of pilot-monitoring tasks to observe who participated. Based on mixed-effects regressions, the results indicated that both factors can predict intended and actual participation, although cooperative behavior was a stronger and more consistent predictor. Thus, fostering community cooperation may outcompete financial benefits in ensuring engagement in natural resource management.","[Brites, Alice Dantas] Univ Sao Paulo, Ave Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Morsello, Carla] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Artes Ciencias & Humanidades, R Arlindo Bettio 1000, BR-03828000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Brites, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Ave Padua Dias 11, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil.",alicebrites@usp.br; morsello@usp.br,"Morsello, Carla/D-7393-2012; Brites, Alice/AAG-7050-2019","Morsello, Carla/0000-0001-7548-6541;",Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Higher Education and Personnel Improvement Coordination (CAPES),Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Higher Education and Personnel Improvement Coordination (CAPES),"The study was funded by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Higher Education and Personnel Improvement Coordination (CAPES).

His income-based estimates start with the daily real wages of adult males and assume that days worked per year were constant. Those advanced in British economic growth make no such assumption and instead are built up from the output side. They correlate better with population trends and are consistent with an economy slowly growing and becoming richer. Clark's denial that such growth occurred, his assertion that substantially more land must have been under arable cultivation, his belief that conditions of full employment invariably prevailed in the countryside at harvest time, his concern that the wage bill would have exceeded the value of output in British economic growth, his refusal to consider the possibility that the working year was of variable length, and his assertion that output per acre must have been equalized across arable and pasture are all shown to be figments of his Malthus delusion'.","[Broadberry, Stephen] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England; [Campbell, Bruce M.

This article presents the case of the giant Italian rayon firm Snia Viscosa which was acquired by its direct rivals, Courtaulds in the UK and the German firm Glanzstoff, in 1927. Italian deflation which underpinned the return of the country to the gold standard between 1925 and 1927 and the parlous financial conditions of Snia Viscosa proved incentives in what seemed to be a fire sale investment. This investment mitigated the credit crunch and allowed Snia Viscosa to have access to foreign rayon expertise. Evidence suggests that the regime and economic nationalism exerted some pressure on foreign interests and were instrumental in the abandonment of plans intended to reduce Italian rayon output dramatically. One contribution of this article is its use of business history to illustrate how recessions can reshape foreign direct investment flows and the tensions that may arise between domestic business interests and foreign stakeholders during recessions. In addition, the history of Snia Viscosa shows the importance of foreign interests and multinationals in the long-term industrialization of Italy.","[Cerretano, Valerio] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Cerretano, V (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",,"cerretano, valerio/JFJ-3727-2023",,,,,,74,6,6,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The paper identifies three weaknesses in the literature: postulating scarcity, normative opposition of SAS, and conceptual entanglement. In bridging these, the paper proposes a unified agenda for SAS studies. This agenda includes: (a) a definition of the cases (population) of SAS; (b) a causal map of the determinants of SAS; (c) an outline of key strategies individuals employ to handle SAS. This agenda relies on the language of probability to systematize SAS studies. This approach subsumes the allocation problem of neoclassical economics within a super-set of problems. Recalibrating socio-ecological inquiry to research the dynamics of scarcity, abundance, and sufficiency will not only cast new light on old problems, but also discover new problems that traditionally have been reserved for neoclassical economics.","[Daoud, Adel] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Ctr Business Res, Trumpington St, Cambridge, England; [Daoud, Adel] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Sociol & Work Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Daoud, Adel] Harvard Univ, TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Harvard Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Cambridge; University of Gothenburg; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

However, there is little understanding of differences across multiple markets within a uniform macro context, or how they might vary between different types of NTFPs. Therefore, this study sought to determine the factors and rationale behind the setting of prices for selected NTFPs in 15 different areas of South Africa. The results showed that the pricing factors considered by sellers when setting the prices of NTFP varied with the type of NTFP being sold, type of market (home markets or urban markets) and the method used by the seller to procure the stock. Overall, transport costs, stock price, profit margin, time taken to collect or produce the product and market price were the widely used factors to determine prices for NTFPs. The marked variation in both markets and products show that there was no formal or certain price setting mechanism that was used by NTFP sellers establish the market prices of NTFPs, with price discovery being the most widespread.","[Mugido, Worship; Shackleton, Charlie M.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Mugido, W (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Dept Environm Sci, POB 94, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",wmugido@yahoo.com,"Shackleton, Charlie M/F-4177-2014; Shackleton, Charlie/GLV-1260-2022","Shackleton, Charlie/0000-0002-8489-6136",South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Dept of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation of South Africa [84 379],South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Dept of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa),"This work was funded by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Dept of Science and Technology and the National Research Foundation of South Africa (84 379).

In this study, we establish an equivalence relationship between MOLP problems and combined-oriented DEA models using a direction distance function designed to account for desirable and undesirable inputs and outputs together with uncontrollable variables. This equivalence model can be effectively used to support interactive processes and performance measures designed to establish future performance goals while taking into account the preferences of decision makers (DMs). In particular, it allows DMs to consider different efficiency improvement strategies when subject to budgetary restrictions.

This article presents a micro-analytical study conducted mainly on unpublished sources, focusing on a boundary area (the Geradadda) disputed by Milan and Venice during the long period of the Italian Wars (1494-1559) in a broad European perspective. To understand the impact of wars, the management of local commons and communal assets is analysed in the more general context of the management of local finances. This research shows how local communities organized cooperative behaviours for the defence of local resources, developing innovative credit systems and encouraging a process of redistribution. Before other important factorssuch as the distribution of wealth or of local political and social powercooperation between social groups and the role played by elites were the keystones to limiting the increase in inequality.","[Di Tullio, Matteo] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Di Tullio, Matteo] Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Di Tullio, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.;Di Tullio, M (通讯作者)，Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy.",matteo.ditullio@unibocconi.it,,,European Research Council under the European Union [283802]; European Research Council (ERC) [283802] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"I presented part of the results of this research at the Economic History Society Annual Conference (York, April 2013) and at the First Rural History Conference (Bern, August 2013).

We conducted a field experiment in Daisetsuzan National Park, Japan, to examine the effect on donation behavior of providing information about two types of initial contributions. The first type of contribution is toward the fundraising campaign for trail maintenance and the initial amount of government funding (i.e., seed money) and information is provided about the target amount. The second type is for trail maintenance and information is provided on the value of one day's contribution by other participants. We found that announcing the seed money amount and the target significantly increased the probability of a positive contribution and raised the average contribution, compared with the control treatment of no additional announcements. When the participants knew others' contribution beforehand, the likelihood of a positive contribution increased; however, the average contribution tended to decrease. In conclusion, announcing the seed money and the fundraising target is superior to the other measures studied in this paper to raise funds in this specific context of protected area management.","[Kubo, Takahiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058502, Japan; [Shoji, Yasushi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Tsuge, Takahiro] Konan Univ, Fac Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Kuriyama, Koichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Div Nat Resource Econ, Kyoto, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Hokkaido University; Konan University; Kyoto University,"Kubo, T (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Environm Biol & Ecosyst Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058502, Japan.",kubo.takahiro@nies.go.jp,"Kuriyama, Koichi/AAQ-2599-2021; Shoji, Yasushi/ABC-9052-2021; Shoji, Yasushi/B-7756-2012; Kubo, Takahiro/E-1243-2012; Simão, Marcos/JFK-3827-2023","Kuriyama, Koichi/0000-0003-2905-1621; Shoji, Yasushi/0000-0002-4363-3890; Shoji, Yasushi/0000-0002-4363-3890; Kubo, Takahiro/0000-0002-4832-5539;","Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan (the Environmental Economics and Policy Study); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K00697]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K00697, 17KT0076] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan (the Environmental Economics and Policy Study); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank park staffs at Daisetsuzan National Park for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Two approaches have proven particularly controversial over recent decades; the costs of energy depletion and of climate change. The valuation implications in measuring present welfare have proven problematic, as both include future sustainability consequences arising from resource depletion and environmental impacts. This study includes a 'transition cost' approach to energy depletion, a modified approach to costs of climate change and water pollution, and removes the cost of ozone depletion. The results illustrate that while GDP per capita increased significantly, the ISEW per capita shows a widening gap. Household labour contributes strongly, but income distribution, energy depletion and costs of climate change limit improvement. Sensitivity analysis shows that accumulating climate change costs and escalating energy depletion costs have significant effects. Nevertheless, the new valuation approaches do not alter conclusions that welfare has shown little improvement. The ISEW provides a useful alternative to current indicators such as GDP subject to awareness of limitations. It is a measure of welfare that uses sustainability accounting methods when estimating costs, but is not an indicator of whether welfare is actually sustainable.","[O'Mahony, Tadhg; Escardo-Serra, Paula; Dufour, Javier] IMDEA Energy Inst, Syst Anal Unit, Ave Ramon de la Sagra 3, Mostoles 28935, Spain; [Dufour, Javier] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Chem & Energy Technol, Mostoles 28933, Spain; [O'Mahony, Tadhg] Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Akerlundinkatu 2 B,4 Krs, FI-33100 Tampere, Finland",IMDEA Energy; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of Turku,"O'Mahony, T (通讯作者)，IMDEA Energy Inst, Syst Anal Unit, Ave Ramon de la Sagra 3, Mostoles 28935, Spain.;O'Mahony, T (通讯作者)，Univ Turku, Finland Futures Res Ctr, Akerlundinkatu 2 B,4 Krs, FI-33100 Tampere, Finland.",tadhg.omahony@utu.fi,"Dufour, Javier/A-7079-2010","Dufour, Javier/0000-0003-2497-7310; O'Mahony, Tadhg/0000-0003-2480-7186",Marie Curie Actions AMAROUT-II (PEOPLECOFUND); European Commission; IMDEA Energy Institute,Marie Curie Actions AMAROUT-II (PEOPLECOFUND)(Marie Curie Actions); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); IMDEA Energy Institute,"Tadhg O'Mahony was funded by the Marie Curie Actions AMAROUT-II (PEOPLECOFUND), co-funded by the European Commission and IMDEA Energy Institute.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing on consumer research on positive functions of prices (e.g. the widely held belief that price and quality are positively correlated), the authors present two behavioural experiments that manipulated price cues to estimate the effect on expectations, eating behaviour and willingness-to-pay as central preference indicators. Findings Consistent with the predictions, high prices as initial anchors positively affect food preferences. Furthermore, they incur a positive spill-over effect to subsequent consumption of insects that are unprocessed (i.e. truffles in which mealworms are visible in their entity) and for which no price information is available. Additionally, the authors show that the positive effects of high prices on preferences are muted if prices are artificially lowered (e.g. by means of government subsidies, Experiment 2). Practical implications Taken together, the authors show that preferences for novel foods such as insects can be promoted by systematically taking into account behavioural economic theories. This suggests that behavioural theory can be used to reap environmental benefits of entomophagy. Originality/value This research links behavioural economics with the actual consumption of insects and therefore complements survey research on behavioural intentions.","[Berger, Sebastian] Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland; [Christandl, Fabian] Hsch Fresenius, Cologne, Germany; [Schmidt, Christina] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Baertsch, Christian] Hsch St Gallen Wirtschafts & Sozialwissensch, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Bern; University of Cologne,"Berger, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Bern, Switzerland.",sebastian.berger@iop.unibe.ch,,"Berger, Sebastian/0000-0003-2392-1024; Christandl, Fabian/0000-0001-8487-3762",,,,,34,15,15,8,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach From inquiry result analysis with 305 dairy sector experts, the authors performed statistical tests using the technique of factorial analysis and confirmatory factorial analysis to confirm and/or refute the dairy production barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). Findings The results confirmed the presence of the barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The barrier lack of cooperation between the chain actors is presented as the biggest obstacle in the sector, according to the interviewees. The authors also found that rural exodus is the barrier with the smallest impact on the dairy sector development in relation to other barriers presented by Bonamigo et al. (2016b). The confirmation of these barriers in practice allows developing new studies to eliminate and/or mitigate these barriers of the dairy sector. Furthermore, the study might shed some light on dairy production activities and help improve management skills. Research limitations/implications This study does not cover all the players that make up the dairy production ecosystem. It is limited only to the main players that are inserted in this sector. The authors observed the lack of data characterizing the dairy production system in Santa Catarina. Originality/value This study presents theoretical and practical contribution. By the confirmation that these barriers are present in the field, it is possible to direct new studies that seek to mitigate them and results in dairy production improvements. As for the practical contribution, the confirmation of those barriers can serve as a basis for the dairy sector decision-making actors, such as government, research institutions, and extension, producers, cooperatives, among others, and assist them in developing strategic actions that concern a cooperative way to develop the whole sector.","[Bonamigo, Andrei] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Prod & Syst Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Ferenhof, Helio Aisenberg] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Postgrad Program Informat & Commun Technol, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Tezza, Rafael] Univ Estado Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Forcellini, Fernando Antonio] Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Mech Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC); Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Bonamigo, A (通讯作者)，Fed Univ Santa Catarina UFSC, Dept Prod & Syst Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil.",andreibonamigo@gmail.com; helio@igci.com.br; rafaeltezza@yahoo.com.br; forcellini@gmail.com,"FERENHOF, H.

Excellence in business processes implies the integration of modern process management models and employees. It is practically impossible to respond to excellence requests, and to integrate only one or fewer control models. The company is a very complex system, and human resource management demands from management and designers of the organization of work a modern management theoretical knowledge and leadership skills. Increasing business efficiency can be generated when integrating multiple complementary management models into an enterprise. In this paper, the selected company analyses the effects of integration of several selected control models: Balanced Scorecard, Open-Book Management, MACS, Work-based Compensation System based on Vroom's Expectation Theory and Equity Theory. The fundamental question in this paper is how to design work organization and compensation system, and that worker expectations are based on objective circumstances of the organization, i.e. to eliminate subjectivity in anticipation. Two assumptions are important for the powerful impact of a well-designed system for measuring efficiency and compensation for work motivation factors, Open-book management and Theory of justice. The main goal of the paper is to determine the most well-designed Efficiency Measurement Systems and Work Compensation Systems based on the theory of fairness and access to information Open-Book Management have a direct impact on as objective workers' expectations as possible. This paper investigates the case study of Vinkoprom Ltd from Eastern Slavonia, and the research provides insights into the application of Open-Book Management, a modern business performance measurement system and a work-based compensation system based on expectation theory and theory of justice. Research methodology used in this paper is qualitative and deductive research methodology. Business success cannot be achieved without people, and it is not possible to plan long-term sustainability of the company if it does not invest in professional employee building. Application of the Open-book management is a challenging project that must be integrated with other modern management models and people governance models.","[Britvic, Josip] Top Consult Grp Ltd, MP Miskine 88, P Sesvete 48363, Croatia; [Grebenar, Vladimir] Vinkoprom Ltd, Zlatana Sremca 47, Vinkovci 32100, Croatia; [Grebenar, Vladimir] Univ Coll Nikola Subic Zrinski, Selska Cesta 119, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Britvic, J (通讯作者)，Top Consult Grp Ltd, MP Miskine 88, P Sesvete 48363, Croatia.",josip.britvic@top-consult-grupa.hr; vladimir.grebenar@gmail.com,"Britvic, Josip/AGO-2173-2022; Britvic, Josip JB/E-4111-2018",,,,,,15,0,0,1,5,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,512,519,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900053,0

Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted among 1,000 inhabitants of Poland aged 15-65. The sample resembled the general population, regarding: age, sex, education and the size of the city of origin. In total, 63 respondents reported buying organic food online. This segment was compared with the rest of the sample with the use of two-tailed t-tests. A logistic regression model was applied to identify the determinants of organic food online shopping in Poland. Findings In a logistic regression model, age, income, willingness to pay (WTP) a premium price for organic food, importance attached to product appearance and to quality signs turned out to be statistically significant determinants of online shopping behaviour for organic food in Poland. Higher income, importance attached to quality signs and higher WTP increase the likelihood of being an organic e-consumer, while higher age and importance attached to product appearance decrease it. Research limitations/implications First, some determinants of organic online shopping have been identified. Second, this study has provided some frameworks to analyse organic food selection motives, barriers to the development of the market, food authenticity assessment criteria, distribution channels, and product characteristics. Practical implications The findings may be useful for the industry due to the identification of the role of quality signs in online food purchases and of the importance of selected organic food consumption motives.

In Catalonia (Spain), political changes towards independentism also occurred within the same period. The purpose of this paper is to explore the consumers' wine preferences in Catalonia in two different scenarios. In particular, the authors have focussed the interest in those preferences regarding the regional origin of the wine. Design/methodology/approach - Data were elicited from two identical discrete choice experiments performed in two times: before (2008) and during the economic crisis (2010) in Catalonia, Spain. Findings - The results imply that the external common circumstances may have had a homogenising influence in consumer choices by decreasing the level of randomness of consumers' selection. Consumers' preferences for a Catalan origin were enhanced during the crisis, while price became the most important attribute. Research limitations/implications - Ideally, the participants involved in both experiments would have been the same. Unfortunately, this was not possible to maintain and it is one of the limitations of this study. The authors are also aware that other non-controlled variables may have also played a role and the conclusions that are driven should be taken carefully. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature of the discrete choice modelling using the recently developed Generalized Multinomial Logit Model.

Findings This study revealed that consumers want more products at the farmers' market that require significant resources and time to grow, such as meat and fruit. Consumers reported that they would be more likely to attend a weekday market if it had better hours of operation and better selection. Consumer comments also revealed that consumers often perceive the market to run out of products and not have the full supply that they want to purchase.

Environmental challenges and resource constraints have led to a demand for new technologies, solutions and products. The EU's Eco-Innovation Observatory defines eco-innovation as any new significantly improved products (goods or services) process, organisational change or marketing solution that reduces the use of natural resources (including materials, energy, water and land) and decreases the release of harmful substances across product's full lifecycle. Argued by European Commission, our economies have developed a linear model based on take-make-consume-dispose pattern of growth. Moving toward a more circular economy that uses a take-make-usetake-make. pattern of growth is essential to deliver the resource efficient economy established under the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Although the need for eco-innovation is widely recognised within EU, eco-innovation performance indicates high variations across EU Member States. European Eco-Innovation Scoreboard groups countries into eco-innovation leaders, average eco-innovation performers and countries catching up in eco-innovation. Countries catching up in eco-innovations are mostly new Member States, without exception of Croatia. In order to evaluate the strength and weaknesses of eco-innovation performance in Croatia in period 2013 - 2016, 16 indicators are interpreted by five sub-indices (eco-innovation inputs, eco-innovation activities, eco-innovation outputs, resource efficiency and socio-economic outcomes) in the Eco-innovation Scoreboard forming aggregated Eco-innovation index. Recycling, as the most prominent and adopted pillar of circular economy is measured by recycling rate. Croatia's environmental and socio-economic modest results indicate that eco-innovation development and transition into a new circular economy model in Croatia is at early stage. Due to a long period of economic recession, a general lack of adequate policies and competences, an inadequate waste management, a lack of regulatory framework and mechanisms for stimulating eco innovation and new technologies, all indicates Croatia's lag in eco-innovation and in its transition towards a green economy.","[Harc, Martina] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Sci Res & Artist Work Osijek, F Kuhaca 29-I, Osijek 3100, Croatia; [Alic, Martina Bris] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",Croatian Academy of Sciences & Arts; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Harc, M (通讯作者)，Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Sci Res & Artist Work Osijek, F Kuhaca 29-I, Osijek 3100, Croatia.",harcm@hazu.hr; mbris@efos.hr,"Bris Alic, Martina/IWL-9109-2023",,,,,,21,1,1,0,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,537,547,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900056,0

Most of the plants are less tolerant of acidic soil (pH <7). Because acidic soil causes solubility of Aluminum (Al), Manganese (Mn), and Iron (Fe). For example, when Al's solubility is high, Al does not only poison the plant but causes the essential element phosphorus (P) in the soil to be fixed (bound) by the Al so that it cannot be absorbed by the plant. This study aims to determine the effect of lime types with grain size on soil properties and growth and production of hybrid corn. This study uses nonfaktorial randomized block design (RBD) which consists of two treatment factors, namely the type of agricultural lime which is divided into 2 treatment levels, namely D-1: Dolomite and D-2: Calcite, each type is divided into 3 sizes namely: D1-1 is passes 60 mesh filter, D(1-2 )is passes 80 mesh filter, D-2-(1) is passes 60 mesh filter, D2-2 is passes 80 mesh filter. Thus, 4 treatments will be repeated 3 times, so that there will be 12 experimental units. Each experimental unit consists of 3 polybags, so that 36 polybags will be obtained. And in each experimental unit there were 2 sample plants. The results showed that lime treatment significantly affected plant height, wet weight of straw, ear length, ear diameter and ear weight per plant, but had no significant effect on the number of leaves, leaf area index, and flowering age.","[Hutauruk, Sixtus; Matanari, Jawaller; Siburian, Iman Firman; Panjaitan, Delima; Tampubolon, Sanggam Dera Rosa; Sihombing, Dewi Restuana; Pandiangan, Maruba] Univ Katolik Santo Thomas, Fac Agr, Medan, Indonesia",,"Siburian, IF (通讯作者)，Univ Katolik Santo Thomas, Fac Agr, Medan, Indonesia.",imanfirman369@gmail.com,"Tampubolon, Sanggam/AIE-2227-2022; Pandiangan, Maruba/GPX-5982-2022","Tampubolon, Sanggam/0000-0002-6062-7839;",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

Therefore, adopting process mining for the field of manufacturing and logistics should take into account the complexity and dynamics as well as the heterogeneous data sources and the quality of event data. Therefore, the objective of this work is to study the application of process mining in the manufacturing and logistics domain with real data from manufacturing companies. We propose a methodology to improve the limitations of process mining by using a Markov chain as a sequence clustering technique in the data preprocessing step and apply heuristic mining to extract the business process models.

However, individually speaking, visitations greatly depend on the category, resource attractiveness, additional offer and other authentic features of the protected area. In Croatia, an additional aggravating circumstance of certain protected areas from the aspect of international interest in visiting is the lack of recognition of the value of a particular category of protection. The consequence of that is incompatibility of such categories with the categories of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Regional Park is one of the protected areas that, as such, has not categorized by the IUCN, so there is no recognisability, neither value as globally known and uniquely categorized National Parks. The purpose of this paper is to point out the potentials of this protected area, which can be valorised and exploited for tourism purposes by strengthening the recognisability of Regional Parks on the wider international market. The goal of the paper is to investigate and identify the main activities of the regional tourist boards and public institutions operating in the area of the Mura-Drava Regional Park in the direction of promotion and strengthening of the international recognition of the protected area. The theoretical part of the paper will provide an overview of current research in the field of ecotourism in protected areas, with a focus on the development potential and recognisability of protected areas by using standard scientific methods (method of analysis and synthesis, historical and descriptive method etc.). In the empirical part of the paper will be presented the results of the primary research conducted on a suitable sample of the regional tourist boards directors and the directors of regional Public institutions of protected areas operating in the area of the Mura-Drava Regional Park. Accordingly, the research will be conducted in the area of the five counties in Continental Croatia on which the Regional Park spreads. With the primary purpose of obtaining relevant data, the interview method will be used for the purposes of this paper. The findings will enable the definition of the main guidelines for improving the marketing activities of the Regional Park Mura-Drava as a destination, with the emphasis on strengthening the international recognition and image creation of Regional parks.","[Jakovic, Bozidar; Golub, Barbara] Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, M Gupca 78, Virovitica, Croatia",,"Jakovic, B (通讯作者)，Coll Tourism & IT Management Virovitica, M Gupca 78, Virovitica, Croatia.",bozidar.jakovic@vsmti.hr; barbara.golub@yahoo.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,6,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,548,557,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900057,0

For the area of road cargo transportation, this contribution is discussing the use of geospatial data in truck routing especially in the context of autonomous driving and social sustainability concepts. Fleet management and cruise control systems have been established during the last decade in road transportation. However, the stationary vehicle routing before the actual travelled tour is subject only to planning and optimization based on a quite low level of information. For example, geospatial data regarding topography as well as speed limitations and trajectory as well as street elevation and bend characteristics are currently not used but have significant impact on truck speed, fuel consumption and driver workload. Therefore, a conceptual outline as well as a quantitative test simulation for applying geospatial big data in ex ante vehicle routing is provided. This does encompass obvious advantages in economic (reduced transport cost), environmental (reduced transport emissions) as well as social dimensions (reduced driver workload and working time). Further inquiries shall address detailed question as to how geospatial big data could be integrated into the daily routine and processes of vehicle routing in road transportation.","[Klumpp, Matthias] FOM Univ Appl Sci, Inst Logist & Serv Management, Leimkugelstr 6, D-45141 Essen, Germany",,"Klumpp, M (通讯作者)，FOM Univ Appl Sci, Inst Logist & Serv Management, Leimkugelstr 6, D-45141 Essen, Germany.",matthias.klumpp@fom.de,"Klumpp, Matthias/AAF-4579-2019; Klumpp, Matthias/H-6890-2017","Klumpp, Matthias/0000-0002-7543-2751; Klumpp, Matthias/0000-0002-7543-2751",,,,,43,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-8917,,978-3-319-74225-0; 978-3-319-74224-3,LECT NOTES LOGISTICS,,,2018,,,,,,,368,377,,10.1007/978-3-319-74225-0_50,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BL3JG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449752500050,0

There are many forms of business combinations and relations whose implementation requires further analysis and various approaches in scientific and professional papers. Different forms of acquisitions, as one of particularly important business combinations, contribute to better business and financial performance of companies, and take place in all areas of activities, as well as security services. Having in mind the aforementioned reasons, the aim of this paper is to analyse, not only acquisitions, but also financial performance of a newly founded security services company, based on an example of the acquisition of several Croatian security services companies by Securitas AB Sweden, the biggest security services group in the world. After the acquisition, the companies have been merged into a new firm called Securitas Hrvatska d.o.o. Among the analysed target companies that were the subject of this acquisition, was also Security Buzov Ltd. from Eastern Croatia, a business leader in security services in the region, as well as in Croatia. Various quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Both scientific and technical literature and financial reports were analysed. Data synthesis has emphasized the efficiency of the acquisition and analysed financial performance of the new company. By comparing statistical and financial reports, conclusions on the effects of acquisition and the performance of the new company were reached. The results show that the new company has improved its business performance, especially when it comes to profitability, liquidity, indebtedness and business efficiency. Since the main goal of the company is to retain a strong position in security services industry and to continue to provide services to its global clients, it is expected that the company will be resilient and financially successful.","[Kovacevic, M.

Design/methodology/approach US internet panelists were asked about their preferences for purchasing non-GM produce, non-GM cereal, and organic products even if they cost a little more. They were also asked if genetically engineered foods are safe to consume. Responses to these four questions were dependent variables in binary logistic regressions. The sample size was 725 adults. Findings Attitudes toward non-GM produce and non-GM cereal were linked with different variables. Green attitudes were positively linked with non-GM and organic food attitudes. Impulsive purchases, a religiosity factor, and a privacy concern factor were linked with non-GM but not organic food attitudes. Social desirability bias was also significant. The genetically engineered food model identified some unique linkages with the control variables, suggesting that these terms may not improve consumer confidence with food. Originality/value New measures and several variables that researchers independently found to be significant were tested together in models and found to be linked with organic and non-GM food attitudes. Some expected relationships were not found. The results provide better profiles of consumers who have strong attitudes toward GM and organic foods.","[Larson, Ronald B.] Midamer Consultants Int, Fargo, ND 58102 USA",,"Larson, RB (通讯作者)，Midamer Consultants Int, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.",ron.larson@live.com,"Larson, Ronald B/A-5411-2008","Larson, Ronald B/0000-0001-9313-9236",,,,,98,27,29,8,80,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

It aims to document food insecurity prevalence, risk factors for and consequences of food insecurity and food insecurity coping strategies among students. Design/methodology/approach English articles published between January 2000 and November 2017 were identified using electronic databases. Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies assessed the study quality of quantitative research. Findings A total of 37 quantitative, three mixed-methods and three qualitative studies were included from 80,914 students from the USA (n=30 studies), Australia (n=4), Canada (n=8) and Poland (n=1). Prevalence estimates of food insecurity were 9-89 percent. All quantitative studies were rated weak based on the quality assessment. Risk factors for food insecurity included being low income, living away from home or being an ethnic minority. Negative consequences of food insecurity were reported, including reduced academic performance and poor diet quality. Strategies to mitigate food insecurity were numerous, including accessing food charities, buying cheaper food and borrowing resources from friends or relatives. Research limitations/implications Given the heterogeneity across studies, a precise estimate of the prevalence of food insecurity in postsecondary students is unknown. Practical implications For many students studying in wealthy countries, obtaining a postsecondary education might mean enduring years of food insecurity and consequently, suffering a range of negative academic, nutritional and health outcomes. There is a need to quantify the magnitude of food insecurity in postsecondary students, to inform the development, implementation and evaluation of strategies to reduce the impact of food insecurity on campus.

So, a contemporary context of the development of this part of Croatia requires substantial investments and implementation of decentralizing and other measures. A trend that is especially worrisome, along already-mentioned low economic development level, is associated with extreme depopulation which is caused by long-term negative population growth values and amplified by current emigration processes of mechanical population migration. Taking into account the need to create economic policies targeted to stop negative trends concerning loss of population as well as those aimed to improve economic indicators of municipalities in Eastern Croatia, the goal of this paper is to analyse current situation in five counties in Eastern Croatia which have been falling behind the others economically. It will also include a review of current migration and depopulation values. After reviewing several indicators some suggestions could be provided.

Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional data were collected in 2015 using a survey including a choice experiment (CE) (n=500). Generalized mixed logit models were estimated. Findings Vietnamese consumers are willing to pay a premium of 82 percent for organic rice, and 45 percent for rice produced using IPM, compared to conventionally produced rice. They are also willing to pay a premium of 95 percent for rice claiming to be rich in vitamins and other nutrients, and 50 percent for rice that guarantees a fair price to rice farmers. Research limitations/implications A hypothetical CE was employed. Future research using revealed preference methods is suggested. Originality/value This study makes a significant contribution to the limited existing literature on consumers' valuation of quality rice attributes in the context of developing countries such as Vietnam. The study shows that rice, that is, sustainably produced using organic or IPM methods provides a promising avenue for rice producers. This study highlights that there is an added value for rice with credence attributes in relation to sustainable production methods, health benefits, and fair farmer prices in a developing country.","[My, Nguyen H.

Insecticide commonly used by farmers in this area was of organochloric active ingredient, namely Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane (DDT).The DDT was an insecticide that was degraded very difficultly by the soil, was toxic and persistent in the soil for decades. This insecticide caused changes in soil microbiology, including fungi. Soil sampling using a soil drill at a depth of 0-20 cm with a diagonal sampling method of 45 sample points. Subsequently the soil samples were taken to the Pesticide Laboratory at the North Sumatra Plantation Seed Germination Center for extraction using the Quechers Tube Method using three material variables, namely sodium acetate (Na-acetate), primary secondary amine (PSA) and octadecylsilane (C18) with Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that DDT derivatives were found in B o'p'DDD soil at the amount of 1.6 mu gKg-1, and at C o'p'DDD soil at 2.2 mu gKg-1. The DDT residues in both locations B and C were classified as dangerous because they exceeded the DDT standard of 0.7 mu gKg-1 dry soil which refered to the Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines (CCME). Soil samples containing five grams of DDT residue were then isolated and fungi growing on the soil were identified.

More and more respondents agree with the statements such as my job is secure, my income is high, and my opportunities for advancement are high. The labour statistics and multiple linear regression analysis support the hypothesis that higher incomes and more opportunities for advancement would increase the overall job satisfaction. Although younger cohorts and those with higher education have higher employment rates and more prospects for career advancement, the analysis shows that these groups are not more satisfied with their jobs than employees in other groups. Other factors such as interesting work, stress, relationships with management and pride in one's job are better predictors of the overall job satisfaction.","[Niklass, Mareks] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Niklass, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",mareks.niklass@lu.lv,,,National Research Programme Innovation and Sustainable Development: Latvia's Post-Crisis Experience in a Global Context (SUSTINNO),National Research Programme Innovation and Sustainable Development: Latvia's Post-Crisis Experience in a Global Context (SUSTINNO),This research is supported by National Research Programme Innovation and Sustainable Development: Latvia's Post-Crisis Experience in a Global Context (SUSTINNO),,16,0,0,1,7,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,363,371,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.155,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500043,0

Higher education institutions play important role in this area as well as in the development of human capital in the region. We firstly compared NUTS 2 regions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and according to selected indicators of research and development. We also applied cluster analysis in order to classify similar regions into same clusters. The main aim of our research is to test potential link between intensity of research and development within the concept of smart specialisation of the region and labour productivity in the region. We used factor analysis and regression analysis based on the data cross-sectional data for all NUTS 2 regions in the EU.

Aim of research was to find out what young people from the more developed western part of Croatia are thinking at the possibility of developing applications or internet shop for family farms. Agriculture, as one of the comparative branches that can help improve economic situation of Eastern Croatia, must turn to new promotion channels to survive. It is almost impossible for small family farms to do business online. To reach the final consumer, each manufacturer must be visible, because as the saying goes if you're not online you don't exist. Development of internet, smartphones and apps enables relatively inexpensive advertising. One of the options is to develop an application that would geographically display small family farms and their products to make it easier for customers to reach them. Another option is an online store that would allow small family farms and households to offer their products on internet market. According to the data published on Ministry of Agriculture website on 29.january.2018 number of agricultural businesses is 164,628.Of these 159.349 or 96.79% are family farms. The development and implementation of these solutions can be achieved by mutual forces of farmers, but also with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development. A survey was conducted on a sample of 150 students who showed their point of view on purchasing a homemade product via Online Store, or use of an application in which it is possible to see where the family farm is located and what can be purchased there. Such a way of doing business would enable the direct link between producers and consumers and help economic development of eastern Croatia, youth employment and the reduction of the emigration of young people.","[Resetar, Nikolina Pavicic; Resetar, Zlatko] Veleuciliste Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia; [Tolusic, Zdravko] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Resetar, NP (通讯作者)，Veleuciliste Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia.",nikolina.pavicic@bak.hr; tolusic@efos.hr; zresetar@bak.hr,,,,,,,3,0,0,1,3,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,160,168,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900016,0

Understanding the socio-economic drivers that aggravate the extraction and overexploitation of forest products is vital for designing effective forest conservation and restoration measures. This particularly holds with regard to the importance of two fundamentally opposing motivations of smallholder forest exploitation, which we label wood extraction for need vs. wood extraction for greed. This study was conducted at Zege peninsula in Northern Ethiopia to investigate the factors affecting the extraction and marketing of wood from the peninsula's primary dry Afromontane forest by smallholders. Data was collected using household survey, focus groups discussions and key informant interviews. Data analysis employed the Heckman two-steps econometric model. The predominant involvement of vulnerable households in forest exploitation suggests that wood extraction was driven by need and mainly served sustenance and safety net functions. In addition, we also found evidence of greed-driven forest exploitation. As a consequence of selective rule enforcement and nepotism, the forest enforcement committee was not effective in safeguarding the forest, there by contributing to increased wood extraction and marketing by community members for income generation.

Its establishment in Europe and the Americas resulted in local disease transmission and impacted quality of outdoor recreational activities. Economic implications of its likely invasion into Australia had not been considered. A benefit-cost analysis of an elimination response scenario to an Ae. albopictus incursion in Brisbane was developed with a benefits transfer estimate of the local population's willingness-to-pay for an Ae. albopictus-free environment. Other costed considerations included i) necessary precautionary vector control responses to importations of mosquito-borne diseases (e.g. dengue, Zika) and ii) projected rises in complaints to local government regarding increased mosquito nuisance. Costs of implementing a successful elimination program were estimated between 1 and 4 AU$ per capita, and the annual benefit-cost ratio regarding the value of an unaffected outdoor environment was between 50 and 78. In the event of establishment, annual costs of local government and public health responses were between 0.5 and 1.3 AU$ per capita. The recurrent expense of permanent colonization will be magnified by loss of value associated with an Ae. albopictus-free environment. We conclude it is more cost-beneficial to conduct a thorough elimination program for Ae. albopictus than to allow establishment. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This interpretation has drawn upon relatively limited statistical analysis of mariners' wages, and underestimates the variety of seafarers' remuneration and economic activities besides wages themselves. This article undertakes a more sustained analysis of seventeenth-century wage data drawn from the papers of the English High Court of Admiralty, and uses the same evidence to examine other forms of income, both customary payments as part of shipping, and small-scale trade. Seafarers of all ranks carried their own commodities on all shipping routes, offering an opportunity to increase their income considerably. This evidence confirms that the maritime labour market was hierarchical, and that very often seafarers were poor labourers facing economic insecurity of many kinds. However, it refines the previous interpretation by emphasizing the presence of skilled workers even among the lower levels of this labour market, and by introducing a new dimension to mariners' economic agency: they were not simply wage-workers, but also independent participants in a venture economy.","[Blakemore, Richard J.] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Blakemore, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England.",,,"Blakemore, Richard/0000-0002-0281-6826",European Research Council [284340]; ERC; European Research Council (ERC) [284340] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This article is based on research conducted as part of the project 'Sailing into modernity: comparative perspectives on the sixteenth and seventeenth century European transition', funded by the European Research Council (Starting Grant n. 284340).

This paper informs the debate by exploring which arguments are most effective in garnering support for environmental protection. In a survey-based online experiment, participants stated their level of (dis)approval of a large-scale hydropower dam project after being presented with various kinds of arguments and information about the environmental impacts. The results show that ecosystem service arguments reduced levels of approval of the dam significantly (i.e. they increased support for environmental protection). However, moral-ecological arguments for protecting the environment proved even more effective, while a combination of both types of arguments reduced the dam approval ratings the most. Including a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) with monetary valuation of the costs of losing ecosystem services altered dam approval upwards or downwards, depending on the outcome of the CBA. The approval rates of males, of older participants and of politically rightwing participants were particularly sensitive to the outcomes of monetary valuation. More research is needed to understand the short and long term influence of different environmental discourses on peoples' judgments and levels of environmental concern. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The panel data regression showed that only firm size (measured by energy distributed) and previous year's income were statistically significant for explaining differences in technical efficiency. When companies invest part of their income, they are using more expensive money than if they are accessing other funding sources. It can therefore be seen that there is a possible margin for the Brazilian Distribution Service Operators DSOs to increase their leverage, which would reduce their cost of capital. This reduction in the cost of capital would in turn result in lower tariffs for the energy consumer, while maintaining the current calculation methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to previous research comparing school performance with two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA), we control for prior academic achievement of students by using a rich data set from 2008 to 2010. We employ detailed financial data for deriving the envelope for the efficient production frontier of the schools. Using Simar and Wilson's (J Econ 136:31-64, 2007, J Prod Anal 36:205-218, 2011a) double bootstrap procedure for two-stage DEA, the study finds that schools with lower total student numbers, a higher average of years of service of teachers, a higher ratio of special education students that attracts extra government funding, and girls only do better than other schools. On the other hand, a negative influence comes from a school's location in provincial and outer metropolitan areas. An important result is that the socio-economic background of students attending a school has no significant effect on their academic performance, whereas higher prior academic achievements have a positive and statistically significant impact on student achievement. These results are relevant to decision makers for the school sector, in particular for funding criteria contained in the Gonski (Review of funding for schooling - Final report (December).

However, productivity search is constrained by environmental preoccupations, raising the question of agricultural development models to be adopted to increase productivity while limiting environmental consequences. This paper examines the role of market orientation by assessing the effect of agricultural commodity export on greenhouse gas emissions relatively to local market oriented agricultural production model. Using panel data from 1986 to 2010 for 136 countries around the world, and accurate instrumental variables technique, the findings suggest that the proportion of primary commodity export in agricultural production increases greenhouse gas emissions. These results are robust to different sources of agricultural export and environmental data, and to the inclusion of additional control variables. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a review of existing approaches for preserving land, we consider a conceptual model of environmental impact fees (ElFs) coupled with conservation payments for managing private land of ecosystem value. In this framework, conservation payments are intended to cost-effectively target fair market value compensation for heterogeneous land for preservation that sustains ecosystem health. EIFs serve as a financial instrument to augment conservation payments and to allow flexibility for landowners with private information to pursue development opportunities while accounting for environmental impacts. Using a bioeconomic model of nature-reserve design, we develop an empirical illustration of how to estimate the EIF of development damage to critical habitat in southern Rhode Island in an effort to preserve land as an environmental infrastructure that maintains ecosystem health.

J,"Young, MA",,,,"Young, Margaret A.",,,Energy transitions and trade law: lessons from the reform of fisheries subsidies,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Energy transitions; Fisheries subsidies; Fossil fuel subsidies; Fragmentation; Trans-Pacific Partnership; World Trade Organization,FISH,"Fossil fuel subsidies, like subsidies to the fishing sector, lead to trade-distorting and ecologically harmful practices. The US$35 billion in subsidies provided by countries every year to the fishing sector leads to more and more boats being built, even as 90% of fish stocks are either fully exploited or overfished. An estimated US$444 billion in subsidies are provided annually for the production of fossil fuels by G20 countries, even as evidence emerges that oil, gas and coal reserves must remain unexploited to limit global warming increases to 2 A degrees C. Of course, each country has its own development priorities, livelihood concerns and need for food and energy security. Agreeing upon subsidy reform is a complex undertaking that requires the assessment of social, political and historical considerations, as well as the involvement of international and transnational legal regimes that govern climate change, energy, fisheries and trade. This article reviews proposals for reform within the World Trade Organization and regional trade agreements, including the new disciplines on fisheries subsidies that were endorsed in the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although the latter agreement is unlikely to enter into force, consensus is emerging on the need to prohibit subsidies that contribute to overfishing or that are linked to illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. The article shows how these legal developments might inform attempts to limit fossil fuel production and consumption subsidies. It highlights the need for learning and open deliberation about subsidy reform by affected stakeholders, including representatives from international organizations and civil society. It also points to new arrangements that link compliance with subsidy rules to standards and benchmarks from fisheries regimes, and demonstrates how such inter-regime connections are legitimate in the context of the fragmentation of international law. While reform to fisheries subsidies is still preliminary and fraught, there are useful lessons for the equally important project of energy transitions.","[Young, Margaret A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Young, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",m.young@unimelb.edu.au,,"Young, Margaret/0000-0002-3033-5990",Research Foundations-Flanders at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Research Foundations-Flanders at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel,With thanks to participants at the workshop for the Research Network on Fragmentation and Complexity in Global Governance (REFRACT) sponsored by the Research Foundations-Flanders at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel on 26 June 2015 and especially to the workshop organizers Thijs Van de Graaf and Harro van Asselt.

Combining the Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) and the Eora global multi-regional input-output table, we use input-output analysis to calculate a consumer social risk footprint (SF) of nations' imports. For our SFs, we select four indicators related to five of the UN's SDGs: gender equality (SDG 5 also 8.5 & 8.8); mother and child health (SDG 3, especially 3.1 & 3.2); governance (SDG 16, especially 16.5 & 16.6); and access to clean water (SDG 6, especially 6.1 & 62). After examining results for all four indicators we focus on gender equality to fully convey the value and limitations of using this method of analysis. Our study compares producer (domestic) social risk and consumer social risk footprints resulting from international trade patterns. Generally, developed countries show higher social risk footprints while developing countries show higher domestic social risks with the exceptions of UK and Ireland in the developed-world, and China and India in the developing-world. Details of the SFs associated with exported products worldwide reveal that Pakistan, Yemen and Iran have some of the highest SF risk, while Australia, Canada and Denmark are among the lowest. These results are important for the UN in developing partnerships to address the Sustainable Development Goals and for organisations such as the World Bank, Trade Unions and NGOs' work towards a fairer world.

We adapt revealed preference valuation techniques as a combined policy evaluation and business case tool with broader application to urban forest planning and investment. We use spatial hedonic price modelling of 2,299 house sales across 80 sample sites in 52 residential Brisbane suburbs, to reveal home-buyers willingness to pay 3.73% more for houses in streets with target levels of footpath tree cover (50% tree canopy coverage of the footpath zone by 2031) nearby (within 100m). An estimate of the contribution of 2010 levels of footpath tree cover (35%) to the prices of houses sold in 2010 ($US15.03 -15.91 million) far exceeded annual costs to those home owners in local property taxes. Associated annual rates revenues ($US0.51 - 0.53 million) to local government and stamp duty revenues ($US0.53 - 0.60 million) to state government help justify ongoing collaborative investment to achieve target levels of footpath tree cover.

The analysis has established that by the end of the 18th century, the settlements covered by the analysis were of a rural character, that traditional forms of economic activities and the way of life prevailed in them, that they were marked by a complex ethnic and religious population structure; it also examines whether, to what extent, and in which areas the ideas of the Enlightenment had yielded success.","[Bogovic, Dubravka Bozic] Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia",,"Bogovic, DB (通讯作者)，Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Lorenza Jagera 9, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",dbozic@ffos.hr,"Božić Bogović, Dubravka/JMR-0151-2023","Božić Bogović, Dubravka/0000-0001-6979-3908",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,45,52,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500002,0

Design/methodology/approach - Using the data gathered from the 17 food groups within the POFs and multidimensional scaling, the Brazilian states were divided into groups and analysed according to their similarities in terms of annual per capita household food acquisition. Findings - The study's results point to five groups with similarities in terms of food acquisition among the Brazilian states. Additionally, the issues that reflect Brazil's diversity were discussed, highlighting possible factors that caused the movement of some states between groups during the analysis period. The heterogeneity observed in food acquisition in Brazil emphasises Brazilian agribusiness development and underscores the influence of the food supply chains on the regional food patterns. Originality/value - This research presents the geographic changes in the Brazilian agribusiness, and how these changes are reflected in the population food patterns and in the heterogeneity in food acquisition among the Brazilian states. Concerning this work, supply chains of agri-industrial products focussed on the domestic market can be analysed in depth, offering guidelines for future research in logistics and agri-industrial economy.","[de Vargas Mores, Giana; Talamini, Edson; Dewes, Homero] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Studies & Res Agribusiness, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Mores, GD (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Studies & Res Agribusiness, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",gimores@gmail.com,"Talamini, Edson/B-5523-2009; Mores, Giana de Vargas/K-8165-2015; Dewes, Homero/I-6202-2013","Talamini, Edson/0000-0003-2349-0447; Mores, Giana de Vargas/0000-0003-3733-2220;",,,,,60,4,4,1,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, they lack the scientific knowledge to analyse the overall production system holistically. The general objective of this research is the analysis of the biophysical input-output relations and the technical sustainability, including environmental impacts, of the potato production systems, using multi-target methodologies and system modelling. The data consist of full input-output accountancy of potato cropping systems in seven rural communities of the Mantaro Valley. Between 2005 and 2011, a total of 42 potato plots were monitored. Life-cycle assessment and data envelopment analysis (DEA) were used to estimate environmental impacts and relative technical efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, potential production was calculated with the SUBSTOR-Potato model based on local climate conditions. The potato growth and development model estimated that potential tuber dry weight (DW) production ranged from 6.11 to 16.74 t ha(-1), while the measured production varied from 1.34 to 12.18 t ha(-1). The most important energetic use was allocated to material input (10,835-32,314 MJ ha(-1)). Energetic conversion fluctuated from 3.74 to 7.19 and specific energy from 0.57 to 1.12 MJ t(-1). DEA calculated a total of 64.3% inefficient potato cropping systems. Main factors affecting potato production were: inadequate fertilization schemes, inefficient investment and allocation of labour, low production volumes and relevant environmental impacts. The latter amounted to (t(-1) FW yield): 150 global warming potential (kg CO2-eq), 5.23 acidification potential (kg SO2-eq), 6.11 eutrophication potential (kg PO4-eq), 0.05 land use (ha) and 610 cumulative energy demand (MJ-eq) on average. This methodology has proven to be efficient in evaluating the technical sustainability of different potato systems, considering achievable potential production and minimal environmental impacts under local conditions.","[Grados, D.] Univ Nacl Agr La Molina, Av La Molina S-N La Molina, Lima, Peru; [Heuts, R.; Vetters, E.; Schrevens, E.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Biosci Engn, Celestijnenlaan 200E, Leuven, Belgium",University Nacional Agraria La Molina; KU Leuven,"Grados, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Agr La Molina, Av La Molina S-N La Molina, Lima, Peru.",dgrados@lamolina.edu.pe,"Grados, Diego/GYR-1584-2022","Grados, Diego/0000-0001-5548-3204",,,,,19,1,1,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-50-4,ACTA HORTIC,,,2017,1154.0,,,,,,155,162,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1154.20,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Engineering; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BK1IS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431840500020,0

Evidence of the adverse relationship between land inequality and the accumulation of human capital has thus far only been presented by using data from Western countries and from countries that achieved industrialization not under colonial occupation but by their own economic interest. The presented findings thus contribute to the body of knowledge on this topic and confirm the generalizability of the Galor model by analyzing the unique Korean context under Japanese rule in the early twentieth century. It is the first study to present evidence that inequality in landownership had an adverse effect on the level of public education in the Korean colonial period (i.e., it is a non-financial hurdle for human capital accumulation). By using a fixed effects model and a fixed effects two-stage least squares model with an instrumental variable estimation, this study exploits variation in inequality in land concentration across regions in Korea, accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity across these regions. Overall, this analysis establishes a highly significant adverse effect of land inequality on education in the Korean colonial period.","[Jun, Bogang] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany; [Kim, Tai-Yoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Program, Bldg 37, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Kim, Tai-Yoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Econ Program, Bldg 37, Seoul 151746, South Korea; [Kim, Tai-Yoo] Seoul Natl Univ, Policy Program, Bldg 37, Seoul 151746, South Korea",University Hohenheim; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Jun, BG (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Econ, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",bogang33@gmail.com; tykim@snu.ac.kr,"Jun, Bogang/AAW-6029-2020","Jun, Bogang/0000-0003-4994-702X",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MEST) [2010-0026178],"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MEST)(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government)","We are grateful to Oded Galor for his valuable comments.

Foreign language skills, which enhance the ability to communicate with people from around the world, have become valuable due to the requirements of the multicultural and multilingual labor market. Foreign languages are taught at higher education institutions (HEI) in Croatia, as twenty-first century graduates are expected to have acquired the skill of at least one foreign language. The aim of this research is to develop an understanding of foreign language skills, which are needed in general, but also considered and valued as an advantage for employment in Eastern Croatia. In the research conducted in April 2015, a questionnaire (for three subgroups-employers, students and HE educators from Eastern Croatia) was used to evaluate the perception of the importance of foreign language skills. Although the research demonstrates that foreign language skills are regarded as a highly-valued skill mainly due to the fact that businesses in Eastern Croatia compete in international markets and are export oriented, a disparity is noticed as students gave foreign language skills a slightly higher importance for employability than educators and employers. Knowing how to communicate in a foreign language makes graduates competitive and contributes to a more successful career. Both the academic and business sector might benefit from the results about the necessity of foreign language skills gained in this research. While our world is changing rapidly, the only thing that remains is the language which is the instrument for the future. The need for foreign language skills is higher than ever, and the skill itself should therefore be cared for.","[Konig, Ljerka Sedlan; Hocenski-Dreiseidl, Mirna; Hocenski, Mia] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"König, LS (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia.",ljerka@efos.hr; mirna@efos.hr; mhocenski@efos.hr,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,423,432,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500040,0

The challenge for the industry is to claim real production characteristics while being in line with consumers' expectations. Looking at the example of marketing pasture-raised milk year-round and the fact that cows only have access to pasture in summer, the purpose of this paper is to analyse consumer expectations, the potential of deception and the acceptance of more credible marketing strategies. Design/methodology/approach - An online access panel was used for data collection. The data include 310 German milk buyers, who were grouped using cluster analysis to examine the different target groups for the year-round and seasonal marketing of pasture-raised milk. Findings - The study distinguished two different consumer groups: one with lower expectations accepting year-round marketing (32.5 per cent) and the other with higher demands, who feel deceived by year-round marketing (46.7 per cent). Furthermore, one part of the last group is also sceptical towards the more precise seasonal marketing due to their general scepticism towards ag-related marketing claims. Practical implications - To generate consumer trust in ag-related marketing claims, it is beneficial to meet consumers' expectations. Producers have to decide if they orient their products to more modest or more critical consumer segments. While it is easier to implement lower standards, there is the risk to disappoint (and thereby lose) the most interesting target group of highly involved consumers characterised by some general doubts regarding food marketing claims. Originality/value - The study is the first to demonstrate the existence of two consumer segments that differ in their expectations towards and acceptance of ag-related marketing claims for food products.","[Kuehl, Sarah; Schlueterbusch, Lea; Spiller, Achim] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Kühl, S (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",skuehl@gwdg.de,"Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,54,4,5,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Innovations create resources. Innovations lead to the creation of new resources that did not exist until then (or existed, but had no use value), or give new possibilities for using the existing resources. Innovations enable constant raising of the technological level of products, processes, equipment and materials. Innovation is vital for achieving a competitive advantage. Innovation is an important element of the new economy, i. e. the knowledge economy. Innovative management equals entrepreneurship. Therefore, innovation should not be considered as a separate event, but a process. The very concept of innovation has been a household name for a long time. During the last years the use of its semantic meaning in different areas and contents of economic life has been significantly expanded. The management of innovation processes focuses mainly on creativity and enhancement of existing products, services and processes. The aim of the research is to demonstrate the fundamental advantages of using innovation and technology in the context of innovation management in order to achieve competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the improvement of production processes as well as guest satisfaction through the use of innovative management methods. The paper uses adequate scientific and professional methodology to analyze innovation developments affecting the improvement of business processes of a company. Both domestic and international bibliographic materials were used in preparing the paper. Also used were scientific methods mostly of classification and description, as well as induction and deduction and concretisation. The growing competitive environment suggests that the challenges facing the management system will be different in the future. Managers will have to create an environment to execute complex strategies. Intensive implementation of information technology in the business system will allow management companies a relatively more effective implementation of strategies and the convergence to objectives. By putting the guest, i. e. the relationship with the guest, at the strategic center, new innovative forms of management functions and concepts are being sophisticated, which will enhance this approach and try to keep the guest for life, with constant delight with their products or services.","[Mikinac, Kresimir] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Primorska 42, Opatija 51410, Croatia; [Corluka, Goran] Univ Split, Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Split,"Mikinac, K (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Primorska 42, Opatija 51410, Croatia.",kmikinac@fthm.hr; gcorluka@oss.unist.hr,"Mikinac, Krešimir/AAA-4275-2021; Mikinac, Krešimir/JCN-9186-2023; Mikinac, Kresimir/AAU-7690-2020","Mikinac, Kresimir/0000-0001-6787-4982",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,219,229,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500020,0

In order for the European union (hereinafter: EU) to function properly as a common single market it does not suffice to remove obstacles for trade such as of high taxes, costs of production, delivery or other economic barriers. Namely, different standards of procedural protection and availability of access to justice in national and cross-border disputes in the field of consumer protection diminish the trust of consumers in the single market and create barriers for trade. Hence, efforts have been made in order to create instruments in the field of consumer law which would ensure essential rights to consumers across 28 Member States (hereinafter: MS). In order to accomplish the set goal, alongside the standards which provide for protection of essential rights of consumers in the MS, redress and enforcement mechanisms which safeguard them should be available. In the research of the impact of EU consumer law in removing difficulties and obstacles for obtaining procedural protection of individual as well as collective interests and rights of consumers in case of law infringements by traders critical analysis and synthesis as well as a comparative method will be used. Inductive approach will be used in the analysis in order to draw upon the experience of implementation and/or direct application of EU consumer law in Croatian legal system.

This is the result of different roles of men and women in the society due to the fact that women are still disproportionately burdened with unpaid work which makes it difficult for them to balance paid and unpaid work. Due to the fact that the problem of gender inequality has a number of negative economic effects, it is often placed in the focus of macroeconomic policies, among which the fiscal policy, due to its allocation and redistribution effect, particularly the budget as its most important instrument, which should be used for achieving the objective of gender equality. Therefore, the authors point out the importance of implementing gender-sensitive budgeting which, by taking into account the differences between men and women in the budget decision-making process, contributes to greater gender equality. A gender-sensitive budget is used for financing measures designed to facilitate the reconciliation of women's family and professional life, which allows more intensive involvement of women in the labour market. One of these measures is childcare. In the Republic of Croatia childcare is in direct jurisdiction of local governments; thus, public spending on childcare can be a good indicator of gender sensitivity of local budgets. The level of satisfaction of needs, and the absolute and relative level of public spending on childcare in the towns and municipalities of the Slavonian region are analysed in the paper in order to determine gender sensitivity of local budgets in the region of Slavonia.","[Sikiric, Ana Marija; Vasicek, Davor; Drezgic, Sasa] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Sikiric, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ana.marija.sikiric@efri.hr; davor.vasicek@efri.hr; sasa.drezgic@efri.hr,"Drezgic, Sasa/GVR-7966-2022; Drezgic, Sasa/S-4114-2018; Sikiric Simcic, Ana Marija/S-6043-2018; Vasicek, Davor/S-8372-2018","Drezgic, Sasa/0000-0002-7712-8112; Sikiric Simcic, Ana Marija/0000-0002-8408-586X; Vasicek, Davor/0000-0001-9493-264X",,,,,19,0,0,1,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,755,764,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500073,0

Design/methodology/approach - The data refer to Asian subsidiaries of Japanese companies engaged in food production activities. The data set covers 545 overseas subsidiaries from 2003 to 2014, and the total number of observations is 3,513. A linear probability model examines the factors influencing the probability of a subsidiary withdrawing. Findings - The results show that strong relationships between parent companies and overseas subsidiaries, specifically in terms of personnel and capital, reduce the likelihood of withdrawal. The number of years in business has a positive effect on withdrawal. Additionally, investment aims, such as the establishment of an international production network and acquisition of host country markets, affect the probability of withdrawal. The results are similar for subsidiaries in China and other countries, but there are differences regarding subsidiaries' histories and investment aims. Originality/value - There is limited research on food companies withdrawing from overseas markets. This study bridges the gap in the literature by compiling micro-level data and conducting a quantitative analysis of such withdrawals from overseas markets.

We investigated the factors influencing species availability within the Australian cagebird trade. We predicted that species price should be an informative indicator of the species abundance in the trade, and that physical attributes, origin of the species, and limitations for free trade and for captive breeding should be important drivers for species price. We investigated the quantitative relationship between species price and these factors using phylogenetically informed models. 357 species were present in the Australian cagebird trade, and 55.2% were alien. We found a strong negative relationship between species price and abundance. We identified that smaller-bodied, drabber species were cheaper than larger, more colourful species, and that native birds, species that were mostly exempt from regulations to their keeping and trading, and species easier to keep in captivity, tended to be cheaper. Assuming that the more widely held a species the greater the likelihood that is to be released, we propose that price can be used as a proxy for abundance when screening the species that have a higher risk of being deliberately or accidentally introduced.

In this paper, 18 Railway Bureau are chosen as the research object, and we select 2005-2014 year panel data, using DEA nonparametric method for empirical analysis. The main research conclusions are as follows: (1) from the space dimension, the technical efficiency distributes uneven in spatial regions, and the railway efficiency in western area is obviously lower than the Middle East efficiency value, the main reason is the western region is with low traffic density and relatively high investment strength; (2) the main technical inefficiency of railway enterprises is due to the low pure technical efficiency, which is closely related with the 10 years of railway over investment and construction; (3) from the time dimension, the technical efficiency of all railway transport enterprises is gradually improvement and the main thanks to the passenger and cargo transportation and a series of reform initiatives in railway industry. In addition, the robustness test is carried out. The results show that the efficiency values of each enterprise are approximately the same, that is, these results are accepted by robustness tests, proving the stability and reliability. In the 13th Five-Year plan, our country should reduce the construction of high-speed railway; the existing railway industry should further improve the railway competition, improving competitive advantage.","[Yu, Kemei] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University,"Yu, KM (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",498372480@qq.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-0995-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ6EQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426596000102,0

In this study, we estimate consumer preferences for fresh strawberries with various sustainable claims: two based on production techniques (reduced pesticides and less fertilizer use) and three based on outcomes associated with ecosystem services (reduced negative impacts on air, soil, or water). While consumers are willing to pay more for fresh strawberries produced with sustainable practices, the premiums differ by the production method. Consumers are willing to pay the highest price premium for fresh strawberries produced with reduced pesticide use, followed by those produced with reduced impacts on water quality. Demographic variables (such as income), purchase habits (such as price normally paid for strawberries), and perception variables (such as importance rating of strawberry attributes) are significant factors affecting consumer preference for strawberries produced using environmentally friendly techniques. Consumers who have a better knowledge of GMO fresh strawberries in the market are willing to pay significantly less for all types of eco-labeled fresh strawberries.","[Chen, Xuqi; Gao, Zhifeng; House, Lisa] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Swisher, Marilyn] Univ Florida, Dept Family Youth & Community Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Zhao, Xin] Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Gao, ZF (通讯作者)，POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",xqchen@ufl.edu; zfgao@ufl.edu,"Chen, Xuqi/AAC-4204-2022; Gao, Zhifeng/AFD-7759-2022; House, Lisa/V-5724-2017","Chen, Xuqi/0000-0001-7668-9367; Gao, Zhifeng/0000-0003-2984-8278; House, Lisa/0000-0002-1901-6550","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project [FLA-FRE-005292]","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch project","The authors thank the valuable comments from two anonymous reviewers as well as those from the editor.

EET is defined as the ideas concerning the interlinkages between ecology and economics and described through the analysis of the flows and stocks of energy and matter, including their economic implications for the processes of social provisioning and cultural development. The diversity of EET is analyzed in terms of dissimilar positions mainly concerning energy as a determinant of cultural development and the normative aspects involving resource distribution, social ideals and policy-making. Social energetics is identified as a foundation of EET. These definitions are then used to argue for the formation of a scientific metaparadigm, falling short of a full-scale Kuhnian scientific paradigm. In addition, insights are drawn concerning paradigm formation in modem ecological economics and how this paradigm formation is related to the on-going debate among ecological economists on the benefits and limits of the adoption of a broad methodological pluralism.","[Franco, Marco P.

Specifically, we investigate potential transition barriers within three case studies. First, unemployment represents the most commonly cited reason why economic growth is considered indispensable. Second, alternative indicators to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) have not succeeded in replacing GDP as a standard metric of economic welfare. Third, pension schemes rely on economic growth to offset demographic change. In each of these three examples, we identify actor-interest constellations that foster the status quo of a growth economy. We conclude that compensating some of those actors who would presumably be worse off in a post-growth economy may be necessary - though not sufficient - for a transition.","[Strunz, Sebastian; Schindler, Harry] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ),"Strunz, S (通讯作者)，UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Permoser Str 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",Sebastian.strunz@ufz.de,"Strunz, Sebastian/N-3555-2015","Schindler, Harry/0000-0002-8890-6418",,,,,107,15,16,2,42,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The key advantage of LCA is its higher product resolution but it relies on global or regional averages, which could bias results. Our outcomes suggest that this obstacle could be avoided for primary goods if domestic process data are collected, since the necessary raw materials are mostly extracted from the environment of the direct trade partner. Conversely, for many other products, intermediate inputs are produced following a wide range of blueprints and cross multiple borders, which makes it challenging to determine how and where raw materials needed for their production originate. For these products, a method to combine the superior coverage of MRIO with the product resolution of LCA is evaluated here, using imports to Finland as a study case. The analysis provides insights on how to identify critical supply chains and illustrates a relatively simple, replicable solution that can be used in other regions or environmental accounts. Nevertheless, the existing resolution of MRIO models and dissimilarities in classifications between the two tools could constitute a new source of errors if not properly handled.","[Pinero, Pablo; Pongracz, Eva] Univ Oulu, Fac Technol, Energy & Environm Engn, POB 4300, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Cazcarro, Ignacio; Arto, Inaki] Univ Basque Country, BC3, Sede Bldg 1,1st Floor,Sci Campus, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Cazcarro, Ignacio] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Agrifood Inst Aragon IA2, ARAID Aragonese Agcy Res & Dev Researcher, Zaragoza, Spain; [Maenpaa, Ilmo; Juutinen, Artti] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ, POB 4600, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland; [Maenpaa, Ilmo] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, POB 140, FI-00251 Helsinki, Finland; [Juutinen, Artti] Nat Resources Inst Finland, POB 413, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland",University of Oulu; University of Basque Country; University of Zaragoza; University of Oulu; Finnish Environment Institute; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke),"Piñero, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Fac Technol, Energy & Environm Engn, POB 4300, FI-90014 Oulu, Finland.",Pablo.Pinero@oulu.fi,"Piñero, Pablo/AAA-8711-2020; C, Ignacio Cazcarro/AFA-1858-2022; Pongrácz, Eva/L-2054-2013","C, Ignacio Cazcarro/0000-0001-7517-0053; Arto, Inaki/0000-0001-6427-7437",University of Oulu Graduate School; AURORA Doctoral Programme,University of Oulu Graduate School; AURORA Doctoral Programme,We are grateful to the anonymous reviewer for helpful comments.

However, the dominant mechanism used by online microfinance platforms, in which intermediaries administer loans, has profound implications for borrowers. Using an analytical model of microlending with intermediaries who disburse and service loans, we demonstrate that profit-maximizing intermediaries have an incentive to increase interest rates because much of the default risk is transferred to lenders. Borrower and lender interest rate elasticities can serve as disciplining mechanisms to mitigate this interest rate increase. Using data from Kiva.org, we find that interest rates do not affect lender decisions, which removes one of these disciplining mechanisms. Interest rates are high, around 38% on Kiva. In contrast, on an alternative microfinance platform that does not use intermediaries, Zidisha, interest rates are only around 10%, highlighting the dramatic impact of intermediaries on interest rates. We propose an alternative loan payback mechanism that still allows microfinance platforms to use intermediaries, while removing the incentive to increase interest rates due to the transfer of risk to lenders.","[Bollinger, Bryan] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Mkt, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Yao, Song] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Mkt, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Duke University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Bollinger, B (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Mkt, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",bryan.bollinger@duke.edu; syao@umn.edu,"Yao, Song/JJC-2914-2023; Bollinger, Bryan/ABH-5961-2020","Yao, Song/0000-0002-0339-9649; Bollinger, Bryan/0000-0001-8596-6418",,,,,37,11,11,2,67,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

While formal developers build houses renting land from landowners, informal developers use land for free. However, informal developers must incur defensive expenditures to avoid government intervention. In equilibrium, at any distance of the central business district (CBD), informal developers use land until the value of the marginal productivity of land equals the defensive expenditures per unit of land. The model shows the land allocated to produce short informal (tall formal) buildings increases (decreases) with distance to the CBD. Thus, the model introduces a new source of spatial variation of building height. The model also shows that a higher level of informal housing increases the spatial size of a city and reduces the height of its buildings.","[Posada, Hector M.] Univ Antioquia, Fac Ciencias Econ, Calle 67 53-108,Bloque 13, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad de Antioquia,"Posada, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Antioquia, Fac Ciencias Econ, Calle 67 53-108,Bloque 13, Medellin, Colombia.",hector.posada@udea.edu.co,,"Posada, Hector M./0000-0002-9600-561X","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Universidad de Antioquia; Conalpe","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Universidad de Antioquia; Conalpe","Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion; Universidad de Antioquia; Conalpe.",,21,2,3,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

Reducing emissions will necessitate the transition from relatively high EROI dispatchable fossil fuels to a combination of relatively low EROI intermittent renewables and geographically limited non-intermittent renewables. As renewable capacity requires energy to construct there is an initial fossil fuel cost to creating new renewable capacity. An insufficiently rapid transition to renewables will imply a scenario in which it is impossible to avoid either transgressing emissions ceilings or facing energy shortages; we term this the energy-emissions trap. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model, termed EETRAP, that builds the EROI metric and the energy characteristics of renewable generation into a macroeconomic framework. EETRAP is used for simulation analysis to test how differing assumptions about the EROI of intermittent renewables will affect the time-path of renewable investment necessary to escape the energyemissions trap. For all runs of the model, the renewable investment rate by 2050 is significantly larger than the current energy investment rate. For declining intermittent renewable EROI, the renewable investment rate crowds out other forms of investment leading to a declining economic growth rate.","[Sers, Martin R.; Victor, Peter A.] York Univ, Fac Environm Studies, N York, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Sers, MR (通讯作者)，York Univ, Fac Environm Studies, N York, ON, Canada.",mrsers@yorku.ca,,,Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP); Economics for the Anthropocene (E4A) partnership,Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP); Economics for the Anthropocene (E4A) partnership,This research was funded in part by the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP).

For this reason, disease prevention and improvement of medical follow-up represent major public health issues. The aim of this study was to measure the impact of adherence to French follow-up guidelines on hospitalization of people with diabetes. We used insurance claims data from the years 2010 to 2013 collected for 52,027 people aged over 18, affiliated to a French social security provider and treated for diabetes. We estimated panel data models to explore the association between adherence to guidelines and different measures of hospitalization, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, diabetes treatment and density of medical supply. The results show that adherence to four guidelines was associated with a significant decrease in hospital admissions, up to approximatively 30% for patients monitored for a complete lipid profile or microalbuminuria during the year. In addition, our analyses confirmed the strong protective effect of income and a significant positive correlation with good supply of hospital care. In conclusion, good adherence to French diabetes guidelines seems to be in line with the prevention of health events, notably complications, that could necessitate hospitalization.","[Andrade, L.

Nonetheless, there is virtually unanimous support for growth in politics. This may partly be due to an assumed social consensus about the desirability of growth. Here we examine public perceptions relevant to the growth debate by using data from a large number of representative surveys conducted in Europe and the US. The main findings are: (i) a relative majority of respondents seem to believe that economic growth and environmental protection are compatible, even though a fraction of the population might have unstable opinions; (ii) when people have to choose, environmental protection is prioritized in most surveys and countries; and (iii) the public has limited factual knowledge of relevant concepts and data, such as the meaning of economic growth and past GDP growth rates. These findings are discussed and further qualified. We highlight the importance of methodological aspects such as question wording and format in the interpretation of the results and draw implications for political debate and future research on economic growth and the environment.","[Drews, Stefan] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Social Environm & Econ Psychol, Fortstr 7,Bldg H, D-76829 Landau, Germany; [Antal, Miklos] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Social Res Methodol, Inst Empir Studies, Pazmany Peter Setany 1, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

A recent energy boom has increased economic opportunities in the region but has also placed development pressures on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Ranchers in the basin place high importance on good stewardship of land and water resources and are amenable to providing ecosystem services on their land in exchange for additional revenue. We conduct a rancher survey in the region to elicit preferences on program design for a voluntary Payment for Ecosystem Services program focused on maintaining or enhancing high-quality wildlife habitat and hydrologic services. Choice experiment results indicate management practices that reduce ranch revenues require higher levels of compensation than those that do not. Ranchers report that target ecosystem service is more important to them than associated payment levels, though reservation prices tend to be high relative to land values. Overall, ranchers do not express a preference for shorter contract length but those planning to sell their ranch operations do. Fewer than 25% of ranchers are satisfied with current mitigation programs, suggesting room for improvement.

Forest managers essentially have two options for increasing carbon sequestration (i.e., creating carbon offset credits): (1) avoid or delay harvest of mature timber; or (2) harvest timber and allow natural or artificial regeneration (with 'regular' or 'seed-selected' growing stock). A forest management model representative of the southern interior of British Columbia is described and used to examine forest conservation that prevents emissions of CO2, and even-flow and commercial harvesting where timber is processed into long-lived wood products that store carbon and residuals for energy. The objective of the model is to maximize net discounted returns to commercial timber operations plus the benefits of managing carbon fluxes. The model tracks carbon in living trees, organic matter, and post-harvest carbon pools. It also includes various parameters related to the weighting of future carbon flows, anticipated price of carbon, whether and to what extent use of biomass reduces fossil fuel emissions from generating electricity or production of non wood construction materials, et cetera. The results demonstrate that the decision about which forestry activities generate carbon offset credits and how many is essentially a political and not a scientific one.","[van Kooten, G.

The characterization of this type of optimal allocation adds to the literature on structural efficiency, which so far has not dealt with it in such a general framework. At the theoretical level, we both determine a decomposition of the industry measure, which establishes the relationship between group and individual measures, and provide its rigorous economic interpretation based on the ray average cost. Moreover, our framework allows to highlight the relationship between the industry measure and different returns-to-scale characterizations of the technology. At the applicative level we devise an algorithm to solve the related non-linear programming problem, thus providing the decision maker with a method to compute the optimal industry structure and the corresponding efficiency components.

This paper provides insights into the accuracy of the official series by examining the accuracy of the export and import series for Brazil during the 19th century. We re-estimate the official import series using trading partner sources, and find that the official series was marginally under-valued during certain periods of the 19th century. Furthermore, we provide new upper- and lower-bound estimates of the export series by testing different assumptions regarding the size of the cost, insurance and freight to free on board factor adjustments. Finally, we introduce a new import price index for the period 1827-1913.","[David Absell, Christopher; Tena-Junguito, Antonio] Univ Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; [Tena-Junguito, Antonio] Inst Figuerola, Madrid, Spain; [David Absell, Christopher; Tena-Junguito, Antonio] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Sociales, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Absell, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.;Absell, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Ciencias Sociales, C Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",christopherdavid.absell@uc3m.es; antonio.tena@uc3m.es,,"Absell, Christopher/0000-0002-5123-4814; Tena-Junguito, Antonio/0000-0002-7845-5406",[MCI: 2015/00209/001],,"The authors would like to thank Sandra Kuntz-Ficker, Luis Bertola, Thales Zamberlan Pereira, and three anonymous referees for their invaluable comments.

To understand the connections between Sraffa's economic theory and the classical circular economy discussed by Verger (2017), an essential aspect to be addressed here is Sraffa's interpretation of the classical conception of the wage, which can be fruitfully addressed in terms of the capabilities approach, as suggested by Vivian Walsh (2000).","[Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CEGE, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Martins, NO (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.;Martins, NO (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CEGE, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",nmartins@porto.ucp.pt,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,47,19,19,3,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

The analysis makes use of a student-level efficiency model, and several school level variables are included as explanators for efficiency scores. The results show that, especially for reading, the most influential variables relate to the composition of the student body, while the students' performance in mathematics is partly correlated with the management practices adopted by the school principal/head teacher. Schools and schooling can only explain a minor part of the variance in achievement scores, however, and the characteristics of the students themselves play the most significant role.

Prior empirical research documents the existence of organizational learning-by-doing, but provides little insight into why some firms learn while others do not. Among the 124 U.S. liver transplant centers that opened between 1987 and 2009, this paper shows evidence of organizational learning-by-doing, but only shortly after entry. Significant heterogeneity exists with learning only evident among those firms entering early in the sample period when liver transplantation was an experimental medical procedure. Firms that learn begin with lower quality outcomes before improving to the level of firms that do not learn, suggesting that early patient outcomes depend on the ability of new entrants to import best practices from existing liver transplant programs. Knowledge of best practices became increasingly available over time through the dissemination of academic research and increasingly specialized training programs, so that between 1987 and 2009, 6 month post-transplant survival rates increased from 64 to 90% and evidence of organization-level learning-by-doing disappeared. The lack of any recent evidence of organizational learning-by-doing implies that common insurer experience requirements may be reducing access to health care in non-experimental complex medical procedures without an improvement in quality.","[Stith, Sarah S.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico,"Stith, SS (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",ssstith@unm.edu,,,Health Resources and Services Administration [234-2005-370011C],Health Resources and Services Administration(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUnited States Health Resources & Service Administration (HRSA)),"I would like to thank Tom Buchmueller, Scott Masten, Jeff Smith, Mario Macis, and Steve Leider, for helpful comments.

Scientific expertise is commonly seen as providing important means to overcome this tension, for example in the Agreement's global stocktake, which is said to be undertaken in the light of equity and the best available science. This raises the question of how scholarly communities best can contribute to deliberations on equitable differentiation in the effort required to meet common temperature goals. To discuss this question, the paper looks to the literature within Science and Technology Studies on the role of science in policymaking, where disagreement exists over the merits of heating up controversies through politicization, versus cooling down issues by seeking consensus. It assesses two cases in which scientific expertise has engaged with questions of equitable effort-sharing in international climate politics: The Bali Box of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, and the Civil Society Equity Review undertaken prior to COP21 in Paris. Based on a comparison of the two cases, it is argued that scientific contributions should not shy away from highlighting conflicts in values and interests, and that heating up discussions about climate justice may be a valuable contribution to overcoming the tensions of the Paris Agreement.","[Lahn, Bard] CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway",,"Lahn, B (通讯作者)，CICERO Ctr Int Climate Res, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway.",bard.lahn@cicero.oslo.no,"Lahn, Bård/AAJ-6936-2021","Lahn, Bård/0000-0001-9161-9455",Research Council of Norway [209701],Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The author would like to thank Goran Sundqvist, the editors, and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

There are tourist boards of cities, municipalities, counties, areas, towns and islands. The umbrella institution is the Croatian National Tourist Board (central office). In 2015, tourist boards had 862 employees and the total revenues of all tourist boards amounted to 110 million euros, with the total assets exceeding 37 million euros (mainly deposits). This represents a significant financial potential for the development of tourism, a potential which is not an integral part of the state and local government budgets. In Croatia, there is an uneven distribution of revenue, in particular as regards the revenue deriving from the tourist tax. As much as 95% of the tourist tax revenue is generated by the tourist boards of the Adriatic counties. Although tourist tax is charged per night, this is extremely unfair to continental tourist boards as, due to the low number of overnight stays, these tourist offices generate less revenue and thus have fewer opportunities to promote and improve tourism. The main objective of tourist boards should be the development of tourism in the whole of Croatia. Therefore, in order to promote tourism in areas with weak tourism performance, a different distribution of tourist tax revenue should be considered. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse the financial position of such areas and the possibility of redistributing revenues intended for the promotion of tourism among individual regions of the Republic of Croatia, based on the analysis of financial reports for 297 active tourist board offices.","[Bajo, Anto] Inst Publ Finance Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Primorac, Marko] CESifo Res Network, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Blazekovic, Miheal] Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Institute of Public Finance; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Bajo, A (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.",bajo@ijf.hr; mprimorac@efzg.hr; mblaekovi@gmail.com,"Bajo, Anto/D-8423-2016","Bajo, Anto/0000-0001-8086-1473",,,,,5,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,924,932,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900097,0

Both economists-theorists and real businessmen speak about it. The economic science abounds with theories about importance of the liberal capitalism. However, today's realities have shown insolvency of many both microeconomic, and macroeconomic theories. For today more often political, economic and business agents unanimously declare specifics of the Russian capitalism, calling it state. The key principle of the liberal economy of lasses-fairehas shown the insolvency. Large business concentrates huge resources, and therefore its potential is enormous. The state capitalism is the ideology which is actively criticized in foreign researches. Nevertheless, there is a question of relevance of that for Russia. The set of researches is devoted to medium and small business: the question of the importance of small and medium business constantly are taken up among science, business and political elits. However, there is also other point of view - small business in view of the existing features of the Russian reality simply can't become a locomotiveof economy. If to pay attention to the sphere of large business, then here, frankly speaking, monopolies and oligopolies function. If to trust neoclassical economic theories, then any monopoly (as well as an oligopoly, just to a lesser extent) distorts efficiency of a market mechanism, so, reduces welfare of all contractors (both the consumer, and the state) due to redistribution of excess profits in own favor. Our research answers questions: What business is necessary to the Russian economy? What structure of property of large business answers problems of scientific and technological development of Russia?

The largest of them - Plavinas hydroelectric plant, was built during the period of the Soviet rule and is still one of the largest in Europe. As a result, the valley of the river Daugava with its unique landscapes and cultural values was flooded, despite the objections by a significant part of Latvian people. Two decades later the construction of another - Daugavpils hydroelectric dam -, was suspended because of similar protests. The debates about the effects of hydroelectric dams are continuing since Latvia regained independence in 1991. The aim of this paper is to assess these debates in the context of environmental ethics. According to approach of environmental economics, the main method for the assessment of environmental projects is the cost/benefit analysis. Likewise, the critics of construction of dams apply predictable economic costs as an argument against the construction, for instance, pointing to damages to fishery. However, economic costs were not the main reason for the protests. The main reason was the expected irreversible losses of natural and cultural values that were assessed as priceless. Such attitude of a large part of society suggests that non-economic values have to be taken into account in comprehensive assessment of these projects. The significance of these values has to be recognized, and the results of cost/benefit analysis should not be a single criterion used in the assessment of the projects of hydroelectric dams.","[Brazma, Gunars] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Brazma, G (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia.",gbrazma@latnet.lv,,,,,,,17,0,0,4,9,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,287,295,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.146,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500034,0

This issue is therefore extremely important in the micro and macroeconomic area. Bearing in mind that modem economies are transforming at an incredible rate, and at the same time, permanent sources of development are weakening, innovations, and above all their commercialization, are what the EU countries see as an effective solution to the problem of achieving economic growth. When analyzing selected determinants of innovation, it is impossible to underestimate their role and importance. Consequently, the subject matter is relevant both from theoretical as well as practical point of view. The aim of the article is to deepen the definition and multifaceted examination of the relevance of selected determinants of innovation in EU countries. The essence of the research problem is therefore to examine the relationship between the level of innovation in EU countries and the following factors: GDP, number of applied patents, innovative products, or research and development expenditure.

Procedures, which in themselves contain a strong consensual element, are dealt with. These are a part of negotiated justice in a wider sense which is a fundamental link amongst various legal solutions in certain national legislatures. Mentioned is the negotiation among parties within a framework which needs to point out basic differences between Anglo-American and European continental conceptions of that legal institute. Under continental law, these are procedures in which a hearing is not carried out, but rather the court reaches a meritorious decision usually at the preparatory hearing or eventually during investigation or at a special hearing for sentencing criminal law sanctions. This occurs after hearing the parties, and on the basis of files and without presenting particular evidence. It is assumed that there is agreement between parties on the legal qualification of acts and/or punishments. Regarding the application of these procedures, unification does not exist because some procedures can be implemented for minor criminal offences and for others, there is no limit regarding the seriousness of the criminal act. Within consensual types of criminal procedures falls the French procedure of coming to the hearing upon previous admission of guilt, the Italian application of punishment upon request by the parties, expression of guilt and negotiating guilt in Bosnia and Herzegovina and verdicts on the basis of agreement among parties in Croatia. The Swiss summary procedure which represents original agreement solution with reduced public main hearing also belongs to this type of procedure. It seems that the penetration of consensual elements in the area of criminal law is unavoidable together with a warning that this penetration has to be harmonized as best possible with the traditional legal procedural principles and values of continental European Law. Uncritical acceptance of 'contractual' criminal procedural solutions with broad 'bargaining' possibilities appears to be unacceptable regardless of the nature and seriousness of the criminal act.","[Caric, Marina] Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Caric, M (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia.",mcaric@prayst.hr,,,,,,,50,0,0,2,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,264,276,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600031,0

It can be defined as long-term savings that provide some protection against financial losses that arise as a result of unforeseen events in the life of the insured person. Life insurance is a type of insurance with special characteristics that are different from other insurances. It is long-term and economical, and the secured amount of money is always paid to the insured or the beneficiary of insurance. While life insurance in developed European countries is very significant, in Croatia, this type of insurance is still poorly developed. The reason for the low number of life insurance is poor information and citizens' interest in participating in certain types of voluntary insurance as well as a low standard of population. Life insurance in the Republic of Croatia is still being identified with savings in the bank. Citizens are neglected or ignorant of the fact that life insurance has a number of advantages over classical savings. However, over the last few years the continuous increase in paid life insurance premiums proves that the public's interest and awareness is changing with regard to this insurance. The aim of this paper is the analysis of life insurance in the Republic of Croatia from the aspect of its main characteristics and categories. In addition, the authors analyze the life insurance market in Croatia, as well as offer insurance schemes for life insurance schemes and their premiums. Thereby using a set of scientific research methods (methods of analysis, comparisons, induction, deduction, descriptors and classifications, etc.) as well as some statistical-mathematical methods used to analyze certain variables. Ultimately, authors conduct primary research on interest and participation of population in certain forms of life insurance, and make concrete conclusions about how to improve this type of activities.","[Cobovic, Maja Vretenar; Cobovic, Mirko; Vujcic, Jasna] Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Cobovic, MV (通讯作者)，Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",Maja.VretenarCobovic@vusb.hr; Mirko.Cobovic@vusb.hr; jasna.vujcic@gmail.com,"Cobovic, Mirko/HLX-5817-2023; Cobović, Maja Vretenar/AAB-6210-2020","Cobovic, Mirko/0000-0001-7104-3321; Cobović, Maja Vretenar/0000-0002-7225-147X",,,,,5,1,1,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,415,423,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900043,0

It is not only the number, but also the diversity and complexity of disputes that have been growing. At present, arbitrators also deal with criminal offences that may have serious impact on society and economy, e.g. corruption, fraud and last but not least money laundering. It is not disputed that decisions on criminal sanctions remain exclusively in the hands of national courts. However, this does not mean that the arbitrators are precluded from applying criminal laws. The occurrence of money laundering within the international commercial arbitration is a complex issue raising a lot of questions, e.g. arbitrability of such disputes, validity of arbitration agreement, applicable criminal law, evidence, duties of arbitrators, review of arbitral awards etc. As it is not possible to deal with all these question this paper focuses only on several aspects. Two possible situations in which money laundering can manifest in international commercial arbitration are identified. First, money laundering can be alleged by a party as defence to the enforcement of a contract in dispute. Second, arbitration can be abused for laundering of illicit assets. The paper further deals with the arbitrators' legal obligations under criminal and regulatory law in the face of suspected or alleged money laundering. In this part the paper focuses especially on the second scenario, e.g. when arbitration is abused for money laundering. The paper analyses if the arbitrators are covered by criminal law provision on money laundering and on notification duties. The paper also analyses if the arbitrators fall within the scope of regulatory system imposing identification and reporting duties. In this part the paper reflects especially relevant provisions of Czech and EU law.","[Drlickova, Klara] Masaryk Univ, Fac Law, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Drlickova, K (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Law, Brno, Czech Republic.",klara.drlickova@law.muni.cz,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,227,234,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600027,0

Consumers of the brands Nescafe Dolce Gusto and Nespresso capsule-based beverages were selected, and comparatively analyzed to understand the possible differences perceived by the consumers of each brand. Design/methodology/approach Based on a soft laddering technique, 27 in-depth interviews were carried out among the users of Nespresso and Dolce Gusto. This technique allowed differentiating the attributes of each brand, as well as defining common/cumulative elements. Findings Individual values of achievement and personal pleasure, mainly reached through better living standards, were dominant for all consumers. Dominant chain analysis results showed the perceptions of consumers were different for each brand. Generally, both brands' consumers seek quality and practicality. However, Dolce Gusto delivers a product perceived as having more functional benefits, thus serving consumers seeking more variety when it comes to different types of beverages. On the other hand, Nespresso serves a more selective niche market, whose consumers rather value brand quality and reliability. Originality/value The characteristics and product specifications show similarities with food consumption trends, which justify the growth of this market in recent years. Therefore, strategies and the consumers' demand for the capsule market show a promising trend on the coffee and drinks market in Brazil, deserving special attention from both companies and producers.","[Gandia, Rodrigo Marcal; Sugano, Joel Yutaka; de Barros Vilas Boas, Luiz Henrique; Mesquita, Daniel Leite] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Adm & Econ, Lavras, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Lavras,"Mesquita, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Adm & Econ, Lavras, Brazil.",romgandia@gmail.com; joel.sugano@gmail.com; luiz.vilasboas@dae.ufla.br; mdleite@gmail.com,"Mesquita, Daniel Leite/AAE-1581-2020; Gandia, Rodrigo M/L-2578-2017","Mesquita, Daniel Leite/0000-0001-6886-9333; Gandia, Rodrigo M/0000-0001-9551-153X",,,,,45,11,11,1,31,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The importance of turning to peoples' lived perspectives are often brought forward as crucial to understanding how inclusion and exclusion are played out in real life. The study aimed to introduce and discuss Universal Design (UD) of museum exhibitions, by engaging visitors and staff in bringing forward content for joint discussions. As there is an ongoing shift from traditional work on accessibility towards UD taking place in Sweden right now, the study was also part of raising the awareness of UD within the disability movement and at the museums. Museum visitors representing different disability organizations worked together with museum staff in photo exercises, supervised by two researchers. In total, 31 participants took part in six three-hour workshops. The workshop format encompassed three steps. First, one of the researchers introduced UD, after which the participants were divided into mixed groups with both visitors and staff. Their task was to take photos of museum features that were in line with, or in conflict with, UD. At the end of the workshop, all groups gathered to discuss what they had found. In this paper, we tell about the examples the participants brought forward and the ensuing joint discussions, and discuss the further implications for UD.","[Hedvall, Per-Olof; Rydeman, Bitte; Andersson, Malin] Lund Univ, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Granholm, Sarah] HSO Skane, Malmo, Sweden",Lund University,"Hedvall, PO (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Box 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",per-olof.hedvall@certec.lth.se,"Hedvall, Per-Olof/D-1932-2015","Hedvall, Per-Olof/0000-0002-0962-2899; Rydeman, Bitte/0000-0002-5376-2979",Region Skane,Region Skane,The reported work has been funded by Region Skane.

The purpose of this research was to determine the way high school graduates from Osijek decide on the faculty they want to enrol, which criteria they apply when choosing their future occupation, what information they need for decision-making, and which sources they use to gather information about the future study and employment possibilities. The study also sought to establish how well informed they are about the labour market. The research was conducted using an online questionnaire. The sample comprised of high school graduates (n = 264) from four Osijekgymnasiums. Data were analysed by descriptive statistics. Results show that high school graduates primarily chose study according to their interests, however, at the same time two thirds of respondents wished they have had more help with analysis of their traits that predispose them for a particular study and profession. Other criteria that quite affect gymnasium graduates study selection are possibility of getting a good job, possibility of advancement and training, ability to contribute to community development, good study conditions and employment opportunities abroad. Decision-making about future study and profession for the greatest number of respondents was based on information they got from their family, friends, faculty/university sites and students studying chosen study.

Despite the shrinking number of banks, they still need to be competitive in order to keep their position in the market. Moreover, today's important factor for success lies in, among others, greater efficiency as it plays a significant role in sustaining growth and competitiveness. Therefore, apprehension of a bank's relative efficiency performance in comparison to the market is important for decision makers and for that reason it is essential to keep track of efficiency. The aim of this paper is to scrutinize the efficiency of Croatian banks in 2016 in order to detect current level of efficiency, leaders on the market and efficiency targets for inputs and outputs of relatively inefficient banks. Certain insufficiencies in the accounting indicators approach to efficiency measurement can be eliminated using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. Therefore, this paper uses the input-oriented constant returns to scale (CCR) and input-oriented variable returns to scale (BCC) DEA models to estimate overall technical efficiency (OTE), pure technical efficiency (PTE) and scale efficiency (SE). For defining input and output variables operating approach is applied. The results for 2016 reveal that average overall technical efficiency and pure technical efficiency are between 0.88 and 0.91, due to different scale efficiency. The group of large banks proved to be more efficient than medium and small sized banks, while no significant difference was proved considering ownership of banks. Furthermore, identifying top performance on the market (Banka Kovanica and Zagrebacka banka), paper provides information on different ways to raise efficiency for relatively inefficient banks.","[Kordic, Lana; Viskovic, Josip] Univ Split, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Kordic, L (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",lana.kordic@efst.hr; josip.viskovic@efst.hr,"Kordić, Lana/F-7785-2017; Visković, Josip/D-5966-2017",,,,,,15,2,2,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,1023,1031,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900108,0

Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was used to investigate consumption patterns, attitudes, and socio-demographic profiles of college-attending respondents between the ages of 18 and 30. Cluster analysis and factor analysis were undertaken to obtain a better understanding of the attitudes among young consumers towards soft drinks. A logistic regression model was used as a predictor to distinguish between frequent and non-frequent soft drink consumers. Findings - Indian youths preferred diet drinks and fruit juices more than regular soft drinks. Soft drinks were mostly consumed as distinct drinks (not as substitutes) and on specific occasions. Easy availability of soft drinks at the locations closure to consumers was a critical factor in determining consumers' purchase and consumption level. Attitude towards the utility and nutritional dimensions of soft drinks had a positive and significant influence on the frequency of consumption. Practical implications - To remain competitive, soft drinks' companies need to focus more on healthy products and those that are refreshing and relaxing. Social implications - Regulating the availability of soft drinks in and around educational institutions will affect consumption of soft drinks and reduce diseases.

Design/methodology/approach An online questionnaire was administered through a market research company (Qualtrics (R) Inc.). A total of 110 managerial staff and 229 restaurant employees completed this questionnaire. Findings Most restaurants were willing to modify recipes for customers with food allergies. Respondents felt that the customers should be responsible for expressing their food allergy needs. Both groups were able to identify certain symptoms of allergic reactions to food but lacked knowledge of allergen-handling practices. The managerial staff and employees had knowledge differences about how to respond to an allergic reaction (p<0.001) and how to identify peanut derivatives on food labels (p<0.000). In total, 70 percent of the managerial staff indicated that they provided employee food allergy training but only 40 percent of employees indicated receiving such training. The managerial staff identified a lack of employee commitment and interest as barriers to training provision. However, the employees identified different reasons (i.e. it is unnecessary and not beneficial). Practical implications Restaurants should have policies in place to accommodative customers with food allergies and make sure food allergy-related information is communicated to their customers via different outlets (i.e. restaurants' websites and printed menus). Food allergy training should be designed based on the areas that need improvement, as knowledge may differ based on the position in the restaurants (managerial staff vs employees) and types of the restaurants (quick service vs casual dining). Pragmatic strategies need to be identified to better encourage and motivate restaurant employees to attend a food allergy training. Originality/value Understanding the similarities and differences in attitudes, knowledge and training on food allergies between restaurant managerial staff and employees would help restaurants to plan and implement policies and training that best fit both managerial staff and employees.","[Lee, Yee Ming; Sozen, Erol] Auburn Univ, Dept Nutr Dietet & Hospitality Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Lee, YM (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Nutr Dietet & Hospitality Management, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",ymlee@auburn.edu; ezs0016@auburn.edu,"Lee, Yee Ming/AAS-8551-2021; Sozen, Erol/AAM-9498-2020","Lee, Yee Ming/0000-0001-5646-2341; Sozen, Erol/0000-0002-3519-0874",,,,,52,13,15,3,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The aim of the research paper is to clarify the relation between the concepts of social innovation and social entrepreneurship. Within the research, the authors used the following methods: monographic method, the methods of analysis and synthesis as well as the method of scientific induction and deduction. In scope of the research, the authors used scientific literature on social entrepreneurship and social innovation. The research shows that social entrepreneurship and social innovation are closely interrelated concepts, since social entrepreneurship often creates and promotes social innovation. Social innovation is a mechanism in actual innovation but a social entrepreneur is a driving force for social change. In addition, a significant difference is the fact that social innovation is not necessarily linked to commercial interests, while in social entrepreneurship the involvement in commercial activities is a mandatory precondition to ensure efficient operation of the enterprise and solving of social problems.","[Licite, Lasma; Grinberga-Zalite, Gunta] Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Licite, L; Grinberga-Zalite, G (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Life Sci & Technol, Jelgava, Latvia.",lasma.licite@llu.lv; gunta.grinberga@llu.lv,"Licite Kurbe, Lasma Licite/AAX-4657-2021; Licite-Kurbe, Lasma/ADO-5954-2022","Licite-Kurbe, Lasma/0000-0002-0973-7522","National Research Programme 5.2 Economic Transformation, Smart Growth, Governance and Legal Framework for the State and Society for Sustainable Development - a New Approach to the Creation of a Sustainable Learning Community (EKOSOCLV)","National Research Programme 5.2 Economic Transformation, Smart Growth, Governance and Legal Framework for the State and Society for Sustainable Development - a New Approach to the Creation of a Sustainable Learning Community (EKOSOCLV)","The paper was supported by the National Research Programme 5.2 Economic Transformation, Smart Growth, Governance and Legal Framework for the State and Society for Sustainable Development - a New Approach to the Creation of a Sustainable Learning Community (EKOSOCLV).

Design/methodology/approach Data on 307 guests in a university canteen composing of stated measures for 12 beliefs, general attitude and behavioral intention and of visually estimated food leftovers are analyzed using exploratory factor and path analyses. Findings A factor analysis for belief statements derives three distinctive and potentially conflicting attitude dimensions: Environment, Self-Interest and Resources. Path analyses on their interrelation with general attitude, intention and behavior indicate that the dimensions have distinctive effects. Moreover, Self-Interest in contrast to the other two dimensions is correlated with situational perceptions about portion size and taste when these are included as direct determinants of leftovers. Research limitations/implications It is recommended to consider different dimensions of attitude when addressing food leftover behavior since these dimensions may not be well represented in a classical summary construct and since their relevance may differ depending on situational factors. Additional research is recommended to validate the results for more representative samples of consumers and to elaborate on the interaction of different attitude dimensions as potential source of attitude ambivalence which cannot clearly be determined from the existing data.

This situation will cause serious environmental problems and will cause economic losses if the food by-product is not utilized. The way to solve this problem is to improve the economic value by valorization of food by-products. Unfortunately, after the juice production, the pomace as a by-product is not utilized completely.

Legal regulation of this area of data retention in European Union, where interest of fighting crime and public safety confronts with the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data, is one of the most debated topics, and therefore it is no wonder that Court of Justice of European Union (CJEU) in its jurisprudence met several very important decisions, among others Digital Rights Ireland & Seitlinger and Ors (joined cases C-293/12 and C-594/12) in 2014. and Tele2/Watson (joined cases C-203/15 and C-698/15) in 2016. These cases deal with application of certain important provisions of Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive1 and some other EU Directives.

Investigation of labour productivity is important for the EU because of recent economic crisis and relatively slow economic recovery, but also because of the existing development gap among its member states. This gap ultimately determines dynamics of productivity growth across constituent parts of the EU. This research includes cross-country comparison of labour productivity in traditional services sector (tourism and hospitality), while referring to both services sector and manufacturing sector productivity of the EU countries. This is the more important because of high labour content of services, including those which create high value added. In this context, absenteeism is an important variable with considerable impact on productivity. As a complex socio-economic construct absenteeism asks for special attention most notably in labour intensive services sector, due to its potentially high impact on business results, including productivity. Research results show that Croatia considerably lags behind the productivity level of the majority of other EU countries, while having relatively high productivity in tourism, as shown through international comparison. It has been also shown that Croatian tourism sector realizes better indicators of absenteeism what further adds to its productivity. The paper also indicates possible problems for further productivity growth in Croatian tourism which, together with low productivity level in industry, might endanger the general productivity level, as well as expected growth of Croatian economy.","[Ribaric, Helga Maskarin; Cikes, Vedrana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija 51410, Croatia; [Derado, Drazen] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskov 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Split,"Ribaric, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija 51410, Croatia.",helgam@fthm.hr; dderado@efst.hr; vedrana.cikes@fthm.hr,"Ribaric, Helga Maskarin/O-1236-2019; Čikeš, Vedrana/S-8961-2019; Čikeš, Vedrana/Z-2055-2018","Ribaric, Helga Maskarin/0000-0002-7201-9603; Čikeš, Vedrana/0000-0001-9121-4503; Čikeš, Vedrana/0000-0001-9121-4503",,,,,33,0,0,0,1,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,346,359,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900036,0

This chapter shows that van der Waerden and Tinbergen used ever-increasing formal methods to face the issue of rationalization, which became politically relevant and controversial in the specific context of the interwar period. Their new scientific tools gave them esteem and influence. In their role as advisers to the government, they gained influence and were able to recommend policies that were in accordance with their political beliefs.","[Rodenburg, Peter] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Rodenburg, P (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,43,1,1,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0743-4154,,978-1-78756-423-7; 978-1-78756-424-4,RES HIST ECON THOUGH,,,2018,36.0,,B,,,,41,57,,10.1108/S0743-41542018000036B004,0.0,,,17,Economics; History Of Social Sciences; Philosophy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Philosophy,BQ3WW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000588194300004,0

Financial discipline should be one of the main priorities for both business people and national administration. All of the EU countries implement the Directive 2011/7/EU on combating late payment in commercial transactions, yet, obviously, this is not enough. In both Croatia and Poland, entrepreneurs are constantly struggling against late payment of their receivables. Legislation of both countries implements not only Bankruptcy Law, but also a procedure for faster recovery of affected debtors. Pre-bankruptcy settlement in Croatia, or Restructuring Law in Poland, aims to prevent bankruptcy. The debt to equity ratio is one of the first indicators of financial crises. The main aim of this research was to test the debt to equity ratio of 107 companies listed in Croatia and Poland as well as find if there are any differences between Croatia and Poland. The results of both countries in terms of the debt-to-equity ratio were also compared to determine the average ratio between the normal and critical ratios, or 1.5 ratio. The research showed that there are differences between the countries: the average debt to equity ratio in Croatia is 2.19 (2016), compared with 1.57 (2016) in Poland. Furthermore, the companies in Croatia, compared to the companies in Poland, use much more external financing resources.","[Roska, Vlasta] Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Remlein, Marzena] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",University North - Croatia; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Roska, V (通讯作者)，Univ North, Koprivnica, Croatia.",vlasta.roska@unin.hr; marzena.remlein@ue.poznan.pl,"Remlein, Marzena/HTL-4292-2023","Remlein, Marzena/0000-0001-7865-0319",,,,,6,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,518,526,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600059,0

Rice is a staple food that is widely used in the world, especially in Indonesia. Several studies have shown that arsenic level in rice is influenced by the environment and genetic differences of rice. The process of cooking in raw rice may reduce arsenic level in rice. The purpose of this research was to study the effect of cooking process using demineralized water and tap water on arsenic contents in rice. The samples used were white rice (Oryza sativa L), brown rice (Oryza rufipogon), brown rice (Oryza punctata) and black sticky rice (Oryza sativa var glutinosa) obtained from several traditional markets in Medan. The process of cooking was done using two types of water, namely demineralized (reverse osmosis; RO) water and tap water. The determination of arsenic level was carried out using atomic absorption spectrophotometer with argon-air flame at wavelength of 193.7 nm. The results showed that the highest arsenic content of 0.3061 mg/kg was found in red rice and the lowest arsenic level of 0.0693 mg/kg was found in white rice. Process of cooking with RO water and tap water reduced arsenic level in cooked rice. The highest reduction in arsenic content (21.93%) caused by cooking process using RO water and 11.40% caused by cooking with tap water. The result showed that the arsenic safety index in raw rice and cooked rice, based on the daily intake according to the excess cancer risk, exceeded the WHO safety standard.","[Silalahi, Jansen; Saraswati, Icha Nanda] Univ Sumatera Utara, Fac Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Chem, Medan, Indonesia; [Tampubolon, Sanggam Dera Rosa] Univ Katolik Santo Thomas, Fac Agr, Medan, Indonesia; [Sagala, Margareth Ruth Mayria] Univ Sumatera Utara, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Medan, Indonesia; [Silalahi, Yosy C.

Design/methodology/approach - The study has three phases. In the first phase, the Delphi method is employed, and 15 motives for the consumption of organic food are identified; these motives are used to develop the model in the second phase. Finally, in the last phase, an ANN is used to rank themotives to determine their priority. Findings - The EFA model explored includes four factors that have a positive effect on the level of organic food consumption. These are naturalness, trust, sanitariness and marketing. Results from the use of an ANN indicate that the main variables in organic food consumption are claims, psychological variables and doubt. From the results of the EFA model it is clear these three variables are components of the factor of trust. Practical implications - Marketers can use the model developed in this paper to satisfy the needs of their customers and hence enhance their market share and profitability. This study shows that improvements in truth in the claims made for organic products, perceived security from using these products and doubts about the safety of other foods can lead marketers to their goal. Informative advertisements can inculcate trust and naturalness among consumers as main factors. Originality/value - The main contribution of this study is the light it sheds on how consumers think about organic foods. It develops a model incorporating motives for consuming organic food and determining the priorities held by consumers of organic foods.","[Sobhanifard, Yaser] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Management & Engn, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology,"Sobhanifard, Y (通讯作者)，Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Management & Engn, Tehran, Iran.",sobhanifard@iust.ac.ir,"Sobhanifard, Yaser/S-6128-2018","Sobhanifard, Yaser/0000-0003-3298-0464",,,,,69,34,34,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - The study utilised the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) indicator for the measurement of food access data from 168 households in ten communities from the Northwestern region of Ghana for the analyses. Households were categorised into participating households (treatment) and non-participating households (control). The endogenous treatment effects model was employed to evaluate the impact of participation in SAIPs training on food insecurity access scale. Findings - The results show that participation in SAIPs training lowers, on average, the household food insecurity access by 2.95 points, approximately an 11 per cent reduction in HFIAS score. Other significant factors found to influence household food insecurity access scale are age of household head, experience in farming, total acres owned by household, income level of the household and occupation of the head of the household. Research limitations/implications - The training programme of participation in SAIPs has massive implications for food security, rural economy and farmers' livelihoods. However, due to the unique conditions prevailing in Northwestern Ghana, the findings of this research are limited in terms of their generalisability. Future research direction in the area of SAIPs trainings and impact study replications in all qualifying rural food production areas in Ghana, which are susceptible to household food insecurity, will provide a national picture of the efficacy of SAIPs trainings on household food insecurity. Practical implications - A proven means to decrease natural resource degradation, increase crops yields, and increase subsistence farmers' income, and food security is an important intervention to resolve the seasonal food shortage, which last for five months in a typical year for agro-food-dependent farming communities in Northwestern Ghana. Social implications - Ensuring household food security improvement and environmental sustainability will help improve living standards of food producers and reduce the adverse social challenges associated with food insecure communities such as health problems due to food deficiencies, social inequalities, environmental pollution and natural resource degradation in Northwestern Ghana. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is the novel thought and approach to examine the impact of the SAIPs trainings on household food security in Northwestern Ghana using the household food insecurity access scale indicator. The study also examined the factors that affect household food security using the endogenous treatment model, which also evaluates the impact of the training programme on the outcome variable.","[Yahaya, Iddrisu] Savanna Agr Res Inst, Dept Socioecon, Council Sci & Ind Res, Wa, Ghana; [Pokharel, Krishna P.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Alidu, Abdul-Fatahi] Univ Dev Studies, Fac Agribusiness & Commun Sci, Climate Change & Food Secur Programme, Tamale, Ghana; [Yamoah, Fred Amofa] Brunel Univ London, Business Sch, London, England",Kansas State University; University for Development Studies; Brunel University,"Yamoah, FA (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Business Sch, London, England.",Fred.Yamoah@brunel.ac.uk,,"Alidu, Abdul-Fatahi/0000-0002-0322-2536",,,,,47,15,17,1,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Unlike the literature, we characterize for the exogenous case the equilibrium prices for all feasible relevant reference prices. Competition is enhanced after the introduction of a reference pricing system. We also compare both reference pricing systems on welfare grounds, assuming two different objective functions for health authorities: (i) standard social welfare and (ii) gross consumer surplus net of total pharmaceutical expenditures. We show that regardless of the objective function, health authorities will never choose endogenous reference pricing. When health authorities are paternalistic, the exogenous reference price that maximizes standard social welfare is such that the price of the generic drug is the reference price while the price of the branded drug is higher than the reference price. When health authorities are not paternalistic, the optimal exogenous reference price is such that the price of the branded drug is the reference price while the price of the generic drug is lower than the reference price.","[Antonanzas, F.; Juarez-Castello, C.

This paper maintains that the bundle of rights view of property is not the most appropriate for analysing situations of this kind. It shows that, from around 1900 onwards, sharecroppers' rights became insecure, which gave rise to a series of dysfunctions that resulted in the contract no longer being optimal. It concludes that the removal of the inefficiencies arising from shared ownership was a sufficient reason to justify the agrarian reform that the Catalan Parliament sought to introduce in 1934.","[Garrido, Samuel] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Avda Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Garrido, S (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, Avda Sos Baynat S-N, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",samuel.garrido@uji.es,,,,,,,65,6,6,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

The paper estimates the relationship between smoking and alcohol consumption using several self-reported and objective smoking measures, while also implementing a two-stage least squares estimation strategy that utilizes the randomized smoking cessation program assignment as an instrument for smoking. The analysis leads to three salient findings. First, self-reported and clinically verified smoking measures provide mixed evidence on the short-term impact of quitting smoking on alcohol consumption. Second, the long-term impact of smoking on alcohol consumption, measured with the historic 5 years smoking behavior, suggests that those with the highest average cigarette consumption and those with the longest smoking history see the largest increase in alcohol consumption. Specifically, abstaining from smoking or reducing the average cigarette consumption to the mean level lowers alcohol consumption by roughly 25% per week. As a result, these findings present comprehensive evidence that smoking and drinking are complements in the long-term and that the public health and finance benefits in smoking cessations treatments are undervalued.","[Ukert, Benjamin] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, 308 Colonial Penn Ctr,3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Ukert, B (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, 308 Colonial Penn Ctr,3641 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",bukert@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

The companies may foresee this effect and modify hiring or contracting policies. We present a model allowing the estimation of IC with such adjustments. We show that the risk of illness does not change the general shape and properties of the (expected) marginal productivity function. We apply our model to several illustrative examples and show that firm's adjustments impact IC in an ambiguous way, depending on detailed company/market characteristics: in some cases the company reduces the employment (further increasing IC), in another-the opposite happens. Contrary to previous findings, teamwork and shortfall penalties may reduce IC in some settings. Our analysis highlights that IC should be split into the result of companies preparing for and actually experiencing sick leaves.","[Jakubczyk, Michal; Kon, Beata] SGH Warsaw, Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland; [Kon, Beata] Minist Hlth, Dept Anal & Strategy, Ul Miodowa 15, PL-00952 Warsaw, Poland",,"Jakubczyk, M (通讯作者)，SGH Warsaw, Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Al Niepodleglosci 162, PL-02554 Warsaw, Poland.",michal.jakubczyk@sgh.waw.pl,"Jakubczyk, Michal/F-8435-2013; Koń, Beata/IAP-2423-2023","Jakubczyk, Michal/0000-0002-0006-6769; Koń, Beata/0000-0003-2190-4546",Fulbright Senior Award,Fulbright Senior Award,"This paper was partially prepared when M.

For decades, existing benefit distribution approaches have been debated by academics, and presented challenges for conservation practitioners. In passing through long chains of project actors, payments incur high transaction costs and are susceptible to elite capture and corruption. A new type of financial technology (FinTech) 'mobile money' could offer a novel and available solution to these challenges, at what is now a critical stage in PES and REDD+ implementation. Mobile payments (made via cell phones) have been used successfully in development projects related to micro-credit, micro-insurance, and aid relief, and this commentary considers their possible advantages and drawbacks for PES/REDD+ schemes. Several countries e.g. Cambodia, China, Tanzania, and the Philippines demonstrate both high PES/REDD+ uptake, and high mobile money penetration. In certain circumstances benefit distribution via FinTech may lower transaction costs, enable higher frequency payments, and provide new socioeconomic benefits. It could also improve the privacy, transparency, traceability, and security of disbursements, contributing to more efficient and equitable PES and REDD+ schemes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper develops a conceptual model and numerical example that illustrate the risk associated with exposure to the high costs of complying with future emissions controls and how this risks trades off against that from potentially premature investment into abatement. We then highlight the potentially unique role of tropical forest protection in helping to manage these risks by providing a cost-effective buffer of near term emissions reductions at a globally significant scale. This buffer would provide insurance against the risk of suddenly tightening targets, as well as providing other critical environmental benefits. We further examine how a version of a private finance instrument in the form of long-dated 'call' options on verified reductions in emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (i.e. REDD+.) can help to operationalize this risk-hedging buffer creation. Options on REDD+ could aid both regulated businesses and tropical nations to manage their respective risks. REDD + options could deliver sufficient abatement to significantly hedge exposure of regulated entities to potential corrections in climate policy while channeling financial resources to defer deforestation even as climate policies continue to evolve.

A worldwide data set of 699 observations drawn from 133 studies combines information reported in primary studies with geospatial data. The meta-analysis explores antagonisms and synergies between ecosystem services. This is the first meta-analysis to incorporate simultaneously external geospatial data and ecosystem service interactions. We first show that it is possible to reliably predict the value of ecosystem services provided by lakes based on their physical and geographic characteristics. Second, we demonstrate that interactions between ecosystem services appear to be significant for explaining lake ecosystem service values. Third, we provide an estimation of the average value of ecosystem services provided by lakes: between 106 and 140 USD$2010 per respondent per year for non-hedonic price studies and between 169 and 403 USD$2010 per property per year for hedonic price studies.

A BEFORE-AFTER, EXPERIMENTAL-CONTROL EVALUATION IN LOS ANGELES",JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRAVEL BEHAVIOR; LAND-USE; TRANSIT,"This paper uses a before-after, experimental-control group method to evaluate the impacts of the newly opened Expo light rail transit line in Los Angeles on personal vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We applied the California Air Resources Board's EMFAC 2011 emission model to estimate the amount of daily average CO2 emissions from personal vehicle travel for 160 households across two waves, before and after the light rail opened. The 160 households were part of an experimental-control group research design. Approximately half of the households live within a half-mile of new Expo light rail stations (the experimental group) and the balance of the sampled households live beyond a half-mile from Expo light rail stations (the control group). Households tracked odometer mileage for all household vehicles for seven days in two sample waves, before the Expo Line opened (fall, 2011) and after the Expo Line opened (fall, 2012). Our analysis indicates that opening the Expo Line had a statistically significant impact on average daily CO2 emissions from motor vehicles. We found that the CO2 emission of households who reside within a half-mile of an Expo Line station was 27.17 percent smaller than those living more than a half-mile from a station after the opening of the light rail, while no significant difference exists before the opening. A difference-in-difference model suggests that the opening of the Expo Line is associated with 3,145 g less of household vehicle CO2 emissions per day as a treatment effect. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the emission reduction effect is also present when the experimental group of households is redefined to be those living within a kilometer from the new light rail stations.","[Boarnet, Marlon G.; Wang, Xize] Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 650 Childs Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Houston, Douglas] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Social Ecol, 5300 Social & Behav Sci Gateway, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Boarnet, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Sol Price Sch Publ Policy, 650 Childs Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",boarnet@usc.edu; xizewang@usc.edu; houston@uci.edu,"Wang, Xize/AAL-4880-2021","Wang, Xize/0000-0002-4861-6002",California Air Resources Board; Haynes Foundation; Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; San Jose State Mineta Transportation Institute; Southern California Association of Governments; University of California Transportation Center; University of California Multi-Campus Research Program on Sustainable Transportation; University of Southern California Lusk Center for Real Estate,California Air Resources Board; Haynes Foundation; Lincoln Institute of Land Policy; San Jose State Mineta Transportation Institute; Southern California Association of Governments; University of California Transportation Center; University of California Multi-Campus Research Program on Sustainable Transportation(University of California System); University of Southern California Lusk Center for Real Estate,"The research was supported by the California Air Resources Board, the Haynes Foundation, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, the San Jose State Mineta Transportation Institute, the Southern California Association of Governments, the University of California Transportation Center, the University of California Multi-Campus Research Program on Sustainable Transportation, and the University of Southern California Lusk Center for Real Estate.

From a traditional economic perspective, this type of manipulation would be considered unlikely to affect perceptions and behaviour, especially in the presence of pecuniary incentives and repeated decisions among sophisticated agents. From a behaviourally informed perspective, however, psychological and political theories of wording argue that word choice can have a significant impact on economic behaviour. To substantiate this discussion, we conduct a survey experiment that tests the impact of the words 'payment' and 'compensation' on favorability ratings of a proposed PES program. These preliminary findings suggest that the words used to describe public policies can be influential non-pecuniary interventions.

However, little is known about how subjective wellbeing, in particular, is impacted by invasive species. This is troubling because it precludes credible empirical considerations of the full-range of social externalities when setting invasive species management policy. To address this knowledge gap, this paper provides the first estimates of invasive species impacts on subjective well-being using the life satisfaction (happiness) index. The approach is applied to the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), a particularly virulent ash tree attacking pest in North America. Using a repeated cross-sectional fixed effects design, the impact of EAB detection on life satisfaction (LS) is estimated for individuals living in 189 counties in 15 US states over 2005-2011.

Finance ministries and frame alignment in UN climate finance negotiations,INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate finance; Climate change; UNFCCC negotiations; Bureaucratic politics; Finance ministries,ADAPTATION FINANCE; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; EQUITY; POLICY,"Finance ministries are increasingly involved in UN climate finance negotiations, yet this development received very limited attention in the literature on climate finance or climate negotiations. It is not obvious from the literature on bureaucratic politics how these ministries will position themselves on climate finance: they may frame climate finance as expenditure to be limited or as an instrument for correcting the market failure of climate change. This paper investigates which frames have characterised the positions of finance ministries on key issues in the climate finance negotiations, and whether the use of a given frame corresponds to particular factors. Case studies of Denmark, India, Indonesia and the USA based on official documents and interviews show that the position of each finance ministry is generally consistent with one particular frame. The Indonesian and Danish finance ministries predominantly framed climate finance as a way of correcting a market failure. The Indian Ministry of Finance emphasised Common but Differentiated Responsibilitieswi, which fits with the budget frame. The US Treasury's position similarly fits th the budget frame while sharing elements of the market failure frame. Finance ministries that had the lead on climate finance were more likely follow the budget frame. The use of both frames cuts across the divide between industrialised and emerging economies. With the exception of the USA, left- and right-wing governments were equally likely to adopt either frame. These findings indicate that strengthening finance ministry forums built around the market failure frame can be a way of reducing norm fragmentation.","[Skovgaard, Jakob] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Skovgaard, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, POB 52, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",jakob.skovgaard@svet.lu.se,,,Swedish Research Council [Vetenskapsradet]; Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation [Riksbankens Jubileumsfond]; Swedish Research Council Formas [Forskningsradet Formas],Swedish Research Council [Vetenskapsradet](Swedish Research Council); Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation [Riksbankens Jubileumsfond](Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Research Council Formas [Forskningsradet Formas](Swedish Research Council Formas),"The research for this article was undertaken as part of the project International Economic Institutions and Domestic Actors in the Climate Regime Complex, which has been funded by the Swedish Research Council [Vetenskapsradet], the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation [Riksbankens Jubileumsfond] the Swedish Research Council Formas [Forskningsradet Formas].",,43,15,17,1,32,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The research has shown that nature parks are the most valuable tourist attractions for development of tourism and other activities in Eastern Croatia. Sustainable tourism development guidelines and management practices are applicable to tourism in nature parks. Sustainability principles refer to the environmental, economic, and socio-cultural aspects of tourism development, and a suitable balance must be established between these three dimensions to guarantee its long-term sustainability. Accounting should have an important role in the implementation of different accounting principles and standards in order to protect resources for sustainable development in nature parks Lonjsko polje and Kopacki rit. Accounting administration provides a clear and complete picture of the real costs and benefits arising from the decision on the allocation of resources. Therefore, the purpose and objective of this paper is to examine the role of accounting in the sustainable development of Nature Park Lonjsko polje and Kopacki rit. Starting from the objective of this study, there has been made an analysis of financial statements using desk research and other secondary sources of information. In addition, the primary research was conducted through a structured interview in the Nature Park Lonjsko polje, highlighted the role and importance of accounting in the records of all the resources of nature parks and in the financial and internal reporting for management.

Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected by self-administered questionnaire completed by respondents who had purchase experience of organic food in the last six months. The specific context of this study is green consumption for organic food in Taiwan. Data collection was implemented in a convenience sampling method. Among the 578 consumers who had filled the questionnaire, 147 did not have any purchase history of organic food, resulting in a final usable sample of 431 (response rate 74.57 percent) in Taiwan. The data were collected during a five-week period in late 2015. Findings - Through structural equation modeling analysis, data were analyzed and the empirical results indicate that tie strength, sender's green expertise, and receiver's green expertise have a positive influence on green consumer's susceptibility to informational interpersonal influences and normative interpersonal influences, separately. In addition, informational interpersonal influences and normative interpersonal influences both have a positive relationship on green purchase intention, which will further positively influence the green purchase behavior. Originality/value - This study reminds marketers of the impact of WOM effects as well as interpersonal influences on consumers. It examines the impact of tie strength, senders' green expertise, and receivers' green expertise on green purchase intention and green purchase behavior. This study also explores the mediation effects of green consumers' susceptibility to interpersonal influences. Consumers' susceptibility to interpersonal influence is discussed in the marketing literature. However, few prior studies have explored its effect in the green setting. Last, few attempts have discussed the relationship between green purchase intention and green purchase behavior. This study contributes to the literature by examine the relationship between green purchase intentions and green purchase behavior.","[Chang, Sheng-Hsiung] Tamkang Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Chin-Wen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",Tamkang University; National Taiwan University,"Chang, SH (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Taipei, Taiwan.",shchang@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Chang, Sheng-Hsiung/V-5505-2019","Chang, Sheng-Hsiung/0000-0001-9685-4315",,,,,76,28,29,6,41,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The first forms of pension insurance in Croatia were based on the so-called: old-age insurance, while the formal forms were developed in the 19th century. The crisis of the pension system, which was present at the end of the period of socialism, deepened even after Croatian independence. Therefore, at the end of the nineties began the reform of pension insurance, which was completed in 2002. The reform of the pension system in Croatia was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, which began in 1999, the goal was to streamline the existing pension system of intergenerational solidarity and to make it sustainable. After the first phase, in 2002 the second phase conducted reform of the pension insurance, which designed the second and the third pillar and, also, established capitalized pension savings. In accordance with the reforms, today's pension system of our country is based on a mixed financing model, in which instead of one, there is a system with multiple pension pillars. But despite the reforms, this system, even today has some difficulties that hinder the efficient functioning. Since the future trends in the pension system are largely determined by demographic and economic indicators as well as regulations governing the pension system, the goal of this paper is to present a scenario of pension insurance development in Croatia from 2016 to 2060, made on the basis of available development projections of demographic, administrative and economic indicators. Within the framework of scenarios, the authors analyze the movement of certain variables of pension insurance which are important for the sustainability of the whole system. By observing the individual strengths and weaknesses in the development of pension insurance on the basis of the created scenarios, the authors offer suggestions for the implementation of additional measures and activities within the system in order to improve the economic and social effects of the pension system and facilitate its long-term sustainability. Thereby using a set of scientific research methods (methods of analysis, comparison, induction, deduction, description and classification, etc.) as well as certain statistical and mathematical methods that are used for the analysis of certain variables.","[Cobovic, Maja Vretenar; Cobovic, Mirko; Vujcic, Jasna] Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Cobovic, MV (通讯作者)，Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Croatia.",Maja.VretenarCobovic@vusb.hr; Mirko.Cobovic@vusb.hr; jasna.vujcic@gmail.com,"Cobović, Maja Vretenar/AAB-6210-2020; Cobovic, Mirko/HLX-5817-2023","Cobović, Maja Vretenar/0000-0002-7225-147X; Cobovic, Mirko/0000-0001-7104-3321",,,,,5,0,0,1,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,290,298,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500026,0

In particular, it aimed at verifying whether environmental actions reveal different models with respect to implementation of sustainability and at analyzing the relationship between environmental strategies and specific POs' characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - The work is based on a field survey carried out by submitting a questionnaire to POs. Collected data were processed by means of exploratory data and multivariate analysis techniques. A cluster analysis was used to classify POs with respect to their ability/will to translate views into sustainability actions. Findings - Three different groups were identified with reference to the involvement in ethical and environmental actions. Results show that POs' strategies often include interlinked economic and environmental objectives. In particular, product quality improvement often goes with the promotion of environmentally friendly techniques, while other environmental actions respond to a reduction costs rather than to a sustainability strategy. Research limitations/implications - Only 38 out of 300 POs returned the questionnaire. Because of the small sample, the analysis has only an exploratory nature and aims at giving a first insight on how sustainability issues are intended and implemented in the agri-food sector. Originality/value - Most works have analyzed environmental strategies at the company level. This study focused on POs in the agri-food sector as they can also represent the drivers of a sustainability pattern involving their members.","[Coppola, Adele] Univ Naples Federico II, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Dept Agr Sci, Naples, Italy; [Ianuario, Sara] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Coppola, A (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Dept Agr Sci, Naples, Italy.",coppola@unina.it,"Coppola, Adele/AAV-6741-2021","Coppola, Adele/0000-0002-9201-7859",,,,,50,17,19,0,14,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

In particular, the authors implement an information campaign aiming to increase consumers' awareness of the food waste problem. Design/methodology/approach - In the period of three weeks, the authors observe intentions to prevent food waste and actual food waste of the consumers in a university restaurant serving ready meals. During the intervention period, consumers are exposed to an information campaign, designed to avoid consumers' insufficient planning problem. Findings - Consumers are willing to pay the same price for less food more often during the campaign than before the campaign, but the approximated impact on the food waste is not significant. Social emotions of guilt and shame are linked to consumers' intentions to prevent food waste, suggesting channels to be included in a successful information campaign nudging consumers toward food waste reduction. Research limitations/implications - The authors were not able to measure precisely food waste, but observed consumers in a real-life context. Consumers were not aware of the study, and made daily purchase decisions before and after the information campaign. Social implications - Consumer behavior is at the core of the food waste problem in developed countries. It is important to understand how consumers can be nudged at low cost, using an information campaign, to change their attitude to food waste, and to decrease food waste. Originality/value - The authors collected an original dataset on the impact of an information campaign, observing behavior of consumers in a real-life context.","[Jagau, Henrik Luis; Vyrastekova, Jana] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Jagau, Henrik Luis] Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozent, Hannover, Germany",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Vyrastekova, J (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",J.Vyrastekova@fm.ru.nl,,"Vyrastekova, Jana/0000-0003-4233-2962","Department of Economics of the Faculty of Management Science, Radboud University","Department of Economics of the Faculty of Management Science, Radboud University","The authors would like to thank to Thomas Dirkmaat from the Behavioural Insights Team of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, The Netherlands, members of this team and three anonymous reviewers for comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

To test these hypotheses, an online survey was used. The dependent variables related to the quality of life (QL) were measured by our adaptation (Appendix 1) of the original version of the questionnaire QL by Maria StrasRomanowska, Anna Oleszkowicz, Tomasz Frackowiak (2012) For comparison and external quality assurance, quality of life was correlated with the life satisfaction measured by the Questionnaire of Life Satisfaction (LS), in a similar research context, adapted by Kowal, Maekioe, and Gochhait (2017) from Anke and Fugl-Meyer (2003) (Appendix 2). In order to measure the independent variables of job satisfaction, the adaptation of the Job Satisfaction Questionnaire was used (Kowal and Roztocki 2015, based on the Vitell and Davis questionnaire, 1990) (Appendix 3). The questionnaire has been translated from English into Polish and adapted to Polish cultural conditions (Kowal and Keplinger, 2015; Peneva, Yordzhev, and Ali, 2013). Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, point estimation, interval estimation, statistical hypothesis verification, and multivariate analysis. For multivariate analysis such as multiple regression analysis, factor analysis and modeling of the structural equation's variables were standardized ( Bagozzi, 2012). The analyzes were performed using statistical software STATISTICA 12. From December 2015 to May 2017, a survey of 420 IT users from regional small enterprises in Lower Silesia was conducted. The sample was selected by a network-interpersonal random sampling, in combination with sequential random sampling and passive experiment planning methods (Kowal, 2002, 2003; Kowal and Weglowska-Rzepa, 2006). Our main findings in this preliminary study are as follows that satisfaction from work has an impact on the quality of life of IT users. Dimensions of job satisfaction affect the quality of life of IT users. The results of the adaptation of the quality of life questionnaire correlate with the results for the original tool and with the adapted version of the satisfaction questionnaire from the living areas (Anke and Fugl-Meyer, 2003). Job satisfaction seems to be related to the overall life satisfaction of IT users in transition economies, but especially with job satisfaction (Kowal and Roztocki, 2015). However, employees are more happy, more satisfied with the internal quality of life than with a job. Many IT users feel that their compensation level and promotion opportunities are inadequate for competency they possess. A possible explanation could be seen in the existing compensation structures in many Polish companies. Frequently, in Polish companies, it may be difficult to offer competitive compensations for a small group of talented IT users. Sometimes the lack of life satisfaction may be due substantial differentials in income between Poland and more mature economies in the EU (Kowal and Roztocki, 2015). For example, in 2017, the average monthly salary in Poland in the end of 2017 was about Polish 4255,59 PLN (Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS) 2017), which is approximately 1019, 30 EURO, while the average salary in EU as of 2017 stands at EUR 1,520 monthly (https://www.reinisfischer.com/average-salary-european-union-2017 much). Moreover, a large number of newly-graduated IT users seeking jobs may depress the salary level for the whole group. This imbalance between a large number of IT professionals seeking jobs and relatively small number of job openings is typical for the job markets of many transition economies. The results of our research in progress contribute to the development of human capital in the sector of IT, especially in creating new motivation systems including IT users needs. The special meaning has novel Polish adaptations of tools like LS and QL useful not only for Polish labor market but for individual and social life.","[Kowal, Jolanta; Oleszkowicz, Anna; Stras-Romanowska, Maria] Univ Wroclaw, Inst Psychol, Wroclaw, Poland",University of Wroclaw,"Kowal, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wroclaw, Inst Psychol, Wroclaw, Poland.",jolanta.kowal@uwr.edu.pl; anna.oleszkowicz@uwr.edu.pl; maria.stras-romanowska@uwr.edu.pl,"Yordzhev, Krasimir/F-2628-2014","Yordzhev, Krasimir/0000-0002-0432-8025",,,,,12,0,0,0,1,UNIV WROCLAW,WROCLAW,"PL UNIWERSYTECKI 1, WROCLAW, 50-137, POLAND",,,978-83-64389-64-1,ICT MAN GLO COM EC G,,,2017,,,,,,,472,479,,,,,,8,Development Studies; Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BP9OZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000570154500042,0

Man built this type of structure in unison with nature, but he built it in accordance to the general social, economic and cultural conditions. Usually such structures are located near or in the vineyard, are small in size, embedded in the landscape and represent traditional architectural heritage. A relatively large number of traditional wine architecture is still preserved in Croatia, yet only a tiny fraction of it has been protected as cultural goods. Although traditional wine architecture is an important element of regional cultural landscape, its survival is not economically profitable unless it is given a new function and purpose. Given the noticeable trend of intensive abandoning and/or devastation of traditional wine architecture in the last three decades under the pressure of globalisation, this research focuses on understanding and interpreting traditional wine architecture for the needs of sustainable development. The starting point of this paper is that traditional wine architecture as heritage can be a factor of revitalization of wine regions. The goal of the paper is, through field trips and scientific literature analysis, to determine the factors, characteristics and values of traditional wine architecture as heritage in so that it can be characterised as a resource in the preparation of wine region development plans. Since traditional wine architecture is regionally recognizable, it should be considered on the level of wine regions and its destiny should be tied to integral development plans. By understanding and recognizing the integral importance of heritage on the regional level, it can be shaped into an authentic and original tourism product and contribute to the recognisability and revitalization of wine regions.","[Kranjcevic, Jasenka] Inst Tourism, Vrhovec 5, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute for Tourism - Croatia,"Kranjcevic, J (通讯作者)，Inst Tourism, Vrhovec 5, Zagreb, Croatia.",jasenka.kranjcevic@iztzg.hr,,,Croatian Science Foundation [HERU-2032],Croatian Science Foundation,"This research is a part of the scientific project Heritage Urbanism (HERU) - Urban and Spatial Models for Revival and Enhancement of Cultural Heritage (HERU-2032) financed by Croatian Science Foundation, which is being carried out at the Faculty of Architecture University of Zagreb.",,13,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,844,852,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500081,0

This has led to the development of theories that incorporate bounded rationality and also to the study of the role of information in economic interactions ( information economics). In particular, information asymmetry, where all the agents do not have access to the same information has aroused much attention, as it has potential to significantly distort economic outcomes resulting in the failure of the market mechanism. It is often assumed that having more data than others gives agents a relative advantage in their interactions. In this paper we consider the situation where agents differ in terms of the granularity (as well as the quantity) of the information that they can access. We investigate this in the framework of a model system comprising agents with bounded rationality competing for limited resources, viz., the minority game. We show that there is no simple relation between the amount of information available to an agent and its success as measured by payoffs received by it. In particular, an agent having access to a much coarser-grained information (that is also quantitatively less) than the rest of the population can have a relative advantage under certain conditions. Our work shows that the success of individual agents can depend crucially on the relative fraction of the population that uses information of a specific type.","[Kushal, Appilineni] Indian Inst Sci, CV Raman Rd, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Sasidevan, V.; Sinha, Sitahhra] Inst Math Sci, CIT Campus, Madras 600113, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore; Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc) India,"Kushal, A (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Sci, CV Raman Rd, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",akushalstar@gmail.com; sasidevan@imsc.res.in; sitabhra@imsc.res.in,,,"IMSc Econophysics project (XII Plan) - Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India","IMSc Econophysics project (XII Plan) - Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India","This work was supported in part by the IMSc Econophysics project (XII Plan) funded by the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.",,15,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-47705-3; 978-3-319-47704-6,NEW ECON WINDOWS,,,2017,,,,,,,113,123,,10.1007/978-3-319-47705-3_8,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Sociology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences; Sociology,BI7KJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414315200008,0

Depending on the type of production and the output of the production cycle, the production process can vary from several months to over a year. Due to the duration of the production process, cash conversion cycle can fluctuate considerably, which means that the availability of cash funds differs among companies, as well as their cash funds needs. Cash gap shows the difference in the number of days from the purchase of inputs necessary for the realization of the production process and number of days needed to collect trade receivables from the sales of finished products. Longer cash gap means that more of the company's funds are tied up in the components of working capital, respectively, in inventories and in trade receivables. Greater part of the money tied up in inventory and accounts receivable can lead to problems with liquidity and subsequently can lead to insolvency. The liquidity of the company shows the availability of company to settle its liabilities. In order to determine the relationship between the cash gap and the liquidity of the company, large and medium-sized companies in the manufacturing industry in the Republic of Croatia is analysed. Cash gap is calculated in a way that the from the sum of the number of days the cash is in inventories and number of days to collect receivables, the number of days to settle payables will be deducted. Quick ratio and current ratio are used as indicators of liquidity. The research is conducted for the period from 2010 to 2015, and the research results show that there is a medium strong positive correlation between cash gap and liquidity rations in the medium-sized and large sized companies from the manufacturing industry in Croatia for the period observed, but this correlation is not statistically significant.","[Percevic, Hrvoje; Hladika, Mirjana; Micin, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Percevic, H (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",hpercevic@efzg.hr; mhladika@efzg.hr; mmicin@efzg.hr,"Hladika, Mirjana/I-1152-2018; Mićin, Marina/H-8303-2018; Perčević, Hrvoje/JXR-7488-2024","Perčević, Hrvoje/0000-0001-9410-0755",,,,,15,0,0,0,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1125,1133,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500110,0

This study will helps the policy makers to understand the various ownership structures effect firms' R&D investment decisions in Chinese high-tech industry.","[Usman, Muhammad; Xiao, Shufang; Ashraf, Rana Umair; Lian, Fenni] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Usman, M (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",usman@bit.edu.cn,"Umair Ashraf, Rana/S-5085-2019","Umair Ashraf, Rana/0000-0002-0152-8419",,,,,18,2,2,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-0995-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ6EQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426596000059,0

Dry matter content is one of the key factors determining fruit quality, and is known to be substantially influenced by altering the salinity of the nutrient solution. While this imposed osmotic stress can improve fruit quality, this often goes hand in hand with a decrease in production due to less water accumulation in the fruit. A more thorough insight into the underlying mechanisms might contribute to a better understanding and eventually steering of this delicate balance. To achieve this deeper knowledge, we combined intensive monitoring of plant and fruit physiological variables with a model-based approach. An experiment on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Dirk') was set up in a greenhouse, where two different water treatments were imposed by altering the salinity (electric conductivity; EC) of the substrate. Besides plant variables such as sap flow, stem diameter variation and stem water potential, fruit growth and quality parameters were measured as well. These data were then used in a recently developed virtual tomato plant and fruit model that is capable of modelling both plant and fruit growth as well as fruit quality (sugars and acids) and xylem and phloem contribution to fruit growth, but which has not been tested under salt-stressed conditions. Results did not show only that the model can be used to predict fruit growth during salt-stress conditions, but also which model parameters and related plant traits are affected most. This is an important step towards a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms controlling fruit development under osmotic stress.","[Van de Wal, B. A. E.; Van de Put, H. A.

Design/methodology/approach - The pig farmer survey and the pork consumer survey were conducted in Funing County, Jiangsu Province, using the best-worst scaling (BWS) and a mixed logit model. Findings - The results showed that the designation of responsibility for ensuring pork quality and safety was of, in descending order, feed producers and suppliers, backyard farmers and farms of designated size, pork processing workshops and companies of and above designated size, slaughterhouses, supermarkets, farmer's markets, pig transporters, and consumers. Both pig farmers and pork consumers believed that those involved in the initial pork supply chain should take greater responsibility for pork quality and safety. Originality/value - Allocation of responsibilities across the entire pork industry chain was investigated from the perspective of pig farmers and pork consumers using the BWS and a mixed logit model.

We extend the sustainable livelihood framework to depict the complex relationship between rural livelihood portfolios and food security by (i) distinguishing between in-kind income and cash income from all important household activities, and (ii) considering protein and calorie intake along with anthropometric data to shed light on all four dimensions of food security. The analysis is based on survey data from 600 households in rural Cambodia. Our results underline the importance of fishing for food security across all income quartiles. Furthermore, we establish a positive connection between small-scale capture fishery and child anthropometrics. Against the background of potentially declining fish stocks we find that there are currently hardly any alternatives to fishing for poorer households, who are most dependent on capture fishery. We hence urge policy makers to support livelihood activities that supplement fishing income. This would help to enhance sustainable fish stock management, conserve natural resources and simultaneously prevent growing food insecurity.","[Hartje, Rebecca; Buehler, Dorothee; Grote, Ulrike] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Hartje, R (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",hartje@iuw.uni-hannover.de; buehler@iuw.uni-hannover.de; grote@iuw.uni-hannover.de,"Bühler, Dorothee/T-1130-2019","Grote, Ulrike/0000-0002-9073-6294",Institute of Environmental Economics and World Trade of the Faculty of Economics and Management of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universitat Hannover,Institute of Environmental Economics and World Trade of the Faculty of Economics and Management of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Universitat Hannover,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

A dynamic multi-species, multi-class, multi-fleet model is developed and calibrated using available biological, economic and environmental information for French fleets. Fishing and economic data have been collected within the European Data Collection Framework. Climate represented by the sea surface temperature is assumed to affect species recruitment. Three management strategies are compared in terms of bio-economic outcomes: the Status-Quo (SQ), a Multi-species Maximum Sustainable Yield (MMSY) strategy and a Multi-species Maximum Economic Yield (MMEY) strategy. These strategies are ranked with respect to two contrasted scenarios regarding the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) driving climate change. Results show that the SQ strategy is not sustainable and is characterized by a major decline of the key commercial species. By contrast, the MMSY strategy improves the ecological state and economic performance of the fishery. The MMEY strategy yields even greater bio-economic improvements. Bio-economic benefits are however altered by the effects of climate change. Under the MMEY strategy, fleets with more diversified catch structures perform better facing climate change.","[Lagarde, A.; Doyen, L.; Ahad-Cisse, A.] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GRETHA UMR 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France; [Gourguet, S.; Macher, C.; Thebaud, O.] Univ Brest, IFREMER, CNRS, UMR 6308,AMURE,Unite Econ Maritime,IUEM, F-29280 Plouzane, France; [Le Pape, O.] UMR ESE, Ecol & Sante Ecosyst, 65 Rue St Brieuc, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Caill-Milly, N.; Morandeau, G.] IFREMER, Lab Environm Ressources Arcachon, Equipe Anglet,FED MIRA 4155, Dept Oceanog & Dynam Ecosyst ODE,UFR Cete Basque, F-64600 Anglet, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux; Ifremer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); Ifremer,"Lagarde, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GRETHA UMR 5113, F-33608 Pessac, France.",adrien.lagarde@u-bordeaux.fr,"Thebaud, Olivier/D-9792-2011","Thebaud, Olivier/0000-0001-8665-3827; Doyen, Luc/0000-0001-8272-6187; Macher, Claire/0000-0001-9307-6562; CAILL-MILLY, Nathalie/0000-0001-5837-6105; Gourguet, Sophie/0000-0002-1565-4053; Le Pape, Olivier/0000-0002-7233-7951; Morandeau, Gilles/0000-0002-6909-8099","COTE LabEx, through the NAVIRE20 project (Cluster of Excellence COTE) [ANR-10-LABX-45]; GRETHA (CNRS-Univ. of Bordeaux); IRSTEA; IFREMER; Campus DoMar (Spain); network SEAVIEW21 [ANR-14-JPF1-0003]; ACROSS project [ANR-14-CE03-0001]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-JPF1-0003] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","COTE LabEx, through the NAVIRE20 project (Cluster of Excellence COTE); GRETHA (CNRS-Univ. of Bordeaux); IRSTEA; IFREMER; Campus DoMar (Spain); network SEAVIEW21; ACROSS project; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This work has been carried out with the financial support of COTE LabEx, through the NAVIRE20 project (Cluster of Excellence COTE, ANR-10-LABX-45) in association with GRETHA (CNRS-Univ. of Bordeaux), IRSTEA, IFREMER and Campus DoMar (Spain).

With mental health becoming an increasingly significant public health issue in China, empirical evidence of disparities in the use of mental health services can guide steps to reduce them. We conducted this study to inform China's on-going health-care reform through examining how health insurance might reduce rural-urban disparities in the utilization of mental health inpatient services in China. This retrospective study used 10years (2005-2014) of hospital electronic health records from the Shandong Center for Mental Health and the DaiZhuang Psychiatric Hospital, two major psychiatric hospitals in Shandong Province. Health insurance was measured using types of health insurance and the actual reimbursement ratio (RR). Utilization of mental health inpatient services was measured by hospitalization cost, length of stay (LOS), and frequency of hospitalization. We examined rural-urban disparities in the use of mental health services, as well as the role of health insurance in reducing such disparities. Hospitalization costs, LOS, and frequency of hospitalization were all found to be lower among rural than among urban inpatients. Having health insurance and benefiting from a relatively high RR were found to be significantly associated with a greater utilization of inpatient services, among both urban and rural residents. In addition, an increase in the RR was found to be significantly associated with an increase in the use of mental health services among rural patients. Consistent with the existing literature, our study suggests that increasing insurance schemes' reimbursement levels could lead to substantial increases in the use of mental health inpatient services among rural patients, and a reduction in rural-urban disparities in service utilization. In order to promote mental health care and reduce rural-urban disparities in its utilization in China, improving rural health insurance coverage (e.g., reducing the coinsurance rate) would be a powerful policy instrument.","[Xu, Junfang] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Med, Res Ctr Publ Hlth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jian] Shandong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Adm, Ctr Hlth Econ Expt & Publ Policy, 44 Wen Hua Xi Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [King, Madeleine] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ruiyun; Xing, Jinshui; Su, Lei] Shandong Ctr Mental Hlth, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Fenghua] Shandong Hlth & Family Planning Commiss, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Mingshan] Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB, Canada",Tsinghua University; Shandong University; Tsinghua University; University of Calgary,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Adm, Ctr Hlth Econ Expt & Publ Policy, 44 Wen Hua Xi Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",wangjiannan@sdu.edu.cn,"Wang, Jian/AAI-6424-2021","Wang, Jian/0000-0001-8769-7928",Department of Health in Shandong [2013WS0152] Funding Source: Medline,Department of Health in Shandong,,,49,38,40,3,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

A growth accounting approach is used to decompose a pollution-adjusted measure of output growth into the contributions of labour, produced capital and natural capital. These indicators allow the sources of economic growth, and its long run sustainability, to be better assessed. Results presented here cover OECD and G20 countries for the 1990-2013 period, and account for the extraction of subsoil natural assets and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The main findings suggest that growth in OECD countries has been generated almost exclusively through productivity gains, while BRIICS countries have drawn largely on increased utilisation of factor inputs to generate additional growth. Regarding natural capital, in countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile, reliance on subsoil assets extraction has contributed to a significant share of income growth. Results also point to a shift towards more environmentally friendly production processes in many countries. In fact, most OECD countries have decreased their emissions over the last two decades, and these pollution abatement efforts result in an upward adjustment of their GDP growth rates, allowing for a more accurate assessment of their economic performance.","[Rodriguez, Miguel Cardenas; Hascic, Ivan; Souchier, Martin] OECD, Environm Directorate, Paris, France; [Souchier, Martin] Ecole Polytech, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Rodríguez, MC (通讯作者)，OECD, Environm Directorate, Paris, France.",miguel.cardenasrodriguez@oecd.org,,,,,,,16,34,36,4,33,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

One of the better known monetary alternatives to GDP is the ISEW, a synthetic proxy of sustainable welfare. Theoretical and methodological limitations of this indicator have been identified and several refinements or extensions proposed, GPI for example. Building on these approaches, this article presents a new composite flow-oriented indicator directly comparable with GDP. The proposed Sustainable Welfare Index (SWI) is calculated for the Italian case over the 1960-2014 period. The estimate of SWI over an extended period of fifty-four years, provides evidence for a previously undetected threshold effect in Italy by means of a flow-oriented indicator - unlike GDP, SWI per capita stops increasing in 1991. Empirical results show that the level of sustainable welfare in Italy stops growing mainly because of a rise in income inequality, a decline in non-paid domestic work and a worsening of the net fixed capital formation and net international investment position.","[Armiento, Mirko] Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Armiento, M (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",mirko.armiento@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,61,9,12,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

A valuable and straightforward approach is to integrate an ecosystem services assessment in a cost-effectiveness analysis as method to evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of several management scenarios to reach one or more objectives and take into account the potential effects on other ecosystem functions and services. Nevertheless, this method is not commonly used in ecosystem management evaluation but can provide an alternative for the frequently used but often contested cost-benefit analysis (which requires the step of assigning a monetary value to each benefit). The aim of this study is to apply the cost-effectiveness analysis in combination with an ecosystem services assessment on a real case-study (comparing alternative management strategies for estuaries) to derive lessons learned to go from theory to practice. The application of this method for the case-study reveals many remaining challenges such as data availability and knowledge to assess ecosystem effects of management measures. Nevertheless, the analysis demonstrates that this method can be used for making a more integrated evaluation and supporting better-informed management decisions.","[Boerema, A.; Meire, P.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Ecosyst Management Res Grp ECOBE, Antwerp, Belgium; [Van Passel, S.] Univ Antwerp, Fac Appl Econ, Dept Engn Management, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp; University of Antwerp,"Boerema, A (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Univ Pl 1 C131, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium.",annelies.boerema@uantwerpen.be,"Boerema, Annelies/N-4660-2019","Boerema, Annelies/0000-0001-5094-733X; Van Passel, Steven/0000-0002-6971-9246",,,,,55,9,11,1,64,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

We investigate two different nudge treatments: a nudge with information and pictures showing environmental and health damages that are presumably caused by breaching the minimum-distance-to-water rule, and a nudge with an additional social comparison suggesting that the majority of farmers in the same region comply with the rule. Three core experimental outcomes are observed: first, nudging has a preventive effect and reduces not only the share of noncompliant participants, but also the total area that is illicitly fertilised. Second, against all expectations, the preventive effect of the nudge with an additional social comparison is not stronger than that of the nudge with information and pictures alone. Third, despite the overall positive effects of nudging, the nudge with social comparison even increased the severity of non-complying behaviour in the deviant subpopulation.","[Peth, Denise; Musshoff, Oliver] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Funke, Katja; Hirschauer, Norbert] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Inst Agr & Nutr Sci, Karl Freiherr von Fritsch Str 4, D-06120 Halle, Saale, Germany",University of Gottingen; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Peth, D (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",denise.peth@agr.uni-goettingen.de; ooliver.musshoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de; katja.funke@landw.uni-halle.de; nnorbert.hirschauer@landw.uni-halle.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X; Hirschauer, Norbert/0000-0001-6027-8889",Centre for Statistics of the University of Gottingen; German Research Foundation (DFG),Centre for Statistics of the University of Gottingen; German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees and the editor for helpful comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

The aim of this paper is to figure out how competitiveness across primary sectors, i.e. sector A, bio-based agriculture, forestry and fishing, and sector B, non-bio-based mining and quarrying, is distributed across geographical regions and how it changes over time. A constant market share analysis based upon sectoral output data (2000-2014) shows that competition for market share was significantly lower in sector A than in sector B across 43 countries and one rest of the world country group (ROW), consisting mainly of smaller non-European economies. As a long-term trend, ROW gained market share in both sectors but with a much higher magnitude in sector B, from Europe, the USA, China and other countries. At times when world growth was negative or near zero (2009 and around 2013), ROW substantially lost market share in sector B with respect to the other regions mentioned.","[Asada, Raphael; Stern, Tobias] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Asada, R (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",raphael.asada@uni-graz.at; tobias.stern@uni-graz.at,"Stern, Tobias/V-9665-2017","Stern, Tobias/0000-0003-2336-5910; Asada, Raphael/0000-0002-5431-6188",,,,,65,24,27,0,34,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Therefore, determining the ideal location is an important problem. This study provides a new direction for solving this problem by combining the contingent valuation (CV) method and nested partitions (NP) algorithm using siting of public arboretums as an example. First, consumers' willingness to pay for environmental facilities considering household characteristics and distance to both newly built and existing facilities are estimated using the CV method. In this process, consumers are divided into two groups (active and passive users), assuming they have different willingness to pay for the facilities. Then, using the results of the CV, the NP algorithm, a simulation-based discrete optimization technique, is constructed to efficiently identify optimal locations that maximize social benefit considering regional characteristics. The results of the proposed algorithm exceeded the performance of the benchmark case, and this study's findings can be used to aid decisions about complicated multiple facility locations. Moreover, visualized results are provided, which can be useful for local and central decision makers.","[Choi, Hyunhong; Koo, Yoonmo] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Gwanakro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Koo, Yoonmo] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Engn Practice, Gwanakro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Koo, Y (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Engn Practice, Gwanakro 1, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",hongchoi@snu.ac.kr; yyounmo@snu.ac.kr,"Choi, Hyunhong/V-7165-2019; Choi, Hyunhong/AAI-9763-2020","Choi, Hyunhong/0000-0003-2896-9051",Seoul National University; Korea Ministry of Environment as Climate Change Correspondence RD Program [2014001300001],"Seoul National University; Korea Ministry of Environment as Climate Change Correspondence RD Program(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by Research Resettlement Fund for the new faculty of Seoul National University, and the Korea Ministry of Environment as Climate Change Correspondence R&D Program (2014001300001).",,54,12,12,1,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Through this analysis, several empirical approaches to comparing international energy organizations are tried out. Direct comparison between IRENA other international energy organizations is found to be problematic as each organization is different and comparisons inevitably encounter apples and oranges type issues. The study finds that IRENA's niche in international renewable energy governance is not yet fully carved out, but that the organization's mandate and institutional structure, as well as recent international developments, indicate that it may grow rapidly in importance.","[Overland, Indra] Norwegian Inst Int Affairs, PB 8159 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway; [Reischl, Gunilla] Swedish Inst Int Affairs, POB 27035, S-10251 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Reischl, G (通讯作者)，Swedish Inst Int Affairs, POB 27035, S-10251 Stockholm, Sweden.",ino@nupi.no; Gunilla.reischl@ui.se,"Overland, Indra/AAY-6935-2021","Overland, Indra/0000-0002-5955-4759; Reischl, Gunilla/0000-0002-2927-9346",Swedish Energy Agency [38068-1]; Petrosam program of the Research Council of Norway,Swedish Energy Agency(Swedish Energy Agency); Petrosam program of the Research Council of Norway,"Funding was provided by the Swedish Energy Agency (Grant No. 38068-1) and the Russcasp project, which is financed by the Petrosam program of the Research Council of Norway.",,48,12,15,6,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

We develop a cliometric analysis of the debt-growth nexus using novel time series methods. We find some support for a negative relationship between both variables, but no clear evidence of a debt threshold. The estimated long-run elasticity in a one-break model shows a tendency to decrease over time from a nonsignificant 0.011 to a -0.070, indicating that a 10 percentage increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with 0.70 percentage points lower real economic growth. Indeed, we find for the first subsample (1851-1939) either decoupling or saturation, while in the second subsample (1940-2000) the long-run elasticity coefficient becomes negative and significant. When we extend our analysis up to 2013, we find a break in 1971 coinciding with the twilight of Franco's dictatorship and the Spanish transition to democracy.","[Esteve, Vicente; Tamarit, Cecilio] Univ Valencia, INTECO Joint Res Unit, Ave Dels Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Esteve, Vicente] Univ Alcala, Alcala De Henares, Spain",University of Valencia; Universidad de Alcala,"Tamarit, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, INTECO Joint Res Unit, Ave Dels Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",cecilio.tamarit@uv.es,"Esteve, Vicente/B-1507-2010; Tamarit, Cecilio/N-2017-2019; Tamarit, Cecilio/A-8178-2010","Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882; Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882",FUNCAS; MINECO [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; GV [PROMETEOII/2014/053]; European Commission [542434-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL],FUNCAS; MINECO(Spanish Government); GV; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors acknowledge support from FUNCAS, MINECO (Project ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R), and GV (Project PROMETEOII/2014/053).

In a similar vein, the new global agreement on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls for the harmonization of economic and environmental goals. To shed light on the relationship between the economy and natural resources, our research investigates the case of the Philippines, employing a material flow accounting approach based on national statistical sources. We analyze domestic extraction, trade of materials and economic development from 1980 to 2014. We also explore differences between territorial (production) and footprint (consumption) accounts. We find that the Philippine economy managed to grow while reducing material intensity because of an increasing share of services sector activities. From net resource trade dependence in the 1980s, the Philippines become a net resource provider in 2014 because of increased extraction and exports of metal ores. Overall, the material requirements grew over the past two decades at lower rate than GDP, signifying relative decoupling. The new data and indicators we present are aimed to inform the national policy agenda. They may help to formulate policies that integrate economic and environmental priorities and guide the Philippines towards achieving the SDGs.","[Martinico-Perez, Marianne Faith G.; Schandl, Heinz; Tanikawa, Hiroki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Schandl, Heinz] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Fishman, Tomer] Yale Univ, Ctr Ind Ecol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Nagoya University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Yale University,"Martinico-Perez, MFG (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",marianne@nagoya-u.jp,"Tanikawa, Hiroki/G-8033-2012; Schandl, Heinz/C-5055-2008; Fishman, Tomer/C-9772-2015","Schandl, Heinz/0000-0001-6399-4231; Fishman, Tomer/0000-0003-4405-2382","Policy Study for Green Economy, and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [2-1711, 3K163011]","Policy Study for Green Economy, and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan","This research was financially supported by Policy Study for Green Economy, and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1711, 3K163011) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.

We present a field experiment that integrates an economic auction and a biophysical water flux model to develop a local market process consisting of both the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, we operate an auction with small-scale livestock owners who bid for contracts to implement site-specific manure management practices that reduce phosphorus loadings to a major reservoir. On the demand side, we implement a real money, multi-unit public good auction for these contracts with residents who potentially benefit from reduced water quality risks. The experiments allow us to construct supply and demand curves to find an equilibrium price for water quality improvement. The field experiments provide a proof-of-concept for practical implementation of a local market for environmental improvements, even for the challenging context of nonpoint pollution.","[Uchida, Emi; Opaluch, James; Kafle, Achyut; Merrill, Nathaniel H.; Michaud, Clayton; Gill, Carrie Anne] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Swallow, Stephen K.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Swallow, Stephen K.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Gold, Arthur J.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Nat Resources Sci, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Merrill, Nathaniel H.] US EPA, Atlantic Ecol Div, 27 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA",University of Rhode Island; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; University of Rhode Island; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Uchida, E (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.;Uchida, E (通讯作者)，216 Coastal Inst, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",euchida@uri.edu,,"Kafle, Achyut/0000-0002-8464-0966","USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2010-65615-20669, Hatch 1006050]; University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute; University of Connecticut (UConn) AES [CONS00971]; UConn's DelFavero Faculty Fellowship",USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute; University of Connecticut (UConn) AES; UConn's DelFavero Faculty Fellowship,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the funding for this project from USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (Grant # 2010-65615-20669 and Hatch 1006050), University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute, the University of Connecticut (UConn) AES (#CONS00971) and UConn's DelFavero Faculty Fellowship.

Agri-environment schemes implemented under the Common Agricultural Policy have addressed this problem, with recent proposals advocating direct support to HNV farming systems. However, research is lacking on the economics of HNV farming, which makes it difficult to set the level and type of support that ensure its sustainability. In this paper, we focused on a Special Protection Area for steppe bird conservation, analysing how economic incentives, biophysical and structural features govern the choice of fanning system. We found that persistence of the traditional farming system important for steppe birds was associated with economic incentives, resistance to change, and good quality soils, whereas a shift to specialised livestock production systems was favoured by higher rainfall and less fragmented farms. A supply curve built using the choice model predicted that the proportion of traditional farming increased from 20% to 80% of the landscape, when economic incentives increased from about 100(sic)/ha to 160(sic)/ha. Overall, our study highlights the dependence of HNV farming systems on economic incentives, and provides a framework to assess the effects of alternative policy and market scenarios to sustain farmland landscapes promoting biodiversity conservation.","[Ribeiro, Paulo Flores; Santos, Jose Lima] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, CEF, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Nunes, Luis Catela] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Beja, Pedro; Reino, Luis; Santana, Joana; Moreira, Francisco] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBio, Campus Agr Vairao, Vairao, Portugal; [Beja, Pedro; Reino, Luis; Santana, Joana; Moreira, Francisco] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Ctr Ecol Aplicade Prof Baeta Neves, CEABN InBio, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Lisboa,"Ribeiro, PF (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, CEF, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal.",pfribeiro@isa.ulisboa.pt; lcnunes@novasbe.pt; pbeja@cibio.up.pt; luis.reino@cibio.up.pt; joanafsantana@cibio.up.pt; fmoreira@isa.ulisboa.pt; jlsantos@isa.ulisboa.pt,"Beja, Pedro/A-7851-2008; Santana, Joana Figueiredo/C-5941-2009; Moreira, Francisco/B-2873-2008; Flores Ribeiro, Paulo/L-7139-2013; Reino, Luis/A-9261-2008; Catela Nunes, Luis/G-1989-2011","Beja, Pedro/0000-0001-8164-0760; Santana, Joana Figueiredo/0000-0002-4100-8012; Moreira, Francisco/0000-0003-4393-8018; Flores Ribeiro, Paulo/0000-0003-2648-1888; Reino, Luis/0000-0002-9768-1097; Catela Nunes, Luis/0000-0001-8115-6223","Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016664 (PTDC/AAG-REC/5007/2014)]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), under FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE [PTDC/AGR-AAM/102300/2008 (FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-008701), PTDC/BIA-BIC/2203/2012 (FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-028289)]; National Funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/87530/2012, SFRH/BD/63566/2009]; Portuguese Ministry of Education and Science; European Social Fund, through FCT, under POPH - QREN - Typology 4.1 [SFRH/BPD/62865/2009, SFRH/BPD/93079/2013]; EDP Biodiversity Chair; REN Biodiversity Chair; FCT [IF/01053/2015]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/63566/2009, SFRH/BD/87530/2012, SFRH/BPD/62865/2009] Funding Source: FCT","Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), under FEDER funds through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE; National Funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Portuguese Ministry of Education and Science(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); European Social Fund, through FCT, under POPH - QREN - Typology 4.1; EDP Biodiversity Chair; REN Biodiversity Chair; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This study was funded by project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016664 (PTDC/AAG-REC/5007/2014), supported by Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

Using appropriate testing procedures and a panel dataset of > 1000 households over 11 years in two primary provinces, we found evidence of self-selection in household behavior of generating off-farm income. But the hypothesis was rejected that there was a significant self-selection component in households' decision to participate in the program and generate farming income. Evaluations ignoring the self-section for off-farm labor were found to be biased and overly positive on program income impact.

Geometric Brownian motion has been shown to be a valid model for an endangered species (Dennis et al. 1991). This paper argues that an endangered species should be viewed as a quasi-public good and shows how real option theory can be used to determine the optimal timing of a conservation intervention that might prevent extinction. When a species goes extinct we assume society incurs a biodiversity loss, that can be measured in dollars. Regret is the interest cost on that loss. Social anxiety increases toward regret as the population of an endangered species declines toward extinction. The complete model requires information on (1) the drift and standard deviation rates before and after the conservation intervention, (2) the social cost (anxiety) from endangerment, (3) the fixed and variable costs of the conservation intervention, and (4) the social rate of discount. The model is illustrated with data on the captive breeding program for the California condor.","[Conrad, Jon M.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, SC Johnson Coll Business, 409 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Conrad, JM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, SC Johnson Coll Business, 409 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jmc16@cornell.edu,,,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1522054] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,20,12,13,2,59,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Design/methodology/approach Using a snowballing technique, 26 cabin crew, managers, supervisors and trainers participated in in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Summative content analysis was used to evaluate the data. Findings In total, 26 respondents from 20 international airlines participated in the study. All respondents agreed that evaluating cabin crew food safety/hygiene issues is important in relation to in-flight food handling; for example, Training evaluation helps in the improvement of the future training; We have an end of course feedback form, either done electronically or on paper and that looks at how the delegates felt the training went, if they came away learning something new, if the environment for learning was right, all sorts of things; the questionnaire is quite comprehensive; and Every trainee is given a feedback form to complete. However, significant failures in food safety training and its evaluation were identified. Research limitations/implications The evaluation of cabin crew food safety training shows that it is ineffective in some aspects, including learning achieved and behavioural change, and these can directly impact on the implementation of food safety practices. Evaluation failures may be due to the lack of available time in relation to other cabin crew roles. Further research may consider using a larger sample size, evaluating training effectiveness using social cognition models and assessments of airline and cabin crew food safety culture. Originality/value This is the first study that evaluates cabin crew food safety training using the Kirkpatrick model. The findings provide an understanding of the current evaluation of cabin crew food safety training and can be used by airlines for improving and developing effective future food safety training programmes. This, in turn, may reduce the risk of passenger and crew foodborne disease.","[Abdelhakim, Ayman Safi; Hewedi, Mahmoud] Fayoum Univ, Fac Tourism & Hotels, Dept Hotel Studies, Al Fayyum, Egypt; [Abdelhakim, Ayman Safi; Jones, Eleri] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Management, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Redmond, Elizabeth C.] Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Food Ind Ctr Zero2Five, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Griffith, Christopher J.] Broadmayne Consulting, Dorchester, England",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Fayoum University; Cardiff Metropolitan University; Cardiff Metropolitan University,"Abdelhakim, AS (通讯作者)，Fayoum Univ, Fac Tourism & Hotels, Dept Hotel Studies, Al Fayyum, Egypt.;Abdelhakim, AS (通讯作者)，Cardiff Metropolitan Univ, Cardiff Sch Management, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",asf01@fayoum.edu.eg,"Redmond, Elizabeth/ACG-1736-2022","Redmond, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8251-3763; Hewedi, Mahmoud/0000-0001-7312-5515; Abdelhakim, Ayman/0000-0002-6907-4329",,,,,76,5,8,3,23,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The input data are quarterly in nature and have been seasonally adjusted. For determining the cointegration relationship, it is possible to proceed with the Engle-Granger test, which is meant to determine the long-term relationship between the effectiveness of the monetary policy between the monetary aggregates M3 and GDP and the relationship between M3 and CPI in the Czech Republic and Switzerland. On the basis of these tests, it was found that there is no cointegration relationship between any time series at a level of significance of 0.05; this means that no long-term relationship was found between the M3 and GDP and also for M3 and CPI.

The usefulness of models is circumscribed given that: (1) market failure is inherent in healthcare and (2) models oversimplify the preference structure underlying choices. We suggest, however, that models which employ the ceteris paribus clause can be useful in order to isolate factors that play a role in healthcare decision-making and ultimately characterize agents' multiattribute utility functions through discrete choice experiments.

Ecotourists cover a broad spectrum of travelers more and more motivated to experience, being interested in the natural environment of the places they visit, as well as in learning about local communities. They are especially attracted to rural areas where there is a mix of traditional landscapes and villages. They are in a constant search for various experiences that can not be ensured through holidays for mass tourism.

The first part of the paper asks the question how a convincing conceptualization of commons could look like. Despite of the increased attention to the concept of the commons.different notions thereof exist. Ostrom and her colleagues often define commons as common pool resources, a specific type of good. The underlying classification is based on different degrees of excludability and subtractability. In the paper this is criticized for disregarding the importance of the social processes at hand. It is argued that instead of being a type of good, commons need to be conceptualized taking the relevant social dimensions into account. Commons are hence conceptualized as the social form of (tangible and/or intangible) matter that is determined by commoning. Commoning creates commons. In the second part the social practices of commoning are argued to be voluntary and inclusively self-organized activities and mediation of peers who aim at satisfying needs. The abstractness of the proposed conceptualization allows to aim at the core of the practices, at finding a way to find the common characteristics or dimensions of these practices, without defining away their ever specific way of being and becoming in the concrete.

The abstract nature of this education model leads to a focus that typically prioritizes formal or technical design exploration and de-emphasizes the role of the user. While Universal Design centers human bodies within design practice, the broad and often vague ambition of universality is difficult for students to engage within an academic context. We argue that approaching Universal Design through the lens of human age emphasizes the physical, sensorial, and cognitive modes of spatial understanding of the young and old and offers a focused perspective through which to address difference and diversity in architectural education. In this paper we outline a pedagogical approach that prioritizes human embodiments, over physical bodies, and integrates empathic understanding as critical to an inclusive, human-centered design methodology. We will discuss how the approach emerged from design seminars and studios taught in the Department of Architecture at the University at Buffalo and was tested through exercises that challenged students to research, empathize with, and ultimately design for the specific needs, abilities, and desires of individuals at the limits of human age.","[Gunawan, Sarah; Jamrozik, Julia] SUNY Buffalo, Sch Architecture & Planning, Hayes Hall,South Campus Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Gunawan, S (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Sch Architecture & Planning, Hayes Hall,South Campus Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA.",jamrozik@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,12,24,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-12,0.0,,,13,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371456.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100002,0

Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,500 participants from different gender, age, area of residence, income, marital status and education. They completed a questionnaire of six questions about demographics, and 26 questions related to knowledge and self-reported practices in terms of food handling, storage, usage of kitchen facilities and personal hygiene subgroups. SPSS v23 was used for statistical analyses. Student t-test and analysis of variance were conducted. Significance level of 0.05 was used. Findings On average, participants scored 55.616.3, 51.325.7, 67.4 +/- 19.3 and 89.1 +/- 16.3 on food handling, storage, usage of kitchen facilities and personal hygiene, respectively, whereas the passing (score above 50 percent) rates were 64.5, 69.9, 90.5 and 99.1, respectively, for the different subgroups. Gender had significant (p<0.05) effect on food handling and personal hygiene; age, marital status and education had significant (p<0.05) effect on handling, usage of kitchen facilities and personal hygiene; area of residence had significant (p<0.05) effect on storage, handling and usage of kitchen facilities; income had significant (p<0.05) effect on handling and usage of kitchen facilities. Overall mean food safety knowledge and self-reported practices score was 63.8 +/- 12.6; passing rate was 86.2; gender, age, area of residence, education, marital status and income had significant (p<0.05) effect. Food safety self-reported practices and knowledge scores were significantly (p<0.001) related to a weak to moderate correlation coefficient (R=0.34).

Design/methodology/approach Using data from the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey, the UK Food Standards Agency's Nutrient Profiling Model is used to classify the healthfulness of households' FAFH purchases. A double-hurdle model is estimated to identify determinants of households' decision to purchase healthy FAFH and the share of their FAFH expenditures and calories allocated to healthy items. Findings Households' acquisition of healthy FAFH varies with income, food assistance, FAFH purchase frequency, dieting, restaurant type, household composition, region and season. There is little difference in the impact of these factors on healthy FAFH expenditure shares vs calorie shares, suggesting that healthy FAFH expenditures proxy the contribution of healthy FAFH to a households' diet. Practical implications Results suggest that increased availability of healthy FAFH may need to be supplemented by targeted advertising and promotions, revisions to nutrition education programs, improved nutrition information transparency and value pricing in order to improve the dietary quality of households' FAFH acquisitions. Originality/value This study is the first to analyze household acquisition of healthy FAFH.","[Leschewski, Andrea M.] South Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA; [Weatherspoon, Dave D.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kuhns, Annemarie] USDA, Econ Res Serv, Food Econ Div, Washington, DC USA",South Dakota State University; Michigan State University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Leschewski, AM (通讯作者)，South Dakota State Univ, Dept Econ, Brookings, SD 57007 USA.",leschewski.andrea@gmail.com; weathe42@msu.edu; amkuhns@ers.usda.gov,,"Leschewski, Andrea/0000-0003-0376-6776",,,,,44,6,8,0,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

During the interview it transpired that CPB did not rely on its macroeconomic models, but on personal experience encapsulated in hand-made monitors, to observe the unfolding crisis; monitors that were, in Teulings' words, used to feel the pulse of the Dutch economy. I will take this metaphor as a cue to present several historical episodes in which models, numbers, and a certain feel for economic phenomena aimed to make CPB economists' research more precise. These episodes are linked with a story about vain attempts by CPB director Teulings to drive out the personal from economic forecasting. The crisis forced him to recognize that personal experience was more important in increasing the precision of economic forecasts than theoretical deepening. The crisis thus both challenged the belief in the supremacy of theory driven, computer-based forecasting, and helped foster the view that precision is inevitably linked to judgment, experience and observation, and not seated in increased attention to high theory; scientifically sound knowledge proved less useful than the technically unqualified experiential knowledge of quacks.","[Maas, Harro] Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Maas, H (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",0743-4154,,978-1-78756-423-7; 978-1-78756-424-4,RES HIST ECON THOUGH,,,2018,36.0,,B,,,,23,39,,10.1108/S0743-41542018000036B003,0.0,,,17,Economics; History Of Social Sciences; Philosophy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Philosophy,BQ3WW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000588194300003,0

The paper discusses an approach to modernity and its influence on profitability in agricultural cooperatives in Poland. Precisely, its purpose is to investigate the links between the income and the level of value and modernity of machinery and equipment, as well as the propensity to monitor and implement technological innovations in Polish agricultural cooperatives. The analysis is based on data collected by survey method from 28 APC operating in the opolskie voivodship the south-western region of Poland. It reveals a moderate willingness of Polish cooperatives to invest in agricultural machinery and equipment and to monitor and implement technological innovations. Simultaneously, it shows that the cooperative income does not depend on this willingness or on the cooperative members' opinion about modernity of machines used by them. However, it proves the existence of high positive correlation between the value of machinery and equipment and the income in cooperatives.","[Matyja, Malgorzata; Rajchelt-Zublewicz, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Matyja, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",malgorzata.matyja@ue.wroc.pl; magdalena.rajchelt@ue.wroc.pl,"Matyja, Małgorzata/R-9455-2018","Matyja, Małgorzata/0000-0002-2167-718X",,,,,15,0,0,0,5,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,66,74,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600006,0

The behavioral wave in the modern economy is the necessary component that is lacking in the conceptual and pragmatic management models concerning Bulgarian economic units. A new look at the status of Bulgarian companies is needed in order to identify the problematic areas of their management and organization as well as a critical assessment of the business practices in them, in order to draw out guidelines for the formation and improvement of micropolicies. Probably, there are some reasons for revealing the controversy about whether that new paradigm is a hidden form of liberal perceptions or a social engineering that leads to excessive constructivism. The goal of the authors, however, is not to be involved in this type of discussion that focuses on the clarification of more specific economic policies, but the impartial perception of what is adequate and relatively sufficient to explain the complex relational charge in the relationship rationality - irrationality, relative to the specific manifestation of corporate human capital. The practice shows that a significant role in the manifestation of corporate culture as well as its interaction with social capital in the context of corporate governance play the well-known socialutilitarianist rules but there are also irrational by definition components such as sympathy, antipathy, ambition, superiority, sense of urge, etc., which, although psychologically determined, prove to be prominent factors as in many cases they obstruct or even block the good and sensible management processes.","[Milanova, Adelina; Naydenova, Pavlinka] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Sofia, Bulgaria",Bulgarian Academy of Sciences,"Milanova, A (通讯作者)，Bulgarian Acad Sci, Sofia, Bulgaria.",nalidea@yahoo.com; p.ileva@iki.bas.bg,,,,,,,16,1,2,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,1,8,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540733700001,0

The goal of the research is to investigate the influence of higher education on the global and regional competitiveness, basing on the case study of Kazakhstan and as the country of the region of Central Asia. Since there is no unified approach how to measure the impact of higher education on the competitiveness of the country and regional level, the goal of this research is also to contribute in building a theoretical framework for the assessment of the influence of higher education on the competitiveness. The comparative study of the higher education and innovation indicators, using the framework of the Global Competitiveness Index, in performed for Kazakhstan in comparison with other Central Asia countries. In parallel, we discuss the influence of higher education reforms in Kazakhstan after joining the Bologna process on. Basing on our research, we can conclude that the reforms in higher education sector in Kazakhstan including the fast introduction the Bologna principles, as well as other government policy initiatives positively influenced the competitiveness of the Kazakhstan, giving the highest place in GCI among the Central Asian countries and leading to the entrance of 6 Kazakhstani universities in the first 1000 best universities worldwide according to the QS World University Ranking. In parallel, the recommendations for further development of the higher education sector are given. Key findings are relevant to the policy makers and managers for designing the development strategies for rising the competitiveness. For policy makers, the authors advise to use wider range of indictors. The indicators used in CGI for measuring impact of higher education on the competitiveness should be complemented with other indicators like employability or those indicators applied in university rankings. The influence of the reforms of the Bologna process on the global competitiveness needs further investigation.","[Revalde, Gita] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia; [Sagintayeva, Saule] Almaty Univ Power Engn & Telecommun, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Riga Technical University; Almaty University of Power Engineering & Telecommunications,"Revalde, G (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",Gita.Revalde@rtu.lv,"Revalde, Gita/HTN-7782-2023",,,,,,14,0,0,0,4,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-294-1,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2018,49.0,,,,,,402,410,,10.22616/ESRD.2018.159,0.0,,,9,Development Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO1ZQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503493500047,0

The model derives from previous research activities that identify strengths and weaknesses in strategic management process of SMEs and optimizes the whole process. The model is simulated on the example of selected SME based on restrictive criteria. The main research methods used in this paper are case study, personal interviewing, financial analyzing, modelling and simulating.

Considering key behaviours of food handlers that lead to norovirus transmission would help prevent the spread. The purpose of this paper is to examine the key risk behaviours of food handlers that lead to norovirus transmission, and to recognise important prevention strategies. Design/methodology/approach A narrative review of the literature summarising the main risk behaviours of food handlers that lead to norovirus transmission. Findings Suboptimal personal hygiene such as poor hand washing compliance, working while ill or returning to work too early and not adhering to cleaning and disinfecting protocols were the main risk behaviours of food handlers identified. To prevent the transmission of norovirus within UK food establishments, environmental barriers such as limited access to cleaning products and facilities, workload and pay concerns should be resolved, and a theory-based approach should be used when developing training programmes to improve food handlers' knowledge and behaviour. Systematic monitoring adhered to ensure food safety protocols should be regularly carried out. Research limitations/implications A limited number of qualitative studies assessing food handlers' attitudes and beliefs concerning norovirus transmission are available. Gaining more detailed and in-depth information on what food handlers perceive are the main barriers when it comes to adhering to food safety guidelines, would aid in the development of effective norovirus mitigation strategies. Originality/value This review discusses the main risk behaviours of food handlers associated with norovirus transmission. It highlights the need for more qualitative research on exploring the attitudes and beliefs of food handlers with regard to norovirus transmission.","[Watson, Sinead] Queens Univ Belfast, Inst Global Food Secur, Sch Biol Sci, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Gong, Yun Yun] Univ Leeds, Sch Food Sci & Nutr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Queens University Belfast; University of Leeds,"Gong, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Food Sci & Nutr, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",s.watson@qub.ac.uk; y.gong@leeds.ac.uk,"Watson, Sinead/GXH-8905-2022; Gong, Yun Yun/C-8412-2018; Gong, Yun Yun/L-7094-2016","Gong, Yun Yun/0000-0003-4927-5526",UK Food Standards Agency [FS101143],UK Food Standards Agency,"This research was part of a larger UK Food Standards Agency project, and has been published previously in a similar form within their report (Food handlers and Norovirus transmission: social science insights).

One common objective of location models has been to ensure maximal accessibility of sited facilities to demand populations. Accessibility evaluation in location models often assumes that trips originate from fixed locations (usually home) and are single purpose. These assumptions contradict the empirical evidence that suggests trips also commonly originate from non-home locations and may involve multiple stops. In this study, a new multi-objective location model is developed that extents the classic p-median problem (PMP) to account for a more realistic assessment of accessibility. Based on the individual accessibility assessment, notions of trip chaining and activity space are incorporated into the model development. In addition to fixed home locations, stops along chained trips are allowed for potential service site visits, and activity space is introduced as an additional dimension to evaluate accessibility of alternative opportunities.

We study three features that are specific to an international conservation agreement: the existence of a natural upper bound of conservation in each country, the importance of local benefits, and the subadditivity of the global conservation function. We consider asymmetries in benefits and costs of conservation and, separately, in the upper bound of conservation in each country, and we examine the impacts of these features on coalition stability and on the effectiveness of biodiversity agreements. Results show that subadditivity of the global conservation function can lead to larger stable coalitions. The inclusion of a transfer scheme that might be implemented through, e.g., international trade of biodiversity credits, can have an impact on coalition composition and can improve conservation outcomes and the size of stable coalitions in certain ranges of the parameter space.","[Alvarado-Quesada, Irene; Weikard, Hans-Peter] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Alvarado-Quesada, I (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",irene.alvaradoq@gmail.com; hans-peter.weikard@wur.nl,"Weikard, Hans-Peter/O-1120-2013","Weikard, Hans-Peter/0000-0002-5209-9845",,,,,51,13,13,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1567-9764,1573-1553,,INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P,Int.

The scope and extent of formalization are key indicators of success in cooperative activity between states. This paper argues that India and China have developed a form of preliminary cooperation through the sharing of water data to resolve disputes. However, the two countries have vested varying interests in the resolution mechanism. No substantial cooperation has been established to tackle conflict resolution and water resource management.

It covers four pre-unification Italian states (Sabaudian State, Florentine State, Kingdom of Naples and Republic of Venice) as well as other areas of Europe (Low Countries, Catalonia) during the period 1300-1800. Three different kinds of indicators are measured systematically and combined in the analysis: headcount indexes, the share of the top rich, and richness indexes. Taken together, they suggest that overall, during the entirety of the early modern period the rich tended to become both more prevalent and more distanced from the other strata of society. The only period during which the opposite process took place was the late Middle Ages, following the Black Death epidemic of the mid-fourteenth century. In the period from ca. 1500 to 1800, the prevalence of the rich doubled. In the Sabaudian State, the Florentine State and the Kingdom of Naples, for which reconstructions of regional wealth distributions exist, in about the same period the share of the top 10 % grew from 45-55 to 70-80 %-reaching almost exactly the same level which has recently been suggested as the European average at 1810. Consequently, the time series presented here might be used to add about five centuries of wealth inequality trends to current debates on very long-term changes in the relative position of the rich.","[Alfani, Guido] Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, Milan, MI, Italy; [Alfani, Guido] IGIER, Milan, MI, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Alfani, G (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dondena Ctr, Milan, MI, Italy.;Alfani, G (通讯作者)，IGIER, Milan, MI, Italy.",guido.alfani@unibocconi.it,"Alfani, Guido/AAF-6090-2020","ALFANI, GUIDO/0000-0001-5534-8694",,,,,56,23,23,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,SEP,2017,11.0,3,,,,,321,348,,10.1007/s11698-016-0151-8,0.0,,,28,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,FF3AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408767000003,0

The rapid market development and high economic growth also present an immense opportunity for the private insurance market. This paper uses the China Health and Nutrition Survey panel data and the difference-in-difference method to identify the causal effects of public health insurance expansion on private health insurance development in the case of expansion of the China Urban Residential Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) program. The paper finds private health insurance enrollment is not affected by the introduction and expansion of URBMI. Rather, private health insurance plays supplementary roles. The findings present the challenges and opportunities for public policies to develop and regulate private health insurance to meet the market niches and provide health insurance to the demands of a heterogeneous population. The findings also have broader implications for other developing nations where public health insurance intends to rapidly expand towards the universal health coverage.","[Hou, Xiaohui] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Zhang, Jing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",The World Bank; Renmin University of China,"Hou, XH (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",xhou@worldbank.org; zhangjingecon@gmail.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [13XNJ001],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"Part of the research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (13XNJ001).",,27,9,9,7,83,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

We examine two hypotheses regarding the role of income sorting and land-use conditions in shaping spatial inequality in Chinese cities, where residents have little direct influence on local public service provision. First, in the presence of resource indivisibility, travel cost, and location-based rationing, scarcity of public-service resources in a city makes access to public services more uneven across neighborhoods, thus exacerbating income sorting and spatial inequality in the city. Second, the exacerbating effect of resource scarcity is mitigated by land-use conditions that limit income sorting. Estimates of willingness to pay by households of different income levels for public-service resources across cities corroborate both the exacerbating effect of resource scarcity and the mitigating effect of inclusive land-use conditions.","[Sun, Weizeng] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weizeng; Zheng, Siqi] Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Sun, Weizeng] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yuming] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Zheng, Siqi] MIT, Ctr Real Estate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Jinan University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; National University of Singapore; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zheng, SQ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Zheng, SQ (通讯作者)，MIT, Ctr Real Estate, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",sunweizeng@gmail.com; yuming.fu@nus.edu.sg; zhengsiqi@gmail.com,"Fu, Yuming/C-1093-2008","Fu, Yuming/0000-0002-7219-3652","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273154, 71322307, 71533004]; national key research AMP; development (RD) plan [2016YFC0502804]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); national key research AMP; development (RD) plan,"We deeply appreciate anonymous referees for their insightful comments.

This unusual situation defies the common belief that the British climate provides abundant water resources and has prompted the regulatory authorities to impose bans on superfluous uses of water. Furthermore, a large percentage of households in England consume unmetered water which is detrimental to water saving efforts. Given this context, we estimate the shadow price of water using a panel data from reports published by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) for the period 1996 to 2010 (three regulatory periods). These shadow prices are derived from a parametric multi-output, multi-input, input distance function characterized by a translog technology. Following O'Donnell and Coelli (2005), we use a Bayesian econometric framework in order to impose regularity-monotonicity and curvature-conditions on a high-flexible technology. Consequently, our results can be interpreted at the firm level without requiring the need to base analysis on the averages. Our estimations offer guidance for regulation purposes and provide an assessment of how the water supply companies deal with water losses under each regulatory period. The relevance of the study is quite general as water scarcity is a problem that will become more important with population growth and the impact of climate change.","[Brea-Solis, Humberto] Univ Cote Azur, SKEMA, Lille, France; [Perelman, Sergio] Univ Liege ULg, HEC Management Sch, Liege, Belgium; [Saal, David S.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Universite Cote d'Azur; SKEMA Business School; University of Liege; Loughborough University,"Brea-Solis, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, SKEMA, Lille, France.",humberto.breasolis@skema.edu,"Perelman, Sergio/K-2135-2016; Solis, Humberto Brea/ABB-3050-2020",,Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique FNRS (FRFC Project Beyond Incentive Regulation),Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique FNRS (FRFC Project Beyond Incentive Regulation)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),"Humberto Brea-Solis and Sergio Perelman acknowledge financial support from the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique FNRS (FRFC Project Beyond Incentive Regulation).

Some firms offer new customers the lowest price; others give preferential prices to their past customers. We contribute to the literature on price discrimination in behavior-based pricing by exploring how customers' social price comparisons, i.e., comparing one's price to that received by similar peers, impact the optimal structure of price discrimination. Social price comparisons have a negative (positive) impact on customers' transaction utility if the price charged to past customers is higher (lower) than a new customer's price. Using an analytical model with vertically differentiated firms, we show that a firm with relatively large market share will reward its past customers with relatively low prices when social price comparisons have a sufficiently large impact on utility. Furthermore, we find that social price comparisons lead to a relaxation of the price competition for new customers. Thus, both firms can earn higher profits when such comparisons are made than when they are absent. We also examine how other factors, such as horizontal competition and strategic customers, interact with social price comparison concerns to impact pricing strategies. Finally, we show how pricing behavior differs when price comparisons are based on historic reference prices rather than on peers' prices.","[Lee, Seung Hwan (Shawn)] Ajou Univ, Sch Business, Suwon 16499, South Korea; [Fay, Scott] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Ajou University; Syracuse University,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，Ajou Univ, Sch Business, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",slee33@ajou.ac.kr; scfay@syr.edu,"Fay, Scott/AAM-5503-2021","Fay, Scott/0000-0002-6694-9169",Whitman Research fund,Whitman Research fund,"The authors would like to thank the participants at the 2015 BBCRST conference for their helpful comments.

Two types of railway development are considered: railway extension and an increase in railway speed. Results of the panel data regression analysis show that railway development is associated with a reduction on air transport. However, the association between railway extension and air patronage is only significant for short- and medium-haul city pairs but not for long-haul ones, whereas the association between railway acceleration and air patronage is only significant for short-haul city pairs. Nevertheless, the potential effect of railway development on the reduction of carbon emissions in China through a modal shift is relatively sizeable, with an approximately 6.9 percent net reduction (2.83 million tons) of the total carbon emissions from air and rail transport in 2010.","[Li, Linna; Loo, Becky P.

We use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey -Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to showthat among employees eligible for single coverage, dependent coverage was almost always available for employees in large firms (100 or more employees) but not in smaller firms, particularly those with fewer than 10 employees. In addition, when dependent coverage was available, eligible employees in smaller firms were more likely than employees in large firms to face two situations that represented the extremes of the incremental cost distribution: (1) they paid nothing for single or family coverage or (2) they paid nothing for single coverage but faced a high contribution for family coverage.

Furthermore, our results suggest that a corporate income tax may have acted as a backstop to maintain revenue collected through PIT.","[Onji, Kazuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyamacho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Tang, John P.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, 26 LF Crisp Bldg, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Osaka University; Australian National University,"Onji, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyamacho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",kazuki.onji@econ.osaka-u.sc.jp; john.tang@anu.edu.au,"Tang, John/AAN-7966-2020; Onji, Kazuki/CAF-5594-2022","Tang, John/0000-0003-1669-4249; Onji, Kazuki/0000-0002-0717-2951","GSE, Osaka University; MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI [15K03510]; Australian Research Council [DE120101426]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03510, 15KK0088] Funding Source: KAKEN; Australian Research Council [DE120101426] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","GSE, Osaka University; MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","Thanks to Paul Rhode, William Collins, Li Liu, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants at ANU(RSE), AJRC, UCL(CORE), NTA 2015 for comments and suggestions that significantly improved this paper.

This paper has analysed economic water productivities along the dairy value chain in South Africa. The findings reveal that the value added to milk and water as it moves along the value chain varies from stage to stage; with the highest value being attained at the processing level, followed by the retail and farm gate levels,.respectively. Milk production in South Africa is economically efficient in terms of water use. Feed production accounts for about 98.02% of the total water footprint of milk with 3.3% protein and 4% fat. Feed production is economically efficient in terms of cost and water use. Value addition to milk and economic productivity of water are influenced by packaging design. Not all economically water productive feed products are significant contributors to milk yield. Future ecological footprint assessments should take into account the value added to output products and economic water productivities along the products' value chain, rather than relying only on water footprint estimates.

Nevertheless, this neoinstitutionalist approach has been criticized because of its excessive determinism and the fact that it doesn't pay enough attention to the periods when elite's power was eroded. The present paper analyzes one of these cases, which occurred in Chile between 1913 and 1973. The income share of the top 1% is used as a proxy for the elite's power. New quantitative evidence on incomes for different groups -the 1% and wage earners-is integrated into an analytic narrative on the conflictive relation between the elite and other political and social actors.","[Weber, Javier Rodriguez] Univ Republica, Programa Hist Econ & Social, Unidad Multidisciplinaria, Constituyente 1502, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Weber, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Programa Hist Econ & Social, Unidad Multidisciplinaria, Constituyente 1502, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay.",javier.rodriguez@cienciassociales.edu.uy,"Rodríguez Weber, Javier Ernesto/GPP-3661-2022",,,,,,55,4,4,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0212-6109,2041-3335,,REV HIST ECON,Rev.

We present a scenario optimization model that incorporates uncertainty about the spread of an invasive species and allocates survey and eradication measures to minimize the number of infested or potentially infested host plants on the landscape. We demonstrate the approach by allocating surveys outside the quarantine area established following the discovery of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada. We use historical data on ALB spread to generate a set of invasion scenarios that characterizes the uncertainty of the pest's extent in the GTA. We then use these scenarios to find allocations of surveys and tree removals aimed at managing the spread of the pest in the GTA, It is optimal to spend approximately one-fifth of the budget on surveys and the rest on tree removal. Optimal solutions do not always select sites with the greatest propagule pressure, but in some cases focus on sites with moderate likelihoods of ALB arrival and low host densities. Our approach is generalizable and helps support decisions regarding control of invasive species when knowledge about a species' spread is uncertain.

I examine this notion in a labor market, where employers and employees do not possess perfect information about wages, and address the question of who benefits from the information provided by job placement services? The empirical strategy considers the two-sided nature of the labor market. Estimates of employee and employer incomplete information are contrasted between users and non-users of placement services provided by Job Corps, America's largest and most important job training program for youths. Findings suggest that employees that use placement services don't have more information about better offer wages, relative to non-users.

The Emergy Accounting (EMA) method proved to be a valuable tool to help address trade complexity by means of environmental quality-oriented indicators. EMA is used in this paper to evaluate the environmental and resource flows involved in China-United States (USA) trade in the years 1993, 2000 and 2008. Results show that China emergy exports (i.e. exports of raw and less processed resources) exceed the imports from USA. Although the money received by China from exports is higher than the money paid for imports, the real imbalance relies in the huge amount of resources that outflow from China, hardly compensated by the value of imports in terms of support to Chinese economy. The conclusion is that trade accounting methods should include holistic valuations beyond the financial costs of traded goods. Policy implications of these results are discussed.

For adaptation in particular, it remains unclear what mobilised private finance is. Research so far has focused on its potential and experiences in developing countries, but not on the arguments of those who introduced and continue to advocate private adaptation finance: developed countries. This paper investigates the positions of developed countries and development banks and agencies. In particular, it aims to identify whether those actors can reach a common understanding of private adaptation finance that minimises norm conflicts in a fragmented climate finance system. Empirically, the paper examines the Biennial Reports and submissions on Strategies and Approaches for Mobilising Scaled-up Finance of six developed country parties, as well as data from interviews with experts from development banks and agencies. The analysis finds a number of discrepancies between these sets of actors, for example on motivations for and modes of private sector involvement. This discrepancy is the result of ambiguity around the concept of private adaptation finance in a highly fragmented climate finance architecture. This ambiguity is problematic when the aim of mobilising private adaptation finance is to contribute to the $100 billion commitment. However, if the aim is adaptation in practice, both ambiguity and fragmentation might actually make the climate finance system more inclusive and innovative.","[Pauw, W.

These approaches often bring together diverse actors in settings that allow for joint problem solving. However, the effectiveness of collaboration can be undermined if governments choose to ignore the outcomes of collaboration in their decision making processes. In this paper we report findings from a study of a drought-based collaborative process. We evaluate the extent to which the provincial government in Ontario, Canada, used recommendations from collaborative groups in its Low Water Response program. Interviews, document analysis and personal observations provided the data for a qualitative, multi-case study analysis. Three cases were chosen where collaborative teams made decisions designed to balance ecological and economic water issues during drought. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework provided a conceptual foundation for evaluating the extent to which collaborative outcomes were used by government. Even though the provincial government did not accept the most important decision made by collaborative teams (to declare severe drought), participants were generally satisfied with outcomes achieved through collaboration, especially social and environmental outcomes. Challenges revealed through the study included insufficient capacity, lack of clear program requirements, and issues inherent with low water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The role of self-identity (SI) as a Muslim, dietary acculturation (DA) in the host culture, moral obligation (MO) to purchase Halal meat and trust on the authenticity of Halal meat is explored. Design/methodology/approach - Cross-sectional data were collected through a questionnaire survey with 436 international Muslim students mainly originating from Muslim countries and currently studying in China. Data were analysed by stepwise multiple regression analyses to test the model and the moderating effects of SI, DA, MO and trust on behavioural intention. Findings - The results indicate that a positive personal attitude towards the consumption of Halal meat, personal conviction and the perceived control over consuming Halal meat predict the intention to eat Halal meat among Muslims. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the use of a snow-ball sampling technique and the focus on only four individual characteristics related to religious food consumption, namely, SI, DA, MO and trust. Practical implications - Practical implications extend to dealing with food policymakers and food marketing managers in companies who might pursue identity-,acculturation-, MO- and trustworthinessrelated strategies in their distribution and communication efforts targeted at the growing local as well as international market of Halal food. Originality/value - This study is one of the first studies investigating the determinants of Halal meat consumption among international Muslim students in China and a first application of the theory of planned behaviour-related religious food consumption context by considering four individual characteristics, namely, SI, DA, MO and trust.","[Ali, Afzaal; Guo Xiaoling; Sherwani, Mehkar] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ali, Adnan] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Mkt, Xian, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Ali, A (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.",afzaal_ciit@yahoo.com,"Ali, Afzaal/JXX-3750-2024; Ali, Dr. Adnan/HJI-1007-2023","Ali, Afzaal/0000-0002-7323-6781; Ali, Dr. Adnan/0000-0001-8836-8851",,,,,39,55,58,2,36,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The authentication and characterization of edible fats and oils by routine chemical methods are highly laborious and time consuming. Fourier transform-mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy has emerged as a predominant analytical tool in the study of edible fats/oils. However, sufficient attention has not been paid so far to spectral characterization of milk fat obtained from cow and buffalo milk. The purpose of this paper is to fill this void. Design/methodology/approach - Ghee samples were prepared from cow and buffalo milk by the direct cream method. From each type of milk (cow and buffalo), 35 samples of ghee were prepared; thus, in total, 70 samples of ghee were obtained for the study. For assigning absorption bands in the IR spectrum, spectra of cow and buffalo ghee samples were acquired in the MIR region (4,000-650 cm(-1)). Findings - In FT-MIR spectra of ghee, 14 peaks were obtained at different positions and with varying intensities. They were at 3,005, 2,922, 2,853, 1,744, 1,466, 1,418, 1,377, 1,236, 1,161, 1,114, 1,098, 966, 870 and 721 cm(-1) for cow and buffalo ghee with almost equal intensity of absorption. Practical implications - The finding of this study will be useful for characterization and authentication of ghee. Originality/value - Application of IR spectral bands of ghee in the MIR region using a FT-infrared spectrometer to monitor the quality of ghee is suggested.","[Antony, Bency; Ratnam, K.] Kaira Dist Cooperat Milk Producers Union, Amul Dairy, Anand, Gujarat, India; [Sharma, Saurabh] Mol Spectroscopy PerkinElmer, Abu Rd, India; [Mehta, Bhavbhuti Manojbhai] Anand Agr Univ, Dept Dairy Chem, Anand, Gujarat, India; [Aparnathi, K.

Also, if oil prices increase, consumers will spend more of their income on petroleum products thereby reducing the share of consumption on other goods. As a consequence, profits fall, as well as company share values. When it comes to spending on petroleum products, income elasticity is higher than price elasticity, so strong economic activity can result in growth of company profits and their share values even if oil prices rise. The existing literature on the subject does not indicate a single conclusion; sometimes there is a negative correlation between oil prices and capital markets, sometimes there is none. The aim of the paper, using data on the CROBEX as the official index of the Zagreb Stock Exchange and oil prices data, is to examine whether there is a statistically significant relationship between oil prices and the movement of the Croatian capital market. In an effort to thoroughly check the direction and the nature of oil prices influence on the Croatian capital market, we used several different indicators of oil prices, to take cognizance of the possible significance of the volatility of oil prices or the effect of surprise, and possible differences in the nature of the impact of oil prices on the capital market depending on whether oil prices rise or fall. The paper also uses two additional variables; the exchange rate, introduced by the nominal effective exchange rate variable, and the industrial production index as a proxy for gross domestic product (GDP), for GDP information are published on a quarterly basis. The model uses monthly data for the period from 01/2000 to 12/2015, for this data frequency was considered optimal in terms of being able to detect the possible impact of explanatory variables on the movement of Zagreb Stock Exchange index - CROBEX. VAR (Vector Auto Regression) methodology was employed in order to detect the possible capital market reaction to the explanatory variables with a time lag.","[Cipcic, Marina Lolic; Kramaric, Tomislava Pavic; Miletic, Marko] Univ Split, Univ Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Cipcic, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Univ Dept Profess Studies, Kopilica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",mlolic@oss.unist.hr; tpavic@oss.unist.hr; mamiletic@oss.unist.hr,"Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/D-4873-2017; Cipcic, Marina Lolic/F-5379-2017; Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/ITU-6477-2023; Miletić, Marko/F-9102-2017","Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/0000-0002-0974-4423; Pavic Kramaric, Tomislava/0000-0002-0974-4423;",,,,,13,1,1,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,1083,1092,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500105,0

Design/methodology/approach - The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was used to explain the consumption of chocolate. In this study, TPB is extended with a construct for AE. Findings - A total of 859 consumers in Belgium and Hungary participated in the study and results showed that including AE increases the predicted variance of the TPB. Moreover, AE have a positive effect on the intention and the actual behaviour of consumers. Next, the study suggests that Belgian consumers are more influenced by their emotional and control beliefs and that Hungarian consumers are also driven by opinion of family and friends and some behavioural beliefs. Practical implications - Overall, TPB can contribute to the understanding of behavioural intention and behaviour towards eating filled chocolate. Moreover, it can help to develop a marketing plan for specific consumer segments as it can identify influencing factors and consumer beliefs towards a product. Originality/value - This is the first study that compares the fit of the TPB model with and without the construct of AE.

Competition stimulates higher effectiveness in many different ways. A competitive environment creates better conditions and expansion opportunities for undertakings concerned and facilitates their entry into the market. In view of a possible loss of market positions as a result of competitive struggle, the implementation of new technology and innovations is progressing more intensively, namely through research, development, patents, and so forth. Competition is effective if independent entities operate in a market, each facing competitive pressure from others. Entities operating in the market derive their behaviour from the structure of the market. Therefore, control of concentrations prevents the establishment or strengthening of dominant entities, which would not be subject to adequate competitive pressure. Economic competition is an eminent instrument for effective and positive function which has influence progressing in economy of market. Although not every behavior of competition is allowable from economy competition. Entities in ambition benefit their position infra market or obtain some benefits often resort for practices which are prohibited. Such acting constitutes unfair competition, which is defiance of good mores of competition and it is able to cause drawback other participants of market. But it is not inevitable to cause material drawback. It may cause nonmaterial drawback, too.

In addition to the description of the basic structure of the network in terms of its topological characteristics like the degree distribution or the clustering coefficient, the demographic information of the users have been utilized to get deeper insight into the various facets of human sociality related to age and gender as reflected in the communication patterns of users. One of the observations suggests that the grandmothering effect is clearly visible in these communication patterns. In addition it is found that the number of friends or connections of a user showa clear decaying trend as a function of the user's age for both genders. Furthermore, an analysis of the most common location of the users shows the effect of distance on close relationships. As computational analysis and modelling are the two key approaches or tools of modern 'Social Physics' we will very briefly discuss the construction of a social network model to get insight into how plausible microscopic social interaction processes translate to meso- and macroscopic socially weighted network structures between individuals.","[Ghosh, Asim; Monsivais, Daniel; Bhattacharya, Kunal; Kaski, Kimmo] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Sch Sci, POB 15500, Aalto 00076, Finland",Aalto University,"Ghosh, A (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Sch Sci, POB 15500, Aalto 00076, Finland.",asim.ghosh@aalto.fi; daniel.monsivais@aalto.fi; kunal.bhattacharya@aalto.fi; kimmo.kaski@aalto.fi,"Kaski, Kimmo/AAO-4320-2021","Kaski, Kimmo/0000-0002-3805-9687","project COSDYN, Academy of Finland [276439]; H EU project IBSEN; CONACYT, Mexico [383907]","project COSDYN, Academy of Finland; H EU project IBSEN; CONACYT, Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","A.G. and K.K. acknowledge support from project COSDYN, Academy of Finland (Project no. 276439).

As revealed in the study, the underlying goal of income management for listed companies is the alleged increase in profits. However, most companies do not pay extra taxes, on the contrary, they reduce the tax report. There is a small amount of taxation on accounting income, so tax cuts may be attributed to profit management rather than objectives.

Pre-harvest factors such as cultivar, climate and growing conditions, as well as harvesting, curing, storage duration, temperature and relative humidity during storage, influence losses. The optimal storage conditions for onions are 0 degrees C and 65-75% relative humidity (RH); however, it is costly to store onions at this low temperature for long periods. It can also be challenging to maintain low RH at low storage temperature. The aims of the present study were: 1) to test the applicability of a HortiSens (R) sensor to monitor temperature and RH under experimental conditions and to evaluate the effects of 2) conventional and pulse cooling, and 3) low and high RH during storage on the quality of conventionally and organically grown onions. We found that online microclimate monitoring using the novel wireless HortiSens (R) sensor gave similar results as data from other sensors. Onions had higher basal root sprouting with pulse cooling and after storage in high RH. There was a higher incidence of disease at high RH, but lower mass losses. Organically grown onions had higher incidence of root sprouting and diseases than conventionally grown onions, especially during storage at high RH.","[Islam, Md.

The analysis was done using the classification decision tree. Findings - The results show the dominant influence of socio-demographic factors, such as region, place of living (urban-rural areas), family size, age, income and education of consumers as well as behavioural-cognitive factors, such as the price importance, place of purchase and product characteristics, in all analysed target variables. Apart from the similarities with traditional wine markets, the specificities related to an emerging market have also been determined. Originality/value - This research combines critical factors based on related studies, including the antecedents and outcome variables, to develop more comprehensive models for better understanding of the wine consumers' behaviour. In major and traditional wine-making countries, the consumption of wine is fairly predictable. In emerging markets, the commercial strategies are, for the most part, based on certain specificities and are quite interesting for the surveys.","[Jovanovic, Miomir M.; Joksimovic, Miljan] Univ Montenegro, Biotech Fac, Podgorica, Montenegro; [Kascelan, Ljiljana; Kascelan, Vladimir] Univ Montenegro, Fac Econ, Podgorica, Montenegro",University of Montenegro; University of Montenegro,"Jovanovic, MM (通讯作者)，Univ Montenegro, Biotech Fac, Podgorica, Montenegro.",miomirj@t-com.me,"Kašćelan, Ljiljana/IXW-8512-2023; Kascelan, Ljiljana/IST-5343-2023; Kascelan, Vladimir/ABB-3192-2021","Kascelan, Ljiljana/0000-0001-9831-7599; Kascelan, Vladimir/0000-0001-8763-7108",,,,,39,11,12,0,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

The theoretical framework is followed by the case study of the International Dance Festival in Kalamata. Special events, as place demonstration action, allow a place to promote its comparative advantages and upgrade its tourist product. Thus, special events influence landscape. The International Dance Festival in Kalamata, which has been going on for 22 years, has shaped city's cultural identity and therefore its landscape.

Human rights are one of the fundamental values of the democratic system and a necessary requirement for the development and life in territorial communities. According to the basic tenets of human rights, they are innate (every human being acquires them at birth), inalienable (cannot be taken away from anyone) and universal (they belong to all people). Constitutional documents and international documents on human rights put man and his rights at the centre of attention and guarantee their protection. The territory of a certain territorial community is the starting point for the realization of human rights and political, economic and social activities of people. I fact, ability to exercise human rights by every person is dependent on the development of territorial communities. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that there should be no difference in rights on the basis of territory to which a person belongs. In view of the significant regional differences in the Croatian territory, there are no equal opportunities for the realization of human rights. This is especially pronounced in the area of the Eastern Croatian, where individual rights are more difficult to exercise compared to developed areas. The existence of regional disparities in particular affects the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. These rights constitute a condition for human dignity. But in some cases, regional differences also affect other generations of rights. Human rights are interdependent and interrelated. The level to which an individual human right will be exercised depends on the realization of other rights. The author concludes that the unevenness of regional development of the country's territory contributes to unequal opportunities for the realization of guaranteed human rights and to unequal opportunities for development, as the basis for the realization of all rights. On the other hand, the author tries to show how balanced regional development is the basis for the exercise of rights in the entire territory of a certain territorial community.","[Marinac, Antun] Polytecn Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia",,"Marinac, A (通讯作者)，Polytecn Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",amarinac@vup.hr,,,,,,,22,0,0,2,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,869,880,,,,,,12,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500084,0

The idea of CSR could be summarized in a way that maximizing profit for the owner is not the only reason for the existence of the company, but it has to fulfill a number of other more significant objectives. The essence of this idea is to assume that the company is supposed to serve man, such as the owners, employees, co-workers, consumers, the local community, and thus serve the good of mankind in a global sense. This article, by analysis of the literature study and the survey method, has attempted to examine the extent to which companies respect the dignity of the person, or humanity, restricting profit-making at all costs. Are employees ready to give up the particular (utilitarian) benefits of higher value, respecting human dignity? Can organizations recognize a person in another person, and do they commit something? These and similar questions determine the direction of analysis in the presented paper.","[Skiba, Lukasz; Albrychiewicz-Slocinska, Anna; Czarnecka, Aleksandra] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management Sociol & Psychol, Management Dept, Ul Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland; [Poor, Jozsef] Szent Istvan Univ, Peter Ku 1,Room 4027, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Ionela, Gavrila Paven] 1 Decembrie 1918 Univ Alba Iulia, Str Gabriel Bethlen 5, Alba Iulia 510009, Romania",Technical University Czestochowa; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; 1 Decembrie 1918 University Alba Iulia,"Skiba, L (通讯作者)，Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management Sociol & Psychol, Management Dept, Ul Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42200 Czestochowa, Poland.",aczar11@tlen.pl; slocinska@wp.pl; ionelapaven@yahoo.com; poorjf@t-online.hu; lukabi@wp.pl,"Czarnecka, Aleksandra/AAN-1695-2021; Poór, József/AAL-4421-2021; Ionela, Gavrila-Paven/A-7696-2019","Poór, József/0000-0002-6873-0646; Skiba, Lukasz/0000-0002-5176-3265",,,,,29,1,1,0,2,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1739-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,669,677,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6FH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426613300083,0

Farmers face the problem of timing the harvest with respect to quality (crude protein content) and quantity (dry matter yield). Literature suggests that harvesting more frequently and thereby keeping the grass short (light harvesting) will result in a higher crude protein content than for less frequent harvesting (heavy harvesting), but will also result in lower yield. However, this trade-off between quality and quantity is based on experiments with typically extremely light or heavy strategies, which are not realistic. We performed a model study to investigate the effect of harvesting strategy on quality and quantity under more realistic harvesting strategies. We used a potential crop growth model adapted to grass. A parameter calibration was carried out with yield and weather data of 2010 and 2011 from one specific field at Knowledge Transfer Centre De Marke (Netherlands), resulting in a correlation coefficient of R= 0.879. Validation was performed using 13 years (2002-2014) of weather and yield data on the site (R= 0.776). With this model, the yields of five different harvest scenarios were predicted, based on 22 years of weather data at the site. In contrast to literature sources, the model predicted, on average, around 10% more annual yield under the light harvest strategies. The difference may be explained by a large regrowth delay after a heavy harvest, caused by a heavy loss of leaf area. Consequently, potential growth days are utilized more efficiently under light harvesting. These predictions could mark the start of the development of new harvest strategies, based on a model-experiment cycle.","[Thiessen, M.; van Mourik, S.] Wageningen Univ, Farm Technol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Evert, F.

Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected by audits made in 40 food businesses of various food industry sectors. All food businesses were located in Poland where the HACCP system is obligatory. Half of the evaluated businesses implemented one or more private voluntary certified standards. The audit form contained 134 detailed questions covering 12 steps and seven principles of HACCP implementation and functioning. The obtained results were analyzed using a t-test, Spearman's test, and cluster analysis. Findings - The overall assessment of the HACCP principles in certified food businesses was higher than in non-certified ones. However, the functioning of HACCP principles in practice was assessed much lower than the system implementation in all business groups, despite certification and the type of food industry. In each of the food industry sectors both implementation and functioning of HACCP principles were evaluated higher in certified than in non-certified food businesses. Further research is needed to explain why, despite certification, the functioning of the mandatory HACCP principles is often incomplete and what factors affect the correct operation, as well as if these are sufficient to ensure food safety. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of this research is a small sample of only 40 food businesses of various food industry sectors located in Poland. Due to the small sample, the research should be considered as the preliminary or scoping study. Although the method applied in the study allowed rapid evaluation of implementation and functioning of HACCP principles in food businesses, more work and analyses should be done for its reliability and validity. Practical implications - The obtained results gave a lot of practical information, e.g.: first, the overall assessment of the HACCP principles in the certified food businesses is higher than that in the non-certified ones; second, the functioning of the HACCP principles in practice is weaker than the system implementation despite certification; third, in some cases the passing certification schemes do not result in a company having excellent food safety practices; and fourth, the applied method allows rapid evaluation of implementation and functioning of HACCP principles. However, more work and analyses should be done for its reliability and validity. Social implications - It is believed that certification strengthens HACCP functioning in food businesses. However, the study has shown that functioning of HACCP principles in practice was assessed much lower than the system implementation in all business groups, despite certification and the type of food industry. This indicate that even in certified food businesses HACCP functioning is often incomplete, which may have an impact on food safety. Originality/value - The paper presents additional and detailed data on the functioning of HACCP principles in certified and non-certified food business. Despite certification and the type of food industry sector, the functioning of HACCP principles in practice was assessed much lower than the system implementation in all business groups. The method applied in this study allowed rapid evaluation of implementation and functioning of HACCP principles in food businesses. However, more work and analyses should be done for its reliability and validity.","[Trafialek, Joanna] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Food Gastron & Food Hyg, Warsaw, Poland; [Kolanowski, Wojciech] Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Dept Dietet & Assessment Food, Siedlce, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Kolanowski, W (通讯作者)，Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Dept Dietet & Assessment Food, Siedlce, Poland.",wojciech.kolanowski@uph.edu.pl,"Kolanowski, Wojciech/B-1812-2016; Kolanowski, Wojciech/O-6305-2019; KOLANOWSKI, Wojciech/GWB-9902-2022; Trafiałek, Joanna/K-4411-2019","Kolanowski, Wojciech/0000-0002-9512-123X; Trafiałek, Joanna/0000-0001-5839-1786",,,,,55,27,29,4,47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

GWorkS is a discrete event model that approaches reality as a discrete stochastic dynamic system. GWorkS was developed and validated using cut-rose as a case crop for which two cultivation systems exist, the path-based system and the mobile cultivation system. The focus of this paper is horizontal extension of GWorkS to sweet pepper, which is characterised by high crop-related labour effort and costs. For sweet pepper, international research aiming at automation of sweet pepper harvest is ongoing. Dynamic process simulation and analysis may contribute strongly to economic and technical constraints for the design of new work methods. The most important crop operation in sweet pepper cultivation, harvesting, was pre-modelled in IDEF3 process analysis. The mathematical structure of the GWorkS model is described, as well as specific model adaptations for sweet pepper and inputs determined from labour registration data and video recordings at a sweet pepper grower. Data were analysed for two growers producing different pepper cultivars. Model simulations were performed for one grower. Dynamic simulation results were used to derive technical and economic requirements as numerical constraints for the design of work method innovation.","[van't Ooster, A.] Wageningen Univ, Farm Technol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Aantjes, G.

The unrestricted version of the model with correlated random parameters, however, is rarely applied. An important advantage of this specification is that the correlations between the parameters are not restricted to zero. These correlations can arise due to a behavioural phenomena or scale heterogeneity. One consequence of this might be that derived willingness-to-pay or to-accept estimates are under- or overestimated, providing decision makers with incorrect estimates. We compare both model specifications using data from a study about farmers' willingness to accept compensation for implementing agri-environmental measures in Brandenburg, Germany. For this data both model specifications - with and without correlated random parameters - provide similar willing-to-accept estimates, but the model with correlations performs better despite the higher number of parameters. As our findings could be case study specific, we want to encourage especially applied researchers to estimate also specifications with correlated random parameters. Applying only models with uncorrelated random parameters can result in biased estimates and thus provide incorrect information to decision makers.","[Mariel, Petr] Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ Econometr & Stat 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, E-48015 Bilbao, Spain; [Meyerhoff, Juergen] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Landscape Architecture & Environm Planning, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",University of Basque Country; Technical University of Berlin,"Mariel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Appl Econ Econometr & Stat 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, E-48015 Bilbao, Spain.",petr.mariel@ehu.es; juergen.meyerhoff@tu-berlin.de,"Meyerhoff, Juergen/M-5640-2019; Mariel, Petr/K-8399-2014","Meyerhoff, Juergen/0000-0003-4333-8514; Mariel, Petr/0000-0002-7412-0684",Federal German Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ: 033W015DN]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2017-82111-R]; Basque Government [IT-642-13],Federal German Ministry of Education and Research; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government),"The authors are grateful to Andreas Horbat for his contribution to the development of the survey and its implementation.

Gold inflows were a colonial rent, and thus a source of income and a financial asset that increased the liquidity supply in a credit market populated by both (direct) participants and non-participants in the colonial trade or in mining. As a source of income it would induce a positive upward pressure on interest rates, while as a financial asset it would lead to the opposite. A method is developed to extract interest rates from notarized personal credit, unbundling the aggregate and the idiosyncratic components of risk pricing. The results show that interest rates in Lisbon did not differ critically from those observed in other cities at the core of the premodern European economy, which were spared from devastation by the earthquake that struck Lisbon in 1755. A simple model relating the market interest rate series to gold stock variations finds that the liquidity channel dominated over the endowment channel, which explains the downward trend in interest rates up until 1757 when the interest rates were freely settled. Mild credit rationing may have been introduced by a 5 per cent ceiling on interest rates that was imposed after 1757.","[Costa, Leonor Freire; Rocha, Maria Manuela] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, CSG GHES Social Sci, Lisbon, Portugal; [Brito, Paulo B.] Univ Lisbon, UECE Econ, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Costa, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, CSG GHES Social Sci, Lisbon, Portugal.",leonorc@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Brito, Paulo B/B-8942-2009; Costa, Leonor/JKJ-5903-2023; COSTA, Leonor Freire/IVU-7777-2023","Costa, Leonor/0000-0002-8867-3036","FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), Portugal [EXPL/EPHHIS/1742/2012]; Strategic Projects of the Gabinete de Historia Economica e Social [UID/SOC/04521/2013]; Unidade de Estudos sobre Complexidade e Economia [UID/ECO/00436/2013]","FCT (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Strategic Projects of the Gabinete de Historia Economica e Social; Unidade de Estudos sobre Complexidade e Economia","We are especially grateful to Rui Pedro Esteves and Larry Neal for detailed comments at several stages of the research undertaken for this article; to Regina Grafe and Silvia Marzagalli, for their helpful suggestions; and to Alejandra Irigoin and Julian Hoppit for inviting us to a seminar at the Institute of Historical Research, University College London.

In this paper we present and analyse Multi-Actor Dialogue Seminars (MADS) as an approach to contribute to transformative social learning and conflict resolution, and the contribution to tangible and intangible outcomes in formal negotiations. Unlike negotiations, the objective of MADS is not to agree on a text, but to identify areas of agreement and disagreement, build trust and understanding and identify policy options that are tailored to different cultural-political and value systems. As a case study we use the breakdown of the negotiations at the formal Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)Conference in 2010 regarding innovative financial mechanisms, and subsequent two international Quito Dialogues using the MADS approach. Through a composite of methods this article reveals the effects of the Quito Dialogues on formal CBD negotiations. The Quito Dialogues contributed to bringing actors out of their deadlock and thereby paving the way for constructive results in the formal CBD negotiations, evident by references in CBD Decisions adopted by 196 CBD Parties. We discuss key design and implementation factors which were decisive for these effects including the importance of a bridging organization, trust building, exploration of both convergences and divergences, involvement of participants with diverse and conflicting views early in the planning, promotion of active listening and addressing diverse knowledge systems and power asymmetries.","[Schultz, Maria; Hahn, Thomas; Ituarte-Lima, Claudia] Stockholm Univ, SwedBio Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hallstrom, Niclas] What Next Forum, Uppsala, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Hahn, T (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, SwedBio Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",maria.schultz@su.se; thomas.hahn@su.se; claudia.ituarte@su.se; niclas.hallstrom@whatnext.org,"Hahn, Thomas/ABH-3316-2021","Hahn, Thomas/0000-0002-6649-5232; Ituarte-Lima, Claudia/0000-0002-4901-0950",Sida; Norad and Japan; Stockholm Resilience Centre; Swedish Research Council Formas [254-2013-130]; SwedBio on Sida Grants,Sida; Norad and Japan(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Stockholm Resilience Centre; Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); SwedBio on Sida Grants,"The work with this article is inspired by collaborative learning with: the team members in the Sida financed SwedBio programme Pamela Cordero Hernandez, Sara Elfstrand, Ellika Hermansson Torok, Pernilla Malmer, Hanna Wetterstrand and other colleagues at Stockholm Resilience Centre such as Sarah Cornell and Maria Tengo; Bente Herstad, Norad and Tone Solhaug, Ministry of Climate and Environment from Norway; Ravi Sharma and his colleagues at the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity; co-chairs of the Quito seminars M.

Using within-family variation, we find that arriving at an older age, or having more childhood exposure to the European environment, led to a more negative wage gap relative to the native born. Infant arrivals had a positive wage gap relative to natives, in contrast to a negative gap for teenage arrivals. Therefore, a key determinant of immigrant outcomes during the Age of Mass Migration was the country of residence during critical periods of childhood development.","[Alexander, Rohan] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25A, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Ward, Zachary] Baylor Univ, Dept Econ, One Bear Pl 98003, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Australian National University; Baylor University,"Alexander, R (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Coll Business & Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25A, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia.",rohan.alexander@anu.edu.au; zach.a.ward@gmail.com,,"Ward, Zachary/0000-0001-7475-0910",College of Business and Economics at the Australian National University,College of Business and Economics at the Australian National University,"For comments on earlier stages of this project, we thank Tim Hatton, Priti Kalsi, Ed Kosack, Amber McKinney, and seminar participants at La Trobe University.

This might be bad news for policies aimed at combating climate change: while the unavoidable costs of these policies arise today, the expected benefits occur in the distant future. Drawing on data from over 12,000 households and using the ordered logit and the generalized ordered logit model, we analyze whether attitudes towards climate change and climate policies as well as public spending preferences differ with respect to age. Our estimates show that elderly people are less concerned about climate change, but more concerned about other global challenges. Furthermore, they are less likely to support climate-friendly policies, such as the subsidization of renewables, allocate less public resources to and have lower willingness-to-pay for environmental policies. Thus, our results suggest that the ongoing demographic change in industrialized countries may undermine climate policies.","[Andor, Mark A.; Schmidt, Christoph M.; Sommer, Stephan] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Schmidt, Christoph M.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum,"Andor, MA (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",andor@rwi-essen.de,,"Sommer, Stephan/0000-0002-0864-7795",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LA1113A]; Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 823],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Collaborative Research Center Statistical Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamic Processes of the German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful for invaluable comments and suggestions by Manuel Frondel and Colin Vance.

Most scholarly studies blame this on various technological barriers. Our work rebuts these studies. We present the first large-N-study on circular economy barriers in the EU (208 survey respondents, 47 expert interviews). We find that cultural barriers, particularly a lack of consumer interest and awareness as well as a hesitant company culture, are considered the main circular economy barriers by businesses and policy-makers. These are driven by market barriers which, in turn, are induced by a lack of synergistic governmental interventions to accelerate the transition towards a circular economy. Meanwhile, not a single technological barrier is ranked among the most pressing circular economy barriers, according to our research. Overall, our work suggests that circular economy is a niche discussion among sustainable development professionals at this stage. Significant efforts need to be undertaken for the concept to maintain its momentum.","[Kirchherr, Julian; Piscicelli, Laura; Bour, Ruben; Hekkert, Marko] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies Grp, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [Bour, Ruben; Kostense-Smit, Erica; Muller, Jennifer; Huibrechtse-Truijens, Anne] Deloitte, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Utrecht University; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited,"Kirchherr, J (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies Grp, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.kirchherr@uu.nl,"Hekkert, Marko/F-2528-2012; Mueller, Jennifer/KBQ-6042-2024; Piscicelli, Laura/AFW-5014-2022; Dijkstra, Tim/Z-1876-2019","Piscicelli, Laura/0000-0001-7501-4608; Muller, Jennifer/0000-0002-7473-7609",,,,,86,696,723,70,559,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Most studies on ES relationships use spatial or temporal statistical analysis (for example: correlations between services). Methods from microeconomic theory have recently received attention for describing ES relationships. The nature and intensity of ES relationships can be assessed by fitting a production possibility frontier that indicates the maximum amount of one ES that can be produced by landscape, for different levels of another ES. This study estimates production frontiers empirically, and compares the ES relationships insights gained this way with those inferred from correlation approaches. InVEST software was used to model and map the provision of six ES in the Reventazon watershed in Costa Rica. Spatial and temporal ES correlation patterns were analyzed for four observed land uses/land covers (LULC). Production frontiers were constructed using a set of 32 simulated scenarios. Production frontier was the most sensitive method for detecting ES relationships. The nature and intensity of ES relationships revealed depended on the analytic methods used. In comparison with correlations, the production frontier approach provided additional information relating to tradeoff intensity and Pareto efficient LULC configurations.","[Vallet, Ameline; Levrel, Harold] Univ Paris Saclay, Ecole Ponts ParisTech, AgroParisTech, CIRED,Cirad,CNRS,EHESS, F-94130 Nogent Sur Marne, France; [Vallet, Ameline; Locatelli, Bruno] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, Res Unit Forests & Soc, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Vallet, Ameline; Locatelli, Bruno; Wunder, Sven] CIFOR, Av La Molina 1895, Lima, Peru; [Seppelt, Ralf] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Landscape Ecol, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Scholes, Robert J.] Univ Witwatersrand, Global Change Inst, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Oszwald, Johan] Univ Rennes 2, Unite Mixte Rech, LETG Rennes COSTEL, CNRS 6554, F-35043 Rennes, France",Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Witwatersrand; Universite Rennes 2; Universite de Rennes,"Vallet, A (通讯作者)，CIRED, Campus Jardin Trop,45 Bis,Ave Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France.",vallet@centre-cired.fr,"Seppelt, Ralf/E-6056-2010; Levrel, Harold/JPY-3527-2023; Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020; Vallet, Améline/F-4037-2018; Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009","Seppelt, Ralf/0000-0002-2723-7150; Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Vallet, Améline/0000-0002-2731-0098; Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; Levrel, Harold/0000-0002-4611-3639","International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); European Union [308393]; French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs; CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA); CGIAR Fund","International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB); European Union(European Union (EU)); French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs; CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund(CGIAR)","This work was supported by the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement number 308393 (OPERAS project), the French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs, and the CGIAR Research Program on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA) with financial support from the CGIAR Fund.

In January 2014, twenty-five states expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act to low-income parents and childless adults. Using data from the 2011-2015 March Current Population Survey Supplements, we compare the changes in insurance coverage and labor market outcomes over time of adults in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not. Our estimates suggest that the recent expansion significantly increased Medicaid coverage with little decrease in ESI. Overall, the expansion did not impact labor market outcomes, including labor force participation, employment, and hours worked.","[Frisvold, David E.] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, NBER, 21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA; [Frisvold, David E.] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, IZA, 21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA; [Jung, Younsoo] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, 21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA",University of Iowa; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Iowa; University of Iowa,"Jung, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, 21 E Market St, Iowa City, IA 52246 USA.",david-frisvold@uiowa.edu; younsoo-jung@uiowa.edu,"Frisvold, David/JGM-1733-2023","Frisvold, David/0000-0001-8720-8995; Jung, Youn Soo/0000-0002-1441-2618",,,,,37,11,21,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2199-9023,2199-9031,,INT J HEALTH ECON MA,Int.

The incidence of any such issues may be treated as an output of complex interactions between a range of variables linked with ambient physical, socio-cultural, economic as well as the political system. The income insecurity is associated with the malnutrition, economic inequality, poverty, and several other socioeconomic hazards. At present, several studies are aiming to develop the 'tools and techniques' of demarcating the areas with some degree of vulnerability to a particular socioeconomic hazard and to examine the internal functions of the interactive variables linked with the hazard. In the present study, we tried to apply the algorithm of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in demarcating the areas susceptible to income insecurity in the district of Purulia, which is a backward district in the state of West Bengal, India, in terms of the overall level of human development achieved so far. The training dataset for developing the AHP model is based on the available secondary data. The model has been validated by running the modeled algorithm on a test dataset and applying the correlation and test of significance between the model output and the collected primary field data. The present model uses fifteen variables and is applicable to most of the subsistence agro-economic systems in tropical areas. The modification of the range of the variables and addition or alteration of variables within the similar structural framework will allow the model getting befitted with the other social and economic systems.

This mapping was conducted to determine the ecosystem services provided by seagrass habitat in the study area; that is Berakit, Malang Rapat and Teluk Bakau villages. The results of this research show the seagrass ecosystem in the study area provides significant value within the socio-economic framework of the coastal communities in surrounding areas, due to the existence of recreational fishing activity within seagrass habitat. The existence of this recreational fishing may provide direct and indirect economic impacts and induce demand, based on how the economic value of the seagrass ecosystem is distributed, so that the purchasing power of the coastal communities in surrounding areas is strengthened. We hope that this SES mapping may support considerations to protect the seagrass ecosystem and local economic development related to the recreational fishing in the seagrass conservation area.","[Wahyudin, Yudi] Bogor Agr Univ, Study Program Trop Marine Econ, Bogor, Indonesia; [Wahyudin, Yudi; Kusumastanto, Tridoyo; Adrianto, Luky] Ctr Coastal & Marine Resources Studies CCMRS IPB, Bogor, Indonesia; [Kusumastanto, Tridoyo] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Bogor, Indonesia; [Adrianto, Luky; Wardiatno, Yusli] Bogor Agr Univ, Fac Fisheries & Marine Sci, Bogor, Indonesia; [Wahyudin, Yudi] Djuanda Univ, Fac Agr, Bogor, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Bogor Agricultural University; Djuanda University,"Wahyudin, Y (通讯作者)，Bogor Agr Univ, Study Program Trop Marine Econ, Bogor, Indonesia.",yudi.wahyudin@pksplipb.or.id,"Adrianto, Luky/GPS-8857-2022; Wardiatno, Yusli/GPK-6481-2022; Wahyudin, Yudi/AAC-2173-2021","Adrianto, Luky/0000-0002-9959-2135; Wahyudin, Yudi/0000-0002-0234-1656; Wahyudin, Yudi/0000-0003-3892-1756",Center for Coastal and Marine Resources Studies Bogor Agricultural University (CCMRS IPB); Ministry of Research and Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia; center of science and technology of higher education CCMRS IPB,Center for Coastal and Marine Resources Studies Bogor Agricultural University (CCMRS IPB); Ministry of Research and Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)); center of science and technology of higher education CCMRS IPB,"We want to express our sincere gratitude to the director of the Center for Coastal and Marine Resources Studies Bogor Agricultural University (CCMRS IPB) for the scholarship of doctoral program and access to and facilities for finishing this research.

In this paper, we look at the labour market performance of Argentineans vis-a-vis the largest two immigrant groups, Italians and the Spaniards. We find that, on average, Argentineans enjoyed higher wages, but workers specialised in particular occupations by nationality. Immigrants clustered in occupations with lower salaries. Despite higher literacy levels and the language advantage, Spaniards did not outperform Italians in earnings. Ethnic networks facilitated the integration of immigrants into the host society and played a role in the occupation selection of immigrants. Our results suggest that Italian prosperity in Buenos Aires was not based on superior earnings or skills but on older and powerful networks.","[Abad, Leticia Arroyo] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA; [Sanchez-Alonso, Blanca] Univ CEU San Pablo, Madrid, Spain",San Pablo CEU University,"Sánchez-Alonso, B (通讯作者)，Univ CEU San Pablo, Madrid, Spain.",blanca@ceu.es,"Sanchez-Alonso, Blanca/N-6581-2013","Sanchez-Alonso, Blanca/0000-0002-1967-7455; Arroyo Abad, Leticia/0000-0002-4406-8838",,,,,62,8,8,1,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1863-2505,1863-2513,,CLIOMETRICA,Cliometrica,MAY,2018,12.0,2,,,,,343,376,,10.1007/s11698-017-0164-y,0.0,,,34,Economics; History; History Of Social Sciences,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; History; Social Sciences - Other Topics,GD3BD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430376700006,0

By supplying financial resources and services, reinsurance can facilitate growth and expansion in the insurance business. Focusing on the insurance sector in the emerging Spanish economy and using a novel dataset on fire insurance companies, this article examines the role of fire insurance in the national capital formation, the importance of reinsurance as a vehicle for expanding the country's domestic underwriting capacity, and how the import of capital impacted on the balance of payment, from the introduction of the first comprehensive legislation regarding insurance in 1908 to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Considering the situation of undercapitalization, the singularities of the insurance market, and the changes in regulatory schemes, we find that foreign reinsurance became a key financial vehicle for increasing underwriting capacity in Spain. We also show the struggle of an emerging market to find ways to keep the balance of current accounts and raise capital when financial infrastructure was underdeveloped. The diffusion of reinsurance networks from the core of industrial western countries towards emerging economies was one of the mechanisms for financial modernization on a global scale.","[Gutierrez Gonzalez, Pablo] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Andersson, Lars-Fredrik] Umea Univ, Umea, Sweden",University of Sevilla; Umea University,"González, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",,"Andersson, Lars/HMO-9989-2023; Gutierrez Gonzalez, Pablo/K-8135-2014","Andersson, Lars Fredrik/0000-0002-1413-3707; Gutierrez Gonzalez, Pablo/0000-0002-0591-8254",V Research Plan of the University of Seville; Umea University through the 'Mobility and Regional Development' grant,V Research Plan of the University of Seville; Umea University through the 'Mobility and Regional Development' grant,"The authors are grateful for comments and discussion on the topic with participants at a seminar held at the department of Economic History, Umea University, and with participants at the 20th Annual Congress of the European Business History Association held in Bergen.

It implements an output damage control approach for German silage maize production, considering almost eighty mechanical and herbicide based weed control options against over thirty weeds, working with detailed data on weed abundance and yields for more than three hundred municipalities in the federal state of North-Rhine-Westphalia. We apply the model to simulate economic optimal weed control over two growing periods under current environmental standards and under the scenario of a glyphosate ban as recently discussed after glyphosate was classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. Considering different levels of weed pressure, we find that adjustments in the intensity of mechanical pre-sowing strategies are an optimal response to a glyphosate ban, causing yield reductions of about 1%. In contrast, we find little evidence for a substitution towards selective herbicides post-sowing. On average, the aggregated economic impacts of a glyphosate ban are small, i.e. at about (sic) 1-2/ha, but single farms may face higher losses at about (sic) 10/ha.","[Boecker, Thomas; Britz, Wolfgang] Rhein Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 19, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Finger, Robert] ETH, Agr Econ & Policy Grp, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Bonn; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Böcker, T (通讯作者)，Rhein Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 19, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",t.boecker@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014; Finger, Robert/A-6248-2011","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823; Finger, Robert/0000-0002-0634-5742",,,,,55,28,28,0,39,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper approaches the subject more synthetically, presenting generic results on classes of indexes and their properties. In particular, we consider a broad class of indexes containing almost all known indexes and a partition of this class into two subsets, slacks-based indexes and path-based indexes. Slacks-based indexes are expressed in terms of additive or multiplicative slacks for all inputs and outputs, and particular indexes are generated by specifying the form of aggregation over the coordinate-wise slacks. Path-based indexes are expressed in terms of a common contraction/expansion factor, and particular indexes are generated by specifying the form of the path to the frontier of the technology. Owing to an impossibility result in one of our earlier papers, we know that the set of all inefficiency indexes can be partitioned into three subsets: those that satisfy continuity (in quantities and technologies) and violate indication (equal to some specified value if and only if the quantity vector is efficient), those that satisfy indication and violate continuity, and those that satisfy neither. We prove two generic theorems establishing the equivalence of these two partitions: all slacks-based indexes satisfy indication and hence violate continuity, and all path-based indexes satisfy continuity and hence violate indication. We also discuss the few indexes that do not belong to either of these two sets. Our hope is that these results will help guide decisions about specification of the form of efficiency indexes used in empirical analysis.","[Russell, R.

We analyse how countries have explained the equity of mitigation and adaptation in 163 INDCs, providing a bottom-up analysis of equity to complement a literature that has focused on top-down allocations. While no single indicator of equity was used by all INDCs, a menu of quantified indicators or tiered approaches could provide bounded flexibility across different national circumstances. The most common equity indicator used in mitigation INDCs is the country's 'small share' of global emissions, followed by per capita emissions. The emissions of individual 'small share' INDCs add up to 24% of annual global emissions when using a consistent data set. Per capita emissions are used across a range of countries with low (0.5) to high (25 t CO2-eq per capita) values for that indicator. Adaptation is included in 89% of INDCs, of which more than half quantify impacts in some manner, and two-thirds use vulnerability as an equity argument. Broadly, we find that most claims to equity are either unsubstantiated or drawn from analysis by in-country experts. Only two INDCs refer to independent evidence, and none consider the consequences of their approach when applied to all countries. Given that the aggregate effect of INDCs will not be sufficient to keep global temperature increase well below 2 A degrees C, and even less to keep temperature below a 1.5 A degrees C rise, the INDCs have distributional implications. More rigorous information is needed to assess relative fair shares, which could be provided officially in future nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Absent improved information, it is likely that researchers and civil society will continue to assess informally what could be considered fair. A hybrid approach to equity-combining bottom-up assessment and top-down allocation-would be consistent with the hybrid architecture of the Paris Agreement, which comprises bottom-up elements such as NDCs and top-down elements such as global goals. Improved information on equity in NDCs will be an important input to the global stocktake 'in the light of equity'.","[Winkler, Harald; Cunliffe, Guy; April, Amanda] Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, 6th Floor Menzies Bldg,Upper Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Hohne, Niklas; Kuramochi, Takeshi; Casas, Maria Jose de Villafranca] NewClimate Inst, Hof 20-26, D-50667 Cologne, Germany; [Hohne, Niklas] Wageningen Univ, Environm Syst Anal Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Cape Town; Wageningen University & Research,"Winkler, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Energy Res Ctr, 6th Floor Menzies Bldg,Upper Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",Harald.Winkler@uct.ac.za,"Winkler, Harald/AAF-6226-2020; Kuramochi, Takeshi/S-2407-2016; Höhne, Niklas/AAZ-2422-2020","Kuramochi, Takeshi/0000-0002-3976-0133; Höhne, Niklas/0000-0001-9246-8759; Winkler, Harald/0000-0002-5826-4071",UNEP,UNEP,"The article substantially extends initial work done as part of Chapter 3 of the 2015 Emissions Gap Report (den Elzen et al. 2015), on which H.W. and N.H. were lead authors and G.C. a contributing author.

CCAE sees such projects as valuable exercises in a student's education, particularly, the practical experience of interaction with 'user-experts.' In 2016 Cork County Council approached CCAE with a proposal to promote age-friendly housing as part of their age-friendly initiative. CCAE developed this into a `live project' for Year 2 architecture students, continuing the integration of UD into the curriculum. This helps students to identify the negative disabling aspects of ageing and show UD principles can be seen as commonplace. For their part, the County Council were able to expand their own thinking, availing of the less constrained ideas that students brought to their schemes. An approach to achieving the adoption of UD is to consider the Vitruvian definition of architecture as having `commodity, firmness and delight'. From this, the aesthetic integration of features to benefit users of limited ability can be achieved without stigmatising anyone as being old or disabled. Now in its second year the project is being run in West Cork. The chosen site in Bantry town centre, has interesting challenges for the students to incorporate UD principles. This paper will present imaginative but viable projects as examples of student' responses to the challenges of designing housing solutions and will report on their ability to integrate age-friendly features at different scales.","[Busby, Kevin; Harrison, Jim] UCC CIT, Cork Ctr Architectural Educ, Cork, Ireland",,"Busby, K (通讯作者)，UCC CIT, Cork Ctr Architectural Educ, Cork, Ireland.",kevin.busby@cit.ie,,,,,,,8,3,3,1,8,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-9630,1879-8365,978-1-61499-923-2; 978-1-61499-922-5,STUD HEALTH TECHNOL,,,2018,256.0,,,,,,205,213,,10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-205,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Medical Informatics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7JT,30371476.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455118100020,0

In Sendai, the Transport Bureau introduced wide entrance/exit gates to enable all passengers, including wheelchair users and others to pass through the gates more easily. What is common to them is that they required only a simple modification of existing systems, and that they were implemented by the bold decisions of transportation operators who lent an ear to users' voices as possible solutions.

Domestic mass production products can be competitive on the foreign market only if they are of adequate quality, competitive prices and can be produced in the required quantities. When it comes to appearance on the foreign market, the quantities are usually a limiting factor because the industrial potentials of the producers from the Republic of Croatia are small and insufficient for a more serious appearance on the world market. When it comes to Slavonia, which connected a good part of its mass industrial production with the processing of agricultural products of mass production, then the situation is significantly harder because the domestic raw material base for such production is significantly more expensive than the one that can be obtained on the foreign market. Therefore, Slavonia should not seek its development perspective within mass production but through highquality small-scale production or production for a well-known consumer, in line with the new digital era. The competitiveness of this type of production comes from the added value produced by the built-in knowledge of the product as well as knowledge about the customer. Accordingly, the aim of the research is to define the conceptual model of the knowledge base that would be used by the economy of Slavonia in the function of implementing the transformation from Industry 1.0 in Industry 4.0. Such a model integrates different types of information and knowledge that will help business entities, both in finding consumers and experts required to realize production on the principles of Industry 4.0.

Tax reforms are necessary to avoid this vicious circle, while streamlining the tax systems to make them simpler, faster and more effective. Special attention should be paid to coordination of tax administration at different administrative levels, increasing the tax base and strengthening transparency to deter corruption-which may thrive due to the many possibilities for interpreting tax systems.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors influencing consumers' willingness to participate in NPD activities. Design/methodology/approach A survey with 1,038 respondents was held in Denmark. Food products for weight management were used as an example to further explore these issues and test the research hypotheses. Data were analysed by means of hierarchical regression analysis. Findings Results indicated that consumer innovativeness is a key factor to stimulate participation. An increase in either cognitive or emotional dimensions also encourages consumer interaction with the company. Weight perception and willingness to participate is moderated by age group. These findings can help managers to identify key segments when developing new food products for weight management. Originality/value This study has proposed and tested a model based on relevant literature and validated scales using a model generation approach to discuss motivations and factors that influence willingness to participate in NPD projects in the food sector.","[Hoppe, Alexia] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Sch Business, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil; [De Barcellos, Marcia Dutra] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Postgrad Programme Management, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Perin, Marcelo Gattermann] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Sch Business, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Jacobsen, Lina Fogt; Lahteenmaki, Liisa] Aarhus Univ, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Management, MAPP Ctr, Aarhus, Denmark",Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Pontificia Universidade Catolica Do Rio Grande Do Sul; Aarhus University,"Hoppe, A (通讯作者)，Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Sch Business, Sao Leopoldo, Brazil.",alexiahoppe@gmail.com; mdutrab@gmail.com; mperin@pucrs.br; linaj@mgmt.au.dk; liisal@mgmt.au.dk,"Dutra de Barcellos, Marcia/F-4508-2011; Perin, Marcelo G/I-5292-2012","Dutra de Barcellos, Marcia/0000-0002-4311-2921; Perin, Marcelo G/0000-0001-9008-6802; Jacobsen, Lina/0000-0003-0896-929X",,,,,49,5,6,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Protection of the market and competition is provided through the public enforcement where competent authorities investigate and sanction violators. On the other hand, injured participants, individuals or undertakings, can obtain civil law remedies in private proceedings, such as nullity of a contractual obligation, injunction, or an award of damages. To obtain damages award injured person must prove a breach of competition law provision, sustained harm, and a causal relationship between the harm and an infringement of competition law provision. Although the compensation for injured represents the first and the main goal of private enforcement, the other role could be observed through the deterrence effect on future violators of competition law provisions. That was a path pursued by the creators of the Directive 2014/104/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the Member States and EU competition law provisions. This paper analyses the development of tort liability for the infringements of competition law within the European Union law, but also in Croatia, where such damages claims are still an exception. After the adoption of the Procedure on damages actions for infringements of the competition law Act in July 2017, the situation could be different. New Act contains substantive and procedural law provisions, which put injured market participants in better position in achieving their right to damages award.","[Kekez, Durda Bolanca] Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Kekez, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Law, Split, Croatia.",durda.bolanca@prayst.hr,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,122,131,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600013,0

Efforts to explain this opposition have focused on perceived negative aesthetic and environmental impact. Less attention has been paid to a fuller suite of the perceived risks and benefits associated with new energy technologies. This paper thus investigates impacts of an offshore wind farm pertaining to individual perceptions and judgments, and why risks to some ecosystem services might be cause for greater public concern than others. We find that this difference can be attributed to the affective and intuitive ways in which people perceive risk. Our mixed-methods design used interviews (n = 27) that involved risk-benefit weighting tasks and an animated visualization to help people imagine an offshore wind farm in a familiar place. We found that affectively-loaded impacts (harm to charismatic wildlife and visual intrusion) were assigned greater weight than more easily quantifiable impacts (displacement of fishing, impact to tourism, cost of compliance with regulations). Interviewees identified increased regional energy self-sufficiency as the most valued potential benefit of an offshore wind farm. These results have implications for ecosystem service assessments generally and, more specifically, for our understanding of 'affective' dimensions of development proposals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Portfolio theory is applied to the growth-instability properties of German districts. Furthermore, a comprehensive diversification measure is defined. Stochastic Frontier Analysis is deployed in order to estimate whether diversification allows regions to achieve more efficient growth-instability combinations. The results confirm that diversification does generate such effects. Spatial interactions do also play a role: The effects are less pronounced for regions whose economic performance is mainly driven by the surrounding regions.","[Kluge, Jan] IHS, Res Grp Co Ind Reg, Josefstadter Str 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria",,"Kluge, J (通讯作者)，Inst Hohere Studien, Josefstadter Str 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria.",kluge@ihs.ac.at,,,,,,,55,10,13,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

It is very difficult to identify the exact number of Croatian emigrants because the data were not collected at all stages of emigration. However, the estimates indicate that almost the same number of Croatians living in Croatia live outside Croatia as well as in their homeland. Although most of the emigrants went hoping to return and considered their exile only temporary, most of them were permanent relocations to the new country. The main problem of Croatian emigration is the problem of emigration monitoring, poor written evidence, poor communication or the isolation of emigrants from the country of origin. By the end of the 20th century and by creating Croatian state independence, it was realistic to expect that emigration trends in Croatia would decline, but because of economic and economic reasons, emigration continued. Over the last decade, from Croatia emigrate more and more of its population, mostly in more developed countries of the world. The citizens of Croatia go to other countries in search of a better life. In this emigration in search of a better life and job, a special problem is young people. The issue of retention and retention of young and highly educated people is one of the most important issues of the Republic of Croatia and its resolution should be a priority before solving all the other problems. As the number of migrants increases, so the countries that receive them increase the immigration requirements, however, developed countries continue to improve the conditions for attracting highly educated, young and highly motivated people for work by offering them certain benefits. The aim of this paper is to show the most attractive destinations - countries of Croatian emigration through the waves of emigration. Particular attention is focused on the latest and the most recent wave of migration. In this study is included the analysis of the collected statistical data and survey, which was conducted among a representative sample of respondents, adults who have left the Republic of Croatia after the war, from 1996 to today.","[Knezevic, Sanja] Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Hrvatska, Croatia",University of Slavonski Brod,"Knezevic, S (通讯作者)，Coll Slavonski Brod, Dr Mile Budaka 1, Slavonski Brod 35000, Hrvatska, Croatia.",sanja.knezevic@vusb.hr,"Knezevic Kusljic, Sanja/ABB-6174-2021","Knezevic Kusljic, Sanja/0000-0003-1298-4281",,,,,2,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,319,325,,,,,,7,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900033,0

The third question is whether the level of equity cost differ in the different branches in which the SMEs operate. And the last question is whether the equity cost is affected by selected factors. The research is based on the set of 16,302 companies data of which were obtained from the Albertina database. The results confirmed the findings of previous research: the highest costs are associated with the capital employed in micro and small firms and in the field of Accommodation, meals and hospitality. The factor affecting the level of the equity cost was identified the volume of sales achieved.

Either voluntary or imposed by health issues, they may be accompanied by alterations in sensory acuity. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how lifelong food habits and health-age issues affect food choice at a later age, with the aim of developing strategies to direct aged people toward healthier food habits. Design/methodology/approach A survey, aimed to investigate differences between current and past food habits, was carried out in a group of 170 Italian older adults. Questions focused on the composition of the main meal, asking participants to describe its actual structure and to highlight differences in previous years' food habits. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was planned, during which participants were asked to help formulating innovative pasta sauces with healthy ingredients. Findings This survey clearly illustrated gender-related differences: women were characterized by a higher consumption of vegetables, while men revealed a more frequent use of wine, pasta and meat. The DCE technique suited older adults' abilities and enabled the development of innovative sauces, indicating a clear preference for extra virgin olive oil, as compared to cream or butter. Gender-related differences were confirmed: women mainly chose a vegetarian sauce, while men expressed an inclination for red meat. Originality/value This is the first report of a successful application of the DCE technique to investigate older adults' dietary choices. The outspoken preference for olive oil as fat in sauce composition is a positive finding for future actions aimed at directing older adults toward healthier food habits.","[Predieri, Stefano; Gatti, Edoardo; Magli, Massimiliano; Rossi, Federica; Daniele, Giulia Maria; Cianciabella, Marta] Inst Biometeorol, Bologna, Italy; [Sotis, Gianluca; Rodino, Paola; Volpe, Roberto] SPP CNR, Rome, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Biometeorologia (IBIMET-CNR),"Gatti, E (通讯作者)，Inst Biometeorol, Bologna, Italy.",s.predieri@ibimet.cnr.it; gianluca.sotis@cnr.it; paola.rodino@cnr.it; e.gatti@ibimet.cnr.it; m.magli@ibimet.cnr.it; F.ROSSI@IBIMET.CNR.IT; GM.DANIELE@IBIMET.CNR.IT; M.CIANCIABELLA@IBIMET.CNR.IT; roberto.volpe@cnr.it,"GATTI, EDOARDO/C-4343-2015; Volpe, Roberto/AAY-4113-2020; rodino, paola/AAX-5809-2020; Predieri, Stefano/C-4392-2015","Predieri, Stefano/0000-0003-4270-4914; CIANCIABELLA, MARTA/0000-0002-3706-5428; Daniele, Giulia Maria/0000-0002-4709-4097; Sotis, Gianluca/0000-0002-3263-6893; GATTI, EDOARDO/0000-0001-8877-2889; Rodino, Paola/0009-0004-8729-0123; Volpe, Roberto/0000-0002-3179-593X",,,,,55,2,2,2,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach - Non-probability sampling was used to recruit a sample of 411 consumers in Southern Chile, over the age of 18 and responsible for the purchase of meat products for their household. Findings - Using a fractional factorial design for conjoint analysis, it was found in the total sample that the meat source of the meat processed product was more important than packaging, region of origin, price and the functional ingredient claim, with preference for lamb and pork meat processed products with omega-3. Two main segments were identified using a cluster analysis; these segments differed according to family size, presence and age of children, ethnic origin, general health interest, quality of diet and level of satisfaction with food-related life. The largest segment (56.0 percent) shows a high preference toward lamb meat processed product with dietary fiber and omega-3. The second (33.6 percent) preferred turkey meat processed product with antioxidants. Practical implications - A differentiated marketing strategy with different meat sources and functional ingredients may give access to a large market share. People more willing to accept different functional ingredients in processed meat products may enjoy a better quality of life. The level of satisfaction with food-related life and quality of diet can be useful in explaining preferences for functional meat processed products. Originality/value - This is the first study to evaluate consumer acceptance of a functional meat processed product made with three different meats and three different functional ingredient claims, which analyzed the relationship between acceptance, the consumer's quality of diet and their level of satisfaction with food-related life.","[Schnettler, Berta; Sepulveda, Nestor; Bravo, Silvana] Univ La Frontera, Fac Agr & Forest Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Schnettler, Berta; Hueche, Clementina] Univ La Frontera, Ctr Excellence Econ & Consumer Psychol, Nucleus Social Sci, Temuco, Chile; [Grunert, Klaus G.] Aarhus Univ, MAPP Ctr, Sch Business & Social Sci, Dept Management, Aarhus, Denmark",Universidad de La Frontera; Universidad de La Frontera; Aarhus University,"Schnettler, B (通讯作者)，Univ La Frontera, Fac Agr & Forest Sci, Temuco, Chile.;Schnettler, B (通讯作者)，Univ La Frontera, Ctr Excellence Econ & Consumer Psychol, Nucleus Social Sci, Temuco, Chile.",berta.schnettler@ufrontera.cl,"Marchán, Silvana Bravo/AAF-8532-2020; Sepulveda, Nestor/H-8699-2018","Marchán, Silvana Bravo/0000-0002-7686-0168;",Project FIC Regional Conicyt [VCE5C000002]; Fondecyt Project [1160005],Project FIC Regional Conicyt; Fondecyt Project(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT),This work was funded by the Project FIC Regional 2015-Conicyt (VCE5C000002) and Fondecyt Project (1160005).,,49,16,17,2,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

Design/methodology/approach Fresh fruit juice samples (n=125) were randomly collected using aseptic technique. Each sample (10mL) was serially diluted with 90mL of sterile peptone water, from 1x10(-1) to 1x10(-5). Each dilution was then used to inoculate nutrient agar by surface spread plating. Aerobic colony counts (ACCs) were determined by colony counting. The isolates were sub-cultured on blood and MacConkey agar. Preliminary identification was achieved on the basis of colony morphology and culture characteristic, and confirmed by API (R) 20E, 20NE, and API (R) Staph testing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay, per CLSI 2015 guidelines. Findings The mean ACC ranged from 2.0x10(6)CFU/mL to 4.93x10(6)CFU/mL, with the highest ACC determined for orange juice. Overall, 153 polymicrobial were identified in 125 samples; 103 of these were Gram-negative rods (GNR) and 28 were Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Escherichia coli (n=38), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=32) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=24) were the predominant GNR; Staphylococcus aureus (n=28) was the predominant GPC. Antibiogram analysis revealed that all GNR were resistant to ampicillin. However, most E. coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime (72.4 percent of isolates), and ceftriaxone and cefepime (68.9 percent), while most K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to cefepime (72 percent) and ceftriaxone (64 percent). All S. aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin, while most (64 percent) were resistant to piperacillin; the most effective drugs against bacteria were vancomycin and imipenem. Practical implications The findings suggest that the local government regulatory food and public health authorities should take immediate emergency measures. Appropriate surveillance studies and periodic monitoring of food items should be regularly performed to safeguard public health. Originality/value The current study revealed the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in freshly prepared fruit juices sold by local street vendors.","[Siddique, Muhammad Hussnain; Nadeem, Habibullah] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Qamar, Muhammad Usman; Hayat, Sumreen; Aslam, Bilal; Saqalein, Muhammad; Saeed, Javeria; Muzammil, Saima] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Microbiol, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Hussain, Sabir] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Government College University Faisalabad; Government College University Faisalabad; Government College University Faisalabad,"Muzammil, S (通讯作者)，Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Microbiol, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",mhs1049@gmail.com; musmanqamar@gcuf.edu.pk; sumreenhayat@gcuf.edu.pk; drbilalaslam@gcuf.edu.pk; habibullah@gcuf.edu.pk; sabirghani@gmail.com; drsaqalein@gcuf.edu.pk; white_golden2002@yahoo.com; saimamuzammil83@gmail.com,"Muzammil, Saima/ABX-0853-2022; ASLAM, BILAL/AAX-6227-2020; Qamar, Muhammad Usman/AAW-9260-2021; Qamar, Muhammad/GPW-8701-2022; Hayat, Sumreen/I-8758-2019; Hussain, Sabir/AGJ-2066-2022","Muzammil, Saima/0000-0002-7775-8878; ASLAM, BILAL/0000-0002-5568-5049; Qamar, Muhammad Usman/0000-0002-2636-238X; Hussain, Sabir/0000-0002-5720-7120; Saqalein, Muhammad/0000-0001-7247-8511; Siddique, Muhammad Hussnain/0000-0003-3700-0509; aqeel, Aliaa/0000-0001-9694-1021",,,,,34,2,2,1,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

This phenomenon created by the developing labour market cannot be handled by the traditional ways of legislation. This process has been fastening and becoming more and more complex, thus, the forthcoming tasks cannot be foreseen yet. On the other hand, it can be stated, that despite the changing economical environment, the goals and targets of labour law are persistent. Unfortunately, the recent attempts (e.g. the idea of flexicurity) were not able to divert the unwanted processes, so there is still challenge to find the ideal solution. This, we think, cannot be a command and control type legislative action, but a multi-layered complex and coherent system, in which the already achieved results of the multinational companies (e.g. International Framework Agreements) will embody a new platform of protection. To stimulate the above mentioned developing area of labour law, the state has to create some kind of relation to this process, in which a complex legal framework should be established. In this new legal environment the classical approach of law (command and control) should be overshadowed by the principle of transparency and the voluntarily cooperation. The greatest issue in this project is to find the proper tools with which the original purpose of the above mentioned legal institutes can be upheld, but legal guarantee can be presented at the same time. With this method, the classical hard law frames of labour law could be covered with a band new soft law coat, which could result a new level of protection of the worker's rights.","[Sipka, Peter; Puskas, Agnes] Univ Debrecen, Fac Agr Environm & Labour Law, Kassai Str 26, H-4026 Debrecen, Hungary",University of Debrecen,"Sipka, P (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Fac Agr Environm & Labour Law, Kassai Str 26, H-4026 Debrecen, Hungary.",iroda@drsipka.hu; agnes.puskas@drsipka.hu,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,427,435,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics; Law",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies; Government & Law,BP1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540727600049,0

Even more so if they are eligible to draw from the Cohesion Fund targeted at the less developed EU countries. In many of these countries, we observe an EU-funds cycle that causes spikes in total investment as the programming period draws near to its end, and a decline after the new programming period begins. As the share of EU-funded public investment and the public investment financed from domestic sources varies highly over time, we decided to explore the differences in the transmission of these two types of public investment shocks into the real economy. We use a version of the EAGLE model calibrated for the Slovak economy integrated in the euro area and extended with EU funds mechanisms. We find that if the part of the total investment that is funded from domestic sources comes from an increase in taxes, the EU-funded investment delivers larger improvement in real GDP. The difference is especially striking for investment funded by an increase of social security contributions paid by firms. Debt-financed public investment delivers virtually the same results irrespective of whether it is co-financed from EU funds or not.","[Tvrz, Stanislav; Zeleznik, Martin] Natl Bank Slovakia, Bratislava, Slovakia",National Bank of Slovakia,"Tvrz, S (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Slovakia, Bratislava, Slovakia.",stanislav.tvrz@nbs.sk; martin.zeleznik@nbs.sk,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,UNIV HRADEC KRALOVE,HRADEC KRALOVE 3,"ROKITANSKEHO 62, HRADEC KRALOVE 3, 500 03, CZECH REPUBLIC",2464-6059,2464-6067,978-80-7435-701-5,HRADEC ECON DAYS,,,2018,8.0,,2,,,,429,441,,,,,,13,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL3AA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449443600042,0

Six dynamic panel models have been estimated using Arellano and Bond GMM estimator and all data have been obtained from OECD. Labour productivity, as a dependant variable, is measured by GDP per hour worked where labour input is defined as total hours worked of all persons engaged in production. Obtained results confirmed the expectation that countries with higher rates of GDP growth, likely with favourable economic conditions, will witness an increase in labour productivity. Regarding gross domestic expenditure on R& D, here presented results confirm its positive impact to labour productivity whether these investments have a direct impact as an input of production or an indirect impact via spill over effects. Employment protection makes it more difficult/expensive for employers to adjust the level of employment to current needs of a production, while from employees' point of view employment protection can improve their productivity due to more reassuring working condition. Since it has a positive and significant impact on labour productivity in three out of five models, it seems that employment protection has a stronger impact on employees than on employers. Results of the analysis on the impact of unemployment rate and employment/population ratio are consistent and in accordance to expectations. Namely, unemployment rate has a positive, while employment/population ratio has a negative impact on labour productivity meaning that higher rates of unemployment in a country make workers try harder to keep their job while at the same time employers focus on more productive, high-skilled labour while less productive workers are fired.","[Visic, Josipa] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia",University of Split,"Visic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Cvite Fiskovica 5, Split 21000, Croatia.",josipa.visic@efst.hr,"Visic, Josipa/D-4807-2017","Visic, Josipa/0000-0002-2536-8317",,,,,20,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2018,,,,,,,396,405,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445029900041,0

It finds strong differences in these economies arising from both measurement and study-specific characteristics. Economies generated from domestic rather than foreign activity have the strongest effects on FDI, with the latter only significant if related to the home country of the investor. Support is also found for studies that identify different sources of agglomeration economies, although this is largely underexplored in the empirical literature. The average agglomeration economies estimate is not influenced by publication bias and indicates genuine effects for agglomeration economies on FDI location choice.","[Jones, Jonathan] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Jones, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",jonathan.jones@ncl.ac.uk,,"Jones, Jonathan/0000-0003-3619-0777",,,,,143,13,14,3,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4146,1467-9787,,J REGIONAL SCI,J.

However, their methodological approaches vary greatly, with significant impacts on results. Therefore, we make a review of past studies to identify, synthesize and discuss methodological differences, to contribute to a more consistent and robust approach to societal exergy accounting. Issues that should be taken into account when making methodological options are discussed and key insights are presented: (1) For mapping of primary inputs and useful exergy categories, the inclusion of all natural resources is more consistent but it has the cost of not being able to distinguish the various energy end-uses in the production of materials. (2) To estimate primary electricity, none of the methods currently used is able to capture simultaneously the efficiency of the renewable energy sector, the environmental impact and the efficiency of energy use in society. (3) To estimate final-to-useful exergy conversion efficiencies, standard thermodynamic definitions should be used because the use of proxies fails to distinguish between increases in exergy efficiency and increases in the efficiency of providing energy services.

Due to the multidimensional nature of the sustainability concept and the difficulties encountered in its measurement, composite indicators have increasingly been used as useful tools for the operationalization of sustainability. In this paper the study of tourism sustainability of Spanish regions is addressed by building a composite indicator that uses multicriteria decision techniques for the aggregation and weighting of the simple indicators considered. The developed index allows the representation of both the weak and strong sustainability paradigms, as well as other compromising, midway concepts between those. Moreover, the sustainability performance of the studied regions can be easily compared and a fair ranking of the regions can accordingly be obtained, which can serve as a starting point that stimulates public and private debate and promotes improvement actions to achieve sustainability.

This paper tests the hypothesis that the increase of German and British energy intensity was an effect from the concentration of heavy industrial production to these countries, although the consumption of a significant share of these goods took place elsewhere. We use an entirely new database that we have constructed (TEG: Trade, Energy, Growth) to test whether these countries exported more energy-demanding goods than they imported, thus providing other countries with means to industrialize and to consume cheap-energy demanding goods. We find that the U-shape curve is greatly diminished but does not disappear. The pronounced inverted U-curve in German energy intensity without trade adjustments is reduced when we account for energy embodied in the traded commodities. For Britain the shape of the curve is also flattened during the second half of the 19th century, before falling from WWI onwards. These consumption-based accounts are strongly influenced by the trade in metal goods and fuels, facilitating industrialization elsewhere. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Each methodology varied in data resolution, methodological complexity and degree of local participation. We collected quantitative and qualitative information on four aspects of performance: accuracy; costs; local equity; and local legitimacy. We show that methodologies with greater data resolution and local participation performed better in all four aspects, while greater methodological complexity was not associated with significantly improved performance. We conclude that monitoring in smallholder and other types of PES may be improved through: 1) devolving analyses to the local level; 2) communicating to stakeholders a distinction between 'applied' and 'scientific' accuracy; and 3) documenting and communicating the diverse functions of monitoring, referred to here as co-benefits - a contrast to simple 'monitor and pay' conceptions of PES.

This article maintains that they do exist and are partly caused by the fact that sharecropping is hardly compatible with the tenant being compensated for improvements, viticulture being the main historical exception. In line with recent contributions to the sharecropping literature, the article contends that the widely held belief among scholars of agricultural contracts that sharecropping was very frequent in Europe's vineyards is incorrect. However, it also provides evidence of an issue whose importance has gone largely unnoticed: prior to the twentieth century, many of the European vineyards worked by sharecroppers had been created by the sharecroppers themselves, through contracts which entitled them to compensation. Those contracts abounded while viticulture depended basically on two inputs, land and labour. When viticulture became a heavy consumer of capital, they were rapidly abandoned, but not in Catalonia, with a paradoxical result: the Catalan rabassa morta contract, which for centuries hadmade it possible to eliminate both the long-and short-terminefficiencies of sharecropping, ended up becoming an obstacle to overcoming the short-term inefficiencies. The article discusses why that happened.","[Garrido, Samuel] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Garrido, S (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",,,"Garrido, Samuel/0000-0003-2321-0767","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2012-36213, ECO2015-66196-P]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),"This article has benefited from financial assistance from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, research projects ECO2012-36213 and ECO2015-66196-P.

For instance, loan-to-value ratios often did not exceed 50 per cent. Using newly discovered archival documents and data from 1934, this article uncovers a darker side of 1920s US mortgage lending: the so-called 'second mortgage system'. As borrowers often could not make a 50 per cent down payment, a majority of them took second mortgages at usurious rates. As theory predicts, debt dilution, even in the presence of seniority rules, can be highly detrimental to both junior and senior lenders. The probability of default on first mortgages was likely to increase, and commercial banks were more likely to foreclose. Through foreclosure they would still be able to retrieve 50 per cent of the property value, but often after a protracted foreclosure process. This would have put further strain on banks during liquidity crises. This article is thus a timely reminder that second mortgages, or 'piggyback loans' as they are called today, can be hazardous to lenders and borrowers alike. It provides further empirical evidence that debt dilution can be detrimental to credit.","[Postel-Vinay, Natacha] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Postel-Vinay, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,Economic and Social Research Council,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am very grateful to my advisors Olivier Accominotti and Albrecht Ritschl for their continuous support and guidance.

Based on an assessment of both policy reports and peer -reviewed studies, this article presents evidence that energy subsidies could reach into the trillions of dollars each year. It also highlights how most subsidies appear to offer net costs to society, rather than benefits, in the form of government deficits, increased waste, shortages of energy fuels, and aggravated environmental impacts, among others. The review then talks about how tools such as best practices in measurement and estimation, subsidy elimination, impact studies, and adjustment packages can dramatically reorient subsidies so that they become more socially and environmentally sustainable. It also argues that such efforts need to explicitly learn from previous successes and recognize the importance of political economy, the possible winners and losers to subsidy reform.

While continued economic growth is ecologically unsustainable, low or negative rates of economic growth are accompanied by adverse social impacts. Hence there is a need for macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable post-growth pathways. The emerging field of ecological macroeconomics aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different models incorporate policy themes from the post-growth literature. Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to eight policy themes. It was found that environmental interactions and the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the combination of input-output analysis with stock-flow consistent modelling was identified as a promising avenue for developing macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide interpretation of what the economy entails, future research will benefit from employing a range of approaches.(C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Computing decoupling factors as defined by the OECD (2002), we find that in almost all sectors and by almost all pollutants the median EU country had at least some decoupling. However, considerable heterogeneity in its magnitude can be observed across countries, sectors, and pollutants. For most pollutants and sectors, median decoupling performance improved from 2001-2008 compared to 1995-2001, while between-country disparities increased simultaneously. In a second step, we investigate country-level changes in decoupling states between the two sub-periods based on Tapio (2005). We find high diversity across countries and over time. To explain these differences across countries and sectors, we assess the impact of environmental policy stringency, and find tentative evidence that stricter policy encourages decoupling, however the effects are small and imprecise, differ by economic sector and pollutant, and take several years to materialize.

Though prior research has shown that compliments will influence a prospective buyer's decision, it is unknown the extent to which salespersons should make these investments. In this paper, we develop an analytical model to examine how seller and buyer characteristics affect the equilibrium provision of compliments by the seller. We establish that the optimal magnitude of compliments is non-monotonic in the buyer's sensitivity to compliments. We identify conditions for when a seller of a high-quality product will offer greater (or lesser) compliments than a seller of a lower quality product. We show that, under certain conditions, an uninformed buyer earns greater utility than a buyer who knows the quality of the seller's product. The findings have implications for sellers in their choice of compliments and buyers in the inferences they draw from the compliments received.","[Sayedi, Amin; Shulman, Jeffrey D.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Sayedi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",aminsa@uw.edu; jshulman@uw.edu,,"Shulman, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5288-3421",,,,,59,3,3,3,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1570-7156,1573-711X,,QME-QUANT MARK ECON,QME-Quant.

However, the transaction costs (TCs) involved are typically unknown or unquantified and therefore often neglected. In this study three types of TCs (search, design and negotiation costs) were measured in person-days and monetary terms based on a global survey of forestry carbon projects implemented across Latin-America, Asia and Africa. Cost estimates vary between zero and 1.201/tCO(2) for person-days and from zero to US$ 1.738/tCO(2) for monetary costs. Key drivers of TCs are identified based on the characteristics of the project in general, the transaction, the transactors involved and institutional design.

Evidence from California and Florida,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transaction costs; Solid waste; Sharing economy,SUSTAINABILITY; GENERATION; EFFICIENCY,"There is much discussion but little research on the environmental impacts of online platforms associated with the sharing economy. Economic theory suggests that falling transaction costs in secondhand markets increase incentives for people to exchange rather than discard used goods. This paper uses difference-in-difference methods to estimate Craigslist's effect on solid waste by exploiting a natural experiment in how the platform expanded across California and Florida. The econometric results suggest that Craigslist reduced daily pet capita solid waste generation by about one third of a pound, though the estimates are not very precise. A plausibility analysis of the weight of items posted on Craigslist concludes that the 200 million annual for-sale posts created by Californians and Floridians can reasonably account for waste reductions of roughly this magnitude.

Drawing upon the recent work on adaptive responses in relation to growth, it presents prenatal and postnatal adaptive mechanisms that affect the growth patterns of children. The most novel adaptive response to the historical literature is the prenatal predictive adaptive response where the metabolism and growth trajectory of a child is programmed to match predicted conditions later in life. Having discussed the framework in detail, a reinterpretation of the growth pattern of American slaves is then suggested. It seems likely that a mismatch between relatively good conditions in utero and absolutely appalling conditions in infancy and early childhood led slave children to become extremely stunted by the age of three or four. However, after this age, slave children experienced catch-up growth because their immune systems had become more developed and because their diet improved tremendously and hookworm exposure was reduced. Thus, it seems that American slave children may have experienced substantial catch-up growth because they were prenatally programmed for a higher metabolism and growth trajectory. The article concludes by setting out some stylized facts about children's growth in the past and pointing toward areas of future research.","[Schneider, Eric B.] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Schneider, EB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Econ Hist Dept, London, England.",e.b.schneider@lse.ac.uk,,"Schneider, Eric/0000-0001-7682-0126",,,,,99,24,26,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0117,1468-0289,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

The potential of PES is linked to the relationship between the willingness to pay (WTP) of ecosystem service buyers and the willingness to accept (WTA) of ecosystem service providers. This study uses an economic model to analyze factors that influence aggregate WTP and WTA in a PES scheme. We demonstrate that wealth disparity between ecosystem services buyers and providers can increase transactions. Furtherinore, when wealth disparity exists between the buyers and sellers, the wealthier population would contribute more into the program and the poorer population would benefit more from it Under these conditions, PES can be socially progressive and mitigate preexisting economic inequality. In this sense, the economic model provides justification for integration of PES and poverty alleviation programs. Results of our study indicate that PES is not a universally applicable conservation tool, and there is a need for a more targeted approach to the design and application of PES. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, mutual ownership has been identified as one means of helping to redeem' capitalism. This article engages with such issues by examining aspects of the behaviour of consumer cooperative societies in Scotland from the 1870s to the 1960s. It starts by discussing whether cooperatives represent a means of conceptualizing and undertaking economic activity that provides an alternative to the paradigm of investor-led (neo)liberal capitalism. From this, and an outline history of consumer cooperatives in Scotland, it identifies two variablesdividend on purchases and funds for educationas proxies for the values underpinning cooperatives' economic behaviour. Analysis of these variables indicates the existence of distinct cultures of cooperation, notably in the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas. The article concludes by offering two lessons from history' for those interested in alternative economic networks. The first is that cooperation can, and has, conceptualized and sustained an alternative to the dominant (neo)liberal economic paradigm. The second is that the scaling-up of such voluntaristic economic thought and behaviour is unlikely to present a macro-level challenge to it.","[Watts, D. C.

However, the optimal gas composition is critical, as respiratory metabolism under low oxygen conditions can shift to a fermentative metabolism. This shift is expected to be regulated by changes in the level of involved enzymes, affecting their overall activity. In this work, we developed a kinetic modeling approach to estimate in vitro the specific enzyme activity from the spectrophotometric assay data of two main fermentation enzymes extracted from 'Jonagold' apple (Malus x domestica Borkh. 'Jonagold'). This model takes into account the entire progress of the curve to analyze the enzyme activity of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. The kinetic model is based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics and first-order kinetics, which describe the conversion of substrate into product by the enzyme. It can accurately predict the enzyme activity of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. In contrast to the law of Lambert Beer, the model is also valid when the assumption of linearity is not fulfilled. The use of a kinetic model to estimate enzyme activity can be extended to other enzymes as long as the underlying reaction mechanism is known.","[Boeckx, J.; Hertog, M. L. A. T. M.; Geeraerd, A.

Departing from the past contributions, which focused either on the theories of environmental behavior or on economic interests, this paper develops arguments about political choice mechanisms that help explain the linkages between inequality and national policymaldng related to the establishment of protected areas. A cross-national analysis of the interactions between inequality, democracy and the legal designation of protected areas in a global sample of 137 countries shows that, ceteris paribus, the effects of inequality vary depending on the strength of democracy: in relatively democratic countries inequality is associated with less land in protected areas, whereas in relatively undemocratic countries the reverse is true. The highly significant effects of inequality undermine the democratic dividend in the arena of nature conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The paper analyses the water and waste utility service, presents the state of utilities sector, and the flows in local loops scenario, specifying then technological solutions. It is presented the development of municipal utility services and forms of organization of public utilities, the key issues, challenges, potential technical, legislative, institutional arrangements and concrete measures. Based on relevant literature and archice sources, the author warns of problems with environmental protection, and its early warning signs dating back to early medieval times. Indeed, the problem receives its modern terms in Modern Era, namely, during the second half of 19th and early 20th century. Growth of economy, commerce and crafts, as well as building of roads and slow industrialization faced the town of Osijek with problems of environmental protection in various ways. Therefore, the problems of environmental protection in the city of Osijek were caused by urban and social construction of the city, its gradual industrialization, as well as the social problems of the city and other social events. How much the issue of environmental protection and nature was important can be seen from the legal regulation of the Croatian Parliament and the Croatian Government of the Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia in Zagreb. In accordance with that, in 1884 Croatian parliament brought a Law on crafts, wich, naturally, had to be put in effect in Osijek too. Articles 25-36 give ruling on environment and ecology issues, as well as possible ways to deal with problems. Beside, environmental protection and clean streets were needed, as in the late 19th century Osijek had a Town embellishment society wich tried to form and build up citizens' awareness of ecology issues and the need for environmental protection.","[Lachner, Visnja] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Lachner, V (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",vlachner@pravos.hr,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2017,,,,,,,647,656,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BK9UJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445028500062,0

Design/methodology/approach - The ripe fruits of palmyra (Borassus flabellifer L) were collected around Kupang city, Indonesia. The pulp was extracted with different techniques. The fresh pulp was directly analyzed for its nutritional and antioxidant properties. The rest of the pulp was de-bittered, dried and used for further treatments and products development. The de-bittered pulp was used to make chips, stick cracker, and jelly sweet. Fresh products were sensory evaluated by 30 semi-trained panelists. For shelf-life analysis, products were wrapped and/or packed with different thickness of food grade plastic, plastic-alumina foil, or mica stopples and kept at different temperatures (30, 40 and 50 degrees C) for one month. Findings - The fresh pulp contains carotenoids (609.10 mg per kg of pulp), vitamin C (461.40 mg per kg of pulp), polyphenols (270 mg per kg of pulp) and anthocyanin (53.90 mg per kg of pulp). Free radical scavenging activity of the dried pulp (water content of 11.60 percent) was 93.4 percent. Several techniques including fermentation, sodium carbonate, and PEG treatment have been successfully developed to reduce the bitterness of the pulp without significantly reducing its antioxidant activities. Food products (chips, stick cracker, and jelly sweet) have then been developed and have got positive response from panelist. Research limitations/implications - Pulp of fruit is a potential source of antioxidants, i.e. carotenoids (pro vitamin A), vitamin C, and polyphenols. The pulp potentially can be used in fresh and dried form for functional food. The bitterness of the pulp can be significantly reduced using fermentation, sodium carbonate or PEG treatment. The pulp can be utilized for producing chips, crackers, and semi moist food products. Practical implications - First, pulp of the palmyrah fruit can be easily extracted using water. Second, the bitterness of the pulp can be reduced by using traditional fermentation starter. Third, many type of food products can be developed using the palmyrah pulp. Social implications - This effort offers opportunity for farmers to optimize the use of palmyrah pulp for functional food. It will provide new jobs and increase the income of farmer at East Nusa Tenggara Province. Originality/value - The study has revealed that pulp of palmyrah fruit is a source of antioxidants: carotenoids (pro vitamin A), vitamin C, and polyphenols. The pulp potentially can be used in fresh and dried form for functional food. The bitterness of the pulp can be significantly reduced using fermentation, sodium carbonate, and PEG. The pulp can be utilized for producing chips, crackers, and semi moist food products.","[Lalel, Herianus Justhianus D.] Univ Nusa Cendana, Fac Agr, Kupang, Indonesia; [Mahayasa, I.

Our sample represents about 25% of the ENERGY STAR (R) qualified homes in the area. We use panel models and a modified repeat sales approach to estimate energy savings of ENERGY STAR (R) residences relative to Non-ENERGY STAR (R) ones, while controlling for the bundle of house attributes, spatial and temporal fixed effects, changes in the Florida State Building Code (FBC), and household changes.
