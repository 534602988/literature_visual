Objective The objective of this study was to provide a systematic review of published CUAs of healthcare technologies in Brazil. Methods We performed a systematic review of economic evaluations studies published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), NHS EED (National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database), HTA (Health Technology Assessment) Database, Web of Science, Scopus, Bireme (Biblioteca Regional de Medicina), BVS ECOS (Health Economics database of the Brazilian Virtual Library of Health), and SISREBRATS (Sistema de Informacao da Rede Brasileira de Avaliacao de Tecnologias em Saude [Brazilian Network for the Evaluation of Health Technologies]) from 1980 to 2013. Articles were included if they were CUAs according to the classification devised by Drummond et al. Two independent reviewers screened articles for relevance and carried out data extraction. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or through consultation with a third reviewer. We performed a qualitative narrative synthesis. Results Of the 535 health economic evaluations (HEEs) relating to Brazil, only 40 were CUAs and therefore included in the analysis. Most studies adhered to methodological guidelines for quality of reporting and 77.5% used quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as the health outcome. Of these studies, 51.6% did not report the population used to elicit preferences for outcomes and 45.2% used a specific population such as expert opinion. The preference elicitation method was not reported in 58.1% of these studies. The majority (80.6%) of studies did not report the instrument used to derive health state valuations and no publication reported whether tariffs (or preference weights) were national or international. No study mentioned the methodology used to estimate QALYs. Conclusions Many published Brazilian cost-utility studies adhere to key recommended general methods for HEE; however, the use of QALY calculations is far from being the current international standard. Development of health preferences research can contribute to quality improvement of health technology assessment reports in Brazil.","[Campolina, Alessandro G.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Med, Canc Inst Sao Paulo ICESP, Ctr Translat Res Oncol, Av Dr Arnaldo 251,8 Andar, BR-01246000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Rozman, Luciana M.; Decimoni, Tassia C.; Leandro, Roseli; Novaes, Hillegonda M.

In particular, the proposed medium band least squares (MBLS) estimator uses sample-size-dependent trimming of frequencies in the vicinity of the origin to account for such contamination. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the MBLS estimator are established, a feasible inference procedure is proposed, and rigorous tools for assessing the cointegration strength and testing MBLS against the existing narrow band least squares estimator are developed. Finally, the asymptotic framework for the MBLS estimator is used to provide new perspectives on volatility factors in an empirical application to long-span realized variance series for S&P 500 equities.

J,"Datta, A; Dave, D",,,,"Datta, Anusua; Dave, Dhaval",,,Effects of Physician-directed Pharmaceutical Promotion on Prescription Behaviors: Longitudinal Evidence,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,prescription drugs; detailing; sales; promotion; healthcare costs,INFORMATION; CHOICE; IMPACT; DRUGS,"Spending on prescription drugs (Rx) represents one of the fastest growing components of US healthcare spending and has coincided with an expansion of pharmaceutical promotional spending. Most (83%) of Rx promotion is directed at physicians in the form of visits by pharmaceutical representatives (known as detailing) and drug samples provided to physicians' offices. Such promotion has come under increased public scrutiny, with critics contending that physician-directed promotion may play a role in raising healthcare costs and may unduly affect physicians' prescribing habits towards more expensive, and possibly less cost-effective, drugs. In this study, we bring longitudinal evidence to bear upon the question of how detailing impacts physicians' prescribing behaviors. Specifically, we examine prescriptions and promotion for a particular drug class based on a nationally representative sample of 150,000 physicians spanning 24months. The use of longitudinal physician-level data allows us to tackle some of the empirical concerns in the extant literature, virtually all of which have relied on aggregate national data. We estimate fixed-effects specifications that bypass stable unobserved physician-specific heterogeneity and address potential targeting bias. In addition, we also assess differential effects at both the extensive and intensive margins of prescribing behaviors and differential effects across physician-level and market-level characteristics, questions that have not been explored in prior work. The estimates suggest that detailing has a significant and positive effect on the number of new scripts written for the detailed drug, with an elasticity magnitude of 0.06. This effect is substantially smaller than those in the literature based on aggregate information, suggesting that most of the observed relationship between physician-directed promotion and drug sales is driven by selection bias. We find that detailing impacts selective brand-specific demand but does not have any substantial effects on class-level demand. The increase in brand-specific demand appears to crowd out demand for the substitute branded drug although not for the generic alternative. Results also indicate that most of the detailing response may operate at the extensive margin; detailing affects the probability of prescribing the drug more than it affects the number of prescriptions conditional on any prescribing. We draw some implications from these estimates with respect to effects on healthcare costs and public health.

Few studies have measured the economic burden of care for childhood and adolescent cancers. Objectives: To estimate costs of cancer care in population-based cohorts of children and adolescents from the public payer perspective. Methods: We identified patients with cancer, aged 91 days to 19 years, diagnosed from 1995 to 2009 using cancer registry data, and matched each to three noncancer controls. Using linked administrative health care records, we estimated total and net resource-specific costs (in 2012 Canadian dollars) during 90 days prediagnosis and 1 year postdiagnosis. Results: Children (<= 14 years old) numbered 4,396: 36% had leukemia, 21% central nervous system tumors, 10% lymphoma, and 33% other cancers. Adolescents (15-19 years old) numbered 2,329: 28.9% had lymphoma. Bone and soft tissue sarcoma, germ cell tumor, and thyroid carcinoma each comprised 12% to 13%. Mean net prediagnosis costs were $5,810 and $1,127 and mean net postdiagnosis costs were $136,413 and $62,326 for children and adolescents, respectively; the highest were for leukemia ($157,764 for children and $172,034 for adolescents). In both cohorts, costs were much higher for patients who died within 1 year of diagnosis. Inpatient hospitalization represented 69% to 74% of postdiagnosis costs. Conclusions: Treating children with cancer is costly, more costly than treating adolescents or adults. Substantial survival gains in children mean that treatment may still be very costeffective. Comprehensive age-specific population-based cost estimates are essential to reliably assess the cost-effectiveness of cancer care for children and adolescents, and measure health system performance.","[de Oliveira, Claire] Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [de Oliveira, Claire; Nathan, Paul C.; Krahn, Murray D.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Eualuat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [de Oliveira, Claire; Krahn, Murray D.] Toronto Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment Collaborat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [de Oliveira, Claire; Liu, Ning; Krahn, Murray D.] Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bremner, Karen E.; Krahn, Murray D.] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Gen Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Greenberg, Mark L.] Pediat Oncol Grp Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Greenberg, Mark L.; Nathan, Paul C.] Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada; [McBride, Mary L.] British Columbia Canc Agcy, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [McBride, Mary L.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Krahn, Murray D.] Univ Toronto, Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Krahn, Murray D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Med, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Centre for Addiction & Mental Health - Canada; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; Toronto General Hospital; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); British Columbia Cancer Agency; University of British Columbia; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Bremner, KE (通讯作者)，Toronto Gen Hosp, Room EN10-231,200 Elizabeth St, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada.",kbremner@uhnresearch.ca,"Nathan, Paul/GRR-2377-2022","Nathan, Paul/0000-0003-0334-0871; Krahn, Murray/0000-0001-5836-397X; Liu, Ning/0000-0001-9215-475X; de Oliveira, Claire/0000-0003-3961-6008","Canadian Institutes of Health Research [259504]; F.

I measure smoking behavior with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and also with serum cotinine levels, a continuous biomarker of nicotine exposure, using individual-level repeated cross-section data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. I find that the cigarette taxes lead to reductions in both the number of cigarettes smoked per day and in smokers' cotinine levels. These reductions are most pronounced in the middle quantiles of both distributions in terms of marginal effects, but most pronounced in the lower quantiles in terms of tax elasticities. I do not find that higher cigarette taxes lead to statistically significant changes in the amount of nicotine smokers ingest from each cigarette.

The interpretation is different from that in a country that evaluates medicines for a single public health insurance plan or a set of heavily regulated plans. It is shown that there will not ordinarily be a single value-based price but rather a schedule of prices with different volumes of buyers at each price. Hence, it is incorrect to term a particular price the value-based price, or to argue that the profit maximizing monopoly price is too high relative to some hypothesized value-based price. When effectiveness of treatment or value of health is heterogeneous, the profit-maximizing price can be higher than that associated with assumed values of quality-adjusted life-years. If the firm sets a price higher than the value-based price for a set of potential buyers, the optimal strategy of the buyers is to decline to purchase that drug. The profit-maximizing price will come closer to a unique value-based price if demand is less heterogeneous.","[Pauly, Mark V.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Pauly, MV (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Hlth Care Management Dept, Colonial Penn Ctr 208, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",pauly@wharton.upenn.edu,,,,,,,9,16,17,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2017,20.0,2.0,,,,,278,282,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.11.017,0.0,,,5,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HX,28237209.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396450400018,0

Because of the complexity and the abundance of possible interactions between the variables used, hardly any interactions are considered. A regression tree is used to systematically search for interactions, a methodologically new approach in risk equalization. Analyses are based on a data set of nearly 2.9 million individuals from a major German social health insurer. A two-step approach is applied: In the first step a regression tree is built on the basis of the learning data set. Terminal nodes characterized by more than one morbidity-group-split represent interaction effects of different morbidity groups. In the second step the traditional' weighted least squares regression equation is expanded by adding interaction terms for all interactions detected by the tree, and regression coefficients are recalculated. The resulting risk adjustment formula shows an improvement in the adjusted R-2 from 25.43% to 25.81% on the evaluation data set. Predictive ratios are calculated for subgroups affected by the interactions. The R-2 improvement detected is only marginal. According to the sample level performance measures used, not involving a considerable number of morbidity interactions forms no relevant loss in accuracy.

This research applies a post-positivist approach combined with qualitative data collection methods through in-depth interviews and desk reviews. The research confirms that the food consumption diversity is not optimal in Jakarta. The one cause is that the private sector has not been included in the process of policy formulation. In addition, the policy design is outdated and unspecified. Furthermore, organizational commitment and inter-organizational coordination need to be improved. Even though there is support from street-level bureaucrats and target groups, the lack of comprehension about policy and passivity of some group members become obstacles in the implementation of the policy. P2KP policy is influenced by socio-economic factors which include knowledge about nutrition, purchasing power, and lifestyle. It can be concluded that the Sustainable Food-Reserved Garden (KRPL) does not support the development of food consumption diversification as a goal of the P2KP policy in DKI Jakarta.","[Febriyanti, Anisa; Juwono, Vishnu] Univ Indonesia, Fac Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Febriyanti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Fac Adm Sci, Depok, Indonesia.",anisafebri93@yahoo.com; vjuwono@ui.ac.id,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-427-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,167.0,,,,,,42,48,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BJ6IT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426719600007,0

However, the definitive methodology for modeling of the agent's behavior in ABSS has not been established yet. This study proposes a new methodology of modeling of the agent's behavior in ABSS using Bayesian network based on the questionnaire survey. This method enables us to simultaneously perform the construction of the agent's behavior model and the estimation of the internal parameters within the model.

This paper proposes using proximity preservation, a concept in topological social choice theory, to rebuild their theorem. The advantage of the new assumption is twofold. First, it is adopted for a good substantive reason, and not for mere technical convenience-this assumption prevents magnification of small errors, and is thus irresistible for any careful social evaluations. Second, it is much weaker than any version of continuity and thus offers a much more solid foundation for the theorem. As such, the new proof in this paper greatly strengthens the original result.

Firms post wages to attract workers and matches are endogenous. Reducing the wage relative to the wage previously posted is costly to the firm, where the cost is proportional to the size of the proposed cut. Shocks to the firm's profitability may yield an equilibrium wage above what the firm would offer absent proportional adjustment costs. Wage cuts can be partial or full, immediate or delayed, and are non-linear in the shock size. Importantly, wages are sticky even if firms have negligible costs for cutting wages.

In particular, in the condition of ambiguity as well as risk, individuals tend to exhibit ambiguity aversion. The core principle of rational (consequential) behaviour conceived by Savage (1954), that is the 'Savage Sure Thing' principle, has been shown to be violated. In mathematical language, this violation is equivalent to the violation of the Law of total probability, (Kolmogorov, 1933). Given the importance of original findings in the call for a generalization of classical expected utility, we perform in this paper a set of experiments related to expressing investment preferences: (i) under objective risk, (ii) after a preceding gain, or loss. In accordance with previous findings we detected state dependence in human judgement (previous gain or loss changed the preference state of the participants) as well as violation of consequential reasoning under risk. We propose a quantum probabilistic model of agents' preferences, where non-consequentialism and state dependence can be well explained via interference of complex probability amplitudes. A geometric depiction of the experimental findings with a state reconstruction procedure from statistical data via the inverse Born's rule (1926), allows for an accurate representation of agents' preference formation in risky investment choice.

Tendering is commonly deployed for pharmaceuticals produced by multiple manufacturers (so-called multisource pharmaceuticals), to choose the product with the lowest price. Through tenders, purchasers request offers from suppliers for the needed products. The ultimate purpose of our research was to develop a guidance on robust tender processes. Therefore, we reviewed the literature to examine the effectiveness and impact of current tendering practices. In addition, we conducted a survey among tender experts from one pharmaceutical company in 17 countries with expanding healthcare coverage. In both the survey and the literature review, we confirmed that worldwide, tendering is a common practice for multisource pharmaceuticals. However, defective tendering practices may increase the vulnerability for some risks including abuse due to intransparent processes, lack of consistency, unclear tender award criteria, a focus on lowest price only, single winner tendering, and generally, a lack of impact monitoring after the end of the tender process. Hence, tenders must be well planned, managed, and conducted to be advantageous. Countries with defined and transparent tender frameworks and processes will be better equipped to achieve the desired improvements in the healthcare systems. 'Good tender practices' include the clear definition of requirements to be used as selection criteria in addition to acquisition costs, and for monitoring of the tender success. 'Good tender practices' may help to manage cost and improve healthcare at the same time.","[Maniadakis, Nikolaos; Gialama, Fotini] Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Athens, Greece; [Holtorf, Anke-Peggy] Hlth Outcomes Strategies GmbH, Colmarerstr 58, CH-4055 Basel, Switzerland; [Correa, Jose Otavio] Abbott Prod Operat AG, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Wijaya, Kalman] Abbott Prod Operat AG, Allschwil, Switzerland",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; ABB,"Holtorf, AP (通讯作者)，Hlth Outcomes Strategies GmbH, Colmarerstr 58, CH-4055 Basel, Switzerland.",anke.holtorf@health-os.com; jose.otavio@abbott.com; kalman.wijaya@abbott.com,,"Holtorf, Anke-Peggy/0000-0002-4638-5351","Abbott Products Operations AG, Allschwil, Switzerland","Abbott Products Operations AG, Allschwil, Switzerland(Abbott Laboratories)","This research resulted from a project funded by Abbott Products Operations AG, Allschwil, Switzerland.",,51,17,18,1,17,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

A key policy response is the Winter Fuel Payment (WFP), a labelled but unconditional cash transfer to households with a member above the female state pension age. The WFP has been shown to raise fuel spending among eligible households. We examine the causal effect of the WFP on health outcomes, including self-reports of chest infection, measured hypertension, and biomarkers of infection and inflammation. We find a robust, 6 percentage point reduction in the incidence of high levels of serum fibrinogen. Reductions in other disease markers point to health benefits, but the estimated effects are less robust.","[Crossley, Thomas F.] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Colchester, Essex, England; [Crossley, Thomas F.] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Zilio, Federico] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England",University of Essex; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Cambridge,"Zilio, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.",fz256@cam.ac.uk,"Zilio, Federico/W-1432-2019","Zilio, Federico/0000-0002-2586-3019; Crossley, Thomas/0000-0003-0952-7450","ESRC [ES/J500045/1]; Centre for Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy [ES/M010147/1]; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/L009153/1]; ESRC [ES/L009153/1, ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Centre for Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"ESRC, Grant/Award Number: ES/J500045/1; Centre for Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy, Grant/Award Number: ES/M010147/1; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Grant/Award Number: ES/L009153/1",,55,6,8,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,SEP,2018,27.0,9.0,,,,,1354,1365,,10.1002/hec.3666,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GP4JC,29744970.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440826700004,0

Furthermore, with non-synchronous trading and contamination of microstructure noise, we propose a nonparametrically eigenvalue-regularized integrated covariance matrix estimator (NERIVE) which does not assume specific structures for the underlying integrated covariance matrix. We show that NERIVE is positive definite in probability, with extreme eigenvalues shrunk nonlinearly under the high dimensional framework p/n -> c > 0. We also prove that in portfolio allocation, the minimum variance optimal weight vector constructed using NERIVE has maximum exposure and actual risk upper bounds of order P-1/2. Incidentally, the same maximum exposure bound is also satisfied by the theoretical minimum variance portfolio weights. All these results hold true also under a jump-diffusion model for the log-price processes with jumps removed using the wavelet method proposed in Fan and Wang (2007). They are further extended to accommodate the existence of pervasive factors such as a market factor under the setting p(3/2)/n -> c > 0. The practical performance of NERIVE is illustrated by comparing to the usual two-scale realized covariance matrix as well as some other nonparametric alternatives using different simulation settings and a real data set.

Objective: Develop and validate an algorithm using predictive modeling supported by machine learning to identify patients with hemophilia A in an administrative claims database. Methods: We first created a screening algorithm using medical and pharmacy claims to identify potential hemophilia A patients in the US HealthCore Integrated Research Database between January 1, 2006 and April 30, 2015. Medical records for a random sample of patients were reviewed to confirm case status. In this validation sample, we used lasso logistic regression with cross-validation to select covariates in claims data and develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of being a confirmed hemophilia A case. Results: The screening algorithm identified 2,252 patients and we reviewed medical records for 400 of these patients. The screening algorithm had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 65%. The predictive model identified 18 predictors of being a hemophilia A case or noncase. The strongest predictors of case status included male sex, factor VIII therapy, office visits for hemophilia A, and hospitalizations for hemophilia A. The strongest predictors of noncase status included hospitalizations for reasons other than hemophilia A and factor VIIa therapy. A probability threshold of >0.6 resulted in a PPV of 94.7% (95% CI: 92.0-97.5) and sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI: 91.5-97.2). Conclusions: We developed and validated an algorithm to identify hemophilia A cases in an administrative claims database with high sensitivity and high PPV.","[Lyons, Jennifer; Desai, Vibha; Lanes, Stephan] HealthCore, Wilmington, DE USA; [Xu, Yaping; Solari, Paul] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA USA; [Ridgeway, Greg; Finkle, William] Consolidated Res Inc, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ridgeway, Greg] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sullivan, Sean] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Roche Holding; Genentech; University of Pennsylvania; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lyons, J (通讯作者)，300 Brickstone Sq,Suite 801A, Andover, MA 01810 USA.",jglyons@bu.edu,"Ridgeway, Greg/ISS-4420-2023",,Genentech,Genentech(Roche HoldingGenentech),The authors would like to thank Jamileh Jemison for her critical review of this manuscript.

In the CRYSTAL study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were treated with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects or withdrawal of consent. Objective To determine if stratified use of cetuximab based on genetic biomarker detection improves cost-effectiveness. Methods We used individual patient data from CRYSTAL to compare the cost-effectiveness, cost per life-year (LY) and cost per quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone in three cohorts of patients with mCRC: all randomised patients (intent-to-treat; ITT), tumours with no detectable mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of the KRAS protein ('KRAS wt') and no detectable mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3 and 4 of NRAS ('RAS wt'). Survival analysis was conducted using RStudio, and a cost-utility model was modified to allow comparison of the three cohorts. Results The deterministic base-case ICER (cost per QALY gained) was A 130,929 pound in the ITT, A 72,053 pound in the KRAS wt and A 44,185 pound in the RAS wt cohorts for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI alone. At a A 50,000 pound willingness-to-pay threshold, cetuximab plus FOLFIRI has a 2.8, 20 and 63% probability of being cost-effective for the ITT, KRAS wt and RAS wt cohorts, respectively, versus FOLFIRI alone. Conclusion Screening for mutations in both KRAS and NRAS may provide the most cost-effective approach to patient selection.","[Harty, Gerard] Merck Serono Ltd, Stanwell Rd, Feltham TW14 8NX, Middx, England; [Jarrett, James] Mapi Grp Ltd, 73 Collier St, London N1 9BE, England; [Jofre-Bonet, Mireia] City Univ London, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England",Merck KGaA; EMD Serono Inc.; City University London,"Jofre-Bonet, M (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",mireia.jofre-bonet.1@city.ac.uk,"Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/V-8673-2019","Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0002-2055-2166; Jofre-Bonet, Mireia/0000-0001-6168-0407",Merck KGaA,Merck KGaA(Merck & Company),This study was sponsored by Merck KGaA.,,41,9,9,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

One of the most commonly proposed strategies to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is increasing beverage prices through taxation. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether and how price-based policies could reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among participants in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Using point-of-sale data from a regional supermarket chain (58 stores), we estimated the responsiveness of demand to sugar-sweetened beverage price changes among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-participating families with young children. Own-price and cross-price elasticities for non-alcoholic beverages were estimated using a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model. The study found evidence that a tax-induced sugar-sweetened beverage price increase would reduce total sugar-sweetened beverage purchases among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants, who were driven by purchase shifts away from taxed sodas and sports drinks to non-taxed beverages (bottled water, juice, milk). The substitution of non-taxed caloric beverages decreases the marginal effects of the sugar-sweetened beverage tax, yet the direct tax effects are large enough to reduce the overall caloric intake, with the average net reduction in monthly calories from sugar-sweetened beverages estimated at around 8% for a half-cent per ounce tax and 16% for a one cent per ounce tax. A beverage price increase in the form of an excise tax would reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and increase healthier beverage purchases among low-income families.","[Jithitikulchai, Theepakorn] World Bank, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Andreyeva, Tatiana] Univ Connecticut, Rudd Ctr Food Policy & Obes, Hartford, CT 06112 USA; [Andreyeva, Tatiana] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA",The World Bank; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Jithitikulchai, T (通讯作者)，World Bank, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",theepakorn@worldbank.org,,"Jithitikulchai, Theepakorn/0000-0002-1725-9567",Economic Research Service at the US Department of Agriculture; Rudd Foundation,Economic Research Service at the US Department of Agriculture; Rudd Foundation,Proprietary data for this study were funded by a grant from the Economic Research Service at the US Department of Agriculture and work was supported in part by the Rudd Foundation.,,37,10,13,0,26,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

I find that higher contemporaneous ozone levels are associated with poorer performances in events that heavily tax the respiratory system. This is the case despite the low exposure levels observed in the studied sample, which are similar to those regularly experienced across the developed world. Such negative performance effects imply that observed ozone exposures are leading to physiological harm, which can be expected to negatively impact economic outcomes through both health and productivity channels. Leveraging the unique structure of the data which includes location information for competitions and home institutions I also identify an acclimatization effect whereby recent exposure to higher ozone levels serves to reduce the negative effects of contemporaneous exposure. This finding underscores the importance of regulating peak ozone levels rather than only mean concentrations, as spikes in ambient ozone levels can be particularly damaging to exposed populations.","[Mullins, Jamie T.] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Resource Econ, 80 Campus Ctr Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Mullins, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Resource Econ, 80 Campus Ctr Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jmullins@umass.edu,,"Mullins, Jamie/0000-0003-1118-2287",,,,,35,25,26,1,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8.0,,,,,1189,1200,,10.1002/hec.3667,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29737586.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437114300004,0

We find that education of mothers increases the probability of completing the full course of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus and Hepatitis B vaccinations for their children. The results are robust to variations in regression specification and including various individual and community variables.","[Ozer, Mustafa] Kilis Yedi Aralik Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Kilis, Turkey; [Ozer, Mustafa] Univ Portsmouth, Econ & Finance Dept, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Brunel Univ, CEDI, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Univ Social & Adm Affairs, Havirov, Czech Republic; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Govt Off Slovak Republ, ISA, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Fidrmuc, Jan] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Eryurt, Mehmet Ali] Hacettepe Univ, Inst Populat Studies, Ankara, Turkey",University of Portsmouth; Brunel University; Brunel University; European Research University; Ifo Institut; Hacettepe University,"Fidrmuc, J (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",jan.fidrmuc@brunel.ac.uk,"Fidrmuc, Jan/AAL-3954-2021; ERYURT, MEHMET/I-8706-2013; Fidrmuc, Jan/AFL-8367-2022","ERYURT, MEHMET/0000-0002-7405-5667; Fidrmuc, Jan/0000-0002-3350-7276",,,,,34,12,13,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8.0,,,,,1218,1229,,10.1002/hec.3770,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29790241.0,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437114300006,0

NICE has an explicit threshold for cost effectiveness, whereas PBAC does not. We compared the initial incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) presented by manufacturers in matched submissions to each decision-making body, with the aim of exploring the impact of an explicit threshold on these ICERs. Methods: Data were extracted from matched submissions from 2005 to 2015. The ICERs in these submissions were compared within each pair and with respect to a cost-effectiveness threshold. Results: Fifty-eight pairs of matched submissions were identified. The median difference between the ICERs ($2635/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) was significantly greater than zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.0299), indicating that the proposed ICERs in the submissions to NICE were higher than those in the matched submissions to PBAC. On 93% of occasions, NICE ICERs were within -$17,772 to +$48,422 of the corresponding PBAC ones (Bland-Altman analysis), demonstrating poor agreement. When an implicit threshold of AUD$50,000/QALY was assumed for PBAC decision making, only eight pairs of submissions had discordant ICERs falling above or below the respective threshold. Conclusions: The significantly higher ICERs in the submissions to NICE than those to PBAC may be a consequence of NICE's explicit willingness-to-pay threshold, and/or other health system factors. Industry may be assuming an implicit threshold for PBAC when constructing their ICERs despite the lack of acknowledgement of such a threshold.","[Wang, Shuhong; Gum, Debra; Merlin, Tracy] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Hlth Technol Assessment, Sch Publ Hlth, Mail Drop DX 650 545,Level 9, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Wang, SH (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Hlth Technol Assessment, Sch Publ Hlth, Mail Drop DX 650 545,Level 9, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",shuhong.wang@adelaide.edu.au,"Merlin, Tracy L/A-9789-2012","Merlin, Tracy/0000-0002-7293-4262",,,,,30,52,54,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,AUG,2018,21.0,8.0,,,,,938,943,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.017,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GP7IX,30098671.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441071700006,0

We use this modification to evaluate the empirical plausibility of recent predictions from high frequency financial theory regarding the small-time movements of an Ito semimartingale. The theory indicates that the probability distribution of the small moves should be locally stable around the origin. It makes no predictions regarding large rare jumps, which get filtered out. Our exact Bayesian procedure imposes support conditions on parameters as implied by this theory. The empirical application uses S&P Index options extending over a wide range of moneyness, including deep out of the money puts. The evidence is consistent with a locally stable distribution valid over most of the support of the observed data while mildly failing in the extreme tails, about which the theory makes no prediction. We undertake diagnostic checks on all aspects of the procedure. In particular, we evaluate the distributional assumptions regarding a semi-pivotal statistic, and we test by Monte Carlo that the posterior distribution is properly centered with short credibility intervals. Taken together, our results suggest a more important role than previously thought for pure jump-like models with diminished, if not absent, diffusive component. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the constrained maximum likelihood (ML) estimators of autoregressive parameters obtained when noncausal order s is fixed and potentially different from the true order so. The effect of such noncausal order misspecification on the constrained ML estimators of the autoregressive parameters is examined by means of the binding function. We find that, surprisingly, the misspecified estimators are consistent over significant regions of the parameter space. Next, we examine the properties of the unconstrained ML estimators which is obtained when the objective function is maximized with respect to all model parameters, including the noncausal order s. In this context, we prove the consistency of s and derive its speed of convergence and asymptotic distribution. However, as the noncausal order is integer-valued, the problem of identifying s concerns rather model selection than standard estimation. We also find that mixed models of different noncausal orders and with the same total autoregressive order are non-nested. This allows us to propose a new approach for robust identification of the noncausal order from a battery of direct and indirect encompassing tests. These tests are based on the difference between the constrained maximum likelihood and indirect inference estimators of the parameters characterizing the mixed causal/noncausal dynamics.

The benefits of narrow networks for consumers usually come in the form of lower premiums in exchange for access to fewer providers. Narrow networks may disrupt continuity of care and access to usual sources of care. We examine choices of health plans in a private health insurance exchange where consumers choose among one broad network and four narrow network plans. Using a discrete choice model with repeated choices, we estimate the willingness to pay for a health plan that covers consumers' usual sources of care. Willingness to pay for a network that covers consumers' usual source of care is between $84 and $275/month (for primary care) and between $0 and $115/month (for specialists). We find that, given that a network covers their usual source of care, consumers show aversion only to the narrowest networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The rarity of the outcome and the treatment was varied across simulation scenarios. Results showed that 2SLS generated consistent estimates of the local average treatment effects (LATE) and biased estimates of the average treatment effects (ATE) across all scenarios. 2SRI approaches, in general, produced biased estimates of both LATE and ATE under all scenarios. 2SRI using generalized residuals minimized the bias in ATE estimates. Use of 2SLS and 2SRI is illustrated in an empirical application estimating the effects of long-term care insurance on a variety of binary health care utilization outcomes among the near-elderly using the Health and Retirement Study.","[Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv & Econ, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Coe, Norma B.] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Med Ethics & Hlth Policy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Chapman, Cole G.] Univ South Carolina, Arnold Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Serv Policy & Management, Columbia, SC USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Pennsylvania; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Basu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Basu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv & Econ, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ CHOICE, 1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",basua@uw.edu,,"Coe, Norma/0000-0003-1228-0938; Basu, Anirban/0000-0003-4238-7402","National Institute of Nursing Research [NIH 1R01NR13583]; NIH research [R01CA155329, RC4CA155809]",National Institute of Nursing Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)); NIH research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),"National Institute of Nursing Research, Grant/Award Number: NIH 1R01NR13583; NIH research, Grant/Award Numbers: R01CA155329 and RC4CA155809",,31,39,46,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,JUN,2018,27.0,6.0,,,,,937,955,,10.1002/hec.3647,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF0UN,29577493.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431646700003,0

Methods: Participating modeling groups were asked to reproduce the results of two published studies using the input data described in those articles. Gaps in input data were filled with assumptions reported by the modeling groups. Goodness of fit between the results reported in the target studies and the groups' replicated outputs was evaluated using the slope of linear regression line and the coefficient of determination (R-2). After a general discussion of the results, a diabetes-specific checklist for the transparency of model input was developed. Results: Seven groups participated in the transparency challenge. The reporting of key model input parameters in the two studies, including the baseline characteristics of simulated patients, treatment effect and treatment intensification threshold assumptions, treatment effect evolution, prediction of complications and costs data, was inadequately transparent (and often missing altogether). Not surprisingly, goodness of fit was better for the study that reported its input data with more transparency. To improve the transparency in diabetes modeling, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist listing the minimal input data required for reproducibility in most diabetes modeling applications was developed. Conclusions: Transparency of diabetes model inputs is important to the reproducibility and credibility of simulation results. In the Eighth Mount Hood Challenge, the Diabetes Modeling Input Checklist was developed with the goal of improving the transparency of input data reporting and reproducibility of diabetes simulation model results.","[Palmer, Andrew J.; Si, Lei] Univ Tasmania, Menzies Inst Med Res, Med Sci 1 Bldg,17 Liverpool St Private Bag 23, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Tew, Michelle; Hua, Xinyang; Tran-Duy, An; Clarke, Philip M.] Univ Melbourne, Ctr Hlth Policy, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Willis, Michael S.; Asseburg, Christian] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [McEwan, Phil] Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Ltd, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Leal, Jose; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Foos, Volker; Lamotte, Mark] Real World Evidence Solut, IQVIA, Zaventem, Belgium; [Feenstra, Talitha] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Feenstra, Talitha] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [O'Connor, Patrick J.] HealthPartners Inst, Minneapolis, MN USA; [O'Connor, Patrick J.] HealthPartners Ctr Chron Care Innovat, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Brandle, Michael] Kantonsspital St Gallen, Dept Internal Med, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Smolen, Harry J.; Gahn, James C.] Med Decis Modeling Inc, Indianapolis, IN USA; [Valentine, William J.; Pollock, Richard F.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland; [Si, Lei; Tew, Michelle; Breeze, Penny; Brennan, Alan; Pollard, Daniel] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Ye, Wen; Isaman, Deanna J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biostat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Herman, William H.; Kuo, Shihchen] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Herman, William H.] Univ Michigan, Dept Epidemiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Laiteerapong, Neda] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Tasmania; Menzies Institute for Medical Research; University of Melbourne; Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd; University of Oxford; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; University of Groningen; Kantonsspital St. Gallen; Medical Decision Modeling Inc.

Methods: We conducted person trade-off (PTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) among 3950 adults selected to be representative of the UK general population. Experimental design was informed by surveys of patients affected by rare diseases, their caregivers, health care staff, and policymakers. Societal preferences were estimated in relation to treating a common disease, increases in waiting lists, or filling of vacant NHS posts. Results of the DCE were applied to recently licensed orphan drugs. Results: On the basis of equal cost, the majority of respondents to the PTO (54%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 50-59) chose to allocate funds equally between patients treated for rare diseases and those treated for common diseases, with 32% (95% CI 28-36) favoring treating rare diseases over treating common diseases (14%; 95% CI 11-17), which this reduced to 23% (95% CI 20-27) when rare disease treatments were 10 times more expensive. When framed differently, more respondents prioritized not increasing waiting list size (43%; 95% CI 39-48) than to treat rare disease patients (34%; 95% CI 30-38). Discussion: The DCE indicated a greater preference for treating a common disease over a rare disease. Respondents agreed with five of 12 positive appraisal recommendations for orphan drugs, even if their list price was higher, but preferred the NHS not to fund the remainder. Conclusions: The general public does not value rarity as a sufficient reason to justify special consideration for additional NHS funding of orphan drugs. This has implications regarding the appropriateness of operating higher thresholds of cost-effectiveness.","[Bourke, Siobhan M.; Plumpton, Catrin O.; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales",Bangor University,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Normal Site,Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459; Plumpton, Catrin/0000-0003-2710-9199",Medical Research Council North West Hub in Trial Methodological Research (NWHTMR) [MR/K025635/1],Medical Research Council North West Hub in Trial Methodological Research (NWHTMR),"DAH received funding from the Medical Research Council North West Hub in Trial Methodological Research (NWHTMR) (MR/K025635/1) and received a Health and Care Research Wales Senior Research Leader award.

This widespread use has been facilitated by legislative and regulatory incentives in both the United States and abroad, yet US payers and health systems have not yet made a concerted effort to understand whether and how rare diseases require special considerations on their part and how to adapt traditional methods of health technology assessment and economic evaluation to accommodate these situations. In this article, we explore the general ethical dilemmas that rare diseases present, steps taken by health technology assessment bodies worldwide to define the level of rarity that would necessitate special measures and the modifications to their assessment and valuation processes needed, and the contextual components for rare-disease evaluation that lie outside of the assessment framework as a guide to US decision makers on constructing a formal and relevant process stateside.","[Ollendorf, Daniel A.; Chapman, Richard H.; Pearson, Steven D.] Inst Clin & Econ Reuiew, Two Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA",,"Ollendorf, DA (通讯作者)，Inst Clin & Econ Reuiew, Two Liberty Sq,9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109 USA.",dollendorf@icer-review.org,,,,,,,39,43,44,0,43,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,547,552,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.01.008,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753351.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432175400009,0

COAs that discriminate level of function relative to a normative sample are particularly important in the pediatric rare disease setting because the literature is often void of natural history data. Pediatric rare disease clinical trials will often include a wide age distribution. Gross and fine motor skills, communication, cognition, and independence in activities of daily living vary by age, and it may be difficult to distinguish between treatment effect and change due to developmental maturation. Asfotase alfa was granted breakthrough therapy designation and subsequently approved for the treatment of hypophosphatasia (HPP; a genetic metabolic musculoskeletal disorder) and is used in this discussion to illustrate COA selection in a pediatric rare disease. Multiple COAs with normative data in HPP clinical trials for asfotase alfa are presented. The assessment instruments included the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, handheld dynamometry, the 6-minute walk test, and the Modified Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment-Gait scale. Multiple end points were required to adequately capture the impact of asfotase alfa treatment on the multiple systems affected in HPP. These data illustrate the importance of using multiple COAs that provide normative data and to use COAs early in the drug development process for rare pediatric disease.","[Phillips, Dawn] Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Phillips, Dawn] UNC Div Phys Therapy, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Evidera,"Phillips, D (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",Dawn.Phillips@Evidera.com,,,Alexion Pharmaceutical Ltd.,Alexion Pharmaceutical Ltd.,D.

Instead of imposing such restrictions, this paper provides sufficient conditions to non-parametrically identify payoff primitives in finite action games with incomplete information, while allowing for multiple equilibria. I then propose a two-step estimator and illustrate its finite-sample performances via Monte Carlo simulations.

We suggest to linearly combine the estimators obtained for different orders of differences and derive the variance-minimizing weighting scheme. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators is derived both for stationary and non-stationary explanatory variables along with a test of the stationarity.

Our results show substantial adverse effects on life expectancy for women subject to the more stringent criteria. A Euro1,000 reduction in annual benefits leads to a 2.4 percentage points higher probability of death more than 10years after the reform. This negative health effect is restricted to women with low pre-disability earnings. We find that the mortality rate of men subject to the stricter rules is reduced by 0.7 percentage points. The evidence for the existence of substantial health effects implies that policymakers considering a disability insurance reform should carefully balance the welfare gains from reduced moral hazard against losses not only from less coverage of income risks but also from deteriorated health.","[Garcia-Gomez, Pilar; Gielen, Anne C.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"García-Gómez, P (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",garciagomez@ese.eur.nl,"Garcia-Gomez, Pilar/ABA-9600-2020","Garcia-Gomez, Pilar/0000-0002-5634-4609; Gielen, Anne C./0000-0001-8704-4900",Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [451-11-036]; Marie Curie Individual Fellowship [PIEF-GA-2011-299133],Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Marie Curie Individual Fellowship(European Union (EU)),"Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Grant/Award Number: VENI - Project number 451-11-036; Marie Curie Individual Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: PIEF-GA-2011-299133",,34,6,6,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,606,621,,10.1002/hec.3617,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,29237234.0,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428324700017,0

Implications of detailed versus general approaches are unclear. Objectives: To compare costing approaches in a trial-based economic evaluation. Methods: We applied four costing approaches to prescribed medication data from the Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors Against Combination Intensive Therapy randomized controlled trial. A detailed micro-costing approach was used as a base case, against which other approaches were compared: costing medications used by at least 1.5% of patients; costing medications on the basis of only chemical name; applying a generic prescription charge rather than a medication-specific cost. We quantitatively examined resulting estimates of prescribed medication and total care costs, and qualitatively examined trial conclusions. Results: Medication costs made up 6% of the total health and social care costs. There was good agreement in prescribed medication costs (concordance correlation coefficient [CCC] 0.815, 0.819, and 0.989) and excellent agreement in total costs (CCC 0.990, 0.995, and 0.995) between approaches 1 and 2. Approaches 3 and 4 had poor agreement with approach 1 on prescribed medication costs (CCC 0.246-0.700 and 0.033-0.333, respectively), but agreement on total care costs remained good (CCC 0.778-0.993 and 0.729-0.986, respectively). Conclusions: Because medication costs comprised only a small proportion of total costs, the less resource-intensive approaches had substantial impacts on medication cost estimates, but had little impact on total care costs and did not significantly impact the trial's cost-effectiveness conclusions. There is room for research efficiencies without detriment to an evaluation in which medication costs are likely to form a small proportion of total costs.","[Heslin, Margaret; Babalola, Oluwagbemisola] Kings Coll London, Kings Hlth Econ, London, England; [Ibrahim, Fowzia; Scott, David] Kings Coll London, Dept Rheumatol, London, England; [Stringer, Dominic] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Biostat Dept, London, England; [Patel, Anita] Queen Mary Univ London, Blizard Inst, Ctr Primary Care & Publ Hlth, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Heslin, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat, Kings Hlth Econ, David Goldberg Ctr, 16 De Crespigny Pk,Denmark Hill,Box 024, London SE5 8AF, England.",margaret.heslin@kcl.ac.uk,"Patel, Anita/F-9832-2010; Stringer, Dominic/L-5066-2016; Heslin, Margaret/C-4307-2014","Heslin, Margaret/0000-0002-3094-9255; Ibrahim, Fowzia/0000-0002-7069-8024; Stringer, Dominic/0000-0001-5624-1733; Patel, Anita/0000-0003-0769-1732",National Institute for Health Research [06/303/84]; King's College London,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); King's College London,This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment program (Project No. 06/303/84).

In this paper, we estimate wage elasticities for physicians. We apply both a structural discrete choice approach and a reduced-form approach to examine how these different approaches affect wage elasticities at the intensive margin. Using uniquely rich data collected from a large sample of general practitioners (GPs) and specialists in Australia, we estimate 3 alternative utility specifications (quadratic, translog, and box-cox utility functions) in the structural approach, as well as a reduced-form specification, separately for men and women. Australian data is particularly suited for this analysis due to a lack of regulation of physicians' fees leading to variation in earnings. All models predict small negative wage elasticities for male and female GPs and specialists passing several sensitivity checks.

Accordingly, each country is trying to attract foreign direct investment and foreign capital. In order to achieve this, it is important that each country is politically stable, has a skilled and educated workforce with relatively low labor cost, a stable and administratively simple tax system. Institutional development and quality, i.e., a favorable institutional framework create an incentive environment for investment activity and have a key role in attracting foreign direct investment. Investment protection, business security, incentive tax policy, investor confidence in the legal order of the state, and security of ownership rights are the most important selection criteria that will determine the direction of the movement of foreign capital and determine the investment attractiveness of an individual country. The progress of the institutional environment and the favorable macroeconomic environment create good foundations for a profitable investment and, consequently, make the country more attractive to foreign investors. But, on the other hand, the increased inflow of foreign direct investment can further boost the process of institutional development. In this regard, the development of institutions and the growth of FDI are two processes that are simultaneously and interactively pursued, which are continuous and which, with their progress, lead to the growth and development of the society as a whole. This paper will try to analyze and explain the main effects of institutional framework and tax policy on foreign direct investments in selected EU countries. Mainly it will be focused to show the flow of the FDI in the countries and whether the changes in the institutional framework and tax policy have an impact on the FDI in selected EU countries.","[Buterin, Vesna; Grdinic, Maj A.; Drazenovic, Bojana Olgic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Buterin, V (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka, Croatia.",vesna.buterin@efri.hr; maja.grdinic@efri.hr; bojana.olgic.drazenovic@efri.hr,"Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/R-4177-2018; Buterin, Vesna/Q-8705-2018",,University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 3/17],University of Rijeka,"This paper has been financially supported by the University of Rijeka, for the project ZP UNIRI 3/17 (Development and Perspectives of Institutional Investors in the Republic of Croatia).",,29,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,129,141,,,,,,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100015,0

Some researchers proved that social media have been a valuable source to predict the future outcomes of some events such as box-office movie revenues or political elections. Social media are also used by companies to measure the sentiment of customers about their brand and products. This work proposes a new social media based model to measure how users perceive new products from a technical point of view. This model relies on the analysis of advantages and drawbacks of products, which are both important aspects evaluated by consumers during the buying decision process. This model is based on a lexicon developed in a related work (Chiarello et. al, 2017) to analyse patents and detect advantages and drawbacks connected to a certain technology. The results show that when a product has a certain technological complexity and fuels a more technical debate, advantages and drawbacks analysis is more efficient than sentiment analysis in producing technical-functional judgements.","[Chiarello, Filippo; Bonaccorsi, Andrea; Fantoni, Gualtiero; Ossola, Giacomo] Univ Pisa, Dept Energy Syst Terr & Construct Engn, Pisa, Italy; [Cimino, Andrea; Dell'Orletta, Felice] CNR, Italian Natl Res Council, Inst Computat Linguist, ILC, Rome, Italy",University of Pisa; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Linguistica Computazionale A.

However, for merger insiders and outsiders, average quality choices are significantly higher than predicted for pure profit-maximising hospitals. This upward deviation is potentially driven by altruistic behaviour towards patients. Furthermore, we find that in the case where sufficient cost synergies are realised by the merged hospitals, there is a significant increase in average quality choices compared to the scenario without synergies. Finally, we find that our results do not change when comparing individual decisions to team decisions.","[Kairies-Schwarz, Nadja] Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany; [Kairies-Schwarz, Nadja] CINCH Competent Competit & Hlth, Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Kairies-Schwarz, N (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany.;Kairies-Schwarz, N (通讯作者)，CINCH Competent Competit & Hlth, Berliner Pl 6-8, D-45127 Essen, Germany.",nadja.kairies@ibes.uni-due.de,"Gebhardt, Judith/JQV-4417-2023",,Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research),Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research),,65,6,8,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26.0,,,3.0,SI,,36,51,,10.1002/hec.3574,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT6WK,29285867.0,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423294300004,0

J,"Chesher, A",,,,"Chesher, Andrew",,,Understanding the effect of measurement error on quantile regressions,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Measurement error; Parameter approximations; Quantile regression,,The impact of measurement error in explanatory variables on quantile regression functions is investigated using a small variance approximation. The approximation shows how the error contaminated and error free quantile regression functions are related. A key factor is the distribution of the error free explanatory variable. Exact calculations probe the accuracy of the approximation. The order of the approximation error is unchanged if the density of the error free explanatory variable is replaced by the density of the error contaminated explanatory variable which is easily estimated. It is then possible to use the approximation to investigate the sensitivity of estimates to varying amounts of measurement error. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

We develop and apply a finite mixture bivariate probit model to analyze whether there are heterogeneous reactions to the introduction of a nonlinear price schedule in the German statutory health insurance system. In administrative insurance claims data from the largest German health insurance plan, we find that some individuals strongly react to the new price schedule while a second group of individuals does not react. Post-estimation analyses reveal that the group of the individuals who do not react to the reform includes the relatively sick. These results are in line with forward-looking behavior: Individuals who are already sick expect that they will hit the kink in the price schedule and thus are less sensitive to the co-payment.

Each course has a lower and an upper quota, indicating that if it is assigned some applicants then their number has to be between these two bounds. We further suppose that applicants extend their preferences over courses to preferences over bundles of courses lexicographically. In this setting we present several algorithmic results concerned with the computation of Pareto optimal matchings (POMs). Firstly, we extend the Serial Dictatorship with Project Closures mechanism to the case when an applicant can be assigned more than one course. We show that unlike in the one-to-many case no mechanism is strategy-proof against dropping manipulations and that this mechanism is strategy-proof against reordering strategies only for some picking sequences. We further show the intractability of the following problems: deciding about the Pareto optimality of a given matching, computation of a POM with maximum cardinality and computation of a POM in case of indifferences.

Using a unique health survey, we explore the heterogeneity of famine intensity across regions and find strong evidence supporting both the adverse effect and the selection effect. The two offsetting effects co-exist and their magnitudes vary in different age cohorts at the onset of famine. The selection effect is dominant among the prenatal/infant famine-exposed cohort, while the adverse effect appears dominant among the childhood/puberty famine-exposed cohort. The net famine effects are more salient in rural residents and non-migrants subsamples. Gender differences are also found, and are sensitive to smoking and drinking behaviors.

Methods: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a controlled before-and-after effectiveness study with one control ward and one intervention ward. The primary outcome measure was the number of errors in the medication administration process observed prospectively before and after implementation. To determine the difference in proportion of errors after implementation of the AMS, logistic regression was applied with the presence of error(s) as the dependent variable. Time, group, and interaction between time and group were the independent variables. The cost analysis used the hospital perspective with a short-term incremental costing approach. The total 6-month costs with and without the AMS were calculated as well as the incremental costs. The number of avoided administration errors was related to the incremental costs to obtain the cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as the cost per avoided administration error. Results: The AMS resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of errors in the intervention ward compared with the control ward. The cost analysis showed that the AMS increased the ward's 6-month cost by 16,843. The cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at 2.01 per avoided administration error, 2.91 per avoided procedural error, and 19.38 per avoided clinical error. Conclusions: The AMS was effective in reducing errors in the medication administration process at a higher overall cost. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the AMS was associated with affordable cost-effectiveness rates.","[Risor, Bettina Wulff; Sorensen, Jan] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, Dept Publ Hlth, JB Winslowsvej 9B, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark; [Risor, Bettina Wulff] Hosp Pharm, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Lisby, Marianne] Aarhus Univ Hosp, Res Ctr Emergency Med, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Sorensen, Jan] Royal Coll Surgeons Ireland, Healthcare Outcome Reseach Ctr, Dublin, Ireland",University of Southern Denmark; Aarhus University; Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland,"Risor, BW (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Hlth Econ Res COHERE, Dept Publ Hlth, JB Winslowsvej 9B, DK-5000 Odense, Denmark.",bettriso@rm.dk,"Risør, Bettina/Y-7088-2019","Risør, Bettina/0000-0003-3701-074X; Lisby, Marianne/0000-0002-9434-0967",Research and Development Fund [U-0034],Research and Development Fund,"The present study is a part of B.W.R.'s PhD program.

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to gauge the extent to which gender differences in longevity can be attributed to gender-specific preferences and health behavior. We set up a physiologically founded model of health deficit accumulation and calibrate it using recent insights from gerontology. From fitting life cycle health expenditure and life expectancy, we obtain estimates of the gender-specific preference parameters. We then perform the counterfactual experiment of endowing women with the preferences of men. In our benchmark scenario, this reduces the gender gap in life expectancy from 4.6 to 1.4 years. When we add gender-specific preferences for unhealthy consumption, the model can motivate up to 89 percent of the gender gap. Our theory offers also an economic explanation for why the gender gap declines with rising income. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our statistic is consistent and does not require any nonparametric smoothing, although we test the validity of a conditional feature. We also propose a bootstrap procedure to obtain the p-values and critical values that are required to carry out the test in practical applications. Results from a simulation study suggest that our test can work very well even in small to moderately sized samples. As an empirical illustration, we apply our test to two datasets that have been used in the literature to estimate censored regression models using Powell's STLS approach, to check whether the assumption of conditional symmetry is supported by these datasets.

Empirical evidence supporting this claim is, however, scarce. At the individual level, physicians' adoption motivation was often considered important in the context of adoption decisions, but a clear notion of its dimensions and corresponding measurement scales is not available. Objectives: To develop and subsequently validate a scale to measure the motivation to adopt medical devices of hospital-based physicians. Methods: The development and validation of the physician-motivation-adoption (PMA) scale were based on a literature search, internal expert meetings, a pilot study with physicians, and a three-stage online survey. The data collected in the online survey were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and the PMA scale was revised according to the results. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the results from the EFA in the third stage. Reliability and validity tests and subgroup analyses were also conducted. Results: Overall, 457 questionnaires were completed by medical personnel of the National Health Service England. The EFA favored a six-factor solution to appropriately describe physicians' motivation. The CFA confirmed the results from the EFA. Our tests indicated good reliability and validity of the PMA scale. Conclusions: This is the first reliable and valid scale to measure physicians' adoption motivation. Future adoption studies assessing the individual level should include the PMA scale to obtain more information about the role of physicians' motivation in the broader adoption context.

We fill this gap by nonparametrically modeling the error distribution in such regressions that entails constructing prior distributions on densities which exhibit flexibility, while fixing the mode at 0. Such priors exist when constraining the mean and median but, to our knowledge, there is none for the mode. Our solution with mixtures of triangular distributions results in a conditionally conjugate prior on the space of unimodal, untruncated, convex densities. Consistency properties of the resulting modal estimators are studied, followed by simulated and real data illustrations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain two sets of structural results of the optimal mechanisms, which can be summarized in one conclusion: under certain distributional conditions, the optimal mechanisms have simple menus. The first set of results states that, under a condition that requires that the types are concentrated on lower values, the optimal menu can be sorted in ascending order. Applying the theorem, we derive a revenue-monotonicity theorem which states that stochastically dominated distributions yield less revenue. The second set of results states that, under certain conditions which require that types are distributed more evenly or are concentrated on higher values, the optimal mechanisms have a few menu items. Our first result states that, for certain such distributions, the optimal menu contains at most 4 menu items. The condition admits power density functions. Our second result works for a weaker condition, under which the optimal menu contains at most 6 menu items. Our last result in this set works for the unit-demand setting, it states for uniform distributions, the optimal menu contains at most 5 items. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

After analyzing data from in-depth interviews, studies of related published documents, and observations, results suggest that reform in the whistleblowing system does not only serve as a tool to improve internal control; it is also a part of the control itself.

Methods: A cohort study was conducted using primary care electronic health records, with linked hospital utilization data, for 3,045 participants who underwent bariatric surgery and 247,537 participants who did not undergo bariatric surgery. Epidemiological analyses informed a probabilistic Markov model to compare bariatric surgery, including equal proportions with adjustable gastric banding, gastric bypass, and sleeve gastrectomy, with standard nonsurgical management of obesity. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and net monetary benefits at a threshold of 30,000 per QALY. Results: In a UK population of 250,000 adults, there may be 7,163 people with morbid obesity including 1,406 with diabetes. The immediate cost of 1,000 bariatric surgical procedures is 9.16 million, with incremental discounted lifetime health care costs of 15.26 million (95% confidence interval 15.18- 15.36 million). Patient-years with diabetes mellitus will decrease by 8,320 (range 8,123-8,502). Incremental QALYs will increase by 2,142 (range 2,032-2,256). The estimated cost per QALY gained is 7,129 (range 6,775- 7,506). Net monetary benefits will be 49.02 million (range 45.72- 52.41 million). Estimates are similar for subgroups of age, sex, and deprivation. Bariatric surgery remains costeffective if the procedure is twice as costly, or if intervention effect declines over time. Conclusions: Diverse obese individuals may benefit from bariatric surgery at acceptable cost. Bariatric surgery is not cost-saving, but increased health care costs are exceeded by health benefits to obese individuals.","[Gulliford, Martin C.; Charlton, Judith; Prevost, Toby; Booth, Helen; Fildes, Alison; Ashworth, Mark; Littlejohns, Peter] Kings Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Addison House,Guys Campus, London SE1 1UL, England; [Gulliford, Martin C.; Prevost, Toby] Guys & St Thomas Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, Natl Inst Hlth Res, Biomed Res Ctr, London, England; [Reddy, Marcus; Khan, Omar] Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, St Georges Univ Hosp, Dept Surg, London, England; [Rudisill, Caroline] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London, England",University of London; King's College London; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; St Georges University London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gulliford, MC (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Addison House,Guys Campus, London SE1 1UL, England.",martin.gulliford@kcl.ac.uk,"Rudisill, Caroline/IUO-5377-2023; Gulliford, Martin/I-8606-2018; Fildes, Alison/A-2493-2017","Gulliford, Martin/0000-0003-1898-9075; Prevost, A.

In the case of pure exchange economies with a finite number of traders it is well-known that the set of competitive allocations could be a strict subset of the core which can also be a strict subset of the bargaining set. In this paper, we show that the Aubin bargaining set (or fuzzy bargaining set) and the set of competitive allocations coincide in a finite coalition production economy under some standard assumptions. We also show that the (Mas-Colell) bargaining set shrinks to the set of competitive allocations in a finite coalition production economy 8 under some standard conditions when e is replicated. As a consequence, the existence of competitive equilibrium in a finite coalition production economy implies the nonemptiness of Aubin bargaining sets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A 2011 policy change required that certain private insurance plans in Medicare form provider networks de novo; in response, insurers cancelled two-thirds of the affected plans. Using detailed data on pre-policy provider and insurer market structure, I compare markets where insurers built networks to those they exited. Overall, insurers in the most concentrated hospital and physician markets were 9 and 13 percentage points more likely to exit, respectively, than those in the least concentrated markets. Conversely, insurers with more market power were less likely to exit than those with less, and an insurer's market power had the largest effect on exit in concentrated hospital markets. These findings suggest that concentrated provider markets contribute to insurer exit and that insurers with less market power have more difficulty surviving in concentrated provider markets.

ClinRO assessments, like all COAs (patient -reported, observer -reported, or performance outcome assessments), are used to 1) measure patients' health status and 2) define end points that can be interpreted as treatment benefits of medical interventions on how patients feel, function, or survive in clinical trials. Like other COAs, ClinRO assessments can be influenced by human choices, judgment, or motivation. A ClinRO assessment is conducted and reported by a trained health care professional and requires specialized professional training to evaluate the patient's health status. This is the second of two reports by the ISPOR Clinical Outcomes Assessment Emerging Good Practices for Outcomes Research Task Force. The first report provided an overview of COAs including definitions important for an understanding of COA measurement practices. This report focuses specifically on issues related to ClinRO assessments. In this report, we define three types of ClinRO assessments (readings, ratings, and clinician global assessments) and describe emerging good measurement practices in their development and evaluation. The good measurement practices include 1) defining the context of use; 2) identifying the concept of interest measured; 3) defining the intended treatment benefit on how patients feel, function, or survive reflected by the ClinRO assessment and evaluating the relationship between that intended treatment benefit and the concept of interest; 4) documenting content validity; 5) evaluating other measurement properties once content validity is established (including intra-and inter -rater reliability); 6) defining study objectives and end point(s) objectives, and defining study end points and placing study end points within the hierarchy of end points; 7) establishing interpretability in trial results; and 8) evaluating operational considerations for the implementation of ClinRO assessments used as end points in clinical trials. Applying good measurement practices to ClinRO assessment development and evaluation will lead to more efficient and accurate measurement of treatment effects. This is important beyond regulatory approval in that it provides evidence for the uptake of new interventions into clinical practice and provides justification to payers for reimbursement on the basis of the clearly demonstrated added value of the new intervention.","[Powers, John H., III] George Washington Univ, Sch Med, Penfield House,15915 Emory Lane, Washington, DC 20853 USA; [Patrick, Donald L.] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Patrick, Donald L.] Univ Washington, Seattle Qual Life Grp, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Walton, Marc K.] Janssen Res & Dev, Ashton, MD USA; [Marquis, Patrick] Modus Outcomes, Newton, MA USA; [Cano, Stefan] Modus Outcomes, Letchworth Garden City, Herts, England; [Hobart, Jeremy] Peninsula Coll Med & Dent, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Isaac, Maria] Natl Acad Sci, Inst Med, European Med Agcy, London, England; [Vamvakas, Spiros] European Med Agcy, London, England; [Slagle, Ashley] Aspen Consulting Serv LLC, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] ISPOR, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Burke, Laurie B.] Lora Grp LLC, Royal Oak, MD USA; [Burke, Laurie B.] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA",George Washington University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Plymouth; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore,"Powers, JH (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Sch Med, Penfield House,15915 Emory Lane, Washington, DC 20853 USA.",jpowers3@aol.com,"Patrick, Donald/Y-2460-2019","Patrick, Donald/0000-0003-0756-0492; Powers III, John H/0000-0002-5150-5119",Intramural NIH HHS [Z99 AI999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA),,,52,87,91,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JAN,2017,20.0,1.0,,,,,2,14,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.11.005,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HM,28212963.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000396449200001,0

This research aims to identify good governance practice in arranging RPJMDes in 40 sample villages in DIY. There were 10 village samples from each regency. The research methods used were quantitative and qualitative approach. Quantitative method was used to find out the stakeholder perspective, while qualitative method was used to obtain specific and unique information in explaining the arranging process of RPJMDes. This evaluation study illustrates good governance practice using some indicators, which are participative, siding with public, transparency, accountable, efficient, and effective. The research result shows that the sample villages has applied good governance yet has not covered the entire indicators. There are six indicators which express good governance spirit in RPJMDes, but only some parts which have achieved good scores.

Using a large sample of administrative data drawn from China, we examine a variety of econometric models for predicting the medical expenditures of individuals. We show that the standard ordinary least squares model performs relatively well compared with other models. We then propose two alternative payment schemes on risk-adjusted capitation. The first is a prospective capitation model and the second incorporates both prospective and retrospective features. We simulate the corresponding payments based on model predictions and evaluate the payment/cost ratios for health care providers.

Our new approach explicitly incorporates the effect of measurement errors and time varying attenuation biases into the covariance forecasts, by allowing the ex-ante predictions to respond more (less) aggressively to changes in the ex-post realized covariance measures when they are more (less) reliable. Applying the new procedures in the construction of minimum variance and minimum tracking error portfolios results in reduced turnover and statistically superior positions compared to existing procedures. Translating these statistical improvements into economic gains, we find that under empirically realistic assumptions a risk-averse investor would be willing to pay up to 170 basis points per year to shift to using the new class of forecasting models.

Objective: To examine the association between contract-level proportion of generic drugs dispensed (pGDD) and Medicare Part D star ratings. Methods: This was a retrospective study of linked 2011 Medicare Part D star rating data with contract-level pGDD data. A total of 477 individual Medicare prescription contracts were included, representing 75% of total Prescription Drug Plans and more than 65% of total Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans available by the end of 2010. Primary outcomes were Medicare Part D summary and domain star ratings (1-5 indicating lowest to highest performance), incorporating a range of quality measures for access, cost, beneficiary satisfaction, and health services outcomes and processes. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to examine associations between pGDD and Medicare Part D summary and domain star ratings, controlling for contract type and number of beneficiary enrollment. Results: Higher pGDD was associated with higher summary star ratings (adjusted odds ratio 1.08 with 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.12) and higher member experience with drug plan domain ratings (adjusted odds ratio 1.07 with 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.11). Conclusions: Prescription formulary benefit design targeting increasing generic drug use appears to be associated with improved member experience and higher plan star ratings. Consideration may be given to incorporating pGDD into Medicare Part D star rating measures to improve quality of prescription plans. Keywords: Medicare, star ratings, quality of care, generic drugs.","[Hohmann, Natalie; Hansen, Richard; Garza, Kimberly B.; Qian, Jingjing] Auburn Univ, Harrison Sch Pharm, Dept Hlth Outcomes Res & Policy, 038 James E Foy Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Harris, Ilene; Kiptanui, Zippora] IMPAQ Int LLC, Columbia, MD USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; American Institutes for Research,"Qian, JJ (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Harrison Sch Pharm, Dept Hlth Outcomes Res & Policy, 038 James E Foy Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",jzq0004@auburn.edu,"Garza, Kimberly/AAZ-6993-2020","Garza, Kimberly/0000-0002-4684-372X; Kiptanui, Zippora/0000-0003-1212-7642",US Food and Drug Administration [U01FD005486],US Food and Drug Administration(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesUS Food & Drug Administration (FDA)),"Funding for this study was made possible, in part, by the US Food and Drug Administration through grant number U01FD005486.

We investigated these dynamics for Germany, using the emergence of transcatheter aortic valve implementation (TAVI) as an alternative to conventional aortic valve replacements (CAVR). We focused on the role of patient co-morbidity-which would be a medical explanation for adopting TAVI-and hospital ownership status, hypothesizing that for-profit facilities are more likely to capitalize on the favorable reimbursement conditions of TAVI. The analysis uses claims data from the Techniker Krankenkasse, the largest health insurance fund in Germany, for the years 2009-2015, covering 2892 patients with TAVI and 9523 with CAVR. The decision on TAVI versus CAVR was estimated for patient-level data, that is, socioeconomic data as well as co-morbidity. At the hospital level, we included the ownership type. We also controlled for effects of the respective owner (rather than the type of ownership), including a random intercept. While the co-morbidity score of TAVI patients was much higher in the early years, over time, the score almost converged with that of CAVR patients. This is in agreement with emerging evidence that suggests the use of TAVI also leads to better patient outcomes. Our results indicate that the type of ownership does not drive the switch to TAVI. We found little, if any, effect from the respective owner, regardless of ownership type. Overall, the effects of co-morbidity suggest that providers acted responsibly when adopting TAVI while evidence was still emerging.","[Schneider, Udo; Linder, Roland; Horenkamp-Sonntag, Dirk] WINEG Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, Bramfelder Str 140, D-22305 Hamburg, Germany; [Schmid, Andreas] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Law & Econ, JP Hlth Care Management, Univ Str 30, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Verheyen, Frank] Techniker Krankenkasse, Bramfelder Str 140, D-22305 Hamburg, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Schneider, U (通讯作者)，WINEG Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, Bramfelder Str 140, D-22305 Hamburg, Germany.",dr.udo.schneider@wineg.de; andreas.schmid@uni-bayreuth.de; prof.dr.roland.linder@wineg.de; dr.dirk.horenkamp-sonntag@wineg.de; dr.frank.verheyen@tk.de,"Horenkamp-Sonntag, Dirk/AAV-8546-2021; Schmid, Andreas/AAA-7147-2019","Schmid, Andreas/0000-0002-0141-0971",,,,,28,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We operate under the most flexible definition of piecewise stationarity, and estimate the number and locations of change-points consistently as well as identifying whether they originate in the common or idiosyncratic components. Through the use of wavelets, we transform the problem of change-point detection in the second-order structure of a high-dimensional time series, into the (relatively easier) problem of change-point detection in the means of high-dimensional panel data. Also, our methodology circumvents the difficult issue of the accurate estimation of the true number of factors in the presence of multiple change-points by adopting a screening procedure. We further show that consistent factor analysis is achieved over each segment defined by the change-points estimated by the proposed methodology. In extensive simulation studies, we observe that factor analysis prior to change-point detection improves the detectability of change-points, and identify and describe an interesting 'spillover' effect in which substantial breaks in the idiosyncratic components get, naturally enough, identified as change-points in the common components, which prompts us to regard the corresponding change-points as also acting as a form of 'factors'. Our methodology is implemented in the R package factorcpt, available from CRAN. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

We study the best subset selection procedure by which the covariates are chosen by maximizing Manski (1975, 1985)'s maximum score objective function subject to a constraint on the maximal number of selected variables. We show that this procedure can be equivalently reformulated as solving a mixed integer optimization problem, which enables computation of the exact or an approximate solution with a definite approximation error bound. In terms of theoretical results, we obtain non-asymptotic upper and lower risk bounds when the dimension of potential covariates is possibly much larger than the sample size. Our upper and lower risk bounds are minimax rate-optimal when the maximal number of selected variables is fixed and does not increase with the sample size.

Objectives: To estimate the MID of the five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) index score in a population-based sample of adults with type 2 diabetes and to explore whether the MID estimate varies by baseline index score and the direction of change in health status. Methods: We used longitudinal survey data of adults with type 2 diabetes in Alberta, Canada. The EQ-5D-5L MID was estimated first by the instrument defined approach, which used the difference between the baseline index scores and the index scores of simulated single-level transitions, and then by the anchor-based approach, which categorized 1-year changes in depressive symptoms, diabetes-related distress, as well as physical and mental health functioning into no change, small change, and large change groups, wherein the MID was estimated as the average change in index score of the small change group. Results: Using the instrument-defined approach, MID estimates were 0.043, 0.040, and 0.045, whereas anchor-based MID estimates were 0.042, 0.034, and 0.049 for all change, improvement, and deterioration, respectively. Larger MID estimates were observed for lower baseline index scores and for deterioration in health status. Conclusions: MID estimates of the EQ-5D-5L index score were consistent between instrument-defined and anchor-based approaches and ranged between 0.03 and 0.05. Estimates varied by baseline index score and the direction of change, with similar results for patient subgroups.","[McClure, Nathan S.; Al Sayah, Fatima; Ohinmaa, Arto; Johnson, Jeffrey A.] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Johnson, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Li Ka Shing Ctr Hlth Res Innovat 2 040, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E1, Canada.",jeff.johnson@ualberta.ca,,,EuroQol Research Foundation grant (The EQ Project) [2016520],EuroQol Research Foundation grant (The EQ Project),This study was supported by a EuroQol Research Foundation grant (The EQ Project number is 2016520).,,23,47,48,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2018,21.0,9.0,,,,,1090,1097,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.02.007,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GT9BF,30224114.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444833500012,0

A key focus of anal cancer prevention has been screening for and treating precancerous high-grade squamous intraepithelial anal lesions (HSILs). Objectives: To develop a health-related symptom index for HSIL using qualitative techniques because anal HSIL and its treatment may have a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and no HRQOL measure specific to this condition and treatment currently exists. Methods: Expert consultation was used to guide one-on-one concept elicitation interviews with participants to identify HRQOL aspects they attribute to their anal HSIL and its treatment. This resulted in a draft instrument, which was administered to an independent participant sample, where cognitive interview techniques assessed comprehension. Results: Eighteen anal HSIL-related concepts were identified by the expert panel. Across the 41 concept elicitation interviews, 23 items representing physical symptoms, physical impacts, and psychological symptoms were identified to comprise the initial measure, which was then evaluated during three rounds of cognitive interviews (n = 45). Several questionnaire aspects were refined on the basis of participant input, with three additional items added per expert/participant recommendation. One item was removed because of poor comprehension, resulting in a 25-item measure. Conclusions: Using state-of-the-art qualitative methodology, we have established the content validity of this new instrument, the ANCHOR Anal HSIL Health-Related Symptom Index. Quantitative validation efforts are currently underway. The participant-driven process of developing this tool will facilitate a participant-centered evaluation of the impact on morbidity for treatment of anal HSIL or observation without treatment.","[Burkhalter, Jack E.; Atkinson, Thomas M.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Berry-Lawhorn, J.; Palefsky, Joel M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Goldstone, Stephen] Laser Surg Care, New York, NY USA; [Einstein, Mark H.] Rutgers New Jersey Med Sch, Newark, NJ USA; [Wilkin, Timothy J.] Weill Cornell Med, New York, NY USA; [Lee, Jeannette] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA",Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences; Northwestern University; Feinberg School of Medicine,"Atkinson, TM (通讯作者)，Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, 641 Lexington Ave,7th Floor, New York, NY 10022 USA.",atkinsot@mskcc.org,"Atkinson, Thomas/JFA-6487-2023",,National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support grant [P30CA008748]; [2 UM1 CA121947-09]; [3U54CA137788-08S1],National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support grant; ;,"This research (AMC-A02; Clinical-Trials.gov: NCT02836522) was funded in part through grants 2 UM1 CA121947-09 and 3U54CA137788-08S1, and a National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support grant (grant no.

We compare these mechanisms when two medical services are imperfect substitutes in demand and are supplied by two different firms. In both cases, the reimbursement is higher when patients select the in-network provider(s). We show that these mechanisms yield lower prices, lower providers' and insurer's profits, and lower expense than in the uniform-reimbursement case. Whatever the degree of product differentiation, a not-for-profit insurer should prefer selective contracting and select a reimbursement such that the out-of-pocket expense is null. Although all providers join the network under any-willing-provider contracting in the absence of third-party payment, an asymmetric equilibrium may exist when this billing arrangement is implemented.","[Mougeot, Michel; Naegelen, Florence] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France",Universite de Franche-Comte,"Naegelen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.",florence.naegelen@univ-fcomte.fr,,,"Health Chair - a joint initiative by PSL, University Paris-Dauphine, ENSAE; MGEN, under the aegis of the Fondation du Risque (FDR)","Health Chair - a joint initiative by PSL, University Paris-Dauphine, ENSAE; MGEN, under the aegis of the Fondation du Risque (FDR)","Health Chair - a joint initiative by PSL, University Paris-Dauphine, ENSAE; MGEN, under the aegis of the Fondation du Risque (FDR)",,23,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8.0,,,,,1201,1217,,10.1002/hec.3769,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29774623.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437114300005,0

In the last decade, the number of children diagnosed with these conditions has inexplicably been on the rise. This increase has been concentrated in the Medicaid caseload nationwide. One of the most striking changes in Medicaid has been the transition from fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement to Medicaid managed care (MMC), which had taken place in 80% of states by 2016. Using Medicaid claims from South Carolina, we show that this change contributed to the increase in asthma and ADHD caseloads. Empirically, we rely on variation in MMC enrollment due to a change in the default Medicaid plan from FFS to MMC, and on rich panel data that allow us to follow the same children before and after they were required to switch. We find that the transition from FFS to MMC explains about a third of the rise in the number of Medicaid children being treated for ADHD and asthma, along with increases in treatment for many other conditions. These are likely to be due to the incentives created by the risk adjustment and quality control systems in MMC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, when the health states being valued are temporary, the TTO approach may be unsuitable. A variant of TTO-chained TTO-has been suggested to be used when the health states are temporary, but little research has been done on how chained TTO should be conducted. Objectives: To systematically review the use of chained TTO in valuing temporary health states. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using the following major databases: Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase, EBM Reviews, and PsycINFO. Abstracts(full articles if necessary) were screened by two independent reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. Results: The resulting number of articles for review was low (n = 9). All the reviewed studies used face-to-face interviews, most had small sample sizes (<100), and all studies valued a small number of health states (<7), with time horizons typically ranging from 4 weeks to 1 year. All studies discussed methodological issues of using chained TTO, and some compared the results with those generated using other preference elicitation methods. Conclusions: Chained TTO appears to be feasible, consistent, and responsive and allows the valuation of temporary health states that would improve the efficiency and accuracy of decision making in health and health care. Nevertheless, the evidence is limited due to the low number of relevant studies in the literature. Further research is needed to examine the performance and validity of chained TTO compared with conventional TTO in the valuation of temporary health states.","[Stoniute, Julija; Mott, David John; Shen, Jing] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Hlth Econ Grp, Baddiley Clark Bldg,Richardson Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England; [Mott, David John] Off Hlth Econ, London, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Shen, J (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Hlth Econ Grp, Baddiley Clark Bldg,Richardson Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 4AX, Tyne & Wear, England.",jing.shen@ncl.ac.uk,"Mott, David/H-8548-2018","Mott, David/0000-0001-5959-8447",Health Foundation,Health Foundation,The development of this work was funded by the Health Foundation for an internship project.,,24,8,10,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,605,611,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.08.3015,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753359.0,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432175400017,0

Mental disorder such as depression is an important yet often neglected NCD and is becoming a growing cause of disability, suicides, and disease burden. This paper provides the first nationally representative estimate of the medical cost attributable to depression and depressive symptoms among the adult population in China. On the basis of the 2012 China Family Panel Studies survey, our results indicate that these mental health conditions have significant impacts on the individual medical expenditure, and they jointly contribute to 14.7% of total personal expected medical spending in China, with depression and depressive symptoms accounting for 6.9% and 7.8%, respectively. Given that patients with mental illness face multiple psychological and institutional barriers in seeking appropriate treatment, the high depression-induced medical costs may be primarily driven by the cost-shifting effect from mental health care to general health care, as mental disorders often coexist with other NCDs such as diabetes and hypertension. As an implication, our study calls for an urgent reform of China's mental health and insurance systems to remove the policy-induced obstacles for the access to mental health care resources.","[Hsieh, Chee-Ruey] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Sch Econ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Qin, Xuezheng] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Peking University,"Qin, XZ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",qin.econpku@gmail.com,,,Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base Grant [16JDLJB001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573003],Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base Grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Beijing Social Science Foundation Research Base Grant, Grant/Award Number: 16JDLJB001; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 71573003",,78,78,85,7,108,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,MAR,2018,27.0,3.0,,,,,525,544,,10.1002/hec.3604,0.0,,,20,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA4TF,28990318.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428324700012,0

As potential mechanisms, I study employer-side and worker-side mechanisms. I find that employers changed health benefit offerings to force or incentivize workers to enroll in HDHPs. But I find little evidence of an increase in workers' demand for HDHPs due to a reduction in income. These results suggest that the HDHP enrollment rate increased during the Great Recession, as employers tried to save costs of offering health benefits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our starting point is players' preferences on return distribution vectors, essentially mappings from states of the world to distributions of returns to be received by players. There are two ways in which equilibria for this preference game can be defined. Also, when the preferences possess ever more features, we can gradually add more structures to the game. These include real-valued functions over return-distribution vectors, sets of probabilistic priors over states of the world, and eventually the traditional expected-utility framework involving one single prior. We establish equilibrium existence results, show the upper hemi-continuity of equilibrium sets over changing ambiguity attitudes, and uncover relations between the two versions of equilibria. Some attention is paid to the enterprising game, in which players exhibit ambiguity-seeking attitudes while betting optimistically on the favorable resolution of ambiguities. The two solution concepts are unified at this game's pure equilibria, whose existence is guaranteed when strategic complementarities are present. The current framework can be applied to settings like auctions involving ambiguity on competitors' assessments of item worths. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of quality-adjusted life years. For example, we describe a recently developed extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features measures of financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further option for expanding this approach augmented CEA, which can introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods for developing hedonic value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations in this area.","[Phelps, Charles E.] Univ Rochester, Polit Sci, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, 30250 South Highway 1, Gualala, CA 95445 USA; [Lakdawalla, Darius N.] Univ Southern Calif, Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Drummond, Michael F.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Towse, Adrian] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Danzon, Patricia M.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Rochester; University of Southern California; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of York - UK; University of Pennsylvania,"Phelps, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Polit Sci, Econ, Publ Hlth Sci, 30250 South Highway 1, Gualala, CA 95445 USA.",charles.phelps@rochester.edu,"Towse, Adrian K/M-3760-2014; Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",,,,,40,53,56,1,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,FEB,2018,21.0,2.0,,,,,146,154,,10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.010,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FX2ML,29477392.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425894000006,0

This initiative enlisted the expertise of leading health economists, including several who are not ISPOR members, to focus on what the field of health economics can provide to help inform the development and use of value assessment frameworks. The preceding seven articles represent the culmination of ISPORs Special Task Force Report on US value assessment frameworks.

Our analysis is based on data for 28 European countries that refer to young people. We find that the consumption of cannabis and 'new substances' is positively related to increasing unemployment rates. An increase of 1% in the regional unemployment rate is associated with an increase of 0.7 percentage points in the ratio of young people who state that they have consumed cannabis at some point in time. Our findings also indicate that higher unemployment may be associated with more young people perceiving that access to drugs has become more difficult, particularly access to ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. According to young Europeans, when the economy worsens, anti-drug policies should focus on the reduction of poverty and unemployment, and not on implementing tougher measures against users.

We use individual, daily price data of two major players in the Polish domestic market. Taking into account implied pricing mechanism existing in the market, an Import Parity Pricing schema, we examine if both of the duopolistic players can apply such mechanism. The study applies nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model specification as empirical hypothesis of pricing mechanism to account for a short and long run cointegrating relationship between wholesale price and its drivers. Nonlinearities in relationships accounts for asymmetric pass through, common in a supply chain of liquid fuels. As a results, we propose an implied structure of the IPP mechanism common for both of the players by indicating the probable reference (benchmark) prices and assessing the influence of PLN/USD and PLN/EUR exchange rates. We find significant long-run relationships for both players and all of the proposed wholesale prices' drivers. We reveal that both exchange rates are important in a long term but only PLN/USD exchange rate enters implied daily prices' creation mechanism. Additionally, we compare dynamic adjustment paths of prices for the two players and show common patterns in reactions to changes in prices' determinants.","[Bejger, Sylwester; Orzeszko, Witold] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Gagarina 13a, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Bejger, S (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Gagarina 13a, Torun, Poland.",sylwester.bejger@umk.pl; witold.orzeszko@umk.pl,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,"MATFYZPRESS PUBL HOUSE, FAC MATH & PHYSICS",PRAHA 8,"CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, SOKOLOVSKA 83, PRAHA 8, 186 75, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7378-372-3,,,,2018,,,,,,,37,42,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BO2PI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000507455300007,0

This suggests that my estimates for GDP are more accurate for countries which are considered to have more reliable GDP data.

In terms of static versus dynamic Shift-Share analyses it is possible to observe that the results obtained in each analysis were approximate, apart some exceptions. However, dynamic analysis eliminates errors presented by the static analysis. Thus, the results of the dynamic analysis can be considered more comprehensive and robust. Overall, according to the dynamic Shift Share analysis employed, it is observed that Panama's exports to the European Union w ere affected by decreases to countries such as: Germany, Belgium, Spain, Greece, Italy, Poland and Sweden.

For every player i and every opponents' degree of rationality epsilon, we require player i to attach at least probability F-i(epsilon) to his opponent being epsilon-rational, where the functions F-i are assumed to be common knowledge amongst the players.

Market failures include limited availability, low quality, lack of information, and high costs of access. We estimated the theoretical demand for one of the most common artemisinin-based combination therapies, artemether-lumefantrine (AL), and its determinants among caregivers of children with malaria seeking care at public health facilities, thus, entitled to receive drugs for free, in southern Mozambique (year 2012). The predicted theoretical demand was contrasted with international and local private market AL prices. Respondents stated high willingness to pay but lower ability to pay (ATP), which was defined as the theoretical demand. The ATP was on average of 0.94 USD for the treatment of a malaria episode. This implied an average gap of 1.04 USD between average local private prices and theoretical demand. Predicted ATP decreased by 14% for every additional malaria episode that the child had suffered during the malaria season. The market price was unaffordable for a large share of our sample, highlighting an unequal welfare distribution between suppliers and potential consumers, as well as issues of inequity in the private delivery of AL.","[Alonso, Sergi; Sicuri, Elisa] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, ISGlobal, Hosp Clin, Carrer Rossello 132, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Alonso, Sergi; Munguambe, Khatia] CISM, Manhica, Mozambique; [Munguambe, Khatia] Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Fac Med, Maputo, Mozambique; [Sicuri, Elisa] Imperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, Hlth Econ Grp, London, England",ISGlobal; CRESIB; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; Centro de Investigacao em Saude de Manhica; Eduardo Mondlane University; Imperial College London,"Alonso, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, ISGlobal, Hosp Clin, Carrer Rossello 132, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain.",alonso.sergi@gmail.com,"Alonso, Sergi/AAL-1960-2021; Alonso, Sergi/GQZ-1236-2022; Sicuri, Elisa/L-8012-2014","Alonso, Sergi/0000-0001-6664-3736; Sicuri, Elisa/0000-0002-2499-2732",Medicines for Malaria Venture,Medicines for Malaria Venture,Medicines for Malaria Venture,,62,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26.0,12.0,,,,,E345,E360,,10.1002/hec.3514,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT4AW,28548247.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423095100022,0

A lab experiment was designed to elicit the risk attitudes of 257 medical and nonmedical students by assigning them the role of a physician who must decide between treatments for patients. An interval regression model was used to estimate individual coefficients of relative risk aversion, and an estimation model was used to test for the effect of type of medical decision and experimental design characteristics on elicited risk aversion. We find that (a) risk attitudes vary across different health contexts, but risk aversion prevails in all of them; (b) students enrolled in health-related degrees show a higher degree of risk aversion; and (c) real rewards for third parties (patients) make subjects less risk-averse. The results underline the importance of accounting for attitudes towards risk in medical decision making.","[Arrieta, Alejandro] Florida Int Univ, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Garcia-Prado, Ariadna] Univ Publ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Gonzalez, Paula] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Univ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Luis Pinto-Prades, Jose] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Universidad Pablo de Olavide; University of Navarra; Glasgow Caledonian University,"García-Prado, A (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona, Spain.",ariadna.garcia@unavarra.es,"prades, jose luis pinto/B-7069-2008; prades, jose luis pinto/AGJ-9700-2022; Gonzalez, Paula LM/IAR-4710-2023; González, Paula/H-3949-2015","prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; prades, jose luis pinto/0000-0002-9684-3410; Gonzalez, Paula LM/0000-0003-0154-0087; González, Paula/0000-0003-1630-9726; Garcia Prado, Ariadna/0000-0003-0052-7198; Arrieta, Alejandro/0000-0002-7628-8894","Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia; FEDER [ECO2012-3648, ECO2013-43526-R, ECO2015-65031-R, ECO2015-65408-R]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ-04992]",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia and FEDER, Grant numbers: ECO2012-3648, ECO2013-43526-R, ECO2015-65031-R and ECO2015-65408-R; Junta de Andalucia, Grant number: SEJ-04992",,68,24,27,4,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26.0,,,3.0,SI,,97,113,,10.1002/hec.3628,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT6WK,29285873.0,"Green Accepted, Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423294300008,0

However, globally, the recommendations vary from country to country, ranging from universal recommendations, risk-group-specific recommendations, to no recommendation at all. Due to high diversity both in recommendation practice and country-specific preconditions, it is difficult to determine the effect of different recommendations on vaccine uptake. This incentivised laboratory experiment (N = 288) tests the behavioural consequences of different recommendations in a repeated interactive vaccination game. The participants are part of heterogeneous groups, comprised of low-and high-risk type of players. They receive either a universal, risk-group-specific or no recommendation prior to their vaccination decisions. Results show that individuals are sensitive to the recommendations. In detail, a risk-group-specific recommendation increases vaccine uptake of high-risk types. However, at the same time, it decreases vaccine uptake of low-risk types. The results imply that when the proportion of low-risk types in a population is considerably larger than the high-risk group, a risk-group-specific (vs. universal) recommendation comes at the cost of decreased social benefit of vaccination due to the overall lower vaccine uptake. Policy decision-making should therefore complement epidemiological considerations with potential positive and negative behavioural consequences of vaccination recommendations.","[Boehm, Robert; Meier, NicolasW.] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Aachen, Germany; [Korn, Lars; Betsch, Cornelia] Univ Erfurt, Ctr Empir Res Econ & Behav Sci CEREB, Erfurt, Germany; [Korn, Lars; Betsch, Cornelia] Univ Erfurt, Media & Commun Sci, Erfurt, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; University of Erfurt; University of Erfurt,"Böhm, R (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Sch Business & Econ, Aachen, Germany.",robert.boehm@rwth-aachen.de,"Korn, Lars/JRW-7181-2023","Bohm, Robert/0000-0001-6806-0374; Betsch, Cornelia/0000-0002-2856-7303",,,,,29,13,14,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,DEC,2017,26.0,,,3.0,SI,,66,75,,10.1002/hec.3584,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FT6WK,29285869.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423294300006,0

OBJECTIVES: To use decomposition methodology on real-world data to identify the relative contributions of treatment effects and patients' baseline characteristics. METHODS: Decomposition analyses were performed on data from the Initiation of New Injectable Treatment Introduced after Antidiabetic Therapy with Oral-only Regimens (INITIATOR) study, a real-world study of patients with type 2 diabetes started on insulin glargine (GLA) or liraglutide (LIRA). These analyses investigated relative contributions of differences in baseline characteristics and treatment effects to observed differences in 1-year outcomes for reduction in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and treatment persistence. RESULTS: The greater HbA1c reduction seen with GLA compared with LIRA (-1.39% vs. -0.74%) was primarily due to differences in baseline characteristics (HbA1c and endocrinologist as prescribing physician; P < 0.050). Patients with baseline HbA1c of 9.0% or more or evidence of diagnosis codes related to mental illness achieved greater HbA1c reductions with GLA, whereas patients with baseline polypharmacy (6-10 classes) or hypogylcemia achieved greater reductions with LIRA. Decomposition analyses also showed that the higher persistence seen with GLA (65% vs. 49%) was mainly caused by differences in treatment effects (P < 0.001). Patients 65 years and older, those with HbA1c of 9.0% or more, those taking three oral antidiabetes drugs, and those with polypharmacy of more than 10 classes had higher persistence with GLA; patients 18 to 39 years and those with HbA1c of 7.0% to less than 8.0% had higher persistence with LIRA. CONCLUSIONS: Although decomposition does not demonstrate causal relationships, this method could be useful for examining the source of differences in outcomes between treatments in a real-world setting and could help physicians identify patients likely to respond to a particular treatment.

Yet the country's decentralized and incremental approach towards universal coverage has created a fragmented SHI system under which a series of structural deficiencies have emerged with negative impacts. First, contingent on local conditions and financing capacity, benefit packages vary considerably across schemes, leading to systematic inequity. Second, the existence of multiple schemes, complicated by massive migration, has resulted in weak portability of SHI, creating further barriers to access. Third, many individuals are enrolled on multiple schemes, which causes inefficient use of government subsidies. Moral hazard and adverse selection are not effectively managed. The Chinese government announced its blueprint for integrating the urban and rural resident schemes in early 2016, paving the way for the ultimate consolidation of all SHI schemes and equal benefits for all. This article proposes three policy alternatives to inform the consolidation: (1) a single-pool system at the prefectural level with significant government subsidies, (2) a dual-pool system at the prefectural level with risk-equalization mechanisms, and (3) a household approach without merging existing pools. Vertical integration to the provincial level is unlikely to happen in the near future. Two caveats are raised to inform this transition towards universal health coverage.","[He, Alex Jingwei] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Policy Studies, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shaolong] Sch Publ Hlth, Zhongshan Er Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK),"He, AJ (通讯作者)，Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Policy Studies, 10 Lo Ping Rd, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jwhe@eduhk.hk,"Ramesh, M/D-4946-2009; He, Alex Jingwei/HKE-5167-2023","Ramesh, M/0000-0002-7376-2300; He, Alex Jingwei/0000-0001-9024-4831; Wu, Shaolong/0000-0003-2800-4209","Early Career Scheme of the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong SAR Government [ECS859218]; Dean's Research Fund of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences [ECR2]; Education University of Hong Kong; Early Career Faculty Research Training Program of Sun Yat-sen University [13YKPY12]","Early Career Scheme of the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong SAR Government; Dean's Research Fund of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences; Education University of Hong Kong; Early Career Faculty Research Training Program of Sun Yat-sen University","This study is funded by the Early Career Scheme of the Research Grants Council, Hong Kong SAR Government (Ref.

However, there may also be a causal effect whereby the quit behavior of one partner is affected by the quit decision of the other partner. If so, there is a spousal peer effect on the decision to quit smoking. We use data containing retrospective information of Dutch partnered individuals about their age of onset of smoking and their age of quitting smoking. We estimate mixed proportional hazard models of starting rates and quit rates of smoking in which we allow unobserved heterogeneity to be correlated across partners. Using a timing of events approach, we determine whether the quitting-to-smoke decision of one partner has a causal effect on the quitting-to-smoke decision of the other partner. We find no evidence of substantial spousal peer effects in the decision to quit smoking. Apparently, love conquers all but nicotine addiction.

Residents of the two countries have single-dipped preferences, determined by the distance of their dips to the nearer public bad (myopic preferences) or, lexicographically, by the distance to the nearer and the other public bad (lexmin preferences). A (social choice) rule takes a profile of reported preferences as input and assigns the location of the public bad in each country. For the case of myopic preferences, all rules satisfying strategy-proofness, country-wise Pareto optimality, non-corruptibility, and the far away condition are characterized. These rules pick only border locations. The same holds for lexmin preferences under strategy-proofness and country-wise Pareto optimality alone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We derive the equivalence used in step (a) and contribute a new criterion to the theory applied in step (b). The validity of the new criterion, which applies second order stochastic dominance to utility distributions, is established by showing its equivalence to the benchmark decision theoretic criterion when comparing the riskiness of lotteries over any vector space. We demonstrate the theory's tractability via diverse economic applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting a quasi-natural experiment, we use a difference-in-differences approach to test whether public hospitals respond to an exogenous change in Diagnosis-Related Group tariffs by increasing C-section rates and/or by upcoding. Controlling for a detailed set of mother characteristics, we find that price changes did not affect the probability of a C-section. We do however find evidence of upcoding: Conditional on the birth delivery method (either a C-section or a vaginal delivery), public hospitals experiencing the largest price change exhibit a higher probability of treating patients coded as complicated. This finding suggests that even public hospitals may be sensitive to market incentives.","[Di Giacomo, Marina; Piacenza, Massimiliano] Univ Turin, Dept ESOMAS, Turin, Italy; [Piacenza, Massimiliano] CNR, IRCrES, Turin, Italy; [Siciliani, Luigi] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Turati, Gilberto] Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Rome, Italy",University of Turin; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR); University of York - UK; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli,"Piacenza, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Sch Management & Econ, Dept Econ Social Sci Appl Math & Stat ESOMAS, Corso Unione Sovietica 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",massimiliano.piacenza@unito.it,"siciliani, luigi/AAE-8686-2020; PIACENZA, MASSIMILIANO/ABF-1996-2020; Di Giacomo, Marina/AAY-8021-2021","Di Giacomo, Marina/0000-0002-7158-7545; Turati, Gilberto/0000-0002-2146-7887; Piacenza, Massimiliano/0000-0003-2437-8254",,,,,26,19,19,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,SEP,2017,26.0,,,2.0,,,23,37,,10.1002/hec.3541,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,FH7GV,28940919.0,"Bronze, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411353600003,0

Individuals engage in unobservable primary prevention and have access to different prevention technologies. Thus, insurance markets are affected by moral hazard and adverse selection. Individuals can choose to take a genetic test to acquire information about their prevention technology. Information has positive decision-making value, that is, individuals may adjust their behavior based on the result of the test. However, testing also exposes individuals to uncertainty over the available insurance contract, so-called classification risk, which lowers the value of information. In our analysis we distinguish between four different policy regimes, determine the value of information under each regime and associated equilibrium outcomes on the insurance market. We show that the policy regimes can be Pareto ranked, with a duty to disclose being the preferred regime and an information ban the least preferred one. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V.

Until then, there has been a long-standing tradition of opportunistic screening. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of organized screening compared with opportunistic screening, as well as to identify factors influencing the clinical and economic outcomes. Methods: We developed and validated an individual-level state-transition model and assessed the health outcomes and costs of organized and opportunistic screening for 40-year-old asymptomatic women. The base-case analysis compared a scenario involving organized biennial screening with a scenario reflecting opportunistic screening practice for an average risk woman aged 45 to 69 years. We applied an annual discount rate of 3% and estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of the cost (2012 euros) per life-year gained (LYG) from a health care perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty. Results: Compared with opportunistic screening, an organized program yielded on average additional 0.0118 undiscounted life-years (i.e., 4.3 days) and cost savings of (sic)41 per woman. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of organized screening was approximately (sic)20,000 per LYG compared with no screening. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of (sic)50,000 per LYG, there was a 70% probability that organized screening would be considered cost-effective. The attendance rate, but not the test accuracy of mammography, was an influential factor for the cost-effectiveness. Conclusions: The decision to adopt organized screening is likely an efficient use of limited health care resources in Austria.","[Schiller-Fruehwirth, Irmgard] Main Assoc Austrian Social Secur Inst, Dept Evidence Based Econ Hlth Care, Kundmanngasse 21, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Schiller-Fruehwirth, Irmgard; Jahn, Beate; Siebert, Uwe] UMIT Univ Hlth Sci Med Informat & Technol, Dept Publ Hlth & Hlth Technol Assessment, Hall In Tirol, Austria; [Jahn, Beate; Siebert, Uwe] ONCOTYROL Ctr Personalized Canc Med, Div Hlth Technol Assessment & Bioinformat, Innsbruck, Austria; [Einzinger, Patrick; Zauner, Guenther; Urach, Christoph] dwh Simulat Serv, Vienna, Austria; [Einzinger, Patrick] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Anal & Sci Comp, Vienna, Austria; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Inst Technol Assessment, Boston, MA USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Boston, MA USA; [Siebert, Uwe] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Ctr Hlth Decis Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Boston, MA USA","UMIT - Private University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics & Technology GmbH; Technische Universitat Wien; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

We use triple difference estimation to identify the HRRP's effects in Virginia hospitals; this method estimates the difference in changes in readmission over time between patients targeted by the policy and a comparison group of patients and then compares those difference-in-differences estimates in patients treated at hospitals with readmission rates above the national average (i.e., those at risk for penalties) and patients treated at hospitals with readmission rates below or equal to the national average (those not at risk). We find that the HRRP significantly reduced readmission for Medicare patients treated for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We find no evidence that hospitals delay readmissions, treat patients with greater intensity, or alter discharge status in response to the HRRP, nor do we find changes in the age, race/ethnicity, health status, and socioeconomic status of patients admitted for AMI. Future research on the specific mechanisms behind reduced AMI readmissions should focus on actions by healthcare providers once the patient has left the hospital.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a provision that increases the Medicaid rebate for both brand-name and generic drugs. This study examines the extent to which oncology drug prices changed after the increase in the Medicaid rebate in 2010. Methods A pre-post study design was used to evaluate the correlation between the Medicaid rebate increase and oncology drug prices after 2010 using 2006-2013 State Drug Utilization Data. Results The results show that the average annual price of top-selling cancer drugs in 2006, adjusted for inflation and secular changes in drug prices, have increased by US$154 and US$235 for branded and competitive brand drugs, respectively, following the 2010 ACA; however, generic oncology drug prices showed no significant changes. Conclusions The findings from this study indicate that oncology drug prices have increased after the 2010 ACA, and suggest that pharmaceutical companies may have increased their drug prices to offset increases in Medicaid rebates.","[Tehrani, Ali Bonakdar] Truven Hlth Analyt, 7700 Old Georgetown Rd,6th Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Carroll, Norman V.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Pharm, Dept Pharmacotherapy & Outcomes Sci, 410 N 12th St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University,"Tehrani, AB (通讯作者)，Truven Hlth Analyt, 7700 Old Georgetown Rd,6th Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",tabonakd@us.ibm.com; nvcarroll@vcu.edu,,,Susan G.

Following this idea, this paper introduces uncertainty about players' ability to observe each others' past choices in extensive-form games. In this context, we show that monitoring opponents' choices does not affect the outcome of the interaction when every player expects their opponents indeed to be monitoring. Specifically, we prove that if players are rational and there is common strong belief in opponents being rational, having perfect information and believing in their own perfect information, then, the backward induction outcome is obtained regardless of which of her opponents' choices each player observes. The paper examines the constraints on the rationalization process under which reasoning according to Battigalli's (1996) best rationalization principle yields the same outcome irrespective of whether players observe their opponents' choices or not. To this respect we find that the obtention of the backward induction outcome crucially depends on tight higher-order restrictions on beliefs about opponents' perfect information. The analysis provides a new framework for the study of uncertainty about information structures and generalizes the work by Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2002) in this direction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use the tests to empirically establish whether the value-weighted market portfolio is the best choice of every individual with preferences exhibiting certain patterns of local attitudes towards risk. Our results indicate that we cannot reject the hypothesis of prospect stochastic dominance efficiency for the market portfolio. This is supportive of the claim that the particular portfolio can be rationalized as the optimal choice for any S-shaped utility function. Instead, we reject the hypothesis for Markowitz stochastic dominance, which could imply that there exist reverse S-shaped utility functions that do not rationalize the market portfolio.

Methods: A stratified analysis according to risk profiles was used to compare the risk of complications in a retrospective cross-sectional single-center study. Differences in costs and length of hospital stay were calculated using the recycled predictions method, based on regression coefficients from generalized linear models with gamma distribution. All models were adjusted for propensity score and possible confounders, such as age, sex, and comorbidities. The analysis was performed separately for diagnostic and interventional catheterization. Results: The unadjusted relative risk (RR) of complications was not significantly different in diagnostic catheterization when a VCD was used (RR = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22-2.16) but significantly lower in interventional catheterization (RR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.21-0.93). Costs were on average (sic)275 lower in the diagnostic group (95% CI -(sic)478.0 to -(sic)64.9; P = 0.006) and around (sic)373 lower in the interventional group (95% CI -(sic)630.0 to -(sic)104.2; P = 0.014) when a VCD was used. The adjusted estimated average length of stay did not differ significantly between the use of a VCD and manual compression in both types of catheterization. Conclusions: In interventional catheterization, VCDs significantly reduced unadjusted complication rates, as well as costs. A significant reduction in costs also supports their usage in diagnostic catheterization on a larger scale.","[Walter, Julia; Vogl, Matthias; Becker, Christian; Brandes, Alina; Rogowski, Wolf] German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany; [Vogl, Matthias; Becker, Christian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Sch Management, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Munich, Germany; [Vogl, Matthias; Becker, Christian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, Munich, Germany; [Holderried, Martin] Univ Hosp Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany; [Sinner, Moritz F.] Univ Hosp Munich, Dept Med 1, Munich, Germany; [Rogowski, Wolf] Univ Bremen, Inst Publ Hlth & Nursing Res, Dept Hlth Care Management, Hlth Sci, Bremen, Germany; [Maschmann, Jens] Univ Hosp Jena, Jena, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Munich; University of Munich; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University Hospital; University of Munich; University of Bremen; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Walter, J (通讯作者)，German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management IGM, POB 1129, D-85758 Neuherberg, Germany.",Julia.Walter@helmholtz-muenchen.de,"Holderried, Martin/AFW-2670-2022; Sinner, Moritz/AAW-5043-2020; Rogowski, Wolf/D-9334-2013","Rogowski, Wolf/0000-0003-1625-4171",German government; Bavarian government; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01KQ0902V],German government; Bavarian government; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This research was carried out on behalf of the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen.

Each bidder receives a signal about the value of the prize and has a signal-dependent probability of participation. All bidders bear a cost of bidding that is an increasing function of their bids. It is shown that the contest organizer prefers fully concealing (disclosing) the information about the number of participating bidders when the cost functions are convex (concave).

Methods: Analysis was conducted through a three state Markov model and used data on the progression of disease with treatment from the gemcitabine arms of randomized controlled trials combined with estimates from the network meta-analysis for the newer regimens. Estimates of health care costs were obtained from local providers, and utilities were derived from the literature. The model estimates the effect of treatment regimens on costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) discounted at 5% per annum. Results: At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of greater than $30,666 per QALY, FOLFIRINOX would be the most optimal regimen. For a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the probability that FOLFIRINOX would be optimal was 57.8%. There was no price reduction for nab-paclitaxel when GnP was optimal. Conclusions: From a Canadian public health payer's perspective at the present time and drug prices, FOLFIRINOX is the optimal regimen on the basis of the cost-effectiveness criterion. GnP is not cost-effective regardless of the WTP threshold. Copyright (C) 2017, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

Emerging types of cancer treatments offer the possibility of being cured in that patients can become long-term survivors whose risk of death is the same as that of a disease-free person. Describing cured and noncured patients with one shared mean value may provide a biased assessment of a therapy with a cured proportion. Objective: The purpose of this article is to explain how to incorporate the heterogeneity from cured patients into health economic evaluation. Methods: We analyzed clinical trial data from patients with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab (Ipi; n = 137) versus glycoprotein 100 (gp100; n = 136) with statistical methodology for mixture cure models. Both cured and noncured patients were subject to background mortality not related to cancer. Results: When ignoring cured proportions, we found that patients treated with Ipi had an estimated mean OS that was 8 months longer than that of patients treated with gp100. Cure model analysis showed that the cured proportion drove this difference, with 21% cured on Ipi versus 6% cured on gp100. The mean OS among the noncured cohort patients was 10 and 9 months with Ipi and gp100, respectively. The mean OS among cured patients was 26 years on both arms. When ignoring cured proportions, we found that the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) when comparing Ipi with gp100 was $324,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (95% confidence interval $254,000-$600,000). With a mixture cure model, the ICER when comparing Ipi with gp100 was $113,000/QALY (95% confidence interval $101,000-$154,000). Conclusions: This analysis supports using cure modeling in health economic evaluation in advanced melanoma. When a proportion of patients may be long-term survivors, using cure models may reduce bias in OS estimates and provide more accurate estimates of health economic measures, including QALYs and ICERs.

Methods: In the proposed uncertainty analysis approach, we calculated the required computational time and the number of runs given a user-defined error bound on the variance of the grand mean. The equations for optimal sample sizes were derived by minimizing the variance of the grand mean using initial estimates for variance components. Finally, analysis of variance estimators were used to calculate unbiased variance estimates. Results: To illustrate the proposed approach, we performed uncertainty analysis to estimate the uncertainty associated with total direct cost of osteoarthritis in Canada from 2010 to 2031 according to a previously published population health microsimulation model of osteoarthritis. We first calculated crude estimates for initial-population sampling and dynamic-equation parameters uncertainty by performing a small number of runs. We then calculated the optimal sample sizes and finally derived 95% uncertainty intervals of the total cost and unbiased estimates for variance components. According to our results, the contribution of dynamic-equation parameter uncertainty to the overall variance was higher than that of initial parameter sampling uncertainty throughout the study period. Conclusions: The proposed analysis of variance approach provides the uncertainty intervals for the mean outcome in addition to unbiased estimates for each source of uncertainty. The contributions of each source of uncertainty can then be compared with each other for validation purposes so as to improve the model accuracy.

In 2008, Israel's Parliament passed an Organ Transplantation Law granting priority on organ donor waiting lists to individuals who had previously registered as organ donors. Beginning in November 2010, public awareness campaigns advertised the priority policy to the public. Since April 2012, priority has been added to the routine medical criteria in organ allocation decisions. We evaluate the introduction of priority for registered organ donors using Israeli data on organ donor registration from 1992 to 2013. We find that registrations increased when information about the priority law was made widely available. We find an even larger increase in registration rates in the 2months leading up to a program deadline, after which priority would only be granted with a 3-year delay. We also find that the registration rate responds positively to public awareness campaigns, to the ease of registration (i.e. allowing for registering online and by phone) and to an election drive that included placing registration opportunities in central voting locations.

Objectives: To evaluate the current state of HEEs of PMs by performing a comprehensive systematic review. Methods: Four databases were searched for HEEs of PM-based strategies. Two reviewers independently selected eligible articles. A checklist was compiled to score items focusing on general characteristics of HEEs of PMs, model characteristics and quality of HEEs, evidence on PMs typically used in the HEEs, and the specific challenges in performing HEEs of PMs. Results: After screening 791 abstracts, 171 full texts, and reference checking, 40 eligible HEEs evaluating 60 PMs were identified. In these HEEs, PM strategies were compared with current practice (n = 32; 80%), to other stratification methods for patient management (n = 19; 48%), to an extended PM (n = 9; 23%), or to alternative PMs (n = 5; 13%). The PMs guided decisions on treatment (n = 42; 70%), further testing (n = 18; 30%), or treatment prioritization (n = 4; 7%). For 36 (60%) PMs, only a single decision threshold was evaluated. Costs of risk prediction were ignored for 28 (46%) PMs. Uncertainty in outcomes was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analyses in 22 (55%) HEEs. Conclusions: Despite the huge number of PMs in the medical literature, HEE of PMs remains rare. In addition, we observed great variety in their quality and methodology, which may complicate interpretation of HEE results and implementation of PMs in practice. Guidance on HEE of PMs could encourage and standardize their application and enhance methodological quality, thereby improving adequate use of PM strategies.

As the nation's capital, Jakarta becomes example of ICT based governance. After implementing web based governance (e-government) in all level of its work units, the provincial government of Jakarta launched mobile phone applications (m-government). This paper reviews the development of e-government and m-government and its implementation in the provincial government of Jakarta. Interactions between actors involved in Jakarta's ICT based governance are studied and its institutional perspective reviewed. The paper questions how ICT based governance (both e-government and m-government) has changed working attitude of government officials, how the presence of mobile phone applications (mobile apps) changes the way citizen and the government interact. We argue that e-government has enhanced the effectiveness of public administration and inter-governments program implementations. Moreover, we argue that citizen will use mobile application to interact with the government if it satisfies his/her sense of self identify, enable him/her to further pursue his/her own interest and if the respond from the government meet their expectation. In this research, we found that government should adapt to the changes of demographic condition of their citizen. In terms of government and citizen interaction, senior citizen and conservative community prefer traditional real life interaction (communication in person) while young citizen and more modern community prefer online interaction (communication through internet based channel). To maximize ICT based interaction between government and citizen, we argue that regular trainings on internet based mobile applications for elder citizens (who usually hold strategic positions and represent community in interaction with government) will guarantee the sustainable use of the application.","[Anggraini, Lya; Lestari, Sri] Univ Indonesia, Publ Adm, Fac Adm Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Bachtiar, Muslim] Tanjung Duren Urban Village Govt Off, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Halil, Erwan] LP3ES Inst Social & Econ Res Educ & Informat, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Anggraini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Publ Adm, Fac Adm Studies, Jakarta, Indonesia.",lya.anggraini@gmail.com; elsrie@yahoo.com; muslim.bachtiar@gmail.com; erwanhalil@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,15,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-427-9,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,167.0,,,,,,66,72,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning; Political Science; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration; Government & Law,BJ6IT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426719600011,0

However, there are few results about efficient estimation procedures for finite-dimensional parameters under these independence restrictions. This paper computes the efficiency bound for finite-dimensional parameters under independence restrictions, and proposes an estimator that is consistent, asymptotically normal and which achieves the efficiency bound. The estimator is based on a growing number of zero-covariance conditions that are asymptotically equivalent to the independence restriction. The results are illustrated with examples, including an instrumental variables regression model and partially linear regression models. A small Monte Carlo study is performed to investigate the estimator's small sample properties and to quantify the efficiency gains that can be made by using the proposed efficient estimator.

In these cases, mapping can be used to estimate preference-based measures. Objectives: To model the relationship between the EQ-5D-3L and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer (FACT-B) instrument, comparing indirect and direct mapping methods, and the use of FACT-B summary score versus FACT-B subscale scores. Methods: We used data from three clinical studies for advanced breast cancer providing 11,958 observations with full information on FACT-B and the EQ-5D-3L. We compared direct mapping using adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models (ALDVMMs) with indirect mapping using seemingly unrelated ordered probit models. The EQ-5D-3L was estimated as a function of FACT-B and other patient-related covariates. Results: The use of FACT-B subscale scores was better than using the total FACT-B score. A good fit to the observed data was observed across the entire range of disease severity in all models. ALDVMMs outperformed the indirect mapping. The breast cancer-specific scale had a strong influence in predicting the pain/discomfort and self-care dimensions of the EQ-5D-3L. Conclusions: This article adds to the growing literature that demonstrates the performance of the ALDVMM method for mapping. Regardless of which model is used, the subscales of FACT-B should be included as independent variables wherever possible. The breast cancer-specific subscale of FACT-B is important in predicting the EQ-5D-3L. This suggests that generic cancer measures should not be used for utility mapping in patients with breast cancer.","[Gray, Laura A.; Wailoo, Allan J.; Alava, Monica Hernandez] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Gray, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",laura.gray@sheffield.ac.uk,"Gray, Laura/AAA-1430-2019","Gray, Laura/0000-0001-6365-7710; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617; Hernandez, Monica/0000-0003-4474-5883",Medical Research Council Methodology Research Programme [MR/L022575/1]; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence through its Decision Support Unit; MRC [MR/L022575/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Medical Research Council Methodology Research Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health and Care Excellence through its Decision Support Unit; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This work was supported by a grant from the Medical Research Council Methodology Research Programme (grant no.

We compared cumulative healthcare costs and disease burden under different treatment cascade scenarios.MethodsWe attached direct costs for the management/care of chronically HCV-infected patients to a previously developed clinical disease progression model. Under assumptions regarding disease stage-specific proportions of model-predicted HCV patients within care, annual numbers of patients initiated on antiviral treatment and distribution of treatments over stage, we projected the healthcare costs and disease burden [in disability-adjusted life-years (DALY)] in 2018-2040 under four treatment scenarios: (A) no treatment/baseline; (B) pre-2018 standard of care (pegylated interferon/ribavirin); (C) gradual scale-up in direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment uptake that does not meet the WHO 2030 treatment uptake target; (D) scale-up in DAA treatment uptake that meets the WHO 2030 target.ResultsScenario D, while achieving the WHO 2030 target and averting 253,500 DALYs compared with the pre-2018 standard of care B, incurred the highest direct patient costs over the period 2018-2030: US$890 million (95% uncertainty interval 653-1271). When including screening programme costs, the total cost was estimated at US$952 million, which was 12% higher than the estimated total cost of scenario C.ConclusionsThe scale-up to meet the WHO 2030 target may be achievable with appropriately high governmental commitment to the expansion of HCV screening to bring sufficient undiagnosed chronically infected patients into the treatment pathway.","[McDonald, Scott A.; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba] Univ Malaya, Ctr Excellence Res AIDS CERiA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [McDonald, Scott A.] Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Ctr Infect Dis Control, Bilthoven, Netherlands; [McDonald, Scott A.] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Azzeri, Amirah; Shabaruddin, Fatiha Hana; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Mohamed, Rosmawati] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Dahlui, Maznah] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Ctr Populat Hlth, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Dahlui, Maznah] Univ Airlangga, Fac Publ Hlth, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Tan, Soek S.] Selayang Hosp, Dept Hepatol, Lebuhraya Selayang Kepon, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment; Glasgow Caledonian University; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Airlangga University,"McDonald, SA (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Ctr Excellence Res AIDS CERiA, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.;McDonald, SA (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm, Ctr Infect Dis Control, Bilthoven, Netherlands.;McDonald, SA (通讯作者)，Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Hlth & Life Sci, Cowcaddens Rd, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",scott.mcdonald@rivm.nl,"Dahlui, Maznah/F-9665-2010; Azzeri, Amirah/M-8166-2016; Dahlui, Maznah/B-8976-2010","Dahlui, Maznah/0000-0003-4923-9410",,,,,27,8,8,0,12,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This issue is especially salient in certain medical specialties where less altruistic behavior of physicians can yield significant financial gains. This study examines experimentally measured altruistic preferences of medical students from schools around the U.S., and whether these preferences predict those students' expected medical specialty choice. The experimental design consists of a set of computer-based revealed preference decision problems, which ask the experimental subjects to allocate real money between themselves and an anonymous person. These data are used to derive an innovative measure of altruism for each participant. I then examine the association between altruism and expected specialty choice, after controlling for an extensive set of covariates collected from an accompanying survey questionnaire. Medical students with a lower degree of altruism are significantly more likely to choose high-income specialties, conditioning on an extensive set of covariates. This altruism measure is more predictive of income of specialty choice than a wide range of other characteristics, including parental income, student loan amount and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) score. On the other hand, the altruism measure does not predict choosing primary care specialties. I also find that altruism predicts students' self-reported likelihood of practicing medicine in an underserved area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It, however, does not provide a preference-based health utility score required for estimating quality-adjusted life-years in economic evaluations for health technology assessments. Objectives: To develop algorithms for mapping from measures used in MND clinical studies to allow for future prediction of the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) utility in populations of patients with MND when utility data have not been collected. Methods: Direct mapping models were developed using ordinary least squares and Tobit regression analyses to estimate EQ-5D-5L utilities (based on English tariffs), with ALSFRS-R total, domain, and item scores used as explanatory variables, using patient-level data from a UK cohort study. Indirect mapping models were also used to map EQ-5D-5L domains, using the same variables, along with the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale for MND using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Goodness of fit was assessed along with predicted values for each mapping model. Results: The best-performing model predicting EQ-5D-5L utilities used five items of the ALSFRS-R items as explanatory variables in a stepwise ordinary least squares regression. The mean squared error was 0.0228, and the mean absolute error was 0.1173. Prediction was good, with 55.4% of estimated values within 0.1 and 91.4% within 0.25 of the observed EQ-5D-5L utility value. Indirect mapping using the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale for MND provided less predictive power than direct mapping models. Conclusions: This is the first study to present mapping algorithms to crosswalk between ALSFRS-R and EQ5D-5L. This analysis demonstrates that the ALSFRS-R can be used to estimate EQ-5D-5L utilities when they have not been collected directly within a trial.","[Moore, Alan; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Eualuat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Young, Carolyn A.] Walton Ctr NHS Trust, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Bangor University; Walton Centre,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Eualuat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Young, Carolyn A/IWD-4833-2023; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Young, Carolyn A/0000-0003-1745-7720; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Local Research Network; Motor Neurone Disease Association UK; Walton Neurological Disability Fund,National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Local Research Network; Motor Neurone Disease Association UK; Walton Neurological Disability Fund,The National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Local Research Network provided research support and the Motor Neurone Disease Association UK and the Walton Neurological Disability Fund provided funding for this study.,,31,9,10,1,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,NOV,2018,21.0,11.0,,,,,1322,1329,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.05.005,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,HA2YE,30442280.0,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450111400008,0

A playful proof of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem,JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Brouwer; Fixed point; Indivisible goods; KKM lemma; Top trading cycles,,"We give an elementary proof of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. The only mathematical prerequisite is a version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: a sequence in a compact subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space has a convergent subsequence with a limit in that set. Our main tool is a 'no-bullying' lemma for agents with preferences over indivisible goods. What does this lemma claim? Consider a finite number of children, each with a single indivisible good (a toy) and preferences over those toys. Let us say that a group of children, possibly after exchanging toys, could bully some poor kid if all group members find their own current toy better than the toy of this victim. The no-bullying lemma asserts that some group S of children can redistribute their toys among themselves in such a way that all members of S get their favorite toy from 5, but they cannot bully anyone.

Matching adults in the 1992-2012 Taiwan Social Change Survey to the malaria intensity in their individual place and year of birth, difference-in-difference estimation shows strong evidence that the eradication increased men's own educational attainment as well as their family income in adulthood. We also use the 1980 census data to show there was a sharp education increase after the eradication. Furthermore, the eradication increased the educational attainment of married men's spouses. Finally, quantile regressions show that the effect concentrated on the lower percentile of the income distribution. Overall, our results suggest negative effects of early-life exposure to malaria.","[Shih, Hsiu-Han] Tunghai Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Ming-Jen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, Ctr Res Econometr Theory & Applicat, Taipei, Taiwan",Tunghai University; National Taiwan University,"Lin, MJ (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.;Lin, MJ (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Ctr Res Econometr Theory & Applicat, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, Taiwan.",mjlin@ntu.edu.tw,"Lin, Ming-Jen/M-5691-2013","Lin, Ming-Jen/0000-0002-7174-2226","Ministry of Education, Taiwan [107L90020]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [107-3017-F-002-004, 101-2410-H-002-029-MY2]","Ministry of Education, Taiwan(Ministry of Education, Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Ministry of Education, Taiwan, Grant/Award Number: 107L90020; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, Grant/Award Numbers: 107-3017-F-002-004 and 101-2410-H-002-029-MY2",,36,4,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,OCT,2018,27.0,10.0,,,,,1484,1512,,10.1002/hec.3781,0.0,,,29,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GS6LC,29896762.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443806600008,0

In many applications, such as dividing a land-estate or a time-interval, it is also important that the pieces are connected. We propose two additional requirements: resource-monotonicity (RM) and population-monotonicity (PM). When either the cake or the set of agents grows or shrinks and the cake is re-divided using the same rule, the utility of all remaining agents must change in the same direction. Classic cake-cutting protocols are neither RM nor PM. Moreover, we prove that no Pareto-optimal proportional division rule can be either RM or PM. Motivated by this negative result, we search for division rules that are weakly-Pareto-optimal - no other division is strictly better for all agents. We present two such rules. The relative-equitable rule, which assigns the maximum possible relative value equal for all agents, is proportional and PM. The so-called rightmost mark rule, which is an improved version of the Cut and Choose protocol, is proportional and RM for two agents. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Discrete Choice Experiment with duration (or DCETTO) is free of such bias, but respondents find this cognitively more challenging. This paper explores non-iterative TTO with or without lead time: NI(LT)TTO. In NI(LT)TTO, respondents see a series of independent pairwise choices without iteration (similar to DCETTO), but one of the two scenarios always involves full health for a shorter duration (similar to TTO). We compare three different types of NI(LT)TTO relative to DCETTO. Each type is presented in two modes: (a) verbally tabulated (as in a DCE) and (b) with visual aids (as in a TTO). The study has 8 survey variants, each with 12 experimental choice tasks and a 13th task with a logically determined answer. Data on the 12 experimental choices from an online survey of 6,618 respondents are modelled, by variant, using conditional logistic regressions. The results indicate that NI(LT)TTO is feasible, but some relatively mild states appear to have implausibly low predicted values, and the range of predicted values is much narrower than in DCETTO. The presentation of NI(LT)TTO tasks needs further improvement.","[Feng, Yan] Off Hlth Econ, London, England; [Hole, Arne Risa; Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Karimi, Milad] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Karimi, Milad; Tsuchiya, Aki; van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Sheffield,"Tsuchiya, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",a.tsuchiya@sheffield.ac.uk,"Hole, Arne Risa/JNE-2362-2023; Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Van Hout, Ben/0000-0001-9698-6094; Karimi, Milad/0000-0002-5298-174X; Hole, Arne Risa/0000-0002-9413-8101; Feng, Yan/0000-0003-4436-1126",EuroQol Research Foundation,EuroQol Research Foundation,"EuroQol Research Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 19 June 2015; EuroQol Research Foundation",,16,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,AUG,2018,27.0,8.0,,,,,1247,1263,,10.1002/hec.3773,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GL4IN,29774632.0,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000437114300008,0

We introduce partial mixture sets (where certain paths may be missing or excluded) and provide a formal extension of the well-known axiomatisation of cardinal linear utility by Herstein and Milnor. In order to compensate for the weaker structure of partial mixture sets, it is necessary to strengthen the Herstein-Milnor axioms. We show that partial mixture sets feature in a variety of benchmark models in the literature and especially where utility may be cardinal nonlinear on a richer set of paths or a larger set of prospects. For instance, in the theory of ambiguity: the canonical partial mixture set consists of the full set of acts together with the set of convex paths that connect comonotonic acts.

Study objective was to compare the costs and outcomes of four genetic testing strategies in children with ASD. Methods A microsimulation model estimated the outcomes and costs (in societal and public payer perspectives in Ontario, Canada) of four genetic testing strategies: CMA for all, CMA for all followed by ES for those with negative CMA and syndromic features (CMA+ES), ES or GS for all. Results Compared to CMA, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per additional child identified with rare pathogenic variants within 18 months of ASD diagnosis was $CAN5997.8 for CMA? ES, $CAN13,504.2 for ES and $CAN10,784.5 for GS in the societal perspective. ICERs were sensitive to changes in ES or GS diagnostic yields, wait times for test results or pre-test genetic counselling, but were robust to changes in the ES or GS costs. Conclusion Strategic integration of ES into ASD care could be a cost-effective strategy. Long wait times for genetic services and uncertain utility, both clinical and personal, of sequencing results could limit broader clinical implementation.","[Yuen, Tracy; Szatmari, Peter; Ungar, Wendy J.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Yuen, Tracy; Szatmari, Peter; Ungar, Wendy J.] Hosp Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Ctr Res & Learning, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, 11-F,686 Bay St, Toronto M5G 0A4, ON, Canada; [Carter, Melissa T.] Childrens Hosp Eastern, Reg Genet Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Szatmari, Peter] Univ Toronto, Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Hosp Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Ottawa; Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); Centre for Addiction & Mental Health - Canada,"Ungar, WJ (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Ungar, WJ (通讯作者)，Hosp Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Ctr Res & Learning, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, 11-F,686 Bay St, Toronto M5G 0A4, ON, Canada.",wendy.ungar@sickkids.ca,,"Ungar, Wendy/0000-0002-0762-0101",Canada Institutes of Health Research Autism Research Training Program; Doctoral Autism Scholars Award; Ontario Graduate Scholarship; RestraComp Hospital for Sick Children Foundation Student Scholarship Program,Canada Institutes of Health Research Autism Research Training Program; Doctoral Autism Scholars Award; Ontario Graduate Scholarship(Ontario Graduate Scholarship); RestraComp Hospital for Sick Children Foundation Student Scholarship Program,"TY was supported through the Canada Institutes of Health Research Autism Research Training Program, Doctoral Autism Scholars Award, Ontario Graduate Scholarship and RestraComp Hospital for Sick Children Foundation Student Scholarship Program.

A stochastic process determines an infinite sequence of ex-ante probability distributions over the states of the world. It is shown that when a social welfare order over such sequences is complete, transitive, continuous, and gives no dictatorship either to the present or the future, then it is represented by a convex combination of an integral over a countably additive measure and an integral over a purely finitely additive measure. The notions of symmetric treatment of the present and the future, stationarity for the present and anonymity for the future are introduced. According to the symmetric treatment, the distributions of the states of the world in the present, when constant in time, and in the distant future can be interchanged without affecting the welfare. The sustainable social welfare order that treats the present and the future symmetrically and satisfies stationarity for the present and anonymity for the future is a sum of the discounted average of the expected utility and the expected utility over the occupation measure of the stochastic process.

Methods: We reviewed the contents of the Tufts Medical Center Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, a repository of all English language cost-perdisability-adjusted life-year averted studies indexed in PubMed. Our review included all catalogued cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year studies published from 2000 through 2015. We restricted attention to studies that investigated interventions in LMICs. Results: Our analysis identified 381 studies (80%) focused on LMICs. Of these studies, 250 (66%) cited the World Health Organization's 1 to 3 times gross domestic product per capita threshold. A full-text review of 60 (24%) of these articles (randomly selected) revealed that none justified use of this threshold in the particular country or countries studied beyond citing (generic) guideline documents. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness analysis can help inform health care spending, but its value depends on incorporating assumptions that are valid for the applicable setting. Rather than rely on commonly used, generic economic thresholds, we encourage authors to use context-specific thresholds that reflect local preferences.","[Leech, Ashley A.; Kim, David D.; Cohen, Joshua T.; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Eualuat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, 800 Washington St 063, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts Medical Center,"Leech, AA (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Ctr Eualuat Value & Risk Hlth, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, 800 Washington St 063, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",aleech@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,"Kim, David/JTD-2751-2023","Kim, David D./0000-0002-3383-8972",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1097194]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1097194] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),This study was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (grant no.

These impediments, which may be unique to RDs or also apply to common diseases but are particularly pertinent in RDs, are diverse and interrelated. Objective: To develop for the first time a catalog of primary impediments to RD research and HTA, and to describe the cause and effect of individual challenges. Methods: Challenges were identified by an international 22-person expert working group and qualitative outreach to colleagues with relevant expertise. A broad range of stakeholder perspectives is represented. Draft results were presented at annual European and North American International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) congresses, and written comments were received by the 385-strong ISPOR Rare Disease Review Group from two rounds of review. Findings were refined and confirmed via targeted literature search. Results: Research-related challenges linked to the low prevalence of RDs were categorized into those pertaining to disease recognition and diagnosis, evaluation of treatment effect, and patient recruitment for clinical research. HTA-related challenges were classified into issues relating to the lack of a tailored HTA method for RD treatments and uncertainty for HTA agencies and health care payers. Conclusions: Identifying and highlighting diverse, but interrelated, key challenges in RD research and HTA is an essential first step toward developing implementable and sustainable solutions. A collaborative multistakeholder effort is required to enable faster and less costly development of safe, efficacious, and appropriate new RD therapies that offer value for money.","[Nestler-Parr, Sandra] Rare Access Ltd, Royal Leamington Spa, England; [Korchagina, Daria] Univ Paris Sud, Mental Hlth & Publ Hlth Unit, INSERM, U669, Paris, France; [Toumi, Mondher] Aix Marseille Univ, Publ Hlth & Chron Dis Lab, Marseille, France; [Pashos, Chris L.] Takeda Pharmaceut Int Inc, Global Outcomes & Epidemiol Res, Cambridge, MA USA; [Blanchette, Christopher] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, Charlotte, NC USA; [Molsen, Elizabeth] ISPOR, Sci & Hlth Policy Initiat, Lawrenceville, NJ USA; [Morel, Thomas; Simoens, Steven] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Pharmaceut & Pharmacol Sci, Leuven, Belgium; [Kalo, Zoltan] Eotvos Lorand Univ, ELTE, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Kalo, Zoltan] Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Gatermann, Ruediger] CSL Behring, Biotherapies Life, Healthcare Policy & External Affairs Europe, Marburg, Germany; [Redekop, William] Erasmus Univ, Hlth Technol Assessment, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Universite Paris Saclay; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; KU Leuven; Eotvos Lorand University; CSL; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam","Korchagina, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sud, 97 Blvd Port Royal, F-75679 Paris, France.",dko@creativ-ceutical.com,"Kalo, Zoltan/G-7582-2011; Redekop, Ken/AAA-2423-2020","Kalo, Zoltan/0000-0001-7762-2607; Redekop, Ken/0000-0001-9538-4083; Morel, Thomas/0000-0002-0690-5359; Simoens, Steven/0000-0002-9512-2005",,,,,112,67,69,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAY,2018,21.0,5.0,,,,,493,500,,10.1016/j.jval.2018.03.004,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GF7VC,29753344.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432175400002,0

Boston Scientific (manufacturer) submitted a case for the adoption of the technology, claiming that it has a longer battery life resulting in a longer time to CRT-D replacement. Other claimed benefits were fewer complications associated with replacement procedures, fewer hospital admissions, less time spent in hospital and reduced demand on cardiology device implantation rooms. The submission was critiqued by Cedar, an external assessment centre. The submitted clinical evidence showed that ENDURALIFE-powered devices implanted during the period 2008-2010 were superior, in terms of longevity, to other devices at that time. Submitted economic evidence indicated that, because of a reduction in the need for replacement procedures, ENDURALIFE-powered devices were cost saving when compared to comparator devices. Cedar highlighted uncertainty of the applicability of the clinical evidence to devices marketed today. The Medical Technologies Advisory Committee noted that this was unavoidable due to the follow-up time required to study battery life. Clinical experts noted that increased battery life is an important patient benefit. However, centres use devices from multiple manufacturers to negate pressure on clinical services in the event of a major device recall. The clinical and economic evidence showed benefits to the patient, and further analysis requested by the committee suggested that ENDURALIFE-powered CRT-Ds may save between A 2120 pound and A 5627 pound per patient over 15 years through a reduction in the need for replacement procedures. ENDURALIFE-powered CRT-D devices received a positive recommendation in Medical Technologies Guidance 33.","[Evans, James Michael; Morgan, Helen] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Cleves, Andrew; Carolan-Rees, Grace] Cedar Healthcare Technol Res Ctr, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Millar, Liesl] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England",Cardiff University; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Evans, JM (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",james.evans2@wales.nhs.uk,,"Morgan, Helen E/0000-0003-2470-9746; Gildea, Liesl/0000-0001-7249-102X",,,,,31,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

To reduce patient heterogeneity, we limit the sample to a given condition, diabetes type II, that is treated almost exclusively in primary care. We estimate GP fixed-effect models and control for a wide set of patient characteristics. Our results show that, for each visit, patients with low education get shorter consultations but more medical tests, patients with low income get less of both, and patients with low education/income get less services in monetary terms. We also find that, during a year, patients with low education/income visit the GP more often and receive more services in monetary terms.

Newly constructed historical data on drug-trafficking organizations' areas of operation at the municipality level and monthly homicide data allow us to control for a rich set of fixed effects and to leverage variation in the timing of kingpin captures to estimate their effects. This analysis indicates that kingpin captures cause large and sustained increases to the homicide rate in the municipality of capture and smaller but significant effects on other municipalities where the kingpin's organization has a presence, supporting the notion that removing kingpins can have destabilizing effects throughout an organization that are accompanied by escalations in violence. We also find reductions in homicides in municipalities surrounding the municipality where kingpins are captured. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Objective The aim of this study was to estimate the potential cost savings that may be derived from consolidation of local health authorities (LHAs) with specific reference to the Italian setting. Methods For our empirical analysis, we use data relating to the costs of the LHAs as reported in the 2012 LHAs' Income Statements published within the New Health Information System (NSIS) by the Ministry of Health. With respect to the previous literature on the consolidation of local health departments (LHDs), which is based on expost-assessments on what has been the impact of the consolidation of LHDs on health spending, we use an ex-ante-evaluation design and simulate the potential cost savings that may arise from the consolidation of LHAs. Results Our results show the existence of economies of scale with reference to a particular subset of the production costs of LHAs, i.e. administrative costs together with the purchasing costs of goods (such as drugs and medical devices) as well as non-healthcare-related services. Conclusions The research findings of our paper provide practical insight into the concerns and challenges of LHA consolidations and may have important implications for NHS organisation and for the containment of public healthcare expenditure.","[Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5-7, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Natl Res Univ, Lab Comparat Social Res, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Rizzi, Dino; Zanette, Michele] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy",University of Pavia; University of York - UK; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5-7, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.;Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Lab Comparat Social Res, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",cinzia.dinovi@unipv.it,"Rizzi, Dino/M-9698-2015; Di Novi, Cinzia/AAK-3184-2021","Di Novi, Cinzia/0000-0002-3536-5507",,,,,34,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The framework characterises the appraisal processes as a diagnostic test aimed at identifying cost-effective (true positive) and non-cost-effective (true negative) technologies. Using the framework, factors that influence the value of operating an appraisal process, in terms of net gain to population health, are identified. The framework is used to gain insight into current policy questions including (a) how rigorous the process should be, (b) who should have the burden of proof, and (c) how optimal design changes when allowing for appeals, price reductions, resubmissions, and re-evaluations. The paper demonstrates that there is no one optimal appraisal process and the process should be adapted over time and to the specific technology under assessment. Optimal design depends on country-specific features of (future) technologies, for example, effect, price, and size of the patient population, which might explain the difference in appraisal processes across countries. It is shown that burden of proof should be placed on the producers and that the impact of price reductions and patient access schemes on the producer's price setting should be considered when designing the appraisal process.","[Johannesen, Kasper M.] Linkoping Univ, Div Hlth Care Anal, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Linkoping, Sweden; [Claxton, Karl; Sculpher, Mark J.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Wailoo, Allan J.] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Linkoping University; University of York - UK; University of Sheffield,"Johannesen, KM (通讯作者)，Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Div Hlth Care Anal, S-58183 Linkoping, Sweden.",kasper.munk.johannesen@liu.se,,"Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617; Sculpher, Mark/0000-0003-3746-9913",,,,,46,5,5,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2018,27.0,2.0,,,,,E41,E54,,10.1002/hec.3561,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,GA7NO,28833844.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428523400004,0

In line with such research background, the World Bank (WB) project aimed at measurement of legal framework efficiency was launched in 2004. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the reformative efforts on the sample of EU national economies based on WB indicators of legal framework efficiency and WB data on actual implemented reforms regarding enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency. Methodology applied is dynamic panel-data estimation, which, besides the data on the existence of legal framework reforms, also includes additional variables that have an impact on judicial efficiency: level of GDP, government expenditures, and level of corruption. The results indicate that reformative efforts taken by the governments in this period have not had the desired effect on the indicators measuring the efficiency of the enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency procedures. Government efforts in the future should be devoted to better design of the reforms, since the resources for the reforms had not been allocated efficiently.","[Dimitric, Mira; Skalamera-Alilovic, Dunj A.; Zikovic, Ivana Tomas] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Dimitric, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Rijeka, Croatia.",mira.dimitric@efri.hr; dunja.skalamera-alilovic@efri.hr; ivana.tomas.zikovic@efri.hr,"Dimitrić, Mira/R-9274-2018; Žiković, Ivana Tomas/R-5169-2018; Tomas Žiković, Ivana/AAJ-8542-2020","Tomas Žiković, Ivana/0000-0002-9156-3479",Croatian Science Foundation [6558]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.09],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,This work has been supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project 6558 Business and Personal Insolvency: The Ways to Overcome Excessive Indebtedness and by the University of Rijeka under the project: Approaches and Methods of Cost and Management Accounting in Croatian Public Sector (No. 13.02.1.2.09).,,36,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,172,182,,,,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100019,0

Firstly, we modify the classical first-order stochastic dominance relation between returns of two given portfolios for the case with endogenous randomness of returns. Endogenous randomness (or decision dependent randomness) means that the probability distribution of asset returns may depend on the decision variable, i.e. on the weights associated to the assets. This is applicable mainly in the high frequency trading, emission allowance trading and/or in the illiquid markets.

However, nowadays we are witnessing an economic slowdown, because the current engines of growth are slowly losing their power to drive the Chinese economy. China needs new growth impulses to maintain stable economic growth and avoid the middle income trap.

Viewed through a long-term perspective that takes indirect effects into consideration, foreign direct investment is nonetheless accompanied by many negative effects. Foreign direct investment is claimed to not necessarily support economic growth and employment especially in cases when foreign direct investment largely crowds out existing investments. Investors are claimed to also, not form ties with domestic companies, production also tends to be focused on technologically less complicated phases of the production chain, and transnational companies in the country are also believed to implement unfriendly strategies. Each country has certain factors that are important for investor decision-making. Many of these factors can influence the host economy and encourage interest from foreign investors. Some factors such as the position of the state, on the other hand, cannot influence the host economy. Investors generally prefer countries that are attractive for some reason. A unified definition of factors that are decisive for investors is quite difficult, however, Countries wishing to support the flow of foreign investment use variety of tools to attract investors, including host country promotion, investment incentives, or aftercare services. The aim of the paper is to identify, based on the available literature, the possible factors influencing the inflow of foreign direct investment into the country in general and using statistical methods to identify specific factors influencing foreign direct investment in the selected country. Using multiple regression analysis, the Gross domestic product, Corporation tax, Science and research expenditures and the Corruption perception index were identified as significant factors influencing foreign direct investment in the Czech Republic.","[Linhartova, Veronika; Owusu, Evans] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Linhartova, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",veronika.linhartova@upce.cz; evans.owusu@student.upce.cz,,,[SGS_2018_21],,This contribution was supported by SGS_2018_21.,,21,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,786,793,,,,,,8,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP4BP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000550734100084,0

That is why they are a promising tool for forecasting, especially in a case of nonlinear time series. One of the most popular nonparametric regression method is kernel smoothing. The aim of the paper is to assess the usefulness of the selected kernel smoothers to predict log returns of the indices from the Polish, Czech and Hungarian stock markets. Two kernel smoothers were applied in the research. The first one was the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, which is the most popular nonparametric regression method. The second one was the local-linear kernel estimator, which combines the local linear approximation and the kernel smoother.

For this purpose, the original Sato specification is modified by adding the time variable that allows us to observe how the relationship between the production and the input factors changes over time. The Nonlinear Least Squares method with an appropriate initial values setting is used to estimate its parameters. Based on these parameters the isoquant maps are depicted and the borders of the economically efficient region are determined. Within that area, the isoquant slope development described by the values of the marginal rate of technical substitution is used to identify the type of the technological progress in the investigated sectors for each country.

In the present paper, we describe the algorithms, transforming these problems into their deterministic equivalents.","[Smid, Martin; Kozmik, Vaclav] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Smíd, M (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Pod Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 8, Czech Republic.",smid@utia.cas.cz,"Kozmik, Vaclav/E-2036-2013",,Czech Science Foundation [16-01298S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by grant No. GA 16-01298S of the Czech Science Foundation.

We build a panel database that combines individuals' information from the Ministry of Health and a database provided by two private health insurers. We perform the correlation test for consumption of health services frequency and supplemental coverage. Following Fang et al. (2008), we condition the estimation on health controls that are available to the econometrician but not to insurers. In both cases we obtain a positive correlation, suggesting that adverse selection predominates. In order to rule out some moral hazard effects, we estimate the correlation between previous frequency of healthcare service consumption and supplemental insurance purchase. The positive correlation obtained is robust to the inclusion of controls for diagnosis implemented by health insurers, suggesting that despite some risk selection strategies, they are not protected from adverse selection. We conclude that some subsidies to supplemental coverage purchase would lower public expenditure in Colombia. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Low-income consumers' lack of health insurance literacy or information regarding CSRs may lead them to not take-up CSR benefits for which they are eligible. We use administrative data from 2014 to 2016 on roughly 22 million health insurance plan choices of low-income individuals enrolled in ACA Marketplace coverage to assess whether they behave in a manner consistent with being aware of the availability of CSRs. We take advantage of discontinuous changes in the schedule of CSR benefits to show that consumers are highly sensitive to the value of CSRs when selecting insurance plans and that a very low percentage select dominated plans. These findings suggest that CSR subsidies are salient to consumers and that the program is well designed to account for any lack of health insurance literacy among the low-income population it serves.

Cancers played a significant role in changing the direction of the effects of unemployment on mortality. The overall pattern of the effects of macroeconomic conditions on mortality in South Korea roughly follows the corresponding changes observed in the United States. We have provided evidence that the sudden change in the relationship between economic conditions and mortality was driven by diseases with higher and rapidly rising treatment costs.

Objectives: To examine to what extent these ISTs provide value for money and which IST has the highest expected value. Methods: The net benefit framework of health economic evaluations is used to conduct a value-of-implementation analysis of nine ISTs. Seven are directed to health professionals and two to cancer survivors. The analysis consists of four steps: 1) analyzing the expected value of perfect implementation (EVPIM); 2) assessing the estimated costs of the various ISTs; 3) comparing the ISTs costs with the EVPIM; and 4) assessing the total net benefit (TNB) of the ISTs. These steps are followed to identify which strategy has the greatest value. Results: The EVPIM for physical exercise in the Netherlands is (sic)293 million. The total costs for the ISTs range from (sic)34,000 for printed educational materials for professionals to (sic)120 million for financial incentives for patients, and thus all are cost-effective. The TNB of the ISTs that are directed to professionals ranges from (sic)5.7 million for printed educational materials to (sic)30.9 million for reminder systems. Of the strategies that are directed to patients, only the motivational program had a positive net benefit of (sic)100.4 million. Conclusions: All the ISTs for cancer survivors, except for financial incentives, had a positive TNB. The largest improvements in adherence were created by a motivational program for patients, followed by a reminder system for professionals.
