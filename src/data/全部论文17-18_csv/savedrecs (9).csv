We find evidence that shows that, contrary to a harmonious view of society, Keynes had a class stratification of society and an understanding of conflictive interests and developments compatible with that of Marx and Kalecki. The presence of political motivations as fuel for economic instability is another shared element between Kalecki and Keynes. Differences arise regarding the relative importance of the inter- and intra-class dynamic as a driver of distributive conflict, and the State's capabilities to guide or control those conflicts and their consequences.","[Gabriel Bortz, Pablo] Natl Univ San Martin, San Martin, Argentina",,"Bortz, PG (通讯作者)，Natl Univ San Martin, San Martin, Argentina.",pablobortz@yahoo.com,,,,,,,27,3,3,1,2,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We experimentally investigate the effect of violations of the distributive justice norm of just deserts on honesty in a setting where behaving dishonestly entails income redistribution. We find that the violation of the just deserts norm results in a greater propensity toward dishonesty. We then test a more general proposition that violations of just deserts induce dishonesty, even in cases where dishonesty does not have redistributive consequences. Our results confirm this proposition but only for cases in which the violation of just deserts also entails income inequality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) find zero to modest positive effects of capital expenditure on student achievement; however, these studies identify only the effect of capital expenditure financed by a marginally passed bond with a vote share at the cutoff. In this paper I estimate the average effect of capital expenditure on student achievement by incorporating a latent factor model into the existing RDD framework, and comparing school districts that are similar in their underlying confounding variables, namely preferences for educational investment.

This paper experimentally studies whether people can cooperate with each other by endogenously showing their identities and building cooperative reputations when there is an option to hide the identities. Our experiment shows that a non-negligible fraction of subjects choose to conceal their identities and accordingly subjects fail to cooperate with each other in communities if hiding is cost-free. However, almost all subjects disclose their identities and successfully achieve cooperation if a cost is charged for the act of hiding. This finding has a broad methodological implication for the study of reputation mechanisms when infinitely repeated games are used in an experiment, as people's behavior may be determined by their ability to hide identities.

J,"Kaufmann, RK",,,,"Kaufmann, Robert K.",,,Airfares and oil prices: 'Feathers and Rockets' adjustments,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Airfares; Oil markets; Asymmetric adjustments,TRANSMISSION,"One reason that the US Department of Justice is examining collusion within the airline industry may be the small (12%) decline in airfares that follows a large (57%) drop in crude oil prices. This relatively small response could be caused by three mechanisms related to the oil market; (1) slow rates of adjustment, (2) airfares adjust asymmetrically to changes in the oil market, or (3) asymmetric adjustments within the oil market that are communicated symmetrically to airfares. I evaluate these hypotheses by estimating a cointegrating vector autoregression model from monthly data and testing the error correction mechanism for asymmetry. Although small, estimated rates of adjustment indicate that the large reduction in oil prices has been passed to airfares. Tests of the error correction model do not provide evidence for asymmetric adjustments between airfares and oil market. Contrary to the relation between crude oil and motor gasoline prices, prices for jet fuel adjust faster to reductions in crude oil prices and so cannot be responsible for the relatively small decline in airfares. Although the CVAR model does not identify an oil-related mechanism that can generate the small decline in airfares relative to the large decline in the price for crude oil, this absence does not imply the converse, that airlines collude to set airfares.

The Kaldor Kalecki growth model is the Kaldor business cycle model with two modifications: exponential growth introduced by Dana and Malgrange and Kaleckian investment time delay considered in this paper. This model has a form of a system of differential equations with time delay. The methods of dynamical system theory and bifurcation theory are used in the analysis of dynamics of growth cycles. Taking the time delay in investment as a bifurcation parameter we show the existence of a single Hopf bifurcation. We show that the time delay creates a limit cycle in a wider range of parameters than the model without the time delay. The time delay is the source of fluctuations which are described in a deterministic way. We carry out the numerical analysis of the model and find the limit cycle solution as well as we find that the higher the time delay parameter value the longer the period and the higher the amplitude of income and capital. We find that there is a distinguished value of growth rate parameter g=0.0147 for which the lowest value of investment time delay or the lowest value of speed of adjustment is required to obtain cyclic solutions.,"[Krawiec, Adam] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Management, Lojasiewicza 4, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland; [Szydlowski, Marek] Jagiellonian Univ, Astron Observ, Orla 171, PL-30244 Krakow, Poland; [Krawiec, Adam; Szydlowski, Marek] Jagiellonian Univ, Mark Kac Complex Syst Res, Lojasiewicza 11, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University; Jagiellonian University; Jagiellonian University,"Krawiec, A (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Management, Lojasiewicza 4, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland.",adam.krawiec@uj.edu.pl; marek.szydlowski@uj.edu.pl,"Krawiec, Adam/ABC-5854-2020","Krawiec, Adam/0000-0002-9885-253X",Narodowe Centrum Nauki (National Science Centre Poland) project [2014/15/B/HS4/04264],Narodowe Centrum Nauki (National Science Centre Poland) project,The authors acknowledge the support of the Narodowe Centrum Nauki (National Science Centre Poland) project 2014/15/B/HS4/04264.

My approach revolves around the autonomy that employers (principals) grant to workers (agents), which is a key feature of workplace organization. I hypothesize that social trust generates a comparative advantage in industries with more autonomous micro production environments. I employ individual-level data on work autonomy to construct a measure of the extent to which industries are characterized by autonomy in the production process. Results of a cross-country cross-industry analysis confirm that countries with higher levels of social trust have a comparative advantage in high-autonomy industries and vice versa. Results are robust to the possibility of reverse causality. The paper's key contribution is to provide a link between the microeconomic literature on workplace organization and the comparative macroeconomic literature on social trust.","[van Hoorn, Andre] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Hoorn, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",A.van.Hoorn@fm.ru.nl,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Empirically, R&D investment and knowledge capital are negatively correlated with debt at the firm level, which is in contrast with the positive relationship between physical investment and firm debt. I propose a new model to account for these facts: Firms accumulate firm-specific knowledge capital through R&D investment. However, knowledge capital - different from physical capital - cannot be used as banking collateral. Firms with high R&D investment opportunities rely more on internal finance and less on external debt. The model is quantitatively consistent with empirical facts along several dimensions. Based on the model, I then study the implications of two industrial policies. A practice that encourages using intellectual property as collateral for bank loans has a relatively small effect. I recommend a policy of tax credits for R&D investment. In fact, this policy can increase output by more than 5% and welfare by more than 3% in the long run. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While prior research has emphasized the role of social pressures, firm-specific factors, as well as CEO characteristics in CER, little attention has been paid to the impacts of political connections. We propose a mechanism-based framework to study how political connections affect firm's propensity to engage in CER. Using comprehensive environmental information disclosure data on China's listed firms, augmented by unique data on political connections, we find that political connections have a positive effect on CER. This effect is more pronounced for state-owned firms and in cities with stringent environmental regulations. With respect to the channels through which political connections increase CER, we further find that political connections help firms to receive government grants, subsidies and tax reduction related to the environment protection, and implement government environmental policies.

We explore the implications of this phenomena for satisfaction with one's spouse in terms of sexual satisfaction along a range of dimensions, care received from one's spouse, affection expressed to, and received from one's spouse and the prevalence of domestic violence in the home. The main argument that we develop in the paper is that assortative mating is associated with higher satisfaction levels with one's spouse because those involved in homogamous marriages will have more shared values, have more empathy for each other and be better able to communicate with each other, both in terms of everyday living and in terms of their sex lives. We test this argument using data from the China Health and Family Life Survey. We find considerable support for the argument that marrying up, or down, lowers satisfaction with one's spouse.","[Cheng, Zhiming] Macquarie Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Smyth, Russell] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",Macquarie University; Monash University,"Smyth, R (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",zhiming.cheng@mq.edu.au; russell.smyth@monash.edu,"Smyth, Russell/AAE-1492-2019","Smyth, Russell/0000-0001-6593-5462",,,,,46,4,5,1,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

It first evaluates variability in the effects of uncertainty shocks by applying rolling sample and time-varying parameter Vector Autoregression models to US data covering the past 70 years. The results reveal that the effects of uncertainty shocks on the US economy have changed substantially over time. First, the negative effect of uncertainty shocks on the output decreased until the recent period, in which monetary policy rules are constrained by the zero lower bound. Second, contrary to the negative aggregate demand interpretation in the recent literature, uncertainty shocks acted as a negative aggregate supply shock in the earlier periods. From the past 50 years' data for 12 small open economies, I find that the negative effect of uncertainty shocks on output has increased, contrary to the US case. Additionally, the exchange rate and inflation responses are heterogeneous across countries, and the country's commodity exporter or safe haven status is critical in determining the sign of these responses. Finally, the increased vulnerability of small open economies to uncertainty shocks is associated with an increase in international trade. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Such a modification was first proposed by Harsanyi (1974) and was recently reformulated by Ray and Vohra (2015). The farsighted stable set is based on a notion of indirect dominance in which an outcome can be dominated by a chain of coalitional moves in which each coalition that is involved in the sequence eventually stands to gain. However, it does not require that each coalition make a maximal move, i.e., one that is not Pareto dominated (for the members of the coalition in question) by another. Consequently, when there are multiple continuation paths, the farsighted stable set can yield unreasonable predictions. We restrict coalitions to hold common, history independent expectations that incorporate maximality regarding the continuation path. This leads to two related solution concepts: the rational expectations farsighted stable set and the strong rational expectations farsighted stable set. We apply these concepts to simple games and to pillage games to illustrate the consequences of imposing rational expectations for farsighted stability.","[Dutta, Bhaskar] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Warwick, England; [Dutta, Bhaskar] Ashoka Univ, Dept Econ, Rai, Haryana, India; [Vohra, Rajiv] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of Warwick; Ashoka University; Brown University,"Dutta, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Warwick, England.;Dutta, B (通讯作者)，Ashoka Univ, Dept Econ, Rai, Haryana, India.",b.dutta@warwick.ac.uk; Rajiv_Vohra@brown.edu,,,,,,,25,32,32,0,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

In practice, however, ties in preferences arise naturally and are widespread. Market design needs to handle ties carefully, because in the presence of indifferences, stability no longer implies Pareto efficiency, and the deferred acceptance algorithm cannot be applied to produce a Pareto efficient or a worker-optimal stable matching. We allow ties in preference rankings and show that the Pareto dominance relation on stable matchings can be captured by two simple operations which involve rematching of workers and firms via cycles or chains. Likewise, the Pareto relation defined via workers' welfare can also be broken down to two similar procedures which preserve stability. Using these structural results we design fast algorithms to compute a Pareto efficient and stable matching, and a worker -optimal stable matching. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Such information comprises a firm-specific signal of the current state of aggregate demand and, potentially (depending on the transparency regime) a public signal disseminated by the central bank. The economy has two sources of price dispersion: first, the heterogeneity of the private signals of firms whose prices always reflect current information, and second, the non-adjustment of prices by firms that fail to update their information from period-to-period. Monetary policy is conducted by the central bank to maximize expected welfare, with the study's focus on the optimal degree of transparency. A key finding is that, for plausible values of model parameters, full transparency cannot be optimal: whether zero or partial transparency is desirable then depends on the proportion of firms failing to update their information each period.","[James, Jonathan G.; Lawler, Phillip] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"James, JG (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales.",,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,,,,,27,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Results show that financial development influences firms' investments positively either directly or by reducing cash flow sensitivity. The impact remains the same for all types of firms. Moreover, the financial structure has an impact on investment efficiency of firms; this result also remains the same even after controlling levels of financial development. Study contributes that capital market based financial structure impacts investment decisions by reducing financing constraints and agency issue due to its strong monitoring ability.","[Khan, Muhammad Kaleem; He, Ying; Akram, Umair] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sarwar, Suleman] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Shandong University,"Khan, MK (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mkaleemkhan@yahoo.com,"Akram, Umair/AAK-7373-2021; Khan, Muhammad Kaleem/C-5173-2012; Khan, Muhammad Kaleem/AFN-6958-2022; Sarwar, Suleman/AEZ-9049-2022","Akram, Umair/0000-0002-9980-6164; Khan, Muhammad Kaleem/0000-0001-5552-0650; Sarwar, Suleman/0000-0002-4791-0293",,,,,46,38,40,1,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

As a result, there has been an increase in the competitiveness of some of the economies among the CEE states. Due to different priorities and goals, these countries are also characterized by different levels in socio-economic development. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to identify the determinants affecting the competitiveness among the selected CEE countries. Methods: Based on Eurostat data, a set of determinants affecting competitiveness was established. A number of determinants have been eliminated in relation to the variation coefficient. At the same time, a classification of the level of competitiveness among the CEE countries has been made by using the Perkal method. The analysis used 14 selected indicators, 10 of which are considered as stimulating, and 4 as deteriorating the competitiveness of national economies. The result led to obtaining a synthetic level indicator of potential of the CEE countries. Findings & Value added: Following the findings of the conducted analysis, the highest economic competitiveness exists in Estonia and in the Czech Republic, while the lowest was found in Romania and Bulgaria. The results of the evaluation obtained with the Perkal method concerning the competitiveness of the CEE countries that belong to the EU are largely consistent with those presented in different global competitiveness rankings. However, the method applied in this article seems much simpler and less time-consuming, allowing at the same time an optimal choice of analytical determinants. The selected linear Pearson correlation's coefficient confirmed that there is a strong positive relationship between the designated values of the synthetic indicator of competitiveness and the GDP per capita. This confirms the validity of test method used.","[Kruk, Hanna; Wasniewska, Anetta] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Kruk, H (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland.",h.kruk@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,,"Kruk, Hanna/0000-0003-0713-5269",,,,,31,29,29,0,6,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

VaR models, as any other risk management system, are meant to keep financial institutions out of trouble by, among other things, guiding investment decisions within established risk limits so that the viability of a business is not put unduly at risk in a sharp market downturn. However, some researchers have warned that the widespread use of VaR models creates negative externalities in financial markets, as it can feed market instability and result in what has been called endogenous risk, that is, risk caused and amplified by the system itself, rather than being the result of an exogenous shock. This paper aims at analyzing the potential of VaR systems to amplify market disturbances with an agent-based model of fundamentalist and technical traders which manage their risk with a simple VaR model and must reduce their positions when the risk of their portfolio goes above a given threshold. We analyse the impact of the widespread use of VaR systems on different financial instability indicators and confirm that VaR models may induce a particular price dynamics that rises market volatility. These dynamics, which we have called VaR cycles', take place when a sufficient dumber of traders reach their VaR limit and are forced to simultaneously reduce their portfolio; the reductions cause a sudden price movement, raise volatility and force even more traders to liquidate part of their positions. The model shows that market is more prone to suffer VaR cycles when investors use a short-term horizon to calculate asset volatility or a not-too-extreme value for their risk threshold.

What if the matching rate instead disappeared during bad aggregate states? I model an economy with liquid and illiquid savings accounts in which matching is suspended during downturns. The economy features the usual sources of heterogeneity in education and earnings processes, and it allows for time-inconsistent, preferences and heterogeneity in the discount rate. Although the theoretical effects of a countercyclical match are ambiguous due to income and substitution effects operating in different directions, the simulations of the model indicate that the policy delivers a large average increase in consumption from a set of households that look like the wealthy hand to mouth of Kaplan et al. (2014). And crucially, in contrast to conventional fiscal policy, the stimulus associated with countercyclical retirement actually improves the government's financing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Mendoza, EG",,,,"Mendoza, Enrique G.",,,The Public Debt Crisis of the United States,MANCHESTER SCHOOL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MODEL,"Since the birth of the Republic, the United States has gone through five debt-crisis episodes defined as year-on-year increases in net federal debt in the 95-percentile. The Great Recession is the second largest, and the only one in which primary deficits continue six years later and are expected to persist at least through 2026. Persistent deficits are also sharply at odds with the surpluses that contributed to the reversal of all major debt surges in U.S. history. There is a view that high debt is not a concern and more debt is needed for fiscal stimulus and/or strong global demand for safe assets'. This paper makes four points to the contrary based on findings from the literature: First, empirical work shows that debt sustainability conditions display a significant break after 2008 and fiscal stimulus fails when debt is high. Second, a dynamic general equilibrium model predicts that tax adjustments may not make the debt sustainable and will have adverse effects on macro aggregates and social welfare. Third, the strong appetite for U.S. public debt worldwide can be a slow-moving, transitory result from financial globalization in an environment in which U.S. financial markets are relatively more developed and the expected financing needs of the U.S. government are large. Fourth, domestic sovereign default could become optimal if the cost of regressive redistribution in order to make debt payments outweighs default costs related to the social value of debt for liquidity provision, self-insurance and risk-sharing.","[Mendoza, Enrique G.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Mendoza, Enrique G.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mendoza, Enrique G.] PIER, Cambridge, MA USA",University of Pennsylvania; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mendoza, EG (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Mendoza, EG (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Mendoza, EG (通讯作者)，PIER, Cambridge, MA USA.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Further, we assess the downside and upside short- and medium-run risk spillovers from oil to U.S. exchange rate returns and vice versa by computing the conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) risk measures. Before the copula estimations, we apply the spillover index of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and network diagrams to identify and select the currencies that are the most significant net contributors or net receivers of returns from/to the oil/currency markets. The copula results show strong evidence of time-varying and high average (tail) dependence between oil returns and the FX markets, which are net transmitters to oil, for the short and medium time horizons. On the other hand, we find average and relatively low dynamic dependence between oil and the net receiver currencies, regardless of the time horizons. Moreover, there is evidence of up and down risk asymmetric systemic risks from oil to currencies and vice versa for some countries in the short-and medium run horizons. Finally, the risk spillovers are asymmetric over time and investment horizons. These results have several important implications for hedging strategies and diversification benefits for oil and FX traders and institutional investors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a model in which a base product can be sold together with a voluntary extended warranty contract that insures consumers against the risk of product breakdown. Some consumers do not pay attention to extended warranties before making base product choices, but overestimate the value of such warranties at the point of sale. Under retail competition, the consumers' option to buy multiple base products can endogenously create a base price floor that may prevent firms from redistributing the full warranty profits via loss-leadership. Inducing competition in the warranty market weakly increases consumer welfare and weakly outperforms a minimum warranty standard, which can even reduce consumer surplus. The results are consistent with the effects of recent changes regarding extended warranty regulation by UK legislators. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the issue of how self-employed migrants, who account for up to 25 percent of total migrant workers in 2009 (Meng, 2012), acquire urban citizenship remains understudied. Using a unique sample from the 2009 Rural to Urban Migrants in China (RUMiC) survey, this paper explores whether self-employment choice contributes to migrant workers' ascension to urban citizenship and integration, and uncovers the underlying mechanisms. We find that although self-employed migrants are capable of earning a higher income, and improving their living conditions, their tendency to reside permanently in the city is not significantly different from their counterparts of wage workers. We argue that self-employed migrants, who are less covered by urban social securities and are more discriminated against by current urban household registration (Hukou) system, tend to lose faith in ascension to urban citizenship. It implies that a social security system with self-employed migrants being covered as well as an urban Hukou admission system favoring diverse human capital (especially taking into account entrepreneurship) would help accelerate the urbanization process.","[Ning, Guangjie] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Qi, Wei] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Tsinghua University,"Ning, GJ (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Dept Econ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China.",gjning@nankai.edu.cn,,"qi, wei/0000-0003-1768-9468",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473135]; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy,"The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71473135) and Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy.

This creates a rationale for a general thin capitalization rule limiting the amount of debt that qualifies for interest deductibility. This paper sets up a model of corporate finance and investment in a small open economy to identify the optimal constraint on tax-favoured debt finance, assuming that a given amount of revenue has to be raised from the corporate income tax. For plausible parameter values, the socially optimal debt-asset ratio is 2-3% points below the average corporate debt level currently observed. Driving the actual debt ratio down to this level through limitations on interest deductibility would generate a total welfare gain of about 5% of corporate tax revenue. The welfare gain would arise mainly from a fall in the social risks associated with corporate investment, but also from the cut in the corporate tax rate made possible by a broader corporate tax base.","[Sorensen, Peter Birch] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Sorensen, PB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",pbs@econ.ku.dk,,,,,,,32,4,4,1,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Our results confirm that economic growth initially leads to the deterioration of marine ecosystems. However, for a per capita income level of approximately 3,827 USD for the catch model and of 6,066 USD for the biomass model, we found beneficial impacts of economic growth on the sustainability of marine fisheries. Over the next two decades, we expect to see a decline in catch and indications of stock recovery. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper goes beyond the prevailing use of aggregate/averaged data in order to provide a more in-depth treatment of the dynamic effects of the price of crude oil on industrial output growth. To do so, we propose an Asymmetric Mixed Data Sampling (AMIDAS) model to examine if there is any concealed evidence of asymmetry arising from daily effects of the price of crude oil on monthly changes in industrial output in the United States (US). We find that this model is able to detect dynamic asymmetric impacts of a high frequency independent variable on a low frequency dependent variable more effectively than when the high frequency variable is aggregated up at the time interval of the low frequency variable. We find that, in comparison with the marginal lagged effects of a rise in the daily price of crude oil, the effects of a fall in the daily price of crude oil are more sluggish as it takes longer for the effects of the oil price drop to die off over time. This finding implies that a fall in the price of crude oil shifts the supply curve rightward less and at a much slower pace than an equivalent price rise shifts it to the left. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The invention of the substitute is assumed to follow a stochastic process that can be influenced by investment in energy research and development. I analyze the optimal investment strategy under alternative assumptions with respect to the economy's access to international financial markets, the terms on which credit is available, and the country's degree of dependence on resource imports. It is found that, in general, having access to capital markets does not necessarily lead to a higher investment rate. However, in the empirically relevant range of elasticity of intertemporal consumption substitution, the economy with access to credit invests more than under financial autarky. A higher degree of dependence on resource imports implies a lower optimal investment. Arrival of the substitute does not necessarily cause an immediate improvement in the net foreign asset position but may in fact cause its further deterioration.","[Vinogradova, Alexandra] ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Vinogradova, A (通讯作者)，ETH, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland.",avinogradova@ethz.ch,,"Brausmann, Alexandra/0000-0002-8769-8944",,,,,22,2,2,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Some of these equivalences are known but the derivations of others, such as cases for two types of free equity, are not. These equivalences lay the foundation for a proposed Accrued Rent Charge (ARC) as an alternative to Resource Rent Taxes (RRT), both as proposed and implemented. We argue that the ARC may be preferred to the RRT because the timing of returns to investors (owners of reproducible capital) and owners of natural assets coincide. That is, returns accrue to owners of natural assets earlier in time with the ARC relative to the RRT. In addition, we argue that, while both charges are inefficient when there is uncertainty, the ARC may be relatively more administratively and economically efficient. Finally, we use simulations to compare the ARC to the RRT and to standard income charges and discuss the results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

With an extensive literature review, we identify four major drivers of the wage premia: exporting firms hire more skilled workers, utilize more sophisticated machines, buy higher quality material inputs and are more productive than non-exporting firms.

In those countries where such information is arguably more precious to the firm, we find a significant positive relationship between a firm's probability of beginning to export to one market and the presence in the same market of a branch of the firm's financing bank.

The authors introduce a new notion that they call hysteretic persistence, which they see as essential because such a phenomenon as path-dependence in the short-run equilibrium cannot be described by the existing of notions of hysteresis and persistence. In the field of system (ir)reversibility, drawing upon their previous research (Chytil, Mask), 2014, 2015), the authors introduce a new notion of general reversibility, which they justify on the account that such phenomena as a shock counter shock sequence in both hysteretic-persistent and hysteretic systems cannot be described by either of Setterfield's (2008) notions of super-reversibility and irreversibility. Questioning Setterfield's (1998b, 1995) only too general dichotomy of lower/higher level of historical time, the authors rather suggest a characterization of historical time based on 6 attributes of high-level historical time based on the criteria of path-(in)dependence of equilibrium and (ir)reversibility. The suggested attributes underlie the authors' conceptualization scale which enables an assessment of a degree of historicity of any system. Finally, a practical application of the concept of hysteretic persistence is demonstrated on a case of Lavoie's PKA model (Lavoie, 2006) affected by a transitory demand shock. Setting the hysteretic persistence of Lavoie's PKA model into the conceptualization scale, the authors draw conclusions for a degree ofhistoricity of this system.","[Chytil, Zdenek; Maslo, Lukas] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Chytil, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",chytil@vse.cz; xmasl14@vse.cz,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Using quarterly inventory data over the period 1990Q4 to 2012Q1 and a sample of 15 of the largest listed oil companies in the world, we derive an Index of Scaled Physical Inventories (ISPI). We find declining ISPI up to the early 2000s is consistent with firms minimizing inventory for efficiency sake; then ISPI starts to increase, suggesting physical inventories could have contributed to the run-up in oil prices between 2003 and 2008. Highlighting heterogeneity in inventory behaviors amongst the large oil companies, the structural break test on the ratio of inventory to sales and the days to sales for individual companies shows that five companies had positive structural breaks during the speculation period, while the other companies had no or negative structural breaks. Contrary to declining inventory expectations due to a tightening oil market, the positive structural breaks suggest speculative behavior. We also examine the relationship between changes in profitability and changes in oil inventory over the pre-speculation and speculation period. Though some coefficients for inventory do switch from negative to positive over the two periods as hypothesized, they are only significant in a few cases. However, aggregate measures of inventory do switch and are significant, suggesting that, on average, inventory holdings negatively affected profitability in the pre-speculation period and positively affected profitability in the speculation period.

In keeping with most mainstream and heterodox discussions of uncertainty in economics, however, Lawson focuses on situations in which the objects of uncertainty are imagined and can be stated in a way that, potentially at least, allows them to be the subject of probability judgments. This focus results in a relative neglect of the kind of uncertainties that flow from the existence of possibilities that do not even enter the imagination and which are therefore ruled out as the subject of probability judgments. This paper explores uncertainties of the latter kind, starting with and building on Donald Rumsfeld's famous observations about known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Various connections are developed, first with Nassim Taleb's Black Swan, and then with Lawson's Keynes-inspired interpretation of uncertainty.","[Faulkner, Phil; Runde, Jochen] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Feduzi, Alberto] Univ London, SOAS, London, England; [Feduzi, Alberto] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Cambridge; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Technology Sydney,"Runde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",j.runde@jbs.cam.ac.uk,"Faulkner, Philip B/L-1552-2013","Faulkner, Philip/0000-0002-6074-4533",,,,,58,36,37,4,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We use a newly developed cointegration test, the bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), to examine this long-run relationship. The motivation for using the bootstrap methodology is to generate and apply critical values for the ARDL test that are valid and appropriate for the specific data sets used. Further, the bootstrap tests allow for endogeneity and feedback that may exist. Pesaran et al. (2001) highlighted the possibility of degenerate cases, but empirical studies in general ignore these and may conclude that cointegration exists when it does not. Our tests fail to find evidence of cointegration when GDP is the dependent variable. The absence of a long-run forcing relation from FDI and exports to GDP implies that FDI and exports were not the sole sources of economic growth in our selected Asian economies.

Economic theory predicts that a minimum wage increase will adversely affect firm provided training, and while we found that this effect was indeed observed on formal training, with a 1% increase in the minimum wage causing a 2.8% decline in the formal training of workers affected by minimum wage increases, no statistically significant decrease occurred with informal training. Further, although workers can potentially increase their self-learning activities to compensate for any decrease in skill development opportunities in the workplace, we found that an increase in the minimum wage did not increase worker initiated training. Therefore, the overall effect of an increase in the minimum wage was a decrease in skill development among those workers affected by minimum wages.","[Hara, Hiromi] Japan Womens Univ, Fac Human Sci & Design, Dept Social & Family Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 2-8-1 Mejirodai, Tokyo 1128681, Japan",Japan Womens University,"Hara, H (通讯作者)，Japan Womens Univ, Fac Human Sci & Design, Dept Social & Family Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 2-8-1 Mejirodai, Tokyo 1128681, Japan.",harahiromi@fc.jwu.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25380371, 15KK0097, 16K03711]; Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03711, 25380371, 15KK0097] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to express my appreciation to two anonymous referees and the following persons for their helpful comments: David Neumark, Hiroko Okudaira, Lorien Rice, Keisuke Kawata, Daniel Parent, Ayako Kondo, Hideo Owan, Takahiro Itoh, Masahisa Fujita, Atsushi Nakajima, Masayuki Morikawa, Kotaro Tsuru, Shintaro Yamaguchi, and Daiji Kawaguchi.

The market consists of a set of consumers who have different quality valuations. The public firm aims to maximize social surplus, whereas the private firm maximizes profit. In the first stage, both firms simultaneously choose qualities. In the second stage, both firms simultaneously choose prices. Consumers' quality valuations are drawn from a general distribution. Each firm's unit production cost is an increasing and convex function of quality. There are multiple equilibria. In some, the public firm chooses a low quality, and the private firm chooses a high quality. In others, the opposite is true. We characterize subgame-perfect equilibria. Equilibrium qualities are often inefficient, but under some conditions on consumer valuation distribution, equilibrium qualities are first best. Various policy implications are drawn.

(2012, 2014)-who argue that cooperation is intuitive-provide an incorrect interpretation of their own data. They make the mistake of inferring intuition from relative decision times alone, without taking into account absolute decision times. We re-examine their data and find that the vast majority of their responses are slow, exceeding four seconds, even in time-pressure treatments intended to promote intuitive responses. Further, a plot of the average cooperation rates by decision time fails to yield a monotonically decreasing relationship. However, among the few decisions that were relatively fast, there appears to be a positive-not negative-association between decision time and cooperation. We conclude that the data presented by Rand et al. (2012, 2014) fail to provide evidence for the hypothesis that cooperation is intuitive. If anything, their data indicate the opposite.

This paper theoretically investigates how emission permit allocation affects CO2 cost pass-through rate by developing a Nash-Cournot oligopolistic market equilibrium model. We find that the derived CO2 cost pass-through rates are consistent when grandfathering and auctioning rules are used for permit allocation, which are higher than that for benchmarking rule. It has also been found that the magnitude of CO2 cost pass-through rate is relevant to the type of definition, product market structure and average carbon intensity of the industry. We suggest that policy makers first use benchmarking rule to attract firms to participate at the early stage of emissions trading system (ETS) and then take auctioning rule when ETS is well developed.

The comparative effects of decentralized versus centralized religions on the optimal level of cooperation between the autocrat and the religious clerics, which itself impinges upon political stability, is analysed. The paper shows that the presence of a decentralized body of clerics makes autocratic regimes more unstable. It also shows that in time of stability, the level of reforms is larger with a centralized religion than with a decentralized one. When the autocrat in the decentralized case pushes more reforms than in the centralized one, he always does so at the cost of stability. Historical case studies are presented that serve to illustrate the main results.","[Auriol, Emmanuelle] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Platteau, Jean-Philippe] Univ Namur, Namur, Belgium",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Namur,"Auriol, E (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",emmanuelle.auriol@tse-fr.eu; jean-philippe.platteau@unamur.be,,,,,,,99,18,18,0,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We study a repeated trust game in which trading opportunities arise exogenously and a social network determines the information each player has. The main contribution of the paper is the characterization of optimal networks under alternative assumptions about how information flows across a network. When a defection is observed only by the victim's connections, cohesive networks are Pareto efficient as they allow players to coordinate their punishments to attain high equilibrium payoffs. In contrast, when a defection is observed by the victim's direct and indirect connections, barely connected networks maximize the number of players that can punish a defection and are therefore efficient.

However, it is not obvious how gift exchange should be organized if the principal's goal is to increase the performance of a reciprocal agent. Specifically, who should make the first gift, the principal or the agent? Although both orderings, by themselves, have been hypothesized and examined in theory and experiments, the literature is largely silent on the comparison. I report the results of a field experiment that compares the principal-first and agent-first orderings to each other and a gift-less control. Consistent with the previous experimental literature, I find that principal-first, gifts do increase agent performance. Unlike the literature, however, I find that agent-first, gifts are also effective. Comparing the two, I see that the agent-first ordering works best, is clearly cheaper to implement and differences appear on both the extensive and intensive margins. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In equilibrium, office holders' policy choices are ordered by type; politicians exert positive effort in the first term of office; and as politicians become highly office motivated, the highest politician type mixes with positive probability between shirking and choosing arbitrarily high policies. Nevertheless, the commitment problem of voters imposes a bound on equilibrium expected effort exerted by politicians that holds uniformly across the level of office benefit and the rate of time discounting. In particular, when politicians are highly office motivated, voters are too demanding in equilibrium, and voter welfare would increase if it were possible to commit to a lower cutoff for re-election.

To measure the magnitude of this quality-quantity tradeoff, we estimate a model of dialysis provision that explicitly incorporates a centre's unobservable and endogenous choice of treatment quality while allowing for unobserved differences in productivity across centres. We find that a centre that reduces its quality standards such that its expected rate of septic infections increases by 1 percentage point can increase its patient load by 1.6%, holding productivity, capital, and labour fixed; this corresponds to an elasticity of quantity with respect to quality of -0.2. Notably, our approach provides estimates of productivity that control for differences in quality, whereas traditional methods would misattribute lower-quality care to greater productivity.","[Grieco, Paul L.

In the first stage, A-agents, who are endowed with a quota that describes the maximal number of agents they can be matched to, simultaneously make proposals to the B-agents. In the second stage, B-agents sequentially, and respecting the quota, choose and match to available A-proposers. We study the subgame perfect Nash equilibria of the induced game. We prove that stable matchings are equilibrium outcomes if all A-agents' preferences are substitutable.

We found that during most of 2003-2016, the user cost was significantly lower than 2 percent, caused by high income growth, rapid credit expansion and low interest rates, which led to the persistent housing market imbalance.

To induce the retailers to locate closer to consumers and earn a larger market share, the manufacturers set wholesale prices below marginal cost. This market share effect dominates the previously focused coordination effect under which a higher wholesale price helps coordinate the retailers' pricing decisions. For each manufacturer, vertical separation is a dominant strategy so the endogenous determination of vertical separation versus vertical integration is a prisoner's dilemma game.","[Li, Youping] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, 130 Meilong Rd, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Shuai, Jie] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Shuai, J (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Ave, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China.",liyouping@ecust.edu.cn; shuaijie@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603083, 71603283]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We wish to thank the editor, Giacomo Corneo, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

Since the reforms started in the mid-1990s, publicly subsidized child care programs have decreased, and private care centers have increased. This might have increased the reliance of working mothers on informal child care and reduced their reliance on formal child care. Using post-reform data from the Project on Rural Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) of 2008, I estimate the effects of formal and informal child care on the labor supply of mothers of young children. A recursive model with instrumental variables is employed to account for endogeneity. I find a positive and significant impact of informal child care in the form of grandchild care on the mother's labor force participation, while no significant effect of formal child care in the form of kindergartens or paid nannies. Considering recent tendencies in China to postpone retirement, one possible method to maintain mothers' presence in the labor market could be to reinforce the availability and affordability of formal child care.(23)","[Li, Yunrong] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Li, YR (通讯作者)，Room 723,Gezhi Bldg,Liutai Ave 555, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",liyunrong@swufe.edu.cn,,"Li, Yunrong/0000-0002-3491-3401",National Social Science Foundation of China [15CJY017],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),this work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (grant number 15CJY017).

Using data produced in the controlled environment of an agent-based model's limit order book, we examine various resiliency indicators to determine their predictive capabilities. Most of the types of data created have traditionally been available either publicly or on a restricted basis to regulators and exchanges, but other types have never been collected. We confirmed our findings using actual order flow data with user identifications included from the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) and New York Mercantile Exchange.

Keynes unleashed a devastating critique of classical macroeconomics and introduced a new replacement schema that defines macroeconomics. The success of the Keynesian revolution triggered a counter-revolution that restored the classical tradition and now enforces a renewed classical monopoly. That monopoly has provided the intellectual foundations for neoliberalism which has produced economic and political conditions echoing the 1930s. Openness to Keynesian ideas seems to fluctuate with conditions, and current conditions are conducive to revival of the Keynesian revolution. However, a revival will have to overcome the renewed classical monopoly.","[Palley, Thomas] AFL CIO, Washington, DC 20005 USA",,"Palley, T (通讯作者)，AFL CIO, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",mail@thomaspalley.com,,,,,,,11,1,1,1,6,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The MDD equals zero if and only if error term is conditionally mean independent of the covariates. Our MDD test does not require any nonparametric estimation under the alternative and it is applicable even if we have many covariates in the regression model. We establish the asymptotic distributions of our test statistic under the null and a sequence of Pitman local alternatives converging to the null at the usual parametric rate. Simulations suggest that our MDD test has superb performance in terms of both size and power and it generally dominates several competitors. In particular, it is the only test that has well controlled size in the presence of many covariates and reasonable power against high frequency alternatives as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A slower pace of the RMB's internationalization based more on real demand might become a new norm in the future. To pursue a more sustainable RMB internationalization in the next decade, the Chinese government should maintain a relatively high economic growth rate, avoid the burst of systemic financial crisis, continue to liberalize the capital account in a gradual and cautious way, accelerate the reform and opening up of the domestic financial market, and integrate the RMB's internationalization with Asian monetary cooperation.","[Zhang, Ming; Zhang, Bin] Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, M (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangming@cass.org.cn,,,,,,,20,10,10,2,82,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

The subjective approach to employees is fully reflected in the empowerment process. The definition scope of the analysed notion has not been unambiguously delineated to date. In narrow terms, empowerment means delegating power in the decision-making process and is considered a management method. In broad terms, in turn, the idea is at times called even a management concept. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to provide answers to the following research questions: 1) Can empowerment be called a separate management concept? 2) What is the awareness of the essence of empowerment among contemporary employees? 3) What are the barriers to implementing empowerment assumptions in enterprises? Methods: The research process was based on literature studies and empirical research that was conducted in Poland under two separate research projects. One, carried out in the period 2006-2015, was oriented towards assessing the level of interest in employee participation and identifying the approach to implementing such participation in enterprises. The research covered over 300 respondents. It used structured interview complemented with free interview and analysis of the provided documents of the respondents' enterprises. The results of the research encouraged a closer look at the category of empowerment. Pilot empirical research on the category of empowerment was conducted in 2016 with questionnaire surveys. The research sample was 63 employees. Findings: It was found that empowerment should be perceived as certain expansion of employee participation rather than a separate management concept. It consisted in sharing not only information but also power with employees. The results of the empirical research permitted the ascertainment that interest in lower participation forms prevailed among the respondents. Barriers related to applying empowerment were sought in this context. The pilot research allowed a conclusion that the barriers should be sought primarily in the failure to prepare (also mentally) employees and employers for using empowerment.

We provide large sample evidence from 81 countries around the world that cleantech crowdfunding is more common in countries with low levels of individualism and more common when oil prices are rising. Cleantech crowdfunding campaigns are more likely to have higher capital goals, more photos, a video pitch, and longer text descriptions of the campaign. Relative to non-cleantech campaigns, the success of cleantech campaigns, in terms of achieving funding goals, is more economically sensitive to the campaign's goal size, being not-for-profit, and having a video pitch. The evidence is consistent with the view that while alternative energies are viewed as being more risky, and investors face greater information asymmetries relative to other types of investment projects, there are mechanisms for entrepreneurs to mitigate these information problems and be at least as successful in cleantech crowdfunding markets.

Our assessment is that the evidence to date is not sufficient to warrant recommending that vouchers be adopted on a widespread basis; however, multiple positive findings support continued exploration. Specifically, the empirical research on small-scale programs does not suggest that awarding students a voucher is a systematically reliable way to improve educational outcomes, and some detrimental effects have been found. Nevertheless, in some settings, or for some subgroups or outcomes, vouchers can have a substantial positive effect on those who use them. Studies of large-scale voucher programs find student sorting as a result of their implementation, although of varying magnitude. Evidence on both small-scale and large-scale programs suggests that competition induced by vouchers leads public schools to improve. Moreover, research is making progress on understanding how vouchers may be designed to limit adverse effects from sorting, while preserving positive effects related to competition. Finally, our sense is that work originating in a single case (e.g., a given country) or in a single research approach (e.g., experimental designs) will not provide a full understanding of voucher effects; fairly wide-ranging empirical and theoretical work will be necessary to make progress.

I build a model that rationalizes this fact. Banks act as delegated monitors and invest in risky projects and in risky sovereign bonds. As investors hear rumors of increased asset risk, they run the bank through an information coordination game. Banks could rollover liquidity in repo market using government bonds as collateral, but as sovereign risk raises collateral values shrink. Overall banks' liquidity falls (its cost increases) and so does banks' credit. The model features a balance sheet, a collateral channel and a liquidity channel of sovereign risk.

It first explains why it is necessary to use multiple models simultaneously to correctly assess house price sustainability. It goes on to describe individual models proposed to estimate house price misalignment in the Czech Republic. Results given by these individual models are consonant in identifying periods of over-and undervaluation of house prices but slightly differ in the amplitude of the gaps. A method for aggregating the estimates produced by those approaches is then presented. It works on the premise that more correlated estimates may be evidence of a strong signal, while less correlated estimates may, on the other hand, bring additional information to the house price assessment. By using two sets of weights, it presents an interval of supposed under-or overvaluation of house prices. This method indicates that Czech house prices were roughly at their equilibrium level in mid-2014 following an extended period of slight undervaluation since the mid-2009. It also proves robust to the length of the sample used.","[Hejlova, Hana; Hlavacek, Michal] Charles Univ Prague, Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic; [Hejlova, Hana; Hlavacek, Michal] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Komarek, Lubos] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic; [Komarek, Lubos] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Czech National Bank; Charles University Prague; Technical University of Ostrava; Czech National Bank; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Hejlová, H (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Czech Natl Bank, Prague, Czech Republic.;Hejlová, H (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",hejlova.hana@gmail.com; michal.hlavacek@cnb.cz; lubos.komarek@cnb.cz,"Hejlová, Hana/AAF-2140-2019; Komarek, Lubos/E-9748-2018; Hlaváček, Michal/E-9733-2018","Hlaváček, Michal/0000-0002-9495-2082; Hejlova, Hana/0000-0002-6134-323X",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [13-06229S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),The research behind this paper was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic under Project No. 13-06229S.,,21,4,4,1,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

However, few studies have yet investigated the factors which may promote or inhibit breastfeeding practices in Japan. To fill this research gap, this paper uses data newly gathered in 2012 on breastfeeding initiation and duration for each child of each mother, which enable us to estimate mother fixed-effects models that control for unobserved differences among mothers. Compared to mothers who leave their jobs after childbirth, mothers who return to work within a year after childbirth do not significantly differ in breastfeeding initiation but have a breastfeeding duration which is shorter by 1.654 months. On the other hand, when fathers work under a flextime system after childbirth, breastfeeding initiation is higher, and the duration is longer by 4.418 months. Therefore, letting fathers work under a flextime system would help promote breastfeeding practices in Japan.","[Kobayashi, Miki] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Usui, Emiko] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan",Kobe University; Hitotsubashi University,"Usui, E (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.",mkobayashi@people.kobe-u.ac.jp; usui@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,"Usui, Emiko/G-8936-2012","Usui, Emiko/0000-0001-7686-4655","Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [22000001]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23730233, 15H05692, 16H06322, 15H03343, 17H00991, 26285056, 22000001, 16H03609] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper is part of an academic project called Economic Analysis of Intergenerational Issues: Searching for Further Development, funded by a Grant-in-Aid for Specially Promoted Research from Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Grant Number 22000001).",,45,10,11,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Our results suggest that more market power reduces the fragility of banking institutions, on one hand, and that banking market concentration tends to make these banks riskier, on the other. Our findings are robust to whatever form of market power-risk relationship and whatever market-power measures we use. More precisely, financial markets perceive CEE banks with more market power as less fragile, while the latter are also better capitalised with respect to the distribution of their returns. Moreover, they are even (much) better capitalised when they hold less-diversified and less-liquid assets and when they operate within a stricter banking regulatory environment, which suggests a risk-stabilising role for diversification, liquidity and the bank regulatory environment in these countries.","[Lapteacru, Ion] Univ Bordeaux, Larefi, Dept Econ, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bordeaux,"Lapteacru, I (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, Larefi, Dept Econ, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",ion.lapteacru@u-bordeaux.fr,,,University of Bordeaux under Department of Social and Human Sciences [BQR 2016],University of Bordeaux under Department of Social and Human Sciences,"We wish to thank two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and helpful suggestions, which greatly contributed to improving this study.

Using data from a recent household survey, we find that urban families with a son are more likely to own a house, with a larger size, and at an earlier date. With the booming of the Chinese housing market since the late 1990s as background, having a son thus generates a substantial effect on family wealth through the channel of house ownership.

The effect of children on the female labor supply is usually negative for most married women; however, it might also be positive for some subpopulations. Thus, herein, we use a local likelihood logit regression to detect the heterogeneity in the effects of children on married female employment that cannot be detected by parametric (e.g. probit or logit models) or semi-parametric estimation. Our empirical findings provide evidence of some heterogeneity in the response related to children on the participation of Taiwanese married women in the work force. Since, we find evidence of heterogeneous effects, we suggest that different government policy instruments should be precisely targeted at different specific subpopulations in order to effectively increase the participation of married women in the labor force. When comparing these average characteristics of married women with positive versus negative employment effects due to having children, we find that the average married woman's educational attainment and the logarithm of the husband's wage income differ significantly between women with positive effects of children and those with negative effects of children.","[Tsai, Chun-Li] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Tsai, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",tchunLi@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We show that the trends in household income inequality are largely driven by changes in wage inequality. Given the detailed nature of our series we show that measurement issues and breaks in the series need to be dealt with in order to draw robust conclusions from the data. Most standard inequality measures show that wage inequality has increased over the period. Nevertheless the choice of measure matters, because there are different trends in different parts of the distribution. It appears that the distribution below the median has become more compressed, while the top of the wage distribution has moved away from the median. The inequality in the labour market translates into even higher inequality in society given that high earners tend to live together with other high earners while low wage individuals often end up sharing their incomes with the unemployed. Furthermore there are many South Africans with access to no wage income. Given the trends analysed here it is not surprising that overall inequality in South Africa has not come down or has even increased since the end of apartheid.","[Wittenberg, Martin] Univ Cape Town, SALDRU, DataFirst, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Wittenberg, Martin] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Wittenberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, SALDRU, DataFirst, Rondebosch, South Africa.;Wittenberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa.",martin.wittenberg@uct.ac.za,"Wittenberg, Martin/J-3146-2013","Wittenberg, Martin/0000-0002-1946-8186","Redi3x3 project on Employment/Unemployment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth; University of Cape Town","Redi3x3 project on Employment/Unemployment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth; University of Cape Town","Some of the original data work was done with the support of an infrastructure grant to Data-First from the Redi3x3 project on Employment/Unemployment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth.

This paper reports three important results. First, comparative advantage is shaped by factor endowments as well as fundamental determinants of corporate finance. In particular, a larger equity ratio of firms and tough governance standards relax financing constraints, lead to entry of firms at the lower bound of the productivity distribution and create an endogenous comparative advantage in sectors where entrepreneurial firms are clustered. Second, a small degree of protection in the constrained sector can raise a country's welfare by relaxing financing constraints if terms-of-trade effects are small. Third, a small degree of protection of the financially dependent industry in a financially underdeveloped country might even raise world welfare.","[Egger, Peter H.] ETH Zuerich, KOF, Zurich, Switzerland; [Keuschnigg, Christian] Univ St Gallen, FGN HSG, St Gallen, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of St Gallen,"Egger, PH (通讯作者)，ETH Zuerich, KOF, Zurich, Switzerland.",Egger@kof.ethz.ch,,"Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207; Keuschnigg, Christian/0000-0003-4924-7859",Swiss National Science Foundation [100012-113418],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"Keuschnigg appreciates financial support by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no. 100012-113418).

China is an unusual outlier from the pattern, whose official government statistics show abnormally low, and suspiciously stable, unemployment rates relative to its GDP. This paper reports estimates of China's unemployment rate for its local urban Hukou population using a more reliable, nationally representative dataset for that population than in prior work, and which spans a longer period of history than in the past literature. The unemployment rates we calculate differ dramatically from those supplied in official data and are much more consistent with what is known about key historical developments in China's labor market. The rate averaged 3.7% in 1988-1995, when the labor market was highly regulated and dominated by state-owned enterprises, but rose sharply during the period of mass layoff from 1995 to 2002, reaching an average of 9.5% in the subperiod from 2002 to 2009. The rates were even higher when demographic composition is held fixed. We can also calculate labor force participation rates, which are not available in official statistics at all. We find that they declined throughout the whole period, particularly in 1995-2002 when the unemployment rate increased most significantly. We also find that the impacts of these changes fell most heavily on the unskilled (women, those with less education, and younger individuals). Finally, estimates of unemployment and labor force participation rates are also provided for all urban residents, including migrants without local urban Hukou, and show the same patterns of change over time.

This paper explores how a principal can optimally address this issue when an agent has reputation concerns. It shows that the principal can motivate the agent to initiate a new change by damaging the agent's reputation when he just sits on the status quo. In doing so, compared to the benchmark case where inertia is not an issue, the principal extends monitoring that assesses the value of the new change, and reduces intervention in the agent's implementation of it. Thus the paper suggests that active monitoring and passive intervention can motivate the agent to initiate a new change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, most existing models are not able to generate substantial transmission through international trade. We show that the nature of such transmission depends fundamentally on the features determining the responsiveness of labor supply and labor demand to international relative prices. We augment a standard international macroeconomic model to incorporate three key features: a weak short-run wealth effect on labor supply, variable capital utilization, and imported intermediate inputs for production. This model can generate large and significant endogenous transmission of technology shocks through international trade. We demonstrate this by estimating the model using data for Canada and the United States with limited-information Bayesian methods. We find that this model can account for the substantial transmission of permanent U.S. technology shocks to Canadian aggregate variables such as output and hours, documented in a structural vector autoregression. Transmission through international trade is found to explain the majority of the business cycle comovement between the United States and Canada. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In order to represent these variable renewable energy (VRE) resources in specialized energy system models, high temporal and spatial resolution information on their availability is used. In contrast, integrated assessment models (IAM), typically characterized by long-term time scales and low temporal and spatial resolution, require aggregated information on VRE availability and balancing requirements at various levels of VRE penetration and mix. Parametric studies that provide such information typically regard solar energy synonymously with photovoltaic power generation. However, solar energy can also be harvested with concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, which can be dispatchable if equipped with thermal storage. Accounting for this dispatchable use of the variable solar resource can change the balancing requirements at any solar energy penetration level. In this paper, we present an application of the high-resolution energy system model REMix to a set of European supply scenarios with theoretical VRE shares ranging from 0% to 140%, three solar-to-wind ratios, with CSP included in the solar share. We evaluate balancing measures, curtailments and costs and compare the findings to previous results in which CSP is regarded a backup option among other dispatchable power plants. The results show that CSP potentials in Europe are widely exploited in most scenarios. System costs are found to be lowest for wind-dominated systems or balanced mixes of wind and solar and for an overall VRE share between 40% for a low and 80% for a high scenario of the future CO2 emission certificate price. The comparison with previous results shows that storage capacity is the only system variable that is significantly affected by allocating CSP to the VRE resources category. It is reduced by 24% on average across all VRE shares and proportions and by around 80% at most. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that housing loan regulations such as debt to income regulation contributed to a lower household debt delinquency ratio. Lowering the target interest rate provided additional stabilisation of the delinquency ratio. It is recommended that the government adopt an appropriate mix of regulation and monetary policy to control household financial fragility. The financial supervisory services need to be involved in managing debt to income regulation and minimising financial instability and financial market distortions. Further, the monetary authority has to adopt a more effective position in controlling the real lending interest rate and the delinquency ratio of household loans. Such a policy mix will improve effectiveness in controlling financial fragility, especially at a time of financial crisis.","[Shin, Dong Jin] Natl Assembly Budget Off, Econ Anal Div, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Brian H.

The RTS measurement is classified into two categories: input-based RTS and output-based RTS. The two measures depend upon the sign of an intercept (a) of a supporting hyperplane on a production possibility set. In the DEA framework, multiple solutions usually occur on the intercept. This study discusses how to handle such an occurrence of multiple intercepts within the framework of the input-based and output-based RTS classifications. As an application, this study applies the proposed approach to classify the type of RTS on large photovoltaic power stations, often referred to as mega solar parks, in the United States (US) and Germany. The input-based RTS measurement identifies that US photovoltaic power stations are classified into increasing (64 stations: 80.0%), constant (5 stations: 63%) and decreasing (11 stations: 13.8%), respectively. German photovoltaic power stations are classified into increasing (73 stations: 91.3%), constant (7 stations: 8.8%) and decreasing (0 station: 0.0%), respectively. The finding is confirmed by the output-based RTS measurement on the German photovoltaic power stations. However, the output based RTS on US photovoltaic power stations shows an opposite result. The US photovoltaic power stations are classified into increasing (26 stations: 32.5%), constant (6 stations: 7.5%) and decreasing (48 stations: 60.0%), respectively. The decreasing RTS is because the US photovoltaic power stations have less efficiently operated than those of Germany in such a manner that they cannot produce sufficient outputs from a given level of inputs in such a manner that they have failed to utilize a scale merit for their operations.

It then does a fast-forward to controversies and contributions in the recent past, and speculates on where the intellectual enterprise might be headed from here. The issues involved in the original motivations are definitely alive and well. Aside from the review of the basic issues behind the NW project, an important theme here is that an evolutionary approach to economics entails a degree of engagement with the realities of business organization and the quest for profit that has no parallel in mainstream economics. Thus it makes sense in retrospect that the evolutionary program has proved more influential in other research fields, including strategic management, technology studies and organization theory, than it is in economics proper. Recent controversies underscore the continuing existence of a challenging research agenda featuring the interactions among the dynamic processes at different levels-individuals, firms and market environments.","[Winter, Sidney G.] Univ Penn, Suite 2000,3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Winter, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Dept Management, Suite 2000,3620 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",winter@wharton.upenn.edu,"Winter, Sidney/GXG-2470-2022",,Mack Institute for Innovation Management; Wharton School,Mack Institute for Innovation Management; Wharton School,"University of Pennsylvania.

This paper proposes an allocation principle based on the efficiency levels. The efficiency levels are estimated by employing a stochastic frontier analysis approach and the links between energy intensity and efficiency are constructed. The results show that energy efficiency change is not the major contributor to energy intensity reduction. Furthermore, this analysis indicates that (i) the efficiency based allocation can distribute reduction burdens among regions smoothly compared to the intensity-based allocation; and (ii) the national target of emission intensity reduction can be achieved solely through efficiency measures.

We find that small firms (firms with employees between 20 and 100 employees) have higher mean job flow rates (job creation, job destruction and net job creation rates) than large firms. Firm size and job flow rates are inversely related, and this relationship is especially prominent for firms with 50 employees or more. Although the overall pattern observed is also observed in both sectors, job creation rates in services are higher than the ones in manufacturing. The magnitudes of job destruction rates are comparable across sectors. Higher job creation rate in services but comparable job destruction rate results in higher net job creation rate in services. As for shares, only for smaller firms (20-49 and 50-99 size categories), job creation shares are greater than their shares in employment. But these firms have disproportionate job destruction shares as well. We also find that only the 20-49 category firms contribute to net job creation more than their share in employment. The smaller firms have high disproportionate shares in job creation and destruction in manufacturing and services as well.","[Dogan, Ergun; Yazici, Mehmet] Cankaya Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Islam, M.

As the Dominican Republic recently adopted an inflation targeting regime, it is even more relevant to guarantee that changes in the monetary policy rates are quickly and fully reflected in retail rates, to eventually influence aggregate demand and inflation. This paper estimates the interest rate pass-through of the monetary policy rate to retail rates and explores asymmetries in the adjustment. We find evidence of complete pass-through to retail rates, confirming the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. However, our results also suggest a faster pass-through to lending rates than to deposit rates and asymmetric adjustments of short-term rates, as deposit rates respond faster to policy rate cuts and lending rates respond faster to policy rate hikes. Measures to enhance competition in the financial system could help to achieve a symmetric adjustment of retail rates.","[Grigoli, Francesco] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Mota, Jose M.] Superintendency Banks Dominican Republ, Santo Domingo, Dominican Rep",International Monetary Fund,"Grigoli, F (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",fgrigoli@imf.org; jmota@sb.gob.do,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

While studies in the area have tended to consider broad measures of inequality and support for redistribution in general, we focus on a single, salient relationship between local unemployment rates and demand for spending on unemployment benefits. Using a particularity of the Spanish labour market, we estimate how workers' stated preferences for unemployment benefits spending respond to changes in the local unemployment rate. We then decompose this response into the part explained by risk aversion, and thus demand for insurance, and the part explained by inequity aversion. Our results suggest that increases in local unemployment rates lead to increased demand by workers for unemployment benefits spending. Moreover, our results are consistent with an insurance motive driving this relationship but provide little support for inequity aversion. Our results suggest that studies of the relationship between inequality and demand for redistribution might benefit from considering both the source and measure of the inequality and the instrument of redistribution.","[Backus, Peter G.] Univ Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Backus, Peter G.; Esteller-More, Alejandro] IEB, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Esteller-More, Alejandro] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Manchester; University of Barcelona,"Backus, PG (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.;Backus, PG (通讯作者)，IEB, C John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",peter.backus@manchester.ac.uk,"Esteller, Manel/L-5956-2014","Esteller, Manel/0000-0003-4490-6093; Backus, Peter/0000-0002-6283-6773","MINECO/FEDER, UE [ECO2015-63591-R]; government of Catalonia [2014SGR420]; IEF","MINECO/FEDER, UE(Spanish Government); government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); IEF","The authors are grateful to Sasha O.

One of the root causes of this low rate is that China has the highest HS tuition fees globally. Although the Chinese government has implemented a series of programs to reduce the cost of attending vocational HS, the cost of attending academic HS in China emains high. This study evaluates the extent to which an academic HS tuition relief program initiated by a poor county in western China affects students' schooling decisions after graduation from junior high school. By using a longitudinal dataset of 2348 students in two counties, we use ordinary least squares and propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of this program on four student outcomes: matriculation into academic HS, matriculation into vocational HS, entering the labor market, and retaking high school entrance exams. The results show that the program significantly increased matriculation into academic HS by 21 percentage points, while it reduced matriculation into vocational HS by 7 percentage points, the likelihood of entering the labor market by 11.9 percentage points, and the likelihood of retaking exams by 2.1 percentage points. Further, we find that the effects of the program among middle-income students are stronger compared with those of other groups. And we found that the program had no significantly heterogeneous impact on students with different academic performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We decompose time series into wavelets of varying periodicity. Cycles at all periodicities in all three variables vis-a-vis wage share show a counter-clockwise ('Goodwin') pattern. The well-known regular cycles appear at business cycle frequency. Furthermore, a roughly 30-year cycle exists before 1980. Post-1980, no clear medium-run cyclical picture emerges. This finding is complemented by wavelet covariance analysis, which suggests that covariance of longer period cycles is negative before 1980, but positive thereafter. Crucially, trajectories of trends across the entire postwar period raise the possibility of one 'long' 60-year Goodwin cycle in all three variables vis-a-vis the wage share, which would suggest that sustained growth after c.2000 required much broader real wage increases relative to labor productivity. We conduct non-parametric Granger tests, which indicate that systematic interaction at all periodicities exist. We discuss our findings in relation to the debate on wage-led and profit-led demand regimes.","[Barrales, Jose; von Arnim, Rudiger] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Barrales, Jose] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Region Bio Bio, Chile",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion,"von Arnim, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",rudiger.vonarnim@economics.utah.edu,"Barrales-Ruiz, Jose/Q-2911-2017","Barrales-Ruiz, Jose/0000-0002-6604-2559",,,,,46,23,28,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

By no means can they be viewed as definitive or objective. In this paper we consider, from this very angle, the theory of social choice which is about the aggregation of individual preferences with the aim to derive a consistent social preference.

This ability, however, is reduced by switching costs. Methods: Using an identification for each student from fourth grade in 2000 to eighth grade in 2004, so we were able to verify if they changed schools. Thus, we can compare the expected utility associated with the chosen school with a new school that was not available in 2000 and the estimation of switching costs. Results: We find that on average switching costs are statistically significant and economically relevant and that affect the decision to change the chosen school. Also, we show marginal changes in their levels of utility aren't sufficiently significant to make decision to change at chosen school identifying an eventual threshold. Conclusions: The natural concern regarding parents' capacity to react is given by the existence of switching costs.","[Gallegos Mardones, Juan; Paredes, Ricardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile; [Gallegos Mardones, Juan] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Concepcion, Chile; [Chumacero, Romulo] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion; Universidad de Chile,"Mardones, JG (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Ingn, Santiago, Chile.;Mardones, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Concepcion, Chile.",jagalleg@uc.cl; rchumace@econ.uchile.cl; rparedes@ing.puc.cl,"Paredes, Ricardo D/M-1653-2013; Gallegos, Juan A/G-3376-2019","Gallegos, Juan A/0000-0003-0178-8381; CHUMACERO, ROMULO/0000-0001-7218-0440",,,,,65,1,1,1,12,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This pattern is consistent with large-scale outflow of financial capital, commonly referred to as capital flight Since 2005, capital flight has accelerated reaching $425 billion (plus or minus $60 billion) in 2014 alone. This study provides three estimates for capital flight from China for the period 1984 through 2014 using both Cuddington's balance of payments and more inclusive residual measures. These measures are adjusted to reflect the legitimate assets of the Chinese banking industry, mis-invoicing of China's trade with its major trading partners (especially Hong Kong), exchange rate changes, and the failure of official debt data to capture certain bank transactions. Based on these estimates, it is concluded that capital controls have little long-term effect on the volume of capital flight, Hong Kong is increasingly a pipeline for capital flight from the mainland, and that 'traditional' explanations do not apply to China's capital flight over the last decade. Finally, corruption, transaction costs, and facilitating migration are considered as possible explanations of the recent acceleration of Chinese capital flight. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We explore dimensions in which inequality may vary, notably urban versus rural, and by ethnic status. We also decompose inequality by income source to highlight key factors underlying the relatively low levels of inequality during this period. We find that agricultural opportunities played an important role in dampening inequality, but more important has been the steady development of wage-labor markets in both urban and rural areas. An important caveat to the generally rosy picture we paint is the deteriorating position of ethnic minorities.

While an efficient market for corporate control is vital for an economy's growth and development, insufficient legal standards may permit coercive takeovers that have negative implications for capital markets. This research focuses on tender offers in Japan, where legal rules provide acquirers with the opportunity to make coercive takeovers that expropriate minority shareholder wealth. Japan's legal system changed in 2006 to introduce cash mergers to freeze-out remaining shareholders after successful takeovers, and in 2007 to require bidders making tender offers that seek more than two-thirds of the voting securities of a target to offer to buy all the shares. However, acquirers with the stated aim of securing less than two-thirds of voting securities have no such obligation. We find evidence that these acquirers tend to make coercive two-tier offers that expropriate the interests of minority shareowners. Our results suggest that avoiding coercive takeovers requires that laws force acquirers to provide full information concerning the clean-up merger conditions as well as to pay an equivalent amount in the clean-up to minority shareowners as was offered in the initial tender offer without ambiguity. These conclusions have relevance for all countries that have not fully considered the appropriate level of protection for minority shareholders. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this article is to investigate the relevance of the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) hypothesis versus the efficiency hypothesis in explaining bank performance by analyzing 127 commercial banks from six Balkan countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Macedonia) over the period 2005-2009. In order to account for the dynamic nature of bank profits, it uses a GMM estimator in testing the determinants of bank profitability. The estimation results suggest that profits persist to some extent, indicating that the deviation from a perfectly competitive market structure is marginal. In addition, the findings suggest that efficiency is significantly and positively associated with profitability, whereas the industry concentration variable is insignificant in explaining profitability, indicating support in favor of the efficiency hypothesis. Moreover, among the bank-specific control variables, only size is reported insignificant, and the rest of the variables affect bank profitability in the anticipated manner. Finally, the results suggest that neither inflation nor economic growth has an impact on bank profitability.","[Bucevska, Vesna] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Goce Delchev 9V, Skopje 1000, Macedonia; [Misheva, Branka Hadzi] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ, Pavia, Italy",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Institute of Economics Skopje; University of Pavia,"Bucevska, V (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Econ, Goce Delchev 9V, Skopje 1000, Macedonia.",vesna.bucevska@eccf.ukim.edu.mk,,"Bucevska, Vesna/0000-0002-4411-4953",,,,,50,26,28,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

My findings suggest that trade liberalization led to significant reductions of these pollutants at affected plants.

Although studies on both authors are numerous, relatively little attention has been paid to finding the crucial elements at the heart of their radical disagreement. A.J. Cohen (2014) convincingly argues that Veblen's attack on Clark is in the center of the capital controversy of the 1960s and 1970s. We propose an extension of this argument, based on the idea that Veblen's attack on Clark follows three steps. First, Veblen defined capital in money terms and, at the same time, he saw it as the accumulated technological and institutional experience of a community. Second, insofar as capital cannot be reduced to a stock of physical goods, it is logically impossible to derive a function of the marginal labor productivity from the existing stock of capital. Third, insofar as the marginal productivity of labor cannot be measured, it follows that the equality between real wage and marginal labor productivity cannot logically hold. It also follows that, since it does not exist, this equality cannot be used as a basis for establishing that the equilibrium wage is a just wage.","[Davanzati, Guglielmo Forges] Univ Salento, Dept Hist Soc & Human Studies, Polit Econ, Lecce, Italy; [Pacella, Andrea] Univ Catania, Dept Law, Researcher Econ, Catania, Italy",University of Salento; University of Catania,"Davanzati, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Hist Soc & Human Studies, Polit Econ, Lecce, Italy.",,,,,,,,66,3,3,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Since then, a meaningful literature has examined businesses' environmental-management efforts during the transition. Over the same period as the transition, many firms in developed countries were integrating environmental components into their business strategies and finding this integration profitable. A growing body of research explores the topic of corporate environmental strategy. Given the rising importance of this topic in developed economies, its seems highly important to reassess the literature on businesses' environmental-protection efforts during the transition in order to explore corporate environmental strategies in transition economies where the business benefits may be less clear and domestic consumer pressure for better corporate environmental stewardship is limited. Given the lack of clarity, exploration of corporate environmental strategies in transition economies is important. Guided by a simple conceptual framework, this article reviews and assesses the full body of the empirical literature in order to explore the drivers behind corporate environmental strategies in transition economies. The discussion that follows considers a broad array of drivers: internal factors, market pressures, government, and civil society. The empirical evidence suggests a positive role for foreign ownership and foreign customer pressure, and a stronger role for governmental factors: capacity to monitor, greater enforcement, permit issuance, and higher emission charge rates. The review reveals that many key factors, such as investor pressure, domestic customer pressure, and corporate culture, are weakly explored, if not fully ignored, by empirical studies.","[Earnhart, Dietrich] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, CERGE EI, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Earnhart, D (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, 435 Snow Hall, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",Earnhart@ku.edu,,,,,,,66,1,2,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Using individual census returns from the 1911 Irish census, we examine whether children who attended school were from smaller families-as predicted by a standard QQ model. To measure causal effects, we use a selection of models robust to endogeneity concerns which we validate for this application using an Empirical Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that a child remaining in school between the ages of 14 and 16 caused up to a 27 % reduction in fertility. Our results are robust to alternative estimation techniques with different modeling assumptions, sample selection, and alternative definitions of fertility. These findings highlight the importance of the demographic transition as a mechanism which underpinned the expansion in human capital witnessed in Western economies during the twentieth century.","[Fernihough, Alan] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Fernihough, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast BT9 5EE, Antrim, North Ireland.",a.fernihough@qub.ac.uk,,"Fernihough, Alan/0000-0003-0911-308X",Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences; Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IE),"Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences (IE)(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)","I acknowledge financial support from the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences.

Incremental innovation is often of limited relevance to the new technology invented by successful discrete innovation. Previous theoretical studies have indicated that higher competitive pressure measured by product substitutability increases incremental innovation. In contrast, we find that intensified competition can decrease incremental innovation. A firm's market share upon its failure in discrete innovation decreases as competition intensifies. This effect decreases firms' incentives for incremental innovation because the innovation outcome can be applied to a smaller amount of units. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The differences across conditioning variables within the same method do not exceed 3pp, but including more variables almost universally results in larger estimates of the adjusted wage gaps. Methods that account for common support and selection into employment yielded higher estimates of the adjusted wage gap.

To get this right, we need to measure accurately both the value of nominal GDP (done by Bureau of Economic Analaysis) and key price indexes (done mostly by Bureau of Labor Statisticcs). All of us have worked on these measurements while at the BLS and the BEA. In this article, we explore some of the thorny statistical and conceptual issues related to measuring a dynamic economy. An often-stated concern is that the national economic accounts miss some of the value of some goods and services arising from the growing digital economy. We agree that measurement problems related to quality changes and new goods have likely caused growth of real output and productivity to be understated. Nevertheless, these measurement issues are far from new, and, based on the magnitude and timing of recent changes, we conclude that it is unlikely that they can account for the pattern of slower growth in recent years. First we discuss how the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently adjusts price indexes to reduce the bias from quality changes and the introduction of new goods, along with some alternative methods that have been proposed. We then present estimates of the extent of remaining bias in real GDP growth that stem from potential biases in growth of consumption and investment. And we take a look at potential biases that could result from challenges in measuring nominal GDP, including those involving the digital economy.

Hierarchy compliance, a core prediction of supply-focused models, is tested by measuring the frequency with which cities import a narrowly defined good from the country observed to be the preferred source in the province. Hierarchy violation is widespread: 92% of province goods have at least one non-compliant city. We show that introducing granular importers into a standard heterogeneous firm model leads to a prediction of 73% compliance, close to the observed average of 66%. Extending the model to allow buyers from a city to share an orientation towards specific source countries, we calibrate a heterogeneity parameter to match the average observed compliance rate. The results imply that the supply side explains on average 44% of the variance in city-level sourcing probabilities, leaving the majority of variation due to heterogeneity in buyers across cities.

Persistently low nominal interest rates may lead to more frequent and costly episodes at the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates. We revisit the frequency and potential costs of such episodes in a world of low interest rates, using both a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model and the Federal Reserve's large-scale econometric model, the FRB/US model. Four main conclusions emerge. First, monetary policy strategies based on traditional, simple policy rules lead to poor economic performance when the equilibrium interest rate is low, with economic activity and inflation more volatile and systematically falling short of desirable levels. Moreover, the frequency and length of ELB episodes under such policy approaches are estimated to be significantly higher than in previous studies. Second, a risk adjustment to a simple rule-whereby monetary policymakers are more accommodative, on average, than prescribed by the rule-ensures that inflation averages its 2 percent objective, and requires that policymakers systematically seek inflation near 3 percent when the ELB is not binding. Third, commitment strategies, whereby monetary accommodation is not removed until either inflation or economic activity overshoots its long-run objective, are very effective in both the DSGE and FRB/US models. And fourth, our simulation results suggest that the adverse effects on economic and price stability associated with the ELB may be substantial at inflation targets near 2 percent if the equilibrium real interest rate is low and monetary policy follows a traditional approach. Whether such adverse effects could justify a higher inflation target depends upon the degree to which monetary policy strategies that differ substantially from such traditional approaches are feasible, and an assessment of a broader array of the inflation target's effects on economic welfare.","[Kiley, Michael T.; Roberts, John M.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Kiley, MT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA.",,"Kiley, Michael T/H-1132-2012","Kiley, Michael/0000-0003-0427-0131",,,,,87,72,81,0,13,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Following this severe event, the economic and finance literature has been flooded with numerous quantitative measures of systemic risk. However, researchers have largely ignored the systemic risk potential of regions such as Asia, instead focusing on financial systems in the U.S. and Europe. This paper empirically examines systemic risk potential for banking institutions in Asia, drawing on recent systemic risk analytics. This paper employs two methods, using the Conditional Value-at-Risk method to measure the systemic contribution of institutions and the Granger-causality network approach to determine their degree of interconnectedness. The analysis reveals that the degree of interconnectedness has generally increased among banks in Asia. Nevertheless, the causal network among the banks has become less dense since the GFC (2007-2009). Thus, banks in developed Asian economies generally have higher potential for systemic risk than those in other emerging markets. Finally, we find a positive relationship between bank size and contribution to systemic risk. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a general game with two players. Players choose an action that influences the evolution of a state variable, and decide on the switching time from one regime to another. Compared to the optimal control problem with regime switching, necessary optimality conditions are modified for the first player to switch. When choosing her optimal switching strategy, this player considers the impact of her choice on the other player's actions and consequently on her own payoffs. In order to determine the equilibrium timing of regime changes, we derive conditions that help eliminate candidate equilibrium strategies that do not survive deviations in switching strategies.

The government is thus fulfilling its objective set out in February 2014 and stipulated in the Government Statement of Purpose, i. e. to approximate the minimum wage to 40 % of average wages. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article is to assess the adequacy of the Government Minimum Wage Valorization Policy, in particular from two points of view. Firstly, in view of selected macro-economic indicators in the Czech Republic - the development of consumer prices, average gross wages, economic growth and workforce productivity. Secondly, in comparison with other EU member states which have introduced the institution of a minimum wage. Methods: In order to assess the adequacy of government policy to improve the social protection of the rights of the working population, a background research was conducted into the literature of important studies on the effects of minimum wages on unemployment, while the development of average gross wages in the CR, the minimum monthly wages in the CR and the Kaitz index were also analyzed. Furthermore, an evaluation of selected macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic was performed by means of time lines and the percentage representation of employees in the individual gross wage bands according to sexand type of economic activity. Last, but not least, a comparison was made of minimum wages, real gross domestic product per capita and workforce productivity in Euros and in purchasing power standards between the Czech Republic and countries which have enacted the institution of minimum wages. Findings & Value added: The minimum wage in the Czech Republic is the fifth lowest in the EU. In the long term, it is earned by approximately 3% of employees, which is less than the rate common in other EU countries. Currently, the amount of the minimum wage is below the threshold of income poverty. In comparison with the GDP per capita in PPS and real labour productivity per person employed in other EU countries, the position of the Czech Republic is significantly better, although other EU countries offer higher minimum wages. The decision of the current government to significantly increase the minimum wage as of 2017 is correct.","[Pernica, Martin] Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Pernica, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",,,,Technical University of Brno [FP-S-17-4634],Technical University of Brno,"The paper represents an output of the specific research project Entrepreneurship in the area of industry 4.0 of the Internal Grant Agency of the Technical University of Brno, registration number FP-S-17-4634.",,21,6,6,2,10,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We also test this hypothesis for five different hedging horizons: 1-day, 1-week, 4-week, 8-week and 12-week. Our empirical results show that the pure martingale hypothesis holds for all three commodities and all five horizons. This implies that the expected return on futures contract can be ignored in determining the optimal hedge ratio. We also test to see if the joint normality between futures and spot returns holds for the same three commodities and five hedging horizons. We reject the joint normality hypothesis for all three commodities and five hedging horizons. This implies that hedgers with different utility function have different optimal hedge ratios. Thus, in general, one needs to take into account of hedger's utility function when deriving optimal hedge ratio.

Given that corporate liquidity (cash holdings) is a good channel for examining the quality of corporate governance, the effects of democracy and rule of law on corporate governance can be identified using the liquidity approach. A review of 67 countries from 1996 to 2010 demonstrates that democracy and rule of law indeed have bearings on corporate governance. More specifically, results indicate that firms are more inclined to hoard cash to take advantage of growth opportunities when the level of democracy is higher or rule of law is stronger, suggesting that agency costs are lower and interests of managers and shareholders are more aligned under such circumstances. In addition, the negative effect of debt issuance and dividend payment on cash is more pronounced when the level of democracy is higher or rule of law is stronger, suggesting that these two approaches become more effective in reducing agency costs and transitively cash holdings under such circumstances. Moreover, the positive effect of democracy and rule of law on corporate governance appears to be reinforced when rule of law is stronger and the level of democracy is higher, respectively. Furthermore, higher level of economic development helps reap the benefit of democracy and rule of law in terms of improving corporate governance and reducing agency costs.","[Chen, Naiwei] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Inst Financial Res, 99 Ziyang Ave, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Tsai-Chen] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Finance, 168,Sec 1,Univ Rd, Min Hsiung Township 621, Chia Yi County, Taiwan",Jiangxi Normal University; National Chung Cheng University,"Chen, NW (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Inst Financial Res, 99 Ziyang Ave, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",nwctw@yahoo.com.tw,,,"National Science Council, Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-194-025-]; Jiangxi Normal University, China","National Science Council, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Jiangxi Normal University, China","This work was funded by National Science Council (NSC 100-2410-H-194-025-), Taiwan and Jiangxi Normal University, China",,51,14,14,2,19,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

That is, the presence of specific investment can make a supplier vulnerable to large negative shocks to its customer's business. We demonstrate that this vulnerability causes the supplier to under-invest and a larger volatility in the customer's business exacerbates the supplier's under-investment. More surprisingly, a higher degree of specificity may induce the supplier to invest more, rather than less, in the specific asset. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that: (1) the time varying parameter VAR with stochastic volatility provides a better fit as compared to it's constant counterparts; (2) the impacts of intertemporal global oil price shocks on China's output are often small and temporary in nature; (3) oil supply and specific oil demand shocks generally produce negative movements in China's GDP growth whilst oil demand shocks tend to have positive effects; (4) domestic output shocks have no significant impact on price or quantity movements within the global oil market. The results are generally robust to three commonly employed indicators of global economic activity: Kilian's global real economic activity index, the metal price index and the global industrial production index, and two alternative oil price metrics: the US refiners' acquisition cost for imported crude oil and the West Texas Intermediate price of crude oil.

On average, the supply shock leads to a moderate decline in local native wages and a sharp decline in local native employment. These average effects mask considerable heterogeneity across groups: while younger natives experience larger wage effects, employment responses are particularly pronounced for older natives. This pattern is inconsistent with standardmodels of immigration but can be accounted for by a model that allows for a larger labor supply elasticity or a higher degree of wage rigidity for older than for young workers. We further show that the employment response is almost entirely driven by diminished inflows of natives into work rather than outflows into other areas or nonemployment, suggesting that outsiders shield insiders from the increased competition.","[Dustmann, Christian] UCL, London, England; Ctr Res & Anal Migrat, London, England; Univ Carlos III Madrid, Getafe, Spain",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Dustmann, C (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",,"STUHLER, JAN/L-2770-2014","STUHLER, JAN/0000-0003-0762-5591","ERC [323992-DMEA]; DFG [DU1024/1-1]; German National Academic Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MDM2014-0431, ECO2014-55858-P]; Comunidad de Madrid [MadEco-CM S2015/HUM-3444]",ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German National Academic Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid(Comunidad de Madrid),"Christian Dustmann acknowledges funding through the ERC Advanced Grant 323992-DMEA and by the DFG (DU1024/1-1).

For small, open economies (SOEs) that have lifted restrictions on capital movements, global financial integration seems to have undermined the scope for independent monetary policy, even if these countries had adopted a flexible exchange rate regime. Monetary policy transmission was weakened through the interest rate channel, as long-term rates in SOEs became increasingly correlated with long rates in large, advanced countries. The exchange rate channel was unstable, however, with exchange rates diverging from fundamentals as uncovered interest rate parity failed to hold over relevant periods and capital flows were volatile. These tendencies can contribute to monetary and financial instability when they interact badly with other economic and financial risks that can face small, open, and financially integrated economies. This was the case in Iceland. A fundamental rethinking of policy frameworks and tools has been underwayin SOEs in the wake of the crisis. Potential policy instruments include foreign exchange intervention, enhanced prudential rules on foreign exchange risks, macroprudential tools, better alignment of fiscal and monetary policy, and even selective capital flow management tools.","[Gudmundsson, Mar] Cent Bank Iceland, Kalkofnsvegur 1, Reykjavik 150, Iceland",,"Gudmundsson, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Iceland, Kalkofnsvegur 1, Reykjavik 150, Iceland.",mar.gudmundsson@sedlabanki.is,,,,,,,32,2,2,1,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Despite an unbalanced gender division of paid and unpaid work in this country, women are shown to have a greater predisposition towards engaging in the arts. Altogether, Italian couples spend half of their arts time together. After we apply a Heckman's selection model, results show the overall positive effects of age, education, individual and couple's well-being and weekend participation, and the negative effects of children and residence in southern regions. Yet we demonstrate that the likelihood to participate in the arts and the amount of time allocated to them are determined by different factors.

The bound implies that the equity premium is extremely volatile and that it rose above 20% at the height of the crisis in 2008. The time-series average of the lower bound is about 5%, suggesting that the bound may be approximately tight. I run predictive regressions and find that this hypothesis is not rejected by the data, so I use the SVIX index as a proxy for the equity premium and argue that the high equity premia available at times of stress largely reflect high expected returns over the very short run.

The incentivized subjects received a rebate of approximately 10% of the average membership fee conditional on attending the gym at least once per week in 11 of the 13 weeks of the first quarter of 2010. In the second quarter of 2010 the incentive was repeated, allowing subjects a second chance to earn a rebate. In both quarters they received a rebate of 25 instead of 15 conditional on attending the gym at least twice a week in 11 of the 13 weeks. Gym attendance was recorded both during the intervention period, and during the two quarters after. We compared the conditional incentive to attend the gym with an unconditional incentive where subjects would receive the 10% rebate per quarter merely for staying a member of the gym. The conditional incentive to attend the gym had a positive, yet non-persistent, impact on gym attendance. We conclude that gym attendance can be improved through incentives, but that smarter (non-)financial incentives and nudges need to be explored as well to obtain more persistent improvements in gym attendance.

We identify three main strands of literature: (1) that which deems interventions futile; (2) that which requires some market friction (i.e. limited arbitrage) in order for interventions to be effective; and (3) that which advocates the use of interventions as long as they convey signals on the stance of future monetary policy. We contribute to the literature in three important ways. First, by reviewing new theoretical models that have surfaced within the last decade. Second, by further penetrating into the theory of interventions in order to analyze the key features that make each model distinct. And third, by only focusing on sterilized operations, which allows us to sidestep the effects induced by changes in the stock of money supply. In addition, the models that we present comprise both a macro and microstructure approach so as to provide a comprehensive view of the theory behind exchange rate intervention.","[Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio] Cent Bank Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; [Perez-Reyna, David] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Villamizar-Villegas, M (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Colombia, Bogota, Colombia.",mvillavi@banrep.gov.co,"/ABD-9111-2020; Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio/C-6613-2017","/0000-0001-6151-6631; Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio/0000-0001-8866-9638",,,,,89,12,13,3,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Empirically, we estimate a multivariate logistic regression with the aim of identifying cross-country determinants of grade retention using data about 16 European countries participating in PIRLS 2011 using data about entry age at school and grade enrollment to identify retained students. Our results highlight that socioeconomic background is not the only factor that plays a role. Early-acquired skills do reduce the probability for a child to become a repeater; thus, the policy-makers should devote their effort in helping families to undertake preschool activities that develop skills also before starting formal schooling. Later assistance with homework is helpful as well, but with a lower magnitude and effect, which is offset if early skills are properly accounted for. (C) 2016 The Society for Policy Modeling.

However, the behavior of intraday price movements in the Central and Eastern European stock markets is insufficiently understood. We obtain a large sample of intraday prices in a typical Central and Eastern European stock market and we thoroughly investigate it for dependencies and economic profit opportunities. We determine that intraday price movements present important deviations from a random walk. Despite this, we find that investors are generally unable to use the dependencies imbedded in the price movements to gain economic profits when using trading strategies derived from three popular technical analysis indicators. Overall, we cannot reject the Efficient Market Hypothesis for intraday price movements in Romania. This implies that, because of the existing market frictions, trading on high frequency data is not feasible in the stock market of Romania, at least when using popular technical analysis indicators.","[Anghel, Dan Gabriel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Money & Banking, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Anghel, DG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Money & Banking, Bucharest, Romania.",dan.anghel@fin.ase.ro,"Anghel, Dan Gabriel/F-2720-2014","Anghel, Dan Gabriel/0000-0002-4127-8389",,,,,32,5,5,0,3,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We perform a multivariate variance decomposition analysis of monthly data on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price and the S&P 500. The dataset used in the study spans a long period of 150 years and therefore contains a rich history to examine both the short- and long-run comovement properties of oil and stock prices. Given that the oil and stock markets might comove both in the short-and long-run, it is of interest to see the relative impacts of transitory and permanent shocks on both variables. We find that (log) oil price and (log) S&P 500 share a common stochastic trend for our full sample of September 1859 to July 2015, but a common cycle only exists during the post-WW II period. Full and post-WW II samples have quite different common feature estimates in terms of the impact of permanent and transitory shocks as measured by the impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions. We also find that in the short-run oil is driven mostly by cycles (transitory shocks) and stock market is mostly driven by permanent shocks. But, permanent shocks dominate in the long-run.

For this purpose, a microeconometric model of PBRs renewals is developed and estimated. This model extends previous models of patents renewals by allowing the use of PBRs-specific variables. It is argued that simple tests on the coefficients associated with key PBRs-specific variables can provide insights into the impact of the two exemption rules. Implementation to PBRs in France over the period 1973-2011 for six major crops suggests that neither the farmers' exemption nor the research exemption have a clear-cut effect on the private value of PBRs.

It also investigates the relation between two major oil-importing (the EU and the UK) and oil-exporting (Norway and Russia) European countries and the two oil indices. We use daily data from 3 January 2000 to 18 January 2016. The DCC-GARCH model was employed to account for the time-varying in this study, which yielded several important findings. We found that the Baltics have a positive albeit lower level of time-varying co-movement with the international oil markets. In addition, the results revealed that the impacts of oil shocks in the Baltics are also lower than in the other four European markets. However, this finding is contrary to the existing literature, which argues that the Baltics are integrated. Considering the time-varying and volatility transmission with the oil-importing and oil-exporting countries, we found that there exists high-level time-varying co-movement. We also found that the volatility transmission and the magnitude of shocks from the oil markets are higher in oil-exporting countries. This result has important implications, especially for international investors and oil companies seeking to benefit from risk diversification and hedging techniques.","[Bein, Murad A.] Cyprus Int Univ, Via Mersin 10, Lefkosa, North Cyprus, Turkey",Cyprus International University,"Bein, MA (通讯作者)，Cyprus Int Univ, Via Mersin 10, Lefkosa, North Cyprus, Turkey.",mbein@ciu.edu.tr,"Bein, Murad Abdurahman/KBB-6401-2024","Bein, Murad Abdurahman/0000-0002-3248-4316",,,,,69,6,6,0,4,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Clusters with the similar wage levels were created using the method of cluster analysis. Methods of the nearest neighbour and Euclidean distance metric were used within the cluster analysis. Capital Prague Region has definitely the highest level of wages, on the other hand Karlovy Vary Region is the lowest within the whole Czech Republic. One region with the highest and one region with the lowest wage levels were chosen. For these two regions, the model wage distribution was constructed to enable a comparison of wage development during the past seven years. Three-parametric lognormal curves present the basis of the theoretical wage distribution. Maximum likelihood method was used to estimate the parameters of these lognormal curves. Akaike and Bayesian information criterions were used to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained models of wage distribution. Probability models represent simple approximations of frequently complicated empirical distributions. Knowledge of probability models and knowledge of the developmental trends of their parameters form the basis for the construction of estimations of consumption in the future and for predictions of the impact of various social and economic arrangements.","[Bilkova, Diana] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Winston Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bílková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Winston Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",diana.bilkova@vse.cz,"Bilkova, Diana/G-3694-2017",,"Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic [IP400040]","Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic","This paper was subsidized by the funds of institutional support of a long-term conceptual advancement of science and research number IP400040 at the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic.",,19,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,11,18,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500001,0

The approach is motivated by numerous data sources indicating that the median US stockholder has a portfolio composed of only three or four individual stocks, rather than a well-diversified portfolio as suggested by portfolio theory. Therefore, representing an individual stockholder portfolio by a proxy financial index (the common approach taken in the literature) may be too rough an approximation of investor behaviour and lead to biased results about risk aversion and intertemporal substitution. Eschewing the financial index methodology, our results support the standard representative agent assumption that there is a high degree of homogeneity in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution across stockholders with different wealth levels. Our findings have implications for models that assess the comovement between consumption and return on stocks.","[Bonaparte, Yosef] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Fabozzi, Frank J.] EDHEC Business Sch, Nice, France",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Bonaparte, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Sch Business, 1475 Lawrence St, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",yosef.bonaparte@ucdenver.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,4,2,2,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In this paper, we propose direct empirical evidence of the effects of aggregate uncertainty in multicandidate elections. Adopting a theory-based experimental approach, we explore whether aggregate uncertainty indeed favors the emergence of non-Duverger's law equilibria in plurality elections.

Our results indicate that increases in domestic energy prices and expenditures during the last decade have not been offset by purchasing power gains or energy efficiency improvements, resulting in sustained and growing levels of energy poverty. Capital city regions have fared better than rural areas even if traditional macroeconomic performance indicators do not easily match domestic energy deprivation metrics.

Contest designers often use tools to make a contest among asymmetric contestants more even, in order to either elicit higher effort levels, or for ethical reasons. Handicapping - in which stronger participants are a priori weakened - is one successful tool that is widely used in sports, promotional tournaments and procurement auctions. In this study we show theoretically that participants may also increase their destructive effort, and sabotage their rivals' performance, when handicapping is employed. We empirically verify this prediction using data on 19,635 U.K. horse-races in 2011 and 2012. Our results suggest that while a level field may be conducive to heightened positive effort in general, in a setting where both handicapping and sabotage are present it also lays the ground for greater destruction.

Design/methodology/approach - It uses South Korea as an illustrative example of pursuing sustained economic growth via economic globalisation and moving up the value chains. It provides answers to two questions. First, how did South Korea manage to achieve economic growth via moving up the value chains? Second, what are the governmental efforts on globalisation and trade liberalisation that have contributed to this success? Findings - Among other factors, its success can be seen as a result of a combination of domestic development strategy and policies and its efforts to create a development-friendly global and regional circumstance via strengthening the economic ties with main powers, expanding the free trade agreements network, and deepening integration into Factory Asia. It is of South Korea's interest to push forward the progress of regional integration. Originality/value - Many countries have successfully got rid of poverty by participating international production sharing, but only few of them have managed to move further and eventually upgrade to be an advance economy.

This increases the interest in models that link local production and consumption data to global production, trade and environmental data. The recent increase in availability of global environmentally extended multi-regional input-output tables (EE-MRIO tables) provides an opportunity to link them with existing local environmentally extended input-output tables (EE-RIO tables). These combined tables make it possible (1) to analyse the links between local and global production and consumption and (2) to study global value chains, material use and environmental impacts simultaneously. However, estimations using input-output (I-O) analyses contain errors due to imperfect databases. In this article the magnitude of specification, aggregation and time errors are estimated and compared. The results show the need to combine local datasets with multi-regional ones and show that highest detailed (country and sector levels) as well as time series of I-O tables are the way forward for using I-O analyses in local policy-making.

Not surprisingly, FR employees are substantially more financially literate than the population at large. Most importantly, financially savvy employees are also most likely to participate in their DC plan. Sophisticated workers contribute three percentage points more of their earnings to the DC plan than do the less knowledgeable, and they hold more equity in their pension accounts. We examine changes in employee plan behavior 1 year after employees completed a Learning Module about retirement planning, and we compare it to baseline patterns. We find that those employees who completed the Learning Module were more likely to start contributing and less likely to have stopped contributing to the DC plan postsurvey.

By adopting an evolutionary approach, we describe the paradigm shifts experienced in the macroeconomic research field and emphasize that the types of data the macroeconomist has to deal with play an important role in the evolutionary process of the development of the discipline. After introducing the current debate over Big Data in social sciences, the paper presents a detailed discussion of possible and existing interactions between Big Data and Computational Behavioral Macroeconomics.

We highlight a fundamental tradeoff between monitoring the agent's effort choice and auditing it ex-post. Monitoring proves more effective in tackling corruption, since the supervisor sends the report before the profit realization. By taking advantage of the supervisor's uncertainty about the state of nature, the principal can design a compensation scheme which prevents all forms of corruption at a lower cost. Conversely, auditing allows the principal to save the cost of supervision when the profit realization already suffices to set the compensation due to the agent. We show that the choice between monitoring and auditing crucially depends on the supervisor's ability to falsify information and the cost of hiring a supervisor. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This has largely revolved around the differences between elected mayors and appointed city managers. Much of the academic work has considered the potential efficiency gains that may be associated with either form of government and comparative analyses between the two. However, the empirical literature has been divided regarding the relative efficiency of either form. This article attempts to add to that literature by considering how bond markets may perceive potential efficiencies that emerge from one executive type over the other by evaluating bond ratings for a sample of large municipal governments in the United States. Overall, the results suggest that municipalities headed by a city manager are associated with increased bond ratings (and thus lower borrowing costs), which may lend support that this form of administration is, on some margin, relatively more efficient than others. These results are robust to a number of specifications.","[Dove, John] Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA",Troy University System; Troy University,"Dove, J (通讯作者)，Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA.",jadove@troy.edu,,,,,,,42,4,6,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Regression analysis reveals that foreign firms are larger, have lower capital-to-labour ratios, are more likely to export and are more likely to locate in Sofia. However, foreign firms have had limited success in Bulgaria. They do not exhibit higher sales growth and, in manufacturing, carried out lower capital investment in machinery than domestic firms. The numbers of visits from tax officials is the same for domestic and foreign firms in manufacturing, and lower for foreign firms in the service sector. However, firms with higher exports-to-sales ratios and higher absolute sales were subjected to a higher number of visits from tax officials.

The recommendations are, however, often based on research that is complicated or almost impossible to perform or relies on self-report surveys by the public officials and policy makers. The real behavior of those actors might, therefore, be hidden. Therefore, there opens an opportunity to model these situations and bring transparency and lobbying into the laboratory or field controlled environment and investigate the behavior of involved actors using methods of experimental economics. As the experimental economics is a field of economic research that has been emerging in the main flow for las few decades, the research on transparency and lobbying is, therefore, emerging as well. There have been published studies that focused on transparency and studies that investigated lobbying, however, the number of publications on experimental research on transparent lobbying is limited.

However, the nonlinear FADF test could not reject the null hypothesis for Lithuania. This means that unemployment in Lithuania could be described as a stationary process. As such, it has the tendency to revert to a sustainable level. By contrast, unemployment in Estonia and Latvia would be best characterised as a non-stationary process where the unemployment rate lacks the mean reverting behaviour.","[Furuoka, Fumitaka] Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Furuoka, F (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Asia Europe Inst, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",fumitakamy@gmail.com,"Furuoka, Fumitaka/C-4197-2012","Furuoka, Fumitaka/0000-0003-1863-387X",,,,,47,0,0,1,4,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The paper argues that the withdrawal of the state was detrimental to local governance in the first 20 or so years of post-Mao rural China. With the abolition of agricultural tax and various levies, and the introduction of rural subsidies, rural healthcare and medical care insurances and some investment in rural infrastructure since the beginning of the twenty-first century the return of the state has improved local governance. The paper also argues that the restoration, and in many ways the reinventing, of Chinese tradition of lineage identity makes village elections difficult to be accountable.","[Gao, Mobo C.

However, after the European crisis, the changes of the correlations are diverse. The risk hedge effectiveness of stock markets in BR/CS countries against foreign currencies decreases.

The banking sector plays a central role in intermediating the flow of funds to the real economy in the European countries, especially since the introduction of the single currency framework, which has notably increased not only the European financial integration but also the potential cross-border spillover effects and risk-sharing among euro area countries. The main objectives of this paper are threefold: (i) to assess the risks stemming from lending activities (credit risks); (ii) to present in a network framework the countries' vulnerabilities and cross-border exposures; and (iii) to shed light on further potential financial stability risks.

Sweden, in particular, has seen indebtedness rise from 90% of disposable income in 1995 to 179% in 2015. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) has identified mortgage amortization requirements as a potential instrument for reducing indebtedness; and has drafted guidelines that will intensify the rate and duration of amortization. In this paper, I characterize Swedish-style mortgage contracts, which differ substantially from U.S.-style contracts. I then evaluate the policy changes in an incomplete markets model with three types of debt and a novel mortgage contract specification that is calibrated to match Swedish micro and macro data. I find that intensifying the rate and duration of amortization is largely ineffective at reducing indebtedness in a realistically-calibrated model. In the absence of tight restrictions on the maximum debt-service-to-income ratio or implausibly large refinancing costs, the policy impact is small in aggregate, over the lifecycle, and across employment statuses.","[Hull, Isaiah] Sveriges Riksbank, Div Res, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank,"Hull, I (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Div Res, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",isaiah.hull@riksbank.se,,,,,,,33,3,4,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

Narrativity broadly refers to the way humans construct and use stories, notably to define their personal identity. We borrow from debates outside of economics to provide the critical dimension of our survey. Most contributions on the narrativity of economic agents do not discuss one another. To establish communication, we suggest a structure of oppositions that characterize these contributions taken as a whole. These oppositions are notably characterized by three tensions: in terms of methodological attitudes ('scientism' vs. 'humanism'), of underlying theories of personal identity postulating the existence of a unique sense of self or not ('diachronicity' vs. 'episodicity') and of the normative implications of narrativity ('welfare-increasing' vs. 'welfare-decreasing'). The main goal is to clarify the structure of opposite positions within a more or less explicit debate about the identity of individuals in economics.","[Juille, Tom; Jullien, Dorian] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Juille, T (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France.",tom.juille@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,113,7,7,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

This study aims to explore the dependence structure between crude oil prices and stock market indices, as well as the exchange rates in a number of economies categorized with respect to their status as developing/emerging markets, and oil importer/exporter countries. Dependence structures in this study are evaluated in considerable depth using copula models. The broad time period covered allows the investigation of the effect of global financial crisis on the mentioned dependence structure. An additional feature of this study is the inclusion of 1 to 30-day analysis to capture the variation of dependence on duration change. To serve these aims, as well as ARIMA and GARCH models, various copula measures are used to illustrate the level of the association. Additionally, a special focus on the Turkish case is given to illustrate its sensitivity to oil prices. We find that exchange rates and stock indices of most oil exporter countries show higher oil price dependency, whereas, emerging oil importer markets are less vulnerable to price fluctuations. Considerable impacts were found for the global crisis and the continuing recent sharp decrease in oil prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the paper is a construction of a composite indicator Index corporate sustainability (Ics). A tool for measuring and assessing corporate sustainability is an appropriately designed model called the Sustainable Environmental, Social, Governance and Economic Model (SEESG Model). The composite indicator Ics integrates 5 financial (economic) and 14 non-financial, environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) performance indicators Iji, which are determined in a stepwise fashion from a basic set of performance indicators using the principal component analysis (PCA) modelling. The composite indicator Ics is one of the possible ways to create a tool for measuring and assessing corporate sustainability that allows for the assessment of companies by a set of financial and non financial indicators in various areas of their performance, thus enabling a detailed analysis and determination of the impact of various performance areas and factors in complex corporate performance. An important characteristic of the composite indicator is the possibility to easily make comparisons and rankings of companies in a particular sector, and estimate whether they are heading towards sustainability. The use of benchmarking for company-to-company comparisons makes it possible to interpret summary information and to quantify differences in the performance of individual companies using graphic visualization. For this reason, Ics can be offered as a consistent and flexible benchmarking for owners, managers and investors. Using this indicator, they can incorporate sustainability into their decision-making processes, and achieve economic growth and ensure protection of the environment and social values.","[Kocmanova, Alena; Docekalova, Marie Pavlakova] Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic; [Simanaviciene, Zaneta] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio G 20-225, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Brno University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Kocmanova, A (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",kocmanova@fbm.vutbr.cz; docekalova@fbm.vutbr.cz; zaneta.simanaviciene@ktu.lt,"Pavlakova Docekalova, Marie/O-8845-2017; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/W-3675-2019; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/U-7817-2019","Pavlakova Docekalova, Marie/0000-0003-4628-5075; Simanaviciene, Zaneta/0000-0001-6008-2405;",Czech Science Foundation [14-23079S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This paper is supported by the grant No. 14-23079S Measuring Corporate Sustainability in Selected Sectors of The Czech Science Foundation.,,34,17,18,5,67,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is difficult to attribute the rise in instability to job mobility because there is no evidence of a concurrent increase in job turnover or separations.

The empirical evidence is consistent with the simulations of a search and matching model where an increase in the variance of productivity shocks increases on-the-job search and earnings instability among job changers while leaving job turnover approximately constant.

The authors' choice of the analysed organisation was based on the excellent performance of the organisation in the area of building the organisational commitment. On the basis of the research results, one may conclude that the calculative commitment in the organisations is largely stimulated by the following factors: the economic work conditions, justice in the organisation and development opportunities while the affective commitment is mainly dependent on the perceived support from the organisation. In addition, the research confirmed the existence of differences in factors influencing the intensity of both types of commitment in the analysed employee groups, differentiated both in terms of their positions and type of work in the organisation.","[Lewicka, Dagmara] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Krakow, Poland; [Rakowska, Anna] MCSU Maria Sklodowska Curie Univ, Lublin, Poland",AGH University of Krakow,"Lewicka, D (通讯作者)，AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Krakow, Poland.",,"Rakowska, Anna/AAP-6528-2020; Lewicka, Dagmara/U-8457-2019; Rakowska, Anna/HJH-6655-2023","Rakowska, Anna/0000-0002-4990-2297; Lewicka, Dagmara/0000-0002-6955-7371",Ministry of Science and Higher Education.

Herein, we allow people to choose their distribution over this range endogenously. We consider a multiplicative error model explaining the willingness to pay (WTP) which is estimated using a feasible generalized least squares estimator. We apply our framework to a representative sample of the French population who were asked about the valuation of a bear conservation programme. We find that most participants prefer stating their WTP as a range rather than a point, but the shape of the distribution greatly varies across people.

The model assumes full capacity utilization; saving and investment decisions are coordinated through changes in the valuation of the capital stock or q ratio. Changes in valuation can induce enough investment and capitalist consumption to fill the demand gap left by a reduction in the wage share. But unless there is a strong sensitivity of investment to the q ratio, the increased profitability will be dissipated in a profit-led stock market boom. The model helps resolve the neoliberal paradox of rising profitability with little growth. It also clarifies the relationship between classical and Keynesian growth models which can be seen as special cases arising from limiting values of the investment sensitivity to the q ratio.","[Michl, Thomas R.] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 13346 USA",Colgate University,"Michl, TR (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 13346 USA.",tmichl@colgate.edu,,,,,,,19,10,11,0,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Risk mismanagement in the saving banks was the main culprit but the intensity of the crisis was due to the war of attrition between the main stakeholders (the central and regional governments, the Bank of Spain and the colas), which was further reinforced by the power of inaction of the big Spanish banks: Santander and BBVA. Ultimately, an external actor resolved the stalemate: the European Stability Mechanism, which was able to introduce the necessary reforms after successful completion of the Memorandum of Understanding. The paper sheds new light on the Spanish case by analysing the political and economic factors that led to the crisis. Furthermore, rather than examining the financial crisis from a purely domestic perspective, the paper emphasizes the interplay between domestic and European factors. It closes with lessons for the European Banking Union that can be extracted from the Spanish experience.","[Otero-Iglesias, Miguel] Real Inst Elcano, ESSCA Sch Management, Madrid, Spain; [Royo, Sebastian] Suffolk Univ, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Steinberg Wechsler, Federico] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Steinberg Wechsler, Federico] Real Inst Elcano, Madrid, Spain",Suffolk University; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Otero-Iglesias, M (通讯作者)，Real Inst Elcano, ESSCA Sch Management, Madrid, Spain.",miguel.otero@rielcano.org; sroyo@suffolk.edu; fsteinberg@rielcano.org,,"STEINBERG WECHSLER, FEDERICO/0000-0002-8318-5527",,,,,35,1,1,0,3,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

As a result, international organizations have started to pressurize economies to minimize their carbon emissions by increasing the share of clean energy consumption in total energy use. Hence, the goal of this paper is to empirically explore to what extent both domestic (stock market) and foreign (FDI inflows) capital affect clean energy uses across the EU, the G20, and OECD, spanning the period 1993-2012. The results of long-run elasticities document that both FDI and stock market developments play a significant role in promoting clean energy uses across all three-country groups. The results also suggest that clean energy consumption has a considerable positive and negative effect on economic output and CO2 emissions, respectively, while the political globalization has a substantial negative impact on carbon emissions across the EU, the G20 and OECD economies.

Expected earnings, income variability and other nonmonetary aspects such as independence and job satisfaction are possible answers. This type of decision-making may be inherently dynamic as choices affect the accumulation of specific experience and, thus, the evolution of a worker's skills and compensation. This paper models an individual's decision over employment type by estimating a dynamic, stochastic, discrete choice, optimization problem using panel data from Chile. We simulate choices of employment type in the hypothetical scenario of a proposed mandatory universal unemployment insurance structure under different categories of education and experience. We find a slight increase in the number of workers selecting self-employment due to the reform. Consistent with theories of accumulation of specific experience and specialization, we observe stronger movements the lower (higher) the amount of experience workers have in the departing (destination) sectors.","[Pardo, Cristian] St Josephs Univ, Dept Econ, 5600 City Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA; [Ruiz-Tagle, Jaime] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Torre 26,Oficina 1601, Santiago, Chile; [Ruiz-Tagle, Jaime] Univ Chile, Microdata Ctr, Diagonal Paraguay 257,Torre 26,Oficina 1601, Santiago, Chile",Saint Joseph's University; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Pardo, C (通讯作者)，St Josephs Univ, Dept Econ, 5600 City Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19131 USA.",cpardo@sju.edu; jaimert@econ.uchile.cl,,"Pardo, Cristian/0000-0002-9862-0202","'Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio' of the Ministry of Economy, Chile [NS100041]","'Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio' of the Ministry of Economy, Chile","This work was supported by 'Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio' of the Ministry of Economy, Chile [grant number NS100041].",,40,9,9,3,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In the article, only measurable and comparable indicators that are detectable in each municipality and they are objective indicators for evaluating their efficiency are used. The evaluation of municipal efficiency itself is made using the appropriate DEA model. Regarding the characteristics of the inputs and outputs used, an output-oriented CCR-O model is used. Using this model, the efficiency and super-efficiency of municipalities is defined that subsequently presents the level of quality of life in the given municipality.

Tourism is more than any other production industry demanding of human factor quality. We do not mean only an ability to provide demanded goods and services but to feel our job as our mission. To provide customers the gift of heart and religion. Economic effectiveness of this approach can be confirmed by an example of a family business in the area of private accommodation provision without hospitality or catering services.

With South Africa's complex history, persistent inequality and considerable cultural diversity, economics has much to gain from interdisciplinary collaboration and mixed methods research.","[Posel, Dorrit] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Posel, D (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",dorrit.posel@wits.ac.za,"Posel, Dorrit/AAF-7750-2021","Posel, Dorrit/0000-0002-3343-875X",CoE Human (University of the Witwatersrand),CoE Human (University of the Witwatersrand),"Thanks to John Luiz and Ingrid Woolard for their helpful comments on the paper, and to Don Ross, and to the CoE Human (University of the Witwatersrand), for their support of my research.",,56,4,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

To define related variety in each industry, we used machine-learning-method decision trees. The input and target variables are the number of companies from 86 industries located in 2,531 communities in Poland. Decision trees allow us to predict how many companies from each industry exist in communities, given the precise number of companies from related industries and the number of communities in which these relationships occur. The trees indicate the most common structures of related industries. Our findings confirm that related variety differs in size and scope for every industry and includes companies both within and outside the natural value chain (suppliers and clients). The findings prove the utility of the new definition of related variety, as defining related variety properly and precisely may facilitate the process of implementing and developing smart specialisations in regions.","[Pylak, Korneliusz; Majerek, Dariusz] Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka 38D St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland",Lublin University of Technology,"Pylak, K (通讯作者)，Lublin Univ Technol, Nadbystrzycka 38D St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.",korneliusz.pylak@pollub.pl; d.majerek@pollub.pl,"Pylak, Korneliusz/A-7270-2013; Majerek, Dariusz/D-3457-2017","Pylak, Korneliusz/0000-0001-7812-1281; Majerek, Dariusz/0000-0002-0035-7187",,,,,15,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1285,1294,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300128,0

I show that this multiplicity of equilibria exists in general even when money is replaced with a dividend-bearing asset, as long as the asset is useful as a medium of exchange. If the fundamental value of the asset is sufficiently high, there is a unique equilibrium, in which the price of the asset equals its fundamental value. For lower fundamental values, there is a continuum of bubble equilibria, in which the price of the asset exceeds the fundamental value. For very low fundamental values, the equilibrium is again unique but the asset is not used as a medium of exchange.

By using a panel data, that combines a survey of two cohorts of Israeli first-degree holders and data from administrative sources on jobs and wages, we examine the contribution of job turnover, cognitive abilities and continuing graduate studies to the likelihood of overeducation and wage dynamics. The study produces four main findings. First, rapid job-switching makes a negative contribution to the increase in employee's wage and there is a negative correlation between two variables - an employee's tenure and the number of past employers in the years after the completion of degree studies - and the probability of being overeducated. Second, the contribution of the individual's cognitive abilities and quantitative reasoning skills to the likelihood of becoming overeducated is negative. Third, the wages of overeducated employees are some 11% lower and rise more slowly than the wages of those whose level of schooling corresponds to their jobs; this outcome may be interpreted as indicating that the 'scars' of being overeducated tend to be long-lasting. Fourth, the overeducated workers have lower propensity to continue to advanced academic studies.","[Romanov, Dmitri] Israel Cent Bur Stat, Chief Scientist Dept, Jerusalem, Israel; [Tur-Sinai, Aviad] Max Stern Yezreel Valley Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Yezreel Valley, Israel; [Eizman, Galit] Israeli Council Higher Educ, Planning & Budgeting Comm, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Tur-Sinai, A (通讯作者)，Max Stern Yezreel Valley Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Yezreel Valley, Israel.",aviad.tursinai@mail.huji.ac.il,"Tur-Sinai, Aviad/AAD-6886-2022","Tur-Sinai, Aviad/0000-0002-4802-455X",,,,,54,3,4,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

One major advantage of the CRE approach over the fixed-effects approach is that it is able to estimate the effect of variables that remain unchanged within panel clusters (e.g. time difference between countries), while these variables get dropped from regressions that use fixed-effects methods. Regression results based on the CRE Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator indicate statistically significant negative effect of time difference between countries on bilateral trade. An additional hour of time difference between countries is found to reduce bilateral merchandise exports by approximately 8%, even after controlling for the effect of distance in the regressions.","[Roy, Suryadipta] High Point Univ, Dept Econ, High Point, NC USA",,"Roy, S (通讯作者)，High Point Univ, Phillips Sch Business, 1 Univ Pkwy,Drawer 40, High Point, NC 27268 USA.",sroy@highpoint.edu,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The choice under uncertainty conditions is one of the central problems in managerial theories of choice. That is also the reason why evolutionary researchers seek a way of adapting to the environment, and one of the concepts embedded in an evolutionary stream are the routines. The routines constitute a generative, dynamic, and emerging system that creates various effects regarded as the continuum: from very stable to continuously changeable ones. The purpose of the paper is to shed light on the routine concept based on the management, evolutionary and change literature. Consequently the paper presents a conceptual framework concerning the relationships between the relative rate of the context changes and the nature of routines, resulting in their different types. The potential setting and research directions for the empirical studies based on this conceptual framework have been also addressed. The methodology encompasses a deductive approach and the method that has been used is critical literature studies. The overarching key finding of the paper is that routines constitute a social phenomenon that is always a barrier to changes, yet regarding evolutionary theory, it is also the chance for changes.","[Stanczyk-Hugiet, Ewa; Piorkowska, Katarzyna; Stanczyk, Sylwia] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Strategy & Management Methods, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Stanczyk-Hugiet, E (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Strategy & Management Methods, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Hugiet, Stanczyk/G-2895-2018; Stanczyk, Sylwia/E-1899-2017; Piórkowska, Katarzyna/F-3332-2015","Hugiet, Stanczyk/0000-0002-3218-3812; Stanczyk, Sylwia/0000-0002-3539-0075; Piórkowska, Katarzyna/0000-0001-5880-136X",National Science Centre in Poland [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/00647],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The research is supported by the National Science Centre in Poland (grant number: DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/00647).,,82,1,1,0,4,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Authors ranked countries by FDI's imports and exports shares from the world's FDI performance to analyse the extent of involvement of countries in the process of migration of FDI. Authors found that FDI has been changing in the volume of capital flows, in the structure, and destinations. Recent decades can be marked with spatial shift in attracting FDI: an increasingly prominent position in attracting capital occupied by countries with developing markets. In addition, conducted analysis showed that FDI grow rapidly with an increase in the volatility of migration of capital and this is a long-term threat to the stability of the world and national economies, and therefore, a serious problem in modern global financial system that needs to be addressed.","[Tyrkba, Khanifa; Nalbandyan, Astkhik; Oganesyan, Ani] Peoples Friendhip Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, 6 Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Tyrkba, K (通讯作者)，Peoples Friendhip Univ Russia, RUDN Univ, 6 Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia.",tyrkba_khv@pfur.ru; nalbandyan_aa@pfur.ru; oganesyan_aa@pfur.ru,"Tyrkba, Khanifa/AAC-6760-2021; Tyrkba, Khanifa/ABD-9410-2021; Nalbandyan, Astkhik/AAA-8116-2020; Oganesyan, Ani/N-6309-2017",,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1707,1717,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300170,0

It includes computation and interpretation of multiple bankruptcy risk ratios. When applying accounting ratios in a credit risk evaluation analysts typically either compute and interpret several individual ratios (a univariate approach) or apply some pre-estimated parametric multi-variable econometric tools, such as the Altman model or discriminant function. The problem with the first approach is that it does not take into account the inter-relationships between the individual ratios. The latter approach, in turn, calls for statistical models, whose parameters may not be stable in time and in space. In this paper we empirically examine the usefulness of the alternative approach, that is simple taxonomic ranking, in corporate bankruptcy risk quantification (on the basis of data from the Polish stock market). We found that this simple non-parametric multivariate method outperforms all other tested approaches (including logit model) in discriminating between bankrupt and healthy firms.","[Welc, Jacek; Sobczak, Elzbieta] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Welc, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Nowowiejska 3, PL-58500 Jelenia Gora, Poland.",jacek.welc@ue.wroc.pl; elzbieta.sobczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Sobczak, Elzbieta/K-3590-2018","Sobczak, Elzbieta/0000-0003-1912-7493",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1854,1862,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300185,0

The estimates are relatively less precise than in cases where there are at least some distinct regressors in the two equations. In an attempt to overcome this problem, some authors introduce quadratic terms into one or both equations. As this does not add any new statistical information, just a deterministic function of an existing regressor, the sceptic would question how this could improve the reliability of the estimates. This article shows that arbitrary use of quadratics is not without consequence. It increases the chances of getting either multiple roots, no root or a local root where a global does not exist.

While increased agricultural productivity can improve economic welfare and help address food security problems by benefiting both consumers and producers simultaneously, it also must address the depletion of already scarce natural resources. In the context of a changing climate, sustainable and resilient agricultural production forms a major cornerstone of both adaptation and mitigation strategies. The global community needs to have the proper tools with which to monitor sustainable agricultural productivity gains, identify countries and sectors lagging behind, and commit R&D efforts accordingly to address the challenges ahead. As such, it is suggested that 1) an international consortium should monitor agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) to provide international comparisons and track performance over time; 2) the G20 should acknowledge and address the issue of sustainable productivity measurement, and; 3) the G20 should support more in-depth research into the relationship between agricultural TFP and agricultural R&D.","[Laborde, David; Pineiro, Valeria] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Piñeiro, V (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",v.pineiro@cgiar.org,,"Pineiro, Valeria/0000-0002-4372-7141; Matthews, Alan/0000-0003-1051-1499",,,,,16,4,4,0,5,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,DEC 7,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201866,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-66,0.0,,,11,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HD7OO,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452743100001,0

We use a multivariate unobserved component model (MUC) to derive the potential output and the associated output gap for the Lithuanian economy. The model is estimated via Bayesian methods and the time paths of unobserved variables are extracted via the Kalman filter. The inclusion of unemployment in the MUC model substantially improves the estimates of the output gap in real time. Adding information about credit further emphasizes the overheating of the economy in the pre-crisis period, both in real time and ex post. Including credit preserves the conclusions regarding turning points. We uncover a strong negative correlation between the model-implied unemployment gap (without accounting for credit) and real credit growth. Data revisions do not appear to be the primary source of revisions of output gap estimates.","[Constantinescu, Mihnea; Nguyen, Anh D.

We show that this higher intensity of informal learning does not substitute for temporary workers' lower participation in formal training. Instead, both types of learning are complementary. Heterogeneous-effect analyses suggests that early career expectations of gaining a permanent contract could explain the higher informal learning investments of employees while in a temporary job.","[Ferreira, Maria; de Grip, Andries; van der Velden, Rolf] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Ferreira, Maria] Ind Univ Santander, Sch Business & Econ, Bucaramanga, Colombia; [de Grip, Andries] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Maastricht University; Universidad Industrial de Santander; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"de Grip, A (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.ferreirasequeda@maastrichtuniversity.nl; a.degrip@maastrichtuniversity.nl; r.vandervelden@maastrichtuniversity.nl,"De Grip, Andries/A-6021-2009",,,,,,89,12,12,3,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,DEC,2018,55.0,,,,,,18,40,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.08.009,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BD,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454465000002,0

Using microsimulation-based decompositions, we analyse the driving forces behind these trends, finding that rural poverty and inequality reductions are mainly attributable to increasing labour incomes in Peru's agricultural sector and, to a smaller extent, increasing public transfers. In earlier years, higher returns to experience drive these results, while in later years, increasing staple-crop yields and prices are of key importance. Further, remuneration of working hours increases in reaction to labour-supply shortages in rural areas. The accompanying rising incomes and non-agricultural job creation is less pro-poor than would be ideal, as they benefit more highly skilled workers. Further, shrinking farm sizes hampers poverty reduction and income-inequality reduction. Policies should target the participation of the poor in high-value (non-)agricultural activities, especially if positive trends in commodity prices are only transitory.","[Flachsbarth, Insa] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, RTG 1666 GlobalFood,Heinrich Duker Weg 12, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Schotte, Simone; Lay, Jann] GIGA Inst Afrika Studien, Neuer Jungfernstieg 21, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Garrido, Alberto] ETS Ingn Agron Alimentaria & Biosistemas, Avda Complutense S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",German Institute of Global & Area Studies; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Flachsbarth, I (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, RTG 1666 GlobalFood,Heinrich Duker Weg 12, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",insa.flachsbarth@agr.uni-goettingen.de; simone.schotte@giga-hamburg.de; jann.lay@giga-hamburg.de; alberto.garrido@upm.es,"Lay, Jann/AAP-7896-2020","Lay, Jann/0000-0002-0784-3807; Schotte, Simone/0000-0003-0972-6046; Flachsbarth, Insa/0000-0003-2642-9211",,,,,48,7,8,3,25,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

These losses stem from frictions such as search costs, switching costs, and rational inattention, as well as what we call mental gaps resulting from wrong priors/worldviews, or relevant features of a problem not being top of mind. Most research studying such losses does not empirically distinguish between these mechanisms. Instead, we show that most highly cited papers in this area presume one mechanism underlies consumer choices and assume away other potential explanations, or collapse many mechanisms together. We discuss the empirical difficulties that arise in distinguishing between different mechanisms, and some promising approaches for making progress in doing so. We also assess when it is more or less important for researchers to distinguish between these mechanisms. Approaches that seek to identify true value from demand, without specifying mechanisms behind this wedge, are most useful when researchers are interested in evaluating allocation policies that strongly steer consumers towards better options with regulation, traditional policy instruments, and defaults. On the other hand, understanding the precise mechanisms underlying consumer losses is essential to predicting the impact of mechanism policies aimed primarily at reducing specific frictions or mental gaps without otherwise steering consumers. We make the case that papers engaging with these questions empirically should be clear about whether their analyses distinguish between mechanisms behind poorly informed choices, and what that implies for the questions they can answer. We present examples from several empirical contexts to highlight these distinctions.","[Handel, Benjamin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Schwartzstein, Joshua] Harvard Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University,"Handel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",handel@berkeley.edu; jschwartzstein@hbs.edu,,,,,,,70,56,76,2,129,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We employ the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to estimate the unexplained part of the gender pay gap. To assess the impact of the rule of law on unexplained gender wage differences, we apply a linear regression model, where the estimated unexplained gender pay gap is used as a dependent variable and selected rule of law indicators (specifically the Worldwide Governance Indicators Rule of Law and the Legal System & Property Rights Index) as explanatory variables. Controlling for other institutions affecting gender wage differences (specifically labour market regulation, work-family reconciliation policy and male wage dispersion), we suggest that differences in the quality of legislation and law enforcement across European countries may partly account for the variation in the unexplained gender pay gap. A very progressive improvement in rule of law indices (from the worst to the best among the 25 European countries examined) leads to a decrease in the unexplained gender pay gap by 4.5-5 percentage points.","[Hedija, Veronika] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Jihlava, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Hedija, V (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Jihlava, Czech Republic.",veronika.hedija@vspj.cz,"Hedija, Veronika/AFO-7966-2022","Hedija, Veronika/0000-0002-5353-1505",College of Polytechnics Jihlava [1170/4/176],College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"This research was supported by the College of Polytechnics Jihlava, under Grant No. 1170/4/176 The Effect of Selected Factors on Firm Performance in the Czech Republic.",,22,3,3,1,21,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Our most significant new finding is that changes in governance quality within a policy-relevant time horizon can lead to significant changes in the quality of life. For example, the ten most-improved countries, in terms of changes in government service delivery quality between 2005 and 2012, when compared to the ten most-worsened countries, are estimated to have average life evaluations higher by 0.4 points on a 0 to 10 scale. The results also confirm earlier findings that service delivery quality generally dominates democratic quality in supporting better lives until delivery quality has reached sufficient levels.

It is shown that monetary policy being constraint by the ZLB implies huge welfare losses. Applying an optimal fiscal policy in this situation is found to be highly effective by eliminating roughly one quarter of the total welfare loss of being at the ZLB. Here, following the optimal fiscal policy imlies a prolonged stay at the ZLB. Moreover, while the relative effectiveness of consumption and wage taxes depends on the presence of government spending as well as on the specific monetary policy conducted, all Ramsey-policies aiming at maximizing economy-wide welfare imply reducing the welfare of savers. Furthermore, it is found that the welfare gains of having government spending as an additional instrument are small compared to the total welfare gains of applying a Ramsey-optimal instead of an exogenous policy. Finally, it is shown that if fiscal policy is set optimally, conducting an inflation-targeting policy instead of an optimal monetary policy need not necessarily imply welfare losses.

Discouragement effects for players who lag behind and the showdown effect when the campaign reaches a more decisive state vanish if players have to choose an overall budget and can draw on what is left from this budget in the course of the campaign. This is true both in a context in which the resources allocated to a battle are used up there as well as if player's battle resources carry over to future battles.

This is an empirical quantitative study that seeks to examine the influence of certain firm characteristics (firm size, auditor type, ownership concentration, industry, proportion of non-executive directors (NEDs) on the board, chairman/CEO duality and audit committee) on intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) in Portuguese companies. ICD data for this longitudinal study were gathered from the annual reports of 32 Portuguese listed firms over 5 years using content analysis. The results of this study indicate that firm size and industry are explanatory factors of the level of disclosure of information on intellectual capital. One of the limitations of the empirical part of the study derives from choosing the content analysis method because it is subject to the subjectivity of interpretation. Another limitation is the small sample size and the application only to Portugal which reduces the ability to generalize the results to other settings. This study contributes to the IC literature, providing new empirical data covering the analysis of 5 years of disclosure related to corporate governance.","[Martins, Maria Manuela; Isidro, Helena; Laureano, Raul] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Business Res Unit BRU IUL, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal; [Morais, Ana Isabel] ISEG Lisboa Sch Econ & Management, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Martins, MM (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Business Res Unit BRU IUL, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",manuela.martins@iscte.pt; anamorais@iseg.utl.pt; helena.isidro@iscte.pt; raul.laureano@iscte.pt,"Martins, Maria Manuela/E-1869-2016; Laureano, Raul/K-5547-2014; Morais, Ana Isabel/E-1369-2019","Martins, Maria Manuela/0000-0002-3433-4805; Laureano, Raul/0000-0002-7402-1299; Morais, Ana Isabel/0000-0001-7251-6418",,,,,89,8,11,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

A decomposition of the employment rate of full-time workers on permanent contracts reveals that non-standard employment contributes to a substantially weaker labour market attachment for females and the foreign born than suggested by conventional employment figures alone. Our econometric analysis shows that the negative wage premia associated with fixed-term employment are considerably smaller in Sweden, both for natives and foreign born, than those that have been found for other countries. This may be due to a highly compressed wage structure and extensive coverage of collective bargaining in Sweden. On the whole, the type of fixed-term contract seems not to matter for the estimated wage premia.","[Skedinger, Per] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Skedinger, Per] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Discriminat & Integrat Studies, Vaxjo, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Linnaeus University,"Skedinger, P (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.;Skedinger, P (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Discriminat & Integrat Studies, Vaxjo, Sweden.",per.skedinger@ifn.se,,"Skedinger, Per/0000-0003-4945-1577",Johan and Jakob Soderberg Foundation; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Johan and Jakob Soderberg Foundation; Marianne and Marcus Wallenberg Foundation; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"Thanks to Simon Ek and two anonymous referees for valuable comments and to Simon Ek and Charlotta Olofsson for expert research assistance.

This paper adds to the conversation by investigating the impact of bank distress on firms' exports using matched firm-bank data for the UK. We use two novel measures of bank distress: the Basel III net stable funding ratio, as well as the market-based bank credit default swap spreads, which best capture bank default risk, especially during crises. Our detailed database provides the crucial firm bank relationship information that allows us to directly test for the banking channel effect on the real economy, and to carefully account for various endogeneities and biases in estimation. We also test for the possible contagion of the Sovereign Debt Crisis from the GIIPS economies to the UK. We find that the severe bank distress generated by the recent crises immediately, negatively and significantly affects UK firms' exports, independent of demand shocks. Not all firms were impacted equally: private firms and firms in industries more dependent on external finance were impacted the most, while publicly owned firms were less affected by their bank's distress.

The best way to eliminate the ZLB is to eliminate all but small denominations of currency, ten dollars and lower, and to have those be in the form of coins.

Our analysis shows that China's eastern and north-eastern regions passed the turning point by 2010, while the central region is approaching this point and the western region remains far from it.

This paper combines geocoded information about the timing of introduction of ARVs in Kenyan health facilities with population surveys to estimate the impact of proximity to ARV providers on adolescent risky sexual behavior. A variety of difference-in-difference strategies yield a range of estimates of behavioral effects on pregnancy rates and self-reported sexual activity among 15-18 year-olds in areas where ARVs were introduced, from small to quite large. A simulation combining estimated behavioral responses with medical evidence regarding HIV transmission suggests increasing ARV access will reduce new HIV infections even with a very large increases in risk-taking.","[Friedman, Willa Helterline] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Friedman, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",whfriedman@uh.edu,,,Weiss Family Fellowship through the Center for Evaluation and Global Action; John L.

It allows for simultaneity in the econometric sense that the two realized outcomes depend structurally on each other. Another feature of the proposed model is that it will generate equal durations with positive probability. Our approach takes a stylized economic model that leads to a univariate generalized accelerated failure time model as a starting point. In this model, agents decide when to transition from an initial state to a new one, and the covariates influence the difference in the utility flow in the two states. We introduce simultaneity by allowing the utility flow to depend on the status of the other person. The econometric model is then completed by assuming that the observed outcome is the Nash bargaining solution in that simple economic model. The advantage of this approach is that it includes independent realizations from the generalized accelerated failure time model as a special case, and deviations from this special case can be given an economic interpretation. We established identification under assumptions that are similar to those in the literature on nonparametric estimation of duration models. We illustrate the model by studying the joint retirement decisions in married couples using the Health and Retirement Study. In that example, it seems reasonable to allow for the possibility that each partner's optimal retirement time depends on the retirement time of the spouse. Moreover, the data suggest that the wife and the husband retire at the same time for a nonnegligible fraction of couples. The main empirical finding is that the simultaneity is economically important. In our preferred specification, the indirect utility associated with being retired increases by approximately 5% when one's spouse retires.","[Honore, Bo E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [de Paula, Aureo] UCL, Dept Econ, Sao Paulo Sch Econ, FGV,CeMMAP, London, England; [de Paula, Aureo] IFS, High Wycombe, Bucks, England",Princeton University; University of London; University College London,"Honoré, BE (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",honore@princeton.edu; a.paula@ucl.ac.uk,,"de Paula, Aureo/0000-0003-3611-3448",Center for Retirement Research (Boston College); National Science Foundation; Gregory C.

The IMF introduced new facilities at the global level, new regional financial arrangements (RFAs) were created, and bilateral swap agreements emerged as a new element. In this paper, we ask how these changes influence the use of RFAs. We create a database with all the cases in which a RFA member drew on one of the elements of the global safety net. This allows us to analyze which other options the country had at hand and how their respective volume, timeliness, and policy conditionality affected their use. We find today's global financial safety net to be not a global but a geographically and structurally scattered net with unequal access for three different groups of countries. Small countries can draw on their RFA. Only few countries can count on a bilateral swap line. The majority of the countries in our sample do not have several options to choose from. They have the IMF as their only source. We find that volume alone does not explain why countries choose a certain source of emergency liquidity. Even if the big new voluminous swap arrangements replaced RFAs in some cases, we find a complex pattern of complementary and substitutive use of the regional and other elements of the global safety net.","[Muehlich, Laurissa; Fritz, Barbara] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Latin Amer Studies, Berlin, Germany; [Muehlich, Laurissa; Fritz, Barbara] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Free University of Berlin,"Mühlich, L (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Inst Latin Amer Studies, Berlin, Germany.;Mühlich, L (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Berlin, Germany.",laurissa.muehlich@fu-berlin.de; barbara.fritz@fu-berlin.de,,"Muhlich, Laurissa/0000-0003-3377-4486",,,,,58,10,11,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

To examine the role of offshoring and technological change in driving this labor market development, we develop a task-based model of production in global value chains and propose a decomposition of changes in occupational labor demand. In the setup of the model, technological change affects the total number of workers with a certain occupation throughout the production chain, while task relocation consists of a shift in occupational labor demand from one location to another. For the empirical implementation we combine harmonized cross-country occupations data with world input-output tables. The results of our decomposition suggest that technological change increased the number of non-routine relative to routine occupations in all countries. The effect of task relocation is less strong, and works in the same direction for advanced countries such as Germany and the United States but in the opposite direction for emerging countries such as China and Poland.","[Reijnders, Laurie S.

Results from a novel experiment suggest that such a shift in demand is unlikely to occur in the overall population. However, high income individuals lower their demand for redistribution when primed with information on immigration as they pay a large share of overall taxes. Taste effects, where voters do not desire transfer payments to ethnically different groups, seem to play a minor role. Low education individuals, on the other hand, demand more redistribution when primed. Immigration and demand for welfare are not correlated on average. However, if political systems are more responsive to highly educated voters, increased levels of immigration may lead to less redistribution.","[Runst, Petrik] Univ Gottingen, Inst Small Business Econ, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Runst, P (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Inst Small Business Econ, Gottingen, Germany.",petrik.runst@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,economics department of Gottingen University - Chair of Economic Policy and SME research,economics department of Gottingen University - Chair of Economic Policy and SME research,I gratefully acknowledge financial research support provided by the economics department of Gottingen University - Chair of Economic Policy and SME research (Prof. Bizer).

Previously, such models have generally used elasticities from the literature, although those estimates are mostly obsolete or else estimated using different aggregation levels to those used in the models. Furthermore, the same elasticities are used for all countries. These drawbacks highlight the importance of using empirically validated elasticities. In order to demonstrate the extent of the identified drawbacks, we use the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact (CAPRI) model and empirically assess the Armington and demand elasticities for Switzerland. We then compare the results of a free trade agreement between Switzerland and the European Union with the old and the estimated elasticities derived from the CAPRI model. The results differ remarkably from each other, which supports the importance of the estimated elasticities used in computable equilibrium models in terms of making policy assessments more reliable.","[Wunderlich, A.

Using a unique firm-level dataset of 14,065 Chinese high-tech start-ups from 2007 to 2013, we employ a discrete time hazard model to study the impact of differences in internal and external innovation mechanisms, specifically, innovation efficiency and spillover effect derived from trade, on the likelihood of firms' survival as these factors are currently less understood.

Our results suggest that innovation as measured by patents, innovation efficiency and firms' import and export activities can increase the survival rate of Chinese high-tech firms.

While intoxicated, participants chose between monetary payment and social time, defined as access to their phone and pre-specified social internet sites like Facebook. The design of the experiment made possible an assessment of the acute effects of THC and MDMA on adherence to the generalized axiom of revealed preference (GARP), a necessary and sufficient condition for maximization of a well-behaved utility function. Choices made under the influence of THC, MDMA, and placebo were all GARP compliant. Thus, even when participants were acutely intoxicated with THC or MDMA, their choices remained consistent with the tenets of neoclassical choice theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Part of this has been a rise in far-right, anti-immigration parties in a range of countries. Existing evidence suggests that the presence of immigrants generates an advantage for parties with anti-immigration or nationalist platforms. This paper explores a closely related but overlooked issue: how immigrant behaviour is influenced by these parties. We focus on immigrant location decisions in Northern Italy, an area that has seen the rise of the anti-immigration party Lega Nord. We construct a dataset of mayoral elections in Italy for the years 2002-2014 and estimate the effect of electing a mayor belonging to, or supported by, Lega Nord. Exploiting close elections in a regression discontinuity framework we demonstrate that the election of a Lega Nord mayor discourages immigrants from moving into the municipality. We also provide suggestive evidence that the effect is driven primarily by the anti-immigration politics of Lega Nord insofar as it is absent in the period before their adoption of an explicitly anti-immigration platform and is concentrated in smaller, less educated, municipalities.

We present results from a charitable donation experiment that was designed to test for associations with moderate variation in the level of alcohol consumption rather than with the incidence of chronic dependency. We find that higher levels of alcohol consumption (and also higher levels of alcohol expenditure) are associated with significantly less generosity. However, there is no significant association between alcohol consumption / expenditure and empathy (as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index) or between alcohol consumption / expenditure and materialism (as measured by the Material Values Scale).

The use of loan-to-value (LTV) policies to curb booming property markets has long been used by Hong Kong's monetary authorities to actively manage the potential fallout from housing price bubbles. In 2013 the Hong Kong authorities supplemented the LTV policies with property transfer taxes. Here, we also analyse the merits of these tax-based macroprudential policies in the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium framework. Furthermore, we calibrate the impact of both countercyclical macroprudential policies employed in conjunction with forward guidance. We conclude that both policy approaches can limit the pace of housing price increases. As regards the comparison of LTV and tax-based measures, it turns out that property acquisition taxes are more effective.","[Funke, Michael] Hamburg Univ, CESifo Munich, Hamburg, Germany; [Paetz, Michael] Hamburg Univ, Hamburg, Germany",Ifo Institut; University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg,"Paetz, M (通讯作者)，Hamburg Univ, Dept Econ, Von Melle Pk 5, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",michael.paetz@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,38,8,8,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The latter is considered crucial for coping with growing variable renewable electricity supply and essential for allocative efficiency in electricity markets. Yet, significant amounts of the potential efficiency gains from time-varying tariffing may be left unrealized, since many residential and commercial retail consumers could actually prefer to stick with the usual default, which is flat tariffing, in order to avoid potential consumption cost increases. We study how increasing variable renewable supply affects individual consumption cost changes from implementing real-time retail pricing among residential consumers, using consumption data from Germany and simulating long-run electricity market equilibria. We find that most customers face comparatively small bill changes at high renewable supply shares. We further analyze how consumer heterogeneity influences the unrealized welfare gains from rejecting real-time pricing. Applying synthetic residential, commercial and industrial demand profiles calibrated to German market data, we find that unrealized welfare gains are 18% to 57% larger, if mostly residential and commercial instead of industrial customers remain flat-priced. The corresponding unrealized welfare gains can more than quadruple to 1.1 bn EUR per year, if renewable supply shares increase. Additionally, targeted rollouts of real-time pricing can entail adverse distributional effects across consumer sectors. Particularly residential consumers can face rate increases, if mainly industrial consumers adopt real-time pricing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Results from previous research mostly confirm the negative relationship between profitability and credit risk by considering the current or one year lagged value of profitability. Certain crisis indicates that more profitable banks before the crisis became more risky during the time of crisis. These results motivate us to upgrade the model of credit risk by including earlier values of profitability. Results indicate that two or three years are necessary for growth of profitability to increase credit risk. However, the long-run relationship between foreign banks' profitability and credit risk is positive, for both indicators. For the domestic bank, the long run effect of ROA on credit risk is positive, while for ROE this relationship is negative.","[Peric, Blanka Skrabic] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Peric, BS (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia.",bskrabic@efst.hr,"Skrabic Peric, Blanka/D-4976-2017","Skrabic Peric, Blanka/0000-0002-7448-3821",,,,,22,0,0,1,7,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We use the dynamic Cholesky-factor vector autoregression variance decomposition method. To ascertain the net directional spillovers and to determine the direction of the transmission of shocks, we employed the network graph connectedness method across a few select events characterized by the crude oil price volatility of 2008-09 and 2014-16. We found that the crude oil market has a dominant impact on the total connectedness of the crude oil currency-implied volatility relationship, suggesting that crude oil affects currencies more than currencies affect crude oil for the time frame of 2007-16. However, during the crude oil crisis periods, the dynamics are reversed, with crude having more of an effect. Additionally, the pairwise directional network connectedness between the currency pairs reveals that EURUSD is more sensitive to the crude price fluctuation than other major currency pairs and is one major currency that passes idiosyncratic shocks to other currency pairs.

We ran two experiments with young and older adults, systematically manipulating (1) uncertainty conditions (risk and ambiguity), (2) feedback on decisions and (3) requirements of the task regarding executive functions. Experiment 1 aims at investigating risk with a priori probabilities and ambiguity and the effects of feedback in a card game (N = 200; older adults: 97). The results reveal no age differences in choice behaviour under risk with a priori probabilities. If feedback is provided, we find that older adults are less ambiguity averse than young adults, whereas there is no significant age difference if no feedback is provided. Moreover, the presence of feedback had a positive effect on the propensity to gamble in uncertain conditions by influencing subjective probabilities for both age groups. Experiment 2 uses the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to investigate decision making with statistical probabilities (N = 100; older adults: 50). Here we report older adults being more risk averse, an effect that can be explained with age differences in sensitivity to prior choices. We support the results by comparing them to survey data and conclude that differences in uncertainty-processing exist between young and older adults. Possible explanations of these differences are discussed.","[Sproten, Alec N.] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, Insb Wirtschaftstheorie, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Diener, Carsten] SRH Univ Appl Sci Heidelberg, Div Clin & Biol Psychol, Dept Appl Psychol, Maria Probst Str 3, D-69123 Heidelberg, Germany; [Fiebach, Christian J.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Psychol, Mertonstr 17, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schwieren, Christiane] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst Wirtschaftswissensch, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Goethe University Frankfurt; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Sproten, AN (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, Insb Wirtschaftstheorie, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",alec.sproten@fau.de,"Schwieren, Christiane/ABT-0816-2022; Fiebach, Christian/D-9540-2012; Sproten, Alec Niklas/P-4216-2014","Schwieren, Christiane/0000-0002-5266-3725; Sproten, Alec Niklas/0000-0001-8660-2173",University of Heidelberg,University of Heidelberg,This research has been made possible by a FRONTIER-Fonds grant from the University of Heidelberg to the authors.

Conventional monetary easing can exacerbate these problems, in that the misrepresentation of collateral becomes more profitable, thus increasing haircuts and interest rate differentials. Central bank purchases of private mortgages may not be feasible, due to the misrepresentation of asset quality. If feasible, central bank asset purchase programs work by circumventing suboptimal fiscal policy, not by mitigating incentive problems in asset markets.","[Williamson, Stephen D.] Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Williamson, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Social Sci Ctr, Dept Econ, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",swilliamecon@gmail.com,"Williamson, Stephen D/I-5759-2016","Williamson, Stephen/0009-0007-4677-1803",,,,,26,3,4,0,7,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

The study uses panel data from Turkey to test the presence of an added worker effect during the global economic crisis of 2008. Identification is achieved by an instrumental variable approach. In particular, an exogenous variation in the output of male-dominated sectors induced by the crisis is used as an instrument for the husbands' unemployment. Results show that the probability of a woman participating in the labor force increases by 15-28% in response to her husband's unemployment. However, the effect is not contemporaneous; rather, it appears with a lag of one quarter and only operates for two quarters. The effect is mainly driven by financially-constrained (less-educated and young) couples, which suggests the prevalence of an income effect in spousal labor supply decisions.","[Ayhan, Sinem H.] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Schaumburg Lippe St 5-7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Ayhan, SH (通讯作者)，Inst Labor Econ IZA, Schaumburg Lippe St 5-7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",ayhan@iza.org,,"Ayhan, Sinem/0000-0002-8054-7764",,,,,34,9,10,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The model shows that, when elasticity of demand for the product with a lower learning potential is greater than unity, a tariff imposed on this product can shift the demand toward the product with a higher learning potential, thus enhancing growth in the exporter economy. Therefore, although with some possible negative effect on the welfare in the short run, barriers for the export of natural luxury goods may be beneficial for developing economies in the long run, since they increase their incentive to develop sectors with higher growth potential.","[Azarnert, Leonid, V] Ariel Univ, Ariel, Israel",Ariel University,"Azarnert, LV (通讯作者)，Ariel Univ, Dept Econ & Business Adm, IL-40700 Ariel, Israel.",Leonid.Azarnert@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In addition, speculators' orders depend on price trends, market misalignments and fundamental news. Using a mix of analytical and numerical tools, we show that a herding-induced market entry wave may amplify excess demand, triggering lasting volatility outbursts. Eventually, however, higher stock market risk reduces stock market participation and volatility decreases again. Simulations furthermore reveal that our approach is also able to produce bubbles and crashes, excess volatility, fat-tailed return distributions and serially uncorrelated price changes. Moreover, trading volume is persistent and correlated with volatility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model indicates that the higher the adult unemployment rate in the skilled sector, the lesser is the time allocated by an unskilled adult towards schooling of her child. We also find that an increase in the unskilled adult's wage may or may not decrease child labour in the presence of unemployment. The model predicts that an increase in child wage increases schooling and human capital growth rate only if the adults in the unskilled sector earn less than subsistence consumption expenditure. As the responsiveness of skilled wage to human capital increases, schooling and human capital growth rates increase. The model dynamics bring out the importance of education efficiency and parental human capital in human capital formation of the child. In the case of an inefficient education system, generations will be trapped into low level equilibrium. Only in the presence of an efficient education system, steady growth of human capital is possible. Suitable policies that may be framed to escape the child labour trap are discussed as well.","[Chakraborty, Kamalika; Chakraborty, Bidisha] Jadavpur Univ, 188 Raja SC Mallick Rd, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India",Jadavpur University,"Chakraborty, K (通讯作者)，Jadavpur Univ, 188 Raja SC Mallick Rd, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India.",k.chakraborty82@gmail.com,,,,,,,58,5,5,3,18,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

In the first part of the paper, we present new evidence from a survey. We show that individuals are more generous towards poor people whom they perceive to be diligent workers relative to poor people whom they perceive to be non-diligent, a social preference that we label sympathy for the diligent. This preference is much stronger than preferences regarding other characteristics of the poor, such as race, nationality, and disability. More important, we show that subjects with higher sympathy for the diligent have a stronger preference for workfare programs. In the second part of the paper, we incorporate our empirical findings into a model of income redistribution. We consider the case of a benevolent government with fairness concerns that prioritizes the well-being of individuals who exert the most effort. We characterize the optimal conditions under which the government introduces work requirements. Even if wasteful, work requirements can be optimal, because they allow for a better distinction between individuals who exert great effort and individuals who do not. However, if the government lacks commitment power, the availability of screening through work requirements leads to a lower equilibrium effort and, possibly, a Pareto-dominated allocation.

This study thoroughly examines two popular fuel-factor nesting structures in CGE models of China, namely KL-E-1 and KE-L.(2) We use non-linear algorithms to estimate the underlying CES production functions of these two structures. We recommend the latter to be used in CGE models of China, as it exhibits 1) better goodness of fit, 2) better convergence, and 3) better compliance with economic meanings. Our estimations show that the ranges for the inner- and outer-CES parameters(3) in our preferred KE-L structure are 0.6-0.8 and 0.7-0.9, respectively. Applying these in a CGE model, we find nesting strategies used in previous CGE exercises might have overestimated energy conservation costs in China. A decomposition shows that, using our KE-L, changes in energy use are dominate by output effects rather than substitution effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This article provides a choice-theoretic explanation for each of these phenomena by means of three deferral-permitting models of decision-making that are driven by preference incompleteness, undesirability and complexity constraints, respectively. These models feature rational choice deferral in the sense that whenever the individual does not defer, he chooses a most preferred feasible option. Active choices are therefore always consistent with the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference. The three models suggest novel ways in which observable data can be used to recover preferences as well as their indecisiveness, desirability and complexity components or thresholds.","[Gerasimou, Georgios] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Gerasimou, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AR, Fife, Scotland.",gg26@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Gerasimou, Georgios/0000-0003-3712-3154",,,,,78,19,24,4,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

When consumers value cognitive consistency between the news they read and the policies they support, politicians are induced to propose more polarized policies to conform to a polarized media landscape. A stronger commercial motive or a weaker preference for editorial neutrality in the media exacerbates this effect and causes party policies to become more extreme. We find that prices for news products are higher when consumers have a demand for cognitive consistency, despite the fact that maximal product differentiation does not hold for media firms.

In this study, rather than considering default as a binary variable, we dissect delinquency states further to investigate default behavior in greater detail. As such, we define three states no delinquency, delinquency and serious delinquency and estimate the probabilities of the transitions between states using extensive panel data from Korea, covering a wide range of behavioral information. Our findings have several economic implications. First, the factors that affect delinquency risk can differ from those that affect the transition from delinquency to serious delinquency. Second, the recent increase in the number of seriously delinquent accounts can be attributed to changes in the borrower age distribution. Third, macroeconomic conditions, especially differences in gross domestic product and consumption growth, have led to the recent increase in delinquent accounts. Fourth, the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio has a profound effect on transitions between delinquency states and thus affects both recovery and delinquency. Furthermore, this result is robust to controls for demographic and macroeconomic factors.","[Kim, Hyeongjun] Korea Asset Management Corp KAMCO, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Hoon] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea; [Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887; Cho, Hoon/0000-0003-2322-320X; Kim, Hyeongjun/0000-0003-0386-005X",,,,,27,18,19,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

This raises an important question: how strongly can media affect public perceptions? This paper uses a natural experiment - the staggered introduction of the Digital TV signal in Italy - to measure the effect of media persuasion on the perceptions individuals hold. We focus on crime perceptions and, combining channel-specific viewership and content data, we show that the reduced exposure to channels characterized by high levels of crime reporting decreases individual concerns about crime. The effect is driven by individuals aged 50 and over, who turn out to be more exposed to television while using other sources of information less frequently. Finally, we provide evidence about the effect of the digital introduction on public policies closely related to crime perceptions and on voting behaviour. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The essay mentions the pamphlet work of the Union for Radical Political Economics' various public engagement projects of the early 1970s but at its heart is the 1974 founding of the mass distribution monthly Dollars & Sense. It looks at the positions taken by the periodical over the years and asks, What kind of print object was it? It places the publication within a twentieth century history of left political economy periodicals and compares it with its closest contemporaries in the cultures of print of the American Left, notably Monthly Review and Radical America. The attention to the print ventures of radical economics in the 1970s is a contribution to a new kind of historiography that takes an expanded and extra-curricular outlook of economics.","[Mata, Tiago] UCL, Dept Sci & Technol Studies, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Mata, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",t.mata@ucl.ac.uk,"Mata, Tiago/A-3850-2010","Mata, Tiago/0000-0002-6423-299X",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [283754]; European Research Council (ERC) [283754] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author acknowledges and thanks financial support of the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), grant agreement n degrees 283754, Economics in the Public Sphere.",,47,5,5,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

However, a tariff and the exporter's emission tax are likely substitutes, which would undermine the rationale for these trade measures. This paper examines incentives to regulate the climate under border carbon adjustment (BCA), defined as an import duty of a magnitude determined by the difference in emission taxes between trade partners. Unlike a tariff, a BCA can induce the exporter to adopt a higher tax, suggesting that the BCA and tariff are not equally effective at targeting global emission levels and that the features of the border measure matter in assessing the effectiveness of trade policy in targeting global emissions.","[Sanctuary, Mark] Stockholm Sch Econ, POB 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Sanctuary, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Sch Econ, POB 6501, S-11383 Stockholm, Sweden.",mark.sanctuary@hhs.se,,"Sanctuary, Mark/0000-0002-4199-2400","Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse [W2014-427:1]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research, ENTWINED","Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research, ENTWINED","Jan Wallanders och Tom Hedelius Stiftelse samt Tore Browaldhs Stiftelse, Grant/Award No. W2014-427:1; The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research, Grant name: ENTWINED.",,26,10,10,5,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The results are twofold: (i) when these features are combined, neither shocks that drive most of land-price fluctuations nor investment shocks are the primary source of U.S. business cycles; and (ii) technology shocks play an important role in business cycles.","[Shirota, Toyoichiro] Hokkaido Univ, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan",Hokkaido University,"Shirota, T (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan.",toyoichiro.shirota@econ.hokudai.ac.jp,"Shirota, Toyoichiro/Q-4955-2019",,JSPS KAKENHI [JP16H06587],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to David Vanhoose (the editor), anonymous referees, and participants of the Asian Meeting of the Econometric Society in Hong Kong, Yonsei-Hokudai Joint Workshop, and Modem Economics Workshop at Hokkaido University for comments and suggestions.

Using only readily available bilateral trade data we show how to leverage variation in prices and quantities across multiple markets in order to consistently estimate heterogeneous elasticities. Our elasticity estimates follow intuitive patterns of importer and exporter market power and produce believable distributions and magnitudes. To highlight the flexibility of the estimator, we extend the cornerstone theories of non-cooperative optimal trade policy to a setting where exporters have heterogeneous supply elasticities. Applying our estimates to trade and tariff data worldwide, we show that heterogeneous export supply elasticities provide new avenues for identification. We demonstrate statistically positive and persistent links between non-cooperative optimal tariffs and applied tariffs worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, we analyze the effect of trade costs in shaping the topological structure of the network. It emerges that the relative presence of simple trade configurations increases with distance, while the relative presence of more complex trade configurations decreases with distance. Finally, we discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these empirical facts through a simple new economic geography model with three regions.

We use a structural model and the industrial level data to test the hypothesis that whether the centralized slaughtering policy creates market power. The results detect sizable and significant market power (about 0.5% price margin) for the slaughtering industry in the pork supply chain, mainly due to high barriers of entry and stringent license regulations which reduce competition in the market. The total profit markup for the slaughtering industry reaches 1.85 billion Yuan just in 2016.

First, we provide new evidence that increasing police presence is effective in crime prevention. Our difference-in-differences estimates suggest that the FQTF, which increased police visibility in the French Quarter, reduced robberies, aggravated assaults, and thefts by 37.4%, 16.9%, and 13%, respectively. Second, our findings imply that the proper use of monitoring and incentive strategies has the potential to further improve police services.

We develop a framework for modelling heterogeneity across firms in terms of (i) product market power (price-cost markups), (ii) labor market imperfections (workers' bargaining power during worker-firm negotiations or a firm's degree of wage-setting power) and (iii) revenue productivity. We apply this framework to analyze whether the pricing behavior of firms in product and labor markets differs across firms that engage in different forms of internationalization using an unbalanced panel of 7,458 manufacturing firms over the period 1994-2012 in Japan. Engagement in international activities is found to matter for determining not only the type of imperfections in product and labor markets but also the degree of imperfections. Clear differences in behavior between firms that serve the foreign market either through exporting or through FDI are observed. Exporters are more likely to be characterized by imperfect competition in the product market whereas the opposite holds for multinationals. Exporters are more likely to share rents based on the bargaining power of workers whereas a firm's wage-setting power seems to generate wage dispersion across firms with foreign subsidiaries.","[Dobbelaere, Sabien] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Dobbelaere, Sabien] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kiyota, Kozo] Keio Univ, Keio Econ Observ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kiyota, Kozo] RIETI, Tokyo, Japan",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Keio University,"Dobbelaere, S (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Dobbelaere, S (通讯作者)，Inst Labor Econ IZA, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",sabien.dobbelaere@vu.nl,,"Dobbelaere, Sabien/0000-0001-9521-4893; Kiyota, Kozo/0000-0001-7649-9870","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [JP16H02018, JP18H03637]; MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","We gratefully acknowledge the insightful comments and suggestions by the Editor and two anonymous referees.

We analyze the implications of hysteresis for fiscal policy in a DSGE model. We assume a simple learning-by-doing mechanism where demand-driven changes in employment can affect the level of productivity permanently, leading to hysteresis in output. We show that the fiscal output multiplier is much larger in the presence of hysteresis and that the welfare multiplier of fiscal policy-the consumption equivalent change in welfare for one dollar change in public spending-is positive (negative) in the presence (absence) of hysteresis. The main benefit of accommodative fiscal policy in the presence of hysteresis is to diminish the damage of a recession to the long-term level of productivity and, thus, output. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Performance tends to deteriorate as extensions are introduced: production budgets rise, advertising expenditures remain similar, and the number of opening-weekend theaters experiences a jump with the first sequel and then remains similar in subsequent installments. However, revenue, return-on-investment (ROI) and audience and critical reviews fall, and foreign performance becomes increasingly important. Offsetting deteriorating performance, risk falls: revenue and ROI become more predictable. An early change in the lead actor causes reduced performance, but changes in key product characteristics and inputs in later installments help prolong the franchise. ROI of the current installment is the most critical financial determinant of whether a further extension will occur, but high-budget films and those with higher domestic share of revenue are also more likely to yield further extensions.","[Filson, Darren] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Bauer Ctr 325,500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Havlicek, James H.] NBCUniversal Media LLC, 10 Universal City Plaza,Bldg 1440,34th Floor, Universal City, CA 91608 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College,"Filson, D (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Bauer Ctr 325,500 E Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",dfilson@cmc.edu; Havlicek.James@gmail.com,,,Lowe Institute of Political Economy; Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Claremont McKenna College,Lowe Institute of Political Economy; Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Claremont McKenna College,"Filson thanks the Lowe Institute of Political Economy and the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Claremont McKenna College for financial support.

We contribute to the investigation of the gender question by examining the relationship between the gender of the CEO and corporate board structures. We propose that gender-based behavioral differences between males and females may lead to differences in a firm's board structure. We find evidence that female CEOs are associated with smaller boards that are more independent, more gender diversified, have a lower ratio of inside to outside directors, a broader director network, and younger directors. We also combine these individual board characteristics to capture the overall monitoring potential of the board. Our findings are consistent with the notion that boards of female CEOs are structured for more monitoring. The results are robust to using a propensity score matching sample, a sample of firms that experience a male-to-female or a male-to-male CEO transition, and to controlling for endogenous matching between firms and CEOs. Overall, our results suggest that differences in board structures between firms led by male versus female CEOs can at least be partially explained by gender-based behavioral differences.

Labour productivity increases in our model after a positive news shock to TFP because of an increase in capital utilization.

The principal contribution of this paper is therefore to analyse energy demand for European industries over the period 1995-2009 using a dynamic multilevel model that accounts for this hierarchical data structure. Among other things, we find, firstly, that our dynamic multilevel model suggests that if industry income and the industry energy price increase by 10%, long run energy demand will increase by 8.1% and fall by 6.8%, respectively. Secondly, we find that the corresponding long run income and price elasticities are substantially larger in a standard dynamic model of industry level energy demand which does not account for the hierarchical data structure. Our results therefore suggest that not accounting for the hierarchical data structure results in unreliable estimates of energy demand elasticities. From a policy perspective we argue that it is imperative that future industry level energy demand studies account for the hierarchical structure of the data. This is to prevent energy policy making being based on industry level evidence that substantially inflates the responsiveness of long run energy demand to income and price changes.

From a theoretical point of view, the levels of risk aversion detected in the choice list involving certainty can be accounted for by prospect theory through reference dependence activated by salient outcomes.","[Vieider, Ferdinand M.] Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6UU, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Vieider, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Dept Econ, Whiteknights Campus, Reading RG6 6UU, Berks, England.",f.vieider@reading.ac.uk,,,German Science Foundation (DFG) [VI 692/1-1],German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Larry Samuelson, Coeditor.

To investigate whether this goal can be achieved through such optimization, the present study proposed a new economic-carbon emission-costs (ECC) multi-objective optimization model. Our findings show that the carbon emission peak will be achieved between 2025 and 2028, most likely in 2028, with 10.12 billion tonnes CO2. The peak of coal consumption was achieved in 2013 whereas the oil consumption cannot be peaked before 2035 in the GDP preference. In the process, China's GDP will be able to maintain an average annual growth rate of 5.9%-63% between 2017 and 2030, while the carbon emission average annual growth will be 0.5%-1.1%. The carbon intensity in 2030 can drop to 71.9% based on the 2005 level, which would exceed the committed reduction goal of carbon intensity equal to 60-65%. Furthermore, we find that the volume and time of the CO2 emission peak are not sensitive to renewable electricity price, but are sensitive to the assumptions both the minimum average annual growth rates of GDP and the average annual reduction rate of energy intensity.

Others were interested by the impact of migration on institutional reforms in migrants' countries of origin. Recent studies focus on how migrants affect social and informal institutions in the destination countries. This survey puts together these three strands of literature with three purposes. First, we offer a short definition and synthetic typology of institutions, which provide a guide to understand several studies we have critically reviewed. Second, our analysis is presented following the analytic framework exit, voice, and loyalty of Hirschman in order to highlight the brain gain phenomenon for developing countries, from an institutional point of view.

Taking the full non-linearities of labour income tax codes, including the tax treatment of married couples, into account is crucial for generating the low cross-country correlation between married men's and women's hours worked in the data, and for explaining the variation of married women's hours worked across European countries.","[Bick, Alexander] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Fuchs-Schundeln, Nicola] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, CFS, Frankfurt, Germany; [Fuchs-Schundeln, Nicola] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Goethe University Frankfurt; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Bick, A (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",,"Bick, Alexander G/A-9429-2012",,Cluster of Excellence Formation of Normative Orders at Goethe University; European Research Council [262116]; Fritz Thyssen Foundation; European Research Council (ERC) [262116] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Cluster of Excellence Formation of Normative Orders at Goethe University; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Fritz Thyssen Foundation; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We thank Domenico Ferraro, Berthold Herrendorf, Paul Klein, Dirk Krueger, Jose-Victor RiosRull, Richard Rogerson, Kjetil Storesletten, the editor and four anonymous referees, as well as numerous seminar and conference participants for helpful comments and suggestions.

To include a measure of the resource's transferability to other uses (e.g. other contests), expenditures are a convex combination of investment decisions and their 'bid' in the contest. It is shown in the symmetric equilibrium that participants use a mixed strategy for their resource investments and plan to exhaust those resources in the contest. Implications of an investment constraint on equilibrium strategies in a structured, tournament-style sequence of contests are also explored, where it is shown that increasing the number of contests in the tournament does not necessarily increase participants' investments in expectation.

This article departs from this assumption estimating a labour market equilibrium dynamic discrete choice model on U.S. micro-data for 1967-2007. Individuals adjust to immigration by changing education, participation, and/ or occupation. Adjustments are heterogeneous: 4.2-26.2% of prime-aged native males change their careers; of them, some switch to white-collar careers and increase education by about three years; others reduce labour market attachment and reduce education also by about three years. These adjustments mitigate initial effects on wages and inequality. Natives that are more similar to immigrants are the most affected on impact, but also have a larger margin to adjust and differentiate. Adjustments also produce a self-selection bias in the estimation of wage effects at the lower tail of the distribution, which the model corrects.","[Llull, Joan] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, MOVE, Barcelona, Spain; [Llull, Joan] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics,"Llull, J (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, MOVE, Barcelona, Spain.;Llull, J (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Llull, Joan/L-7692-2014",,"SEV-2015-0563 [263600]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-59056-JIN]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075, SEV-2015-0563]","SEV-2015-0563; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centers of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government)","I would like to thank the editor, Jerome Adda, and four anonymous referees for thoroughly reading the article and providing extremely valuable feedback.

The model reproduces labor-market dynamics under a productivity shock and/or a monetary shock. I can replicate the Beveridge and Phillips curves that are observed in the data, and do not need to rely on the New Keynesian model or real wage rigidity. I find that the nonexistence of an extensive margin and different money mechanisms, such as cash constraints on investment and money in the utility function, do not change the above replications.

The available evidence seems to indicate that this instrument can reduce the feedback loop between credit and house prices. In this paper, we show that these constraints on LTV ratios, used by Spanish banking regulators before the onset of the housing crisis of 2008, did not prevent that feedback loop. In the Spanish case, the fact that appraisal companies were mostly owned by banks led to a situation in which the LTV limits were used to generate appraisal values adjusted to the needs of the clients, rather than trying to appropriately represent the value of the property. This tendency towards over-appraisals produced important externalities in terms of a higher than otherwise demand for housing, and intensification of the feedback loop between credit and house prices.","[Montalvo, Jose G.] Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Montalvo, Jose G.] ICREA Acad, Barcelona, Spain; [Montalvo, Jose G.] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Montalvo, Jose G.] IVIE, Barcelona, Spain; [Raya, Josep M.] UPF, Dept Econ Empresa, Escola Super Ciencies Socials & Empresa, Tecnocampus, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA; Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University,"Montalvo, JG (通讯作者)，Pompeu Fabra Univ, Dept Econ, C Ramon Trias Fargas 25, Barcelona 08005, Spain.;Montalvo, JG (通讯作者)，ICREA Acad, Barcelona, Spain.;Montalvo, JG (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.;Montalvo, JG (通讯作者)，IVIE, Barcelona, Spain.",jose.garcia-montalvo@upf.edu,"Raya, Josep Maria/AAR-7073-2020; Montalvo, Jose G./D-6731-2013","Raya, Josep Maria/0000-0002-2885-234X; Montalvo, Jose G./0000-0003-4161-5055","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-78816R, ECO2014-55555P]; Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563]; Government of Catalonia (ICREA-Academia) [2014SGR-546]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in RD; Government of Catalonia (ICREA-Academia)(ICREA),"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [grants number ECO2016-78816R to J.R., ECO2014-55555P to J.G.M] and through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centres of Excellence in R&D [grant number SEV-2015-0563] and the Government of Catalonia (ICREA-Academia, 2014SGR-546).",,51,11,11,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We investigate these differences by focusing on the analysis methods used by these studies. Using various health indexes, numerous researchers have examined the effects of retirement on health. However, there are no unified views on the impact of retirement on various health indexes. Consequently, we show that the choice of analysis method is one of the key factors in explaining why the estimated results of the effect of retirement on health differ. Moreover, we re-estimate the effect of retirement on health by using a fixed analysis method controlling for individual heterogeneity and endogeneity of the retirement behavior. We analyze the effect of retirement on health parameters, such as cognitive function, self-report of health, activities of daily living (ADL), depression, and body mass index in eight countries. We find that the effects of retirement on self-report of health, depression, and ADL are positive in many of these countries.","[Nishimura, Yoshinori; Oikawa, Masato; Motegi, Hiroyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Nishimura, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",nishimura.yy@gmail.com,,"Oikawa, Masato/0000-0003-1405-1848","JSPS [15H05692]; National Institute on Aging [NIA U01AG009740]; European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812, SHARE-PREP: N211909, SHARE-LEAP: N227822, SHARE M4: N261982]; German Ministry of Education and Research; U.S. National Institute on Aging [U01 AG09740-13S2, P01_AG00 5842, P01_AG08291, P30_AG12815, R21_AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG_BSR06-11, OGHA_04-064$]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17J07578, 15H05692] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); U.S. National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for the valuable comments.

We use a novel neo-Schumpeterian agent-based simulation model to investigate emerging patterns of vertical governance for different levels of imitability and substitutability of capabilities. We find that, in the mature phase of the product life-cycle, firms generally prefer vertical specialization. However, in the early phase, imitability and substitutability, in interplay, determine the governance form preferred. High imitability frustrates appropriation and thereby discourages integration for synergistic advantages. However, firms need not vertically specialize: under low substitutability, incompatibilities reduce the advantages of specialization. When both substitutability and imitability are low, firms can appropriate the value of their inventions and there is no combinatorial advantage of specialization, so firms predominantly integrate. If substitutability is high and imitability is low, the combinatorial advantage of specialization balances with the synergistic advantage of integration.","[Vermeulen, B.; de Kok, A.

In particular, this is true for convex scoring rules (Cahan and Slinko, 2017). Here, we investigate non-convergent equilibria for the broad class of weakly concave scoring rules.

We draw on a dataset comprising 6603 Spanish municipalities with access to broadband services to examine the incumbent's (Telefnica) deployment of fiber in the period 2010-2013. We show that local loop unbundling competition had a strong positive impact on Telefnica's fiber deployment, while bitstream competition had a negative effect. Moreover, the incumbent was more likely to invest in municipalities with a large presence of cable operators. We also consider how the municipalities' sociodemographic characteristics affected the operator's deployment decision. While market size and population density had a positive effect on investment, the level of unemployment and the percentage of elderly population had a negative impact.","[Calzada, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Garcia-Marinoso, Begona; Ribe, Jordi; Rubio, Rafael; Suarez, David] Comis Nacl Mercados & Competencia, Dept Stat & Knowledge Management, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"García-Mariñoso, B (通讯作者)，Comis Nacl Mercados & Competencia, Dept Stat & Knowledge Management, Barcelona, Spain.",calzada@ub.edu; begona.garcia@cnmc.es,"Calzada, Joan/R-8242-2018","Calzada, Joan/0000-0002-2976-1677; Garcia-Marinoso, Begona/0000-0001-9932-9217",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-69193R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),We thank Mattia Nardotto and Lukasz Grzybowski for their valuable comments and suggestions.

To capture possible taboo trade-off aversion, we propose to extend the conventional linear in parameters logit model by including penalties for taboo trade-offs. Using this model, we then explore the presence (and size) of taboo trade-off aversion in a data set specifically collected for this purpose. Results, based on estimation of a variety of (Mixed) Logit models with and without taboo trade-off penalties, suggest that there is indeed a significant and sizeable taboo trade-off aversion underlying choice behaviour of respondents.","[Chorus, Caspar G.; Pudane, Baiba; Mouter, Niek] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Engn Syst & Serv, Transport & Logist Grp, Delft, Netherlands; [Campbell, Danny] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Dept Econ, Stirling, Scotland",Delft University of Technology; University of Stirling,"Chorus, CG (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Dept Engn Syst & Serv, Transport & Logist Grp, Delft, Netherlands.",c.g.chorus@tudelft.nl,"Chorus, Caspar/K-6667-2012; Campbell, Danny/E-1873-2011","Campbell, Danny/0000-0001-7467-2318",European Research Council (ERC) [BEHAVE - 724431],European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The first author wishes to thank the European Research Council for financial support (ERC Consolidator grant BEHAVE - 724431).

A qualitative heuristic is described using just trends; i.e. increasing, decreasing, constant. The trends are the least information intensive quantifiers. E.g. an unemployment is increasing more and more rapidly represents the positive first time derivative of the unemployment (increasing) and positive second derivative (more and more rapidly). It means that not just trends but higher derivatives can be incorporated into a model if they are qualitatively known. No quantitative quantifiers, e.g. numbers, fuzzy sets, are used in this paper. The solution of a qualitative model is a set S of scenarios. A set T of transitions among the set of scenarios S is used to generate an oriented graph H. Any future and past time behaviour of the system under study is described by a path within the graph H. A ten-dimensional macroeconomic serves as a case study. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicate that output-direction efficiency estimates yield counties producing inefficiently for both order-alpha and order-m estimators. After accounting for a variety of secondary environmental variables, unconditional efficiency estimates improve by anywhere between 7.5 and 10-percentage points. Results show that there is little correlation between the highly visible Robert-Woods-Johnson Foundation estimates with those derived here. We also find that counties are more efficient when they possess lower rates of obesity, unemployment, and preventable hospital readmissions. In addition, demographic variables do not play much of a role in explaining cross-county inefficiency. The analysis shows that the two stage DEA is inappropriate and violates several assumptions in comparison to the conditional order-m estimation.","[Gearhart, Richard S., III; Michieka, Nyakundi M.] Calif State Univ, Sch Business & Publ Adm, Dept Econ, 20 BDC,9001 Stockdale Highway, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA",California State University System; California State University Bakersfield,"Gearhart, RS (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ, Sch Business & Publ Adm, Dept Econ, 20 BDC,9001 Stockdale Highway, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",rgearhart1@csub.edu; nmichieka@csub.edu,,"Michieka, Nyakundi/0000-0002-8725-2774",,,,,42,19,20,1,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In the simulated mergers, the regional banks in each area were consolidated into one institution to obtain one bank per prefecture (administrative jurisdiction).

The analysis was performed on a sample of 26 ex-socialist countries from the former Eastern Bloc, during the post-socialist years. These countries had very similar characteristics when socialism collapsed, but very different experiences with transition afterwards, which makes them a suitable group for analysing the relationship between GDP and inequality. We focus on four factors that may shape this relationship labour market institutions, the market power of companies, social benefits and taxes.

Results show that the equilibrium market structure varies with the extent of negative intra-group network externalities. If the negative network externalities are substantial, that is, if an agent's disutility due to a larger sized market on his side is high (enough), then the profit-maximizing strategy for the matchmaker will be to match the highest types of one side with all of the agents on the other side. In that case, the matchmaker will charge a high entrance fee from the former side and allow free entrance to the agents of the latter side. However, if the network externalities are not substantial, then the matchmaker will maximize profits by matching an equal number of agents from each side.

Studying the case of Burkina Faso, we use hand-collected data from individual responses to a survey we designed and conducted between May and June 2014. Our main results show that, although it is not possible to detect any correlation between using mobile money and saving for predictable events, it seems to increase the propensity of individuals to save for health emergencies. We also found robust evidence suggestive that using mobile money increases the propensity of disadvantaged groups such as rural, female, less educated individuals and individuals with irregular income to save for health emergencies. In our further investigations, we address the mechanisms underlying individual saving behaviour. We found that safety and the possibility to transfer money within the sub-region associated with mobile money may be factors that increase the propensity of mobile money users to save for health emergencies. Overall, our results are in line with policymakers' agenda worldwide to increase financial out-reach and improve financial inclusion by using mobile technologies.","[Ky, Serge; Rugemintwari, Clovis; Sauviat, Alain] Univ Limoges, Lab Anal & Prospect Econ, 5 Rue Felix Eboue, F-87031 Limoges, France",Universite de Limoges,"Ky, S (通讯作者)，Univ Limoges, Lab Anal & Prospect Econ, 5 Rue Felix Eboue, F-87031 Limoges, France.",serge.ky@etu.unilim.fr,"Ky, Serge/GPX-1578-2022","Ky, Serge/0000-0002-0288-1759",,,,,53,36,36,3,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The paper characterizes conditions of coalition profitability and stability at both interior and corner equilibria. It is generally much harder to satisfy stability conditions than profitability conditions. A matching coalition is more profitable but less stable with a larger matching rate. Empirically there is no stable coalition but this can be overcome by introducing reputation mechanisms. There always exists a stable grand matching coalition if players value their reputation.

Moreover, the indirect i.e. the spillover effects are quite large suggesting that the growth models should account for spatial inter-dependencies. Precisely, we find that education expenditures in one country affect GDP growth in the neighbouring countries, meaning that these spillovers are geographical in nature. Moreover, we find that the degree of interdependence among countries varies according to the average GDP per capita even if their geographical distances are identical.

The results from our benchmark random-effects model show that cooperatives are significantly less productive, on average, than investor-owned firms, both at the aggregate level and for most of the industries considered. However, the results derived from a System-GMM approach, which is our preferred empirical strategy, are much less conclusive, and we cannot conclude that cooperatives are generally less efficient that investor-owned firms.

The relative importance of each of these margins depends on technology costs, fuel costs, and electricity demand growth. In this paper we explore how recent changes in actual and predicted technology costs for renewables, natural gas prices, and the rate of electricity demand growth have affected emissions from the electricity sector. We use a model to analyze how the sector would respond to a carbon tax with emphasis on the contributions of the four margins and compare with older analysis performed when technology and fuel cost projections were different. We find that a carbon tax induces a more prominent shift of generation from both coal and gas to renewables than from coal to both gas and renewables under the more recent technology and cost projections. We also show that contrary to findings from earlier analysis with higher assumed renewables costs, high natural gas prices enhance the effectiveness of CO2 taxes through greater substitution from gas to renewables. Carbon taxes are having a smaller impact on retail electricity prices in both absolute and percentage terms and thus on overall demand with the more recent projections. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the incidence and determinants of low levels of financial and total wealth using repeated cross-sections of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and a small longitudinal sample of HRS respondents observed both at age 65 and shortly before death. Most of those who report very low wealth holdings at the end of their life had little wealth at the traditional retirement age of 65. There is strong persistence over time in reports of very low wealth, and more generally relatively little evidence that wealth is drawn down in the first 15 years of retirement. The age specific probability of reporting low wealth increases slowly after age 65. Low lifetime earnings are strongly predictive of low wealth at retirement and at the end of life. The post-retirement onset of a major medical condition, and, for married women, the loss of their spouse, are both associated with small increases in the probability of reporting very low wealth, but they account for a small fraction of low-wealth outcomes. Low levels of wealth accumulation before age 65, rather than gaps in the safety net after 65 or rapid spend-down of accumulated assets, appear to be the primary determinant of low levels of wealth just before death.

J,"Ross, MT",,,,"Ross, Martin T.",,,The future of the electricity industry: Implications of trends and taxes,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate policy; Electricity generation; Carbon taxes,,"This analysis examines how changes in market trends and technology costs are likely to affect electricity generation in the United States in the context of possible future carbon taxes. The industry today is at a crossroads as older coal-fired plants retire and as nuclear plants begin to reach the end of their originally planned lives. At the same time, new and improved technologies for wind and solar generation are reshaping the industry, alongside dramatic increases in natural gas generation as the result of the shale-gas revolution. How these forces interact will depend on the specific paths that technologies for renewables and shale gas production take over the next couple of decades. The paper uses the detailed DIEM electricity-sector model to examine a wide range of sensitivity cases for technology and fuel costs under different economic conditions. Model results focus on the level of renewable penetration, natural gas generation and emissions, and what all of these factors may mean for CO2 emissions in the industry. The model finds that carbon taxes can be an effective way to quickly lower emissions. Shifts among natural gas and renewable generation can vary significantly, depending on capital and operating costs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this game, voters must infer the preferred policy of each candidate from the candidate's choice of whether to announce (truthfully) his preferred policy or to take no position. Bayesian voters would put high probability on a candidate having an extreme policy preference after observing him take no position, but cursed voters would not fully appreciate the informational content of the decision to take no position. Stated beliefs reveal substantial uncertainty about other players' strategies. Based on estimates of a structural model of cursed equilibrium allowing for heterogeneity in the degree of cursedness, 32% of choices between candidates are consistent with Bayesian updating, 32% imply no inferences about others' types after observing their actions, and the remainder indicate partial updating. Though the experiment also includes treatments with subjects in both roles, these estimates are based on interactions with programmed candidates, implying that uncertainty about others' rationality and strategic sophistication is not driving the result.

There is no change if costs and demand are given, unless the trade partner is a low-cost country. However, the scope for non-profit objectives is limited by the country's relative size if wages are market-clearing and if workers and firms are stationary, because of reduced competitiveness caused by higher real wage rates. The total surplus is then not affected by the actions of the SOE. International trade does not otherwise reduce the scope for its non-profit objectives if workers and firms are mobile, but productivity differences might require restrictions in order to avoid a complete relocation of the workforce in either country.","[Willner, Johan; Gronblom, Sonja; Kainu, Annina] Abo Akad Univ, Turku, Finland; [Flink, Johan] Stat & Res Aland, Mariehamn, Aland Islands, Finland",Abo Akademi University,"Willner, J (通讯作者)，Abo Akad Univ, Turku, Finland.",johan.willner@abo.fi,,,Society of Swedish Literature in Finland,Society of Swedish Literature in Finland,"Comments by participants in the XXXIX Kansantaloustieteen Paivat, Jyvaskyla, February 2017, and by Tom Bjorkroth, are gratefully acknowledged.

Our results are robust to alternative definitions of financial market development, cleaner energy, and controlling for the effect of government subsidy on cleaner energy. By supporting the demand-induced supply of cleaner energy, we demonstrate that the positive and significant effect of financial market development (FMD) on cleaner energy is stronger in countries with higher growth in carbon intensity and a lower availability of fossil fuels than otherwise. Our results also support the argument that financing uncertain projects such as those that produce cleaner energy should be greater in countries with a higher innovation culture than those where financial markets are already accustomed to undertaking.risky investments.

There exist a continuum of stationary equilibria, a continuum of endogenous credit cycles of any periodicity, and a continuum of sunspot equilibria, irrespective of the assumed trading mechanism. Equilibria featuring too-tight solvency constraints can generate growing credit limits over time, periodic credit shutdowns, and heterogeneous debt limits across ex-ante identical borrowers. Moreover, we provide examples of credit cycles that dominate, from a social welfare point of view, all equilibria with not-too-tight solvency constraints. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Using aggregated household surveys from 124 countries, we estimate the potential impacts of income growth and redistribution on poverty rates, as well as their actual contributions to poverty reduction over the period from 1981 to 2010. Our fractional response approach shows that the potential impacts are highly non-linear and differ across regions and time. This non-linearity and variation need to be taken into account if empirical estimates are to inform development policy. Although historically growth has played the main role in poverty reduction, we find that initial inequality is a strong moderator of the impact of growth. In fact, there has been a shift towards pro-poor growth around the turn of the millennium, both at the $2 and at the $1.25 a day poverty line. Nevertheless, our projections of poverty rates until 2030 show that the end of extreme poverty within a generation, as put forth in the Sustainable Development Goals, is unlikely to materialize.

We propose an analytically solvable multi-country model of endogenous selection in which dominant exporters, dominant products and dominant buyers emerge in parallel as multi-product sellers with heterogeneous technologies compete for buyers with heterogeneous needs. The model not only provides an explanation of the existence of dominant buyers but also makes specific predictions on how the relative importance of dominant buyers should vary across export destinations depending on their market size and accessibility.

To do so, I use sub-daily museum attendance and weather data to reveal a dynamic response to precipitation that would be obscured using day-level data. I find that the magnitudes and signs of the effects of rainfall vary significantly throughout the day. In some hours, the predicted increase in visitors is nearly three times larger than would be expected from estimates using daily measures. Many individuals appear to actively adjust their plans throughout the day in response to rain, while others' attendance depends upon prior weather forecasts of rain. Further analysis reveals that visit duration also increases during rainy periods, and visitors are more likely to attend pay-to-enter special exhibits. International visitors make up a greater share of total visitors during periods of observed precipitation. More broadly, this paper establishes the viability and value of working with widely available sub-daily rainfall data to uncover these dynamics.","[Cuffe, Harold E.] Victoria Univ Wellington, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Cuffe, HE (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",Harold.Cuffe@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,26,12,12,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

The tenure security improvement through demarcation induces a 23 to 43 percent shift toward long-term investment on treated parcels. We explore gender and parcel location as relevant dimensions of heterogeneity.

Based on household data from the China Family Panel Studies of 2012, the present paper quantifies the potential distortions in China's agricultural production and examines their underlying determinants across regions. The results reveal that there are different levels of distortions across regions. The Middle region is facing the greatest distortion. Increases in machinery input, the proportion of non-farm income and effective labor input will reduce distortions. Household saving, farmland rent and farmland size are significantly positively related to distortions. There is a complementary effect between labor and farmland in alleviating production inefficiency, but substitution effects exist between capital and farmland and also capital and labor. The increase in farmland size will aggravate the impact of capital on distortions. Given the constraint of super small-scale farmland, facilitating land transfer is a necessary precondition for improving allocative efficiency.","[Han, Hongyun] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Hanning] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Liange] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Han, HY (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hongyunhan@zju.edu.cn; 11320050@zju.edu.cn; hhyzlg@163.com,,"li, han ning/0000-0001-6990-5455",Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [14 ZDA070]; Key Project of Natural Science of Zhejiang Province [LZ14G30001]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Key Project of Natural Science of Zhejiang Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was supported by the Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 14 ZDA070), the Key Project of Natural Science of Zhejiang Province (No. LZ14G30001) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.",,50,16,16,2,76,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2018,26.0,3,,,,,22,42,,10.1111/cwe.12241,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF5AL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431976700002,0

Results indicate higher linear stock return predictability for the Hong Kong market than for the Chinese markets. However, the results differ when model instability is considered. Specifically, using Bai and Perron's (1998, 2003) approach, the results indicate the presence of structural breaks particularly for the Shenzhen market, which appear to coincide with major economic events or political and institutional changes. The predictable component in stock returns is also time-varying when re-estimating the model over different subsamples defined by the break. Overall, results highlight the importance of considering breaks in forecasting stock returns, and suggest that the Hong Kong market is a relatively ideal haven to park wealth for risk-averse investors whereas the Shenzhen market offers enhanced opportunities for risk-seeking investors.

The effort-maximizing prize allocation rule features a threshold. When the highest effort is above the threshold, all contestants with lower efforts receive negative prizes. These negative prizes are used to augment the prize to the contestant with the highest effort, which better incentivizes contestants with higher abilities. When no contestant's effort exceeds the threshold, all contestants equally split the initial budget (or a portion of it) to ensure their participation. We find that allowing negative prizes can increase the expected total effort dramatically. In particular, if no bound is imposed on negative prizes, the expected total effort can be arbitrarily close to the highest possible effort inducible when all contestants have the maximum ability with certainty. The above contest is shown to be the optimal mechanism for a more general class of mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, they are reminiscent of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) mechanism, even though the latter is not incentive compatible with interdependent valuations.

Small numbers are processed on a linear scale, while large numbers are processed on a logarithmic scale. In this paper, we show that financial analysts process small prices and large prices differently. When they are optimistic (pessimistic), analysts issue more optimistic (pessimistic) target prices for small price stocks than for large price stocks. Our results are robust when controlling for the usual risk factors such as size, book-to-market, momentum, profitability and investments. They are also robust when we control for firm and analyst characteristics, or for other biases such as the 52-week high bias, the preference for lottery-type stocks and positive skewness, and the analyst tendency to round numbers. Finally, we show that analysts become more optimistic after stock splits. Over-all, our results suggest that a deeply-rooted behavioral bias in number processing drives analysts' return expectations.

Our approach differs from theirs in that while we to seek to identify a causal relationship between democracy and development, we build our analysis around the qualitative accounts of regional specialists and the reasoning of political economists.

Export efficiency is defined as the ratio of actual exports to the maximum possible volume. In addition, the study investigates the impact of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and rules of origin on export efficiency, focusing on Vietnam's exports to its major trading partners during the period 1995-2013. The empirical results suggest that the volume of Vietnam's actual exports is far below the estimated efficient level, and that there is considerable room for increasing Vietnam's exports. Membership in ASEAN contributed positively to the country's trade efficiency while rules of origin and non-membership in EU and NAFTA had a negative impact. Those findings imply that Vietnam should enter more FTAs with trading partners and adopt lenient rules of origin in FTA negotiations; and that attracting export-oriented FDI and improving the mix of exports could enhance the country's trade efficiency substantially.

It declines when employment growth deteriorates and increases when employment growth improves, a benefit-expenditure-level-to-employment-growth relationship. This paper develops an RBC model to study the impact of this cyclical quasi-fixed labor cost on firms' employment decisions. I find that the cost increases employment volatility and delays employment adjustments when productivity shocks are small. The model reflects the sluggish employment recoveries of the post-1990 period, but not before that. It also generates data-matching volatility for employment and other business cycle variables.

Considering the different stages of development of the economies in the Asia region, the potential for growth to be spurred by further pursuit of comparative advantage is compelling.

Shifts in labor demand can be measured through changes in employment and earnings, the main labor market outcomes, or through changes in the population and income, more generally. These changes may spillover into the nonresource economy, leading to greater overall effects or possibly crowd out; be spread unequally across the population, thereby altering the distribution of income and the poverty rate; or influence educational attainment, as people choose between additional schooling and work. In this review, the literature linking natural resources to local labor markets is synthesized by organizing existing studies according to their resource measurement and the outcomes that they consider. This synthesis provides an accessible guide to a literature that has boomed in recent years. It also identifies promising avenues for future research and lays a foundation to further generalize the evidence through an eventual meta-analysis.","[Marchand, Joseph] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Weber, Jeremy] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",University of Alberta; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Marchand, J (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",joseph.marchand@ualberta.ca,"Marchand, Joseph/GSD-7311-2022","Marchand, Joseph/0000-0002-5894-320X",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The authors would like to recognize research funding, in the form of a Knowledge Synthesis Grant, received from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.",,89,49,53,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

But key person insurance is a double-edged sword because it has both positive and negative effects on a firm's performance. Different from prior papers, this study proposes to capture the two opposite effects of key person insurance by using a microeconomic analysis. The novel contribution of this paper is that besides risk-reducing effects of key person insurance, we find that key person insurance reduces the salaries of employees, output and excepted profit of the firm. More importantly, we illustrate that strong ability of the key person will promote the efficiency of employees.

If duopoly firms are symmetric, they do not provide enough safety to be socially efficient, and so imposing minimum safety standards can resolve this problem. We show, however, that imposing minimum safety standards may reduce the social welfare when there is a large asymmetry in the safety effort costs. In the unregulated equilibrium, the high-cost firm's safety effort is smaller than that of the low-cost firm, and the high-cost firm is more likely to provide a larger safety effort than is needed to have a socially efficient level with larger asymmetry in the safety effort costs. If safety standards raise the high-cost firm's safety effort, both firms' safety efforts may end up further away from the socially efficient level: the low-cost firm reduces its safety effort when the rival's effort increases because safety efforts are strategic substitutes.","[Yun, Sungho] Hanyang Univ ERICA, Dept Econ, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Yun, S (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ ERICA, Dept Econ, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",uwyunsh@gmail.com,"yun, sungho/Q-9971-2019","Yun, Sungho/0000-0001-6380-9534",,,,,26,0,0,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

The authors investigate this issue in the context of a simplified Agent Based Model of the economy. Depending on the value of the parameters that describe the behaviour of agents (in particular inflation anticipations), they find a rich variety of behaviour at the macro-level. Without any active monetary policy, our ABM economy can be in a high inflation/high output state, or in a low inflation/low output state. Hyper-inflation, deflation and business cycles between coexisting states are also found. The authors then introduce a Central Bank with a Taylor rule-based inflation target, and study the resulting aggregate variables. The main result is that too-low inflation targets are in general detrimental to a CB-monitored economy. One symptom is a persistent under-realization of inflation, perhaps similar to the current macroeconomic situation. Higher inflation targets are found to improve both unemployment and negative interest rate episodes. The results are compared with the predictions of the standard DSGE model.","[Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe; Gualdi, Stanislao] CFM, 23 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France; [Tarzia, Marco] Univ Pierre & Marie Curie Paris 6, Lab Phys Theor Matiere Condensee, 4 Pl Jussieu,Tour 12, F-75252 Paris 05, France; [Zamponi, Francesco] UPMC Univ Paris 06, PSL Res Univ, Sorbonne Univ, Lab Phys Theor,Dept Phys,Ecole Normale Super,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bouchaud, JP (通讯作者)，CFM, 23 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France.",Philippe.Bouchaud@cfm.fr,"Zamponi, Francesco/B-4386-2008","Zamponi, Francesco/0000-0001-9260-1951",,,,,46,3,3,0,13,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 19,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201815,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-15,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB0AA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428703700001,0

This paper analyses the potential drivers of the differences in domestically generated value added in exported goods between 'new' (CEE-10) and 'old' (EU-15) countries. The analysis focuses on the role played by intangible investments, human capital and foreign direct investment. By studying export performance at the industry level for the period 2000-2011, this paper finds that differences in the share of domestically generated value added depend on investments in intangible capital, in particular investments in research and development. CEE-10 countries suffer from a distinct lack of investments in intangible capital, which is currently only sufficient to enable their mere participation in global value chains. Further, inward F.D.I. causes a reduction in demand for domestic inputs for both groups of countries and hence lowers D.V.A. in exports, while CEE-10 countries are also found to be upgrading global value chains by undertaking outward F.D.I.","[Vrh, Natasa] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Vrh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",natasa.vrh@ef.uni-lj.si,"liping, sun/AAW-1808-2021","liping, sun/0000-0002-4711-3518; , Natasa/0000-0001-9972-1219",Slovenian Research Agency [36385],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),This work was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency [grant number 36385].,,48,28,27,2,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We find that the Reform increases the enrollment rate of all ages but decreases the offending rate of 14-year-olds only, who are the age group explicitly targeted by the Reform. The effect mainly comes from natives males, while females and immigrants are not affected. The Reform does not induce crime displacement in times of the year or of the day when the school is not in session, but it increases violent crimes at school. By using measures of enrollment and crime, as well as data at the aggregate and individual level, this article shows that compulsory education reforms have a crime-reducing effect induced by incapacitation but may also lead to an increase of crimes in school facilities plausibly due to a higher concentration of students.

We demonstrate that in a small open economy with a high level of debt, a small increase in the risk premium of the interest rate leads to a substantial contraction in output and negative welfare effects. We then quantify the effects of reducing the debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio using a wide range of fiscal austerity measures. Our results indicate trade-offs between short-run contractions and long-run expansions in aggregate output. In the short run, spending-based austerity reforms are worse than tax-based reforms in terms of lost income. However, in the long run, spending-based reforms produce higher output than tax-based reforms. In addition, welfare effects vary significantly across generations, skill groups, and working sectors. The current old and middle-aged generations experience welfare losses, whereas future generations are beneficiaries of the reforms.","[Glomm, Gerhard] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Jung, Juergen] Towson Univ, Towson, MD USA; [Tran, Chung] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University System of Maryland; Towson University; Australian National University,"Glomm, G (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",gglomm@indiana.edu,,"Tran, Chung/0000-0001-8252-469X; Jung, Juergen/0000-0003-3791-6293",Towson University Research Fellowship Program; ANU Research Grant,Towson University Research Fellowship Program; ANU Research Grant,"We appreciate comments from participants in the Australasian Macroeconomics Workshop 2012, the Midwest Macroeconomics Meeting 2012, and the 18th International Conference of Computing in Economics and Finance 2012, and from two anonymous referees.

Absent macroprudential policies, the optimal monetary policy leans against asset prices and can be closely approximated, using a speed-limit rule that responds to the growth of financial variables. An endogenous feedback loop is crucial for this result: price stability is otherwise quasi-optimal. Similarly, a simple macroprudential rule that links reserve requirements to credit growth dampens the endogenous feedback loop and leads to near price stability.

Exogenous shocks to the network's sharing constraints address the simultaneity problem. In theory, private-network activity could crowd out sales by building aggregate file sharing capacity or increase sales through word of mouth. I find evidence that private-network sharing results in decreased album sales for top-tier artists, though the economic impact is quite modest. However, private-network activity seems to help mid-tier artists. The results are consistent with claims that word of mouth is stronger for lesser-known artists and that digital sales are more vulnerable to increases in file sharing capacity. I discuss policy implications and alternatives to costly legal efforts to shut down private file sharing networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence that an increased share of mortgage lending is positive for financial stability, specifically by lowering the probability of default by financial institutions and reducing the non-performing loan ratio, at least in non-crisis periods, for levels of mortgage shares up to 23-65%. For higher levels of mortgage lending shares, there is some evidence that the impact on financial stability turns negative. We also find that the share of mortgage lending can be a useful measure of both financial development and financial inclusion. This finding most likely reflects the effect of a higher share of mortgage lending in diversifying the mix of banks' assets and thereby reducing overall risk. However, if the share of mortgage lending is too high, then the diversification effect diminishes. Therefore, the challenge is to balance the expected improvement in financial stability due to asset diversification against negative impacts that might result from easier lending standards or too rapid increases in mortgage lending that could trigger a bubble in the housing market. This highlights the need for prudent monetary policy and macroprudential policy measures to forestall the development of such bubbles.","[Morgan, Peter J.; Zhang, Yan] Asia Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F 3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan",,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Asia Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F 3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan.",pmorgan@adbi.org; yanzhang@adbi.org,,,,,,,29,2,2,2,15,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Reforming energy subsidies thus requires overcoming a policy commitment problem. In this paper we show that, even when commitment is feasible, it may fail to materialize in a political equilibrium due to politicians' re-election incentives.

In this paper, we focus on understanding the design and implementation challenges of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions that are aimed at a more efficient sharing of aggregate risk between borrowers and lenders. Using a simple framework that builds on the mortgage design literature, we illustrate that ex ante-designed, automatically indexed mortgages and policies can facilitate a quick implementation of debt relief during a crisis. However, the welfare benefits of such solutions are substantially reduced if there are errors in understanding the underlying structure of income and housing risk and their relation to the indexes on which these solutions are based. Empirical evidence reveals significant spatial heterogeneity and the time-varying nature of the distribution of economic conditions, which pose a significant challenge to the effective ex ante design of such solutions. The design of ex post debt relief policies can be more easily fine-tuned to the specific realization of economic risk. However, the presence of various implementation frictions and their spatial heterogeneity can significantly hamper their effectiveness. Consequently, we argue that effective mortgage market design will likely involve a combination of ex ante and ex post debt relief solutions, with state contingencies. We conclude by discussing the potential gains-which can be large, given significant regional heterogeneity-from tying mortgage terms and policies to local indicators, as well as mechanisms that may alleviate the adverse effects of ex post implementation frictions.","[Piskorski, Tomasz] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Seru, Amit] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Columbia University; Stanford University,"Piskorski, T (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1628895] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,83,23,24,0,2,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

While previous work predominantly focused on developing alternative axiomatizations, in this article we propose a novel approach which centers around the coalition formation process and the underlying probability distribution from which a suitable axiomatization naturally follows. Specifically, we view coalition formation in games with externalities as a discrete-time stochastic process. We focus, in particular, on the Chinese Restaurant Process - a well-known stochastic process from probability theory. We show that reformulating Shapley's coalition formation process as the Chinese Restaurant Process yields in games with externalities a unique value with various desirable properties. We then generalize this result by proving that all values that satisfy the direct translation of Shapley's axioms to games with externalities can be obtained using our approach based on stochastic processes.

When the complementary goods are vertically differentiated, the firm that sells the superior one can commit to a more aggressive pricing strategy through bundling. In the presence of asymmetry in externalities between the two sides in the platform market, bundling may be profitable without foreclosing the rival when platforms implement cross subsidies from the high-externality side (developers) to the low-externality side (consumers). Bundling has a positive effect on welfare because it allows for better internalization of the indirect network effects and reduces the developer cost of multi-homing, but it also has a negative effect because some-consumers consume less-preferred components. Consequently, bundling is socially desirable when platforms are not too differentiated and the vertical differentiation between the complementary goods is high.","[Sun, Keke] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Sun, KK (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Escuela Adm, Santiago, Chile.",kekesun.kk@gmail.com,"Sun, Keke/AAB-1904-2020",,"Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Chile [Fondecyt 3170063]","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Chile","Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Chile, Grant Number: Fondecyt 3170063.",,15,8,9,6,63,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

The Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence in which the first 'n' moves is the exact mirror image of the next 'n' moves should theoretically terminate any advantage to any of the contestants in a sequential pair-wise contest. The tennis tiebreak sequence of serves is the closest to the Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence that one can find in real tournament settings. In a tiebreak between two players, A and B, the order of the first two serves (AB) is a mirror image of the next two serves (BA), such that the sequence of the first four serves is ABBA. Then, this sequence is repeated until one player wins the tiebreak. This sequence has been used not only in tennis, but also recently in the US TV presidential debates. In this study we analyse 1701 men's and 920 women's tiebreak games from top-tier tournaments between the years 2012 to 2015. Using several different strategies to disentangle the effect of serving first from the effect of selection, we find that, for both genders, serving first does not have any significant effect on the winning probabilities of the two players. Thus, it might be useful for other sports, and contests in general, to consider adopting the ABBA sequence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As some of males' essential traits for marriage are hardly observable, a high-quality male is motivated to signal. This paper applies a modified Spence signaling model to the marriage market and tests the theoretical implications with survey data from rural China. We find that houses are primary signals in marriage markets in China, which explains both the high homeownership and the large housing sizes. We find 1) marriageable males are twice as much likely to build a house five years before marriage than five years after, while females do not behave the same way, 2) housing size is reflective of males' unobservable characteristics, especially in villages with high interest rates. Males with more social connections, higher income rank and greater wealth build larger houses. And 3) a ten square-meter larger house reduces a male's probability of singlehood by 0.8% at the age of 30, and enables him to marry a wife 0.1 cm taller.","[Fang, Li] Univ Maryland, Urban & Reg Planning & Design, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Tian, Chuanhao] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Zhejiang University,"Tian, CH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",kfang@umd.edu; tch@zju.edu.cn,"chuanhao, tian/AAO-3490-2020","Fang, Li/0000-0003-1462-6357; Tian, chuanhao/0000-0003-0993-5606",National Natural Science Foundation of China [70973107]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17BJY224],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"The authors thank Marie Howland at University of Maryland, College Park, Ruixue Jia at University of California, San Diego, Sally Sargeson at Australian National University and Chaoyue Tian at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics for their suggestions.

This note makes a simple generalization of the singular rent model by introducing many agricultural processes. Hence the problem of choice of technique arises. With respect to singular rent alone, it is shown that there may exist more than one cost-minimizing technique even though joint production is set aside, and there may be no cost-minimizing technique even though all techniques are feasible. However, in the latter case, at least one system determining intensive rent is feasible and cost-minimizing.","[Huang, Biao] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Huang, BA (通讯作者)，59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",huangbiao@ruc.edu.cn,,,China Scholarship Council (CSC) [201206360131],China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"China Scholarship Council (CSC), Grant/Award Number: 201206360131",,13,0,0,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2018,69.0,1,,,,,109,124,,10.1111/meca.12171,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FR5HG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419096900007,0

The gap between P and MC reflects a firm's degree of market power, and the Lerner index (LI) is equal to the ratio of the gap to P. The salient feature of our model permits LI to be internally determined by the simultaneous equations model, which avoids obtaining negative estimates of the index. The joint probability density function of the composed errors can be derived in the context of copula methods. Our model is applied to study the competitive conditions of Taiwan's banking industry. Findings show that: (1) the quiet life hypothesis is rejected; (2) the relationship between financial innovation, measured by the technology gap ratio of Huang et al. (2014), and our LI is U-shaped, which is robust over different specifications; and (3) the nexus between innovation and competition is inverted-U shape and consistent with Aghion et al.

By exploiting a unique data set of disadvantaged Australians, we provide longitudinal evidence that a drop in life satisfaction tends to precede the use of illegal/street drugs. We also find that the abuse of alcohol, the daily use of cannabis and the weekly use of illegal/street drugs in the past 6 months relate to lower current levels of life satisfaction. This provides empirical support for the utility misprediction model. Further, we find that the decrease in life satisfaction following the consumption of illegal/street drugs persists 6 months to a year after use. In contrast, the consumption of cigarettes is unrelated to life satisfaction in the close past or the near future. Our results, though only illustrative, suggest that measures of individual's subjective wellbeing should be examined together with data on revealed preferences when testing models of rational decision-making.

Residential users are major consumers that usually demand a significant amount of total gas supplied in distribution systems, especially, in the winter season. Natural gas is primarily used for space heating, and for cooking of food by residential users therefore, they should naturally be non-interruptible. Due to the fact that distribution systems have a limited capacity for the gas supply, proper planning and forecasting in high seasons and during the whole year have become critical and essential. This study is conducted for the responsibility area of Baskentgaz which is the LDC of Ankara. Predictive models MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) and CMARS (Conic Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) are formed for one-day ahead consumption of residential users. The models not only permit to compare both approaches, but they also analyze the effect of actual daily minimum and maximum temperatures versus the Heating Degree Day (HDD) equivalent of their average. Using the obtained one-day ahead models with daily data during 2009-2012, the daily consumption of each day in 2013 has been predicted and the results are compared with the existing methods Neural Network (NN) and Linear Regression (LR). The outcomes of this study present MARS and CMARS methods for the natural gas industry as two new competitive approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The authors estimate the impact of this threshold on employment by means of a regression discontinuity analysis. Because this threshold is known in advance, they investigate the presence of discontinuities in both the level and the slope of employment probabilities at different ages around the threshold. Their results indicate that turning 22 does not significantly change the employment probability. However, they find a significant change in the slope of the probability of being employed around one year before, suggesting a smooth deterioration of employment probability before turning 22 rather than a sudden change at a particular age. This finding is confirmed by a differencein-difference analysis. However, no such effect can be found during the period preceding the introduction of the NMW.","[Fidrmuc, Jan] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, IES, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fidrmuc, Jan] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Tena, J.

This article captures the impact of capacity constraints on quality and quantity competition of restaurant industry by employing a two-stage asymmetric capacity constraints model. There are several findings from this study. First, results of this study indicate that reputation difference increases total outputs and quality in equilibrium. Second, capacity constraints decrease the consumer surplus (CS) as well as social welfare (SW), but restaurants benefit from capacity constraints sometimes. Third, capacity reduces both the quality and quantity of the competitor. Furthermore, restaurants raise their prices if consumers are quality-sensitive or lower the quality if consumers are price-sensitive under capacity constraints. Fourth, this study compares the total quality, CS, and SW under four cases: no restaurant faces constraints, small restaurant faces constraints, big restaurant faces constraints, and both small and big restaurants face constraints. The total quality investment, CS, and SW are highest if a small restaurant faces capacity constraints while the larger one does not.","[Chen, You-hua; He, Qinying] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, You-hua; He, Qinying] South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Paudel, Krishna P.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Paudel, Krishna P.] LSU Agr Ctr, Baton Rouge, LA USA",South China Agricultural University; South China Agricultural University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"He, QY (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;He, QY (通讯作者)，South China Agr Univ, Guangdong Ctr Rural Econ Studies, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",heqy83@scau.edu.cn,"; Chen, You-hua/M-4136-2013","He, Qinying/0000-0003-1234-5690; Chen, You-hua/0000-0001-5697-9295","Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC [71401057, 71771057, 71573092]; Guangdong Social Science Foundation [GD13YLJ02]; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province [2014A070704008]; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance Industry; Collaborative Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province [2015WCXTD009]; key National Social Science Fund of PRC [14AJY020]; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71633002, 71333004]","Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS; National Natural Science Foundation of PRC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Social Science Foundation; Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province; Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance Industry; Collaborative Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province; key National Social Science Fund of PRC; Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work is partially supported by Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, GDUPS (2012) and National Natural Science Foundation of PRC (71401057, 71771057, 71573092), Guangdong Social Science Foundation (GD13YLJ02), The Soft Science Project of Guangdong Province (2014A070704008), Collaborative Innovation Center of Scientific Finance & Industry, and Innovative Group Foundation (Humanities and Social Sciences) for Higher Education of Guangdong Province (2015WCXTD009), the key National Social Science Fund of PRC (14AJY020), and the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (71633002; 71333004).",,38,13,14,5,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

When an editor wants to employ a new reporter with a different ideology, they have to negotiate the price of moving from their own ideology to the other's ideology. We focus on the job market for reporters, where the agents negotiate over the ideological position to be reported and wage. We adopt a spatial model in which each agent suffers a utility loss as the agreed-upon position moves away from his/her favored one. Equilibrium determines a threshold ideological gap for a match to be formed. Our analysis generates a natural separation between extreme, mildly extreme and moderate ideologies. Furthermore, we find that agents that hold extreme ideologies compromise less than moderates. This formulation may be applied to other situations in which agents involve monetary and non-monetary considerations, especially a preference for social proximity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In theory, one can expect intangible investments such as R&D to result in higher cash stocks than fixed investments, particularly because intangible capital is less suitable as collateral for obtaining external funds. The relationship can be expected to be particularly strong in innovative countries. These countries carry out a relatively high proportion of cutting-edge R&D, which tends to be particularly risky and may be associated with substantial gestation lags before becoming productive. These features tend to increase firms' precautionary cash holdings. To investigate this issue in a European context, we examine different groups of countries that are clustered based on differences in their innovative capacity. Our estimation results confirm a positive relation between changes in R&D investment and changes in cash holdings, whereas changes in fixed investment do not appear to be related to changes in cash positions. The impact of changes in R&D on cash tends to be higher for country groups characterized by a high level of innovative capacity than for countries with moderate levels of innovative capacity. However, the differences across country groups are less pronounced than expected.","[Baldi, Guido; Bodmer, Andre] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Baldi, Guido] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10108 Berlin, Germany",University of Bern; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Baldi, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Schanzeneckstr 1, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Baldi, G (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, D-10108 Berlin, Germany.",guido.a.baldi@gmail.com,,,,,,,37,7,8,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

We try to fill this gap by studying whether variations in a firm's CSR rating affect systematic risk, firm value, and portfolio performance. First, our results show that an increase in firms' CSR efforts, as reflected by an increase in their CSR ratings, significantly reduces systematic risk. Second, a positive variation in CSR ratings significantly improves firm value. Finally, from a portfolio perspective, a strategy that consists of buying stocks that have experienced a CSR ratings increase and selling stocks that have experienced a CSR ratings decrease (or remain stable) leads to lower financial performance. Taken together, our findings provide new evidence and financial implications for firms and portfolio managers.","[Benlemlih, Mohammed] Univ Luxembourg, Ctr Res Econ & Management, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Benlemlih, Mohammed] PwC Luxembourg, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Jaballah, Jamil] Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Peillex, Jonathan] Leonard de Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, Paris, France; [Peillex, Jonathan] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, CRIISEA, 10 Placette Lafleur,BP 2716, F-80027 Amiens 1, France",University of Luxembourg; Grenoble Ecole Management; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV),"Peillex, J (通讯作者)，Leonard de Vinci Pole Univ, Res Ctr, Paris, France.;Peillex, J (通讯作者)，Univ Picardie Jules Verne, CRIISEA, 10 Placette Lafleur,BP 2716, F-80027 Amiens 1, France.",jonathan.peillex@devinci.fr,,"Peillex, Jonathan/0000-0002-0286-9522",,,,,38,19,21,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Additionally, the organizational support required to make these new incentive structures effective has led to a relevant restructuring in several areas at the State apparatus. In order to understand why it was feasible in Uruguay to deploy such a relevant and deep reform process in a short term, we apply the Institutional Economics perspective, describing the organizational transformations and explaining how political institutions and the political game affect the policymaking process and the policy outcomes. In doing so, we also analyze the role, the incentives and the relative power of the main actors. The reform process led to new incentive structures and institutions/organizations consistent with supporting the credibility of those new rules and it implies an ideological approach regarding the role of the State. Mitigating information asymmetries and the inequitable distribution of economic power demands a compensating role from the public sector. Since discretion is supersede by better defined and open access rules, elitist and clientelistic management of power is supplanted by a more transparent and democratic political and social environment.","[Bergara, Mario] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Bergara, Mario] Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Milnitsky, Sergio] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay","Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","Bergara, M (通讯作者)，Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, Montevideo, Uruguay.;Bergara, M (通讯作者)，Banco Cent Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay.",bergara@bcu.gub.uy; sergiomilnitsky@yahoo.com,,,,,,,50,0,0,0,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

CDD devolves control over the selection, implementation, and financial management of public goods to communities. Until recently, policy enthusiasm has outstripped the evidence. I synthesize findings from randomized controlled trials and find that CDD effectively delivers public goods and modest economic returns at low cost in difficult environments. There is little evidence, however, that CDD transforms local decision making or empowers the poor in any enduring way. Part of this failure may be because some constraints believed to be important-like insufficient social capital-appear not to bind. Others, like exclusive local institutions, are a problem, although not one that CDD remedies.

Based on a sample of 2,452 bonds issued by 78 European listed banks, for the period 2001-2015, we find evidence that the ability of banks to manage risk affects bond spreads: banks with more capable managers obtain a lower cost of debt. In particular our results show that bank bondholders are even more sensitive to RRE during the crisis period, for relatively poorly rated bonds, for unsecured/subordinated debt, and for long maturity debt. Our findings highlight that bondholders' monitoring of banks is effective and takes into account the efficiency of risk management during financial and economic downturns, but during sound periods bank bondholders should strengthen their monitoring of risk management.","[Casteuble, Cecile] Univ Rennes 1, CREM UMR CNRS, Rennes, France; [Nys, Emmanuelle; Rous, Philippe] Univ Limoges, LAPE, Limoges, France",Universite de Rennes; Universite de Limoges,"Casteuble, C (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, CREM UMR CNRS, Rennes, France.",cecile.casteuble@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,57,0,0,2,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on a large sample of Chinese manufacturing firms, we estimate firm-level markup using the wedge between output elasticities of intermediate input and its cost share in total revenue. Firm productivity is measured as revenue productivity and adjusted with the estimated markup. The results suggest that product innovation increases firm-level markup and revenue productivity. However, the effect of product innovation on the adjusted productivity is mostly negative or insignificant. The observed relationships also vary in response to market structures. Our results indicate that the positive impact of product innovation on revenue productivity is mainly driven by price-cost markup changes rather than physical productivity improvements. Our study suggests the widely observed positive relationship between product innovation and revenue productivity should be interpreted with caution.","[Dai, Xiaoyong] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Liwei] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; Dalian University of Technology,"Dai, XY (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",daixy87@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,19,20,5,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this framework, which generalizes the traditional Calvo model, inflation persistence is intrinsic, as it is micro-founded assuming that firms' pricing decisions depend on the time elapsed from the last price reset. We use a linear-quadratic approach to study the welfare effects and optimal policies. We disentangled two distortion sources showing how welfare falls in both the average of the probability of changing prices and its distribution among different firms. Described the underlying distortions of our setup, we analyze its normative implications for optimal inflation. The issues of uncertainty and robustness are also considered: By using robust control techniques, we, in fact, consider the consequences of implementing a wrong monetary rule due to a misinterpretation of sources of inflation inertia.","[Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni; Di Pietro, Marco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Di Bartolomeo, G (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",giovanni.dibartolomeo@uniroma1.it,"Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/K-3030-2015","Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/0000-0001-5016-8483",Sapienza University of Rome,Sapienza University of Rome,"The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees, Barbara Annichiarico, Guido Ascari, Efrem Castelnuovo, Bob Chirinko, Giuseppe Ferrero, Peter McAdam, Salvatore Nistico, Ricardo Reis, Lorenza Rossi, Massimiliano Tancioni, Patrizio Tirelli, and seminar participants at the Universities of Rome (Sapienza CMC conference), Crete, Manchester, Mannheim (ZEW conference), and Tor Vergata for useful comments on earlier drafts.

The minimum wage has contributed to lower wage inequality and this has particularly benefitted low-wage segments of the labour market such as women and the elderly.

The paper is devoted to the analysis of some specific situations in which these behaviors occur and biform game models can be used. The sequential biform game is used in supply chains. In the non-cooperative part, a coordination mechanism based on a specific contract is applied between producers and customers. The cooperative part is merely focused on two concepts, coalition formations by resource capacity constraints and profit sharing. The second application is focused on co-opetition models. The players in the co-opetition model are the firm, customers, suppliers, competitors and complementors (competitors whose products add value). The relationship between the firm and the direct competitors is non-cooperative. The relationship between the firm and the complementors in a search for common added values is cooperative. The last example of a biform game application is an environmental subsidy negotiation where polluters behave in a cooperative way to obtain a subsidy from the authority for a joint action while competing with the distribution of this subsidy among themselves.","[Fiala, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Majovska, Renata] Univ Finance & Adm, Fac Econ Studies, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Fiala, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",pfiala@vse.cz; renata.majovska@mail.vsfs.cz,,,"Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097 DYME]; Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague [IGA F4/57/2017]; University of Finance and Administration, Prague [7429/2018/08]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague; University of Finance and Administration, Prague","This paper was written with the support of the Czech Science Foundation project No. P402/12/G097 DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics and by the grant No. IGA F4/57/2017, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.

In addition, more able multi-destination exporters can refocus on TBT-free markets and reorient their exports. By matching a database of TBT measures raised as concerns at the WTO (Specific Trade Concerns - STCs), with a firm-level panel of French exporters, we show the complex effects of restrictive TBT measures on the different margins of trade. We show that the negative effect of TBT on export participation is magnified for multi-destination firms, which can divert their exports towards TBT-free destinations. Moreover, we conduct aggregate level estimations to show that the effect of stringent TBTs in reducing export flows is magnified in more homogeneous sectors. Observing the shape of the firm distribution at sectoral level and the aggregate response of export to trade cost, we shed light on the fixed component of the additional cost imposed by TBTs on exporters.

However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own. Big urban data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar imagery data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services.","[Glaeser, Edward L.; Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Glaeser, Edward L.] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Glaeser, Edward L.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Ctr Math Sci & Applicat, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Ctr Res Computat & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Program Evolutionary Dynam, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Sch Business, Entrepreneurial Management, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Kominers, Scott Duke] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Luca, Michael] Harvard Sch Business, Negotiat Org & Markets, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Naik, Nikhil] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Glaeser, EL (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu; kominers@fas.harvard.edu; mluca@hbs.edu; nikdnaik@gmail.com,,"Kominers, Scott/0000-0002-7608-6619","Taubman Center for State and Local Government; National Science Foundation [CCF-1216095, SES-1459912]; Harvard Milton Fund; Ng Fund of the Harvard Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Working Group (HCEO) - Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); MIT Media Lab consortia",Taubman Center for State and Local Government; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Harvard Milton Fund; Ng Fund of the Harvard Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications; Human Capital and Economic Opportunity Working Group (HCEO) - Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET); MIT Media Lab consortia,"The authors would like to acknowledge helpful comments from Andy Caplin, William Kominers, Jonathan Smith, and Mitchell Weiss.

In terms of methodologies, it combines three novel features. First, it separates co-movement in monetary policies due to common shocks from spillovers of monetary policies from advanced to peripheral economies. Second, it uses revisions in growth and inflation and the Taylor rule to gauge desired changes in a country's interest rate if it is to focus exclusively on growth, inflation, and real exchange rate stability. Third, it proposes a specification that can work with the quantitative easing episodes when no changes in US interest rates are observed. In terms of empirical findings, we differ from the existing literature and document patterns of 2.5-lemma or something between a trilemma and a dilemma: without capital controls, a flexible exchange rate regime offers some monetary policy autonomy when the center country tightens its monetary policy, yet it fails to do so when the center country lowers its interest rate. Capital controls help to insulate periphery countries from monetary policy shocks from the center country even when the latter lowers its interest rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, we treat the growth of government expenditures on goods and services, financed by credit creation, as the exogenous growth rate driving the system. We examine the long-run convergence of the system toward such a growth rate, analyze the related debt dynamics, and deal with stability and income distribution issues.

The literature on determinants of trade, however, have largely focused on the sources of comparative advantage in determining aggregate trade flows rather than trade in intermediate goods. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of institutional quality and trade costs to explain the determinants of trade in intermediates. Design/methodology/approach The simple model is based on the model of comparative advantage in the gravity framework used by Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Chor (2010) to relate trade flows of intermediate goods to institutional parameters, factor endowments and geography. The empirical tests use a data set containing 172 countries and 17 industries spanning ten years. Findings The results confirm the theoretical prediction that a country with higher institutional quality has a comparative advantage in institution-intensive goods and trade costs have a negative effect on trade. The author further finds that these effects are stronger in share of trade in intermediate goods vis-a-vis final goods. Originality/value To highlight the distinct nature of trade in intermediate goods, the author separates industry trade flows as intermediate input trade and final goods (consumption goods) trade to compare the importance of different sources of comparative advantage among different types of trade flows. Unlike Eaton and Kortum (2002) and Chor (2010) who used cross-sectional data for final goods trade, the ten-year industry-level panel data are used to compare the relative importance of institutions and geography as determinants in trade in intermediate goods compared to final goods trade and capture the macroeconomic time variant factors as well as industry-country pair characteristics. A significant caveat in gravity regression is that an empirical finding may often be driven by omitted variables. Inclusion of a set of country variables such as GDP, production costs and institutional level may still allow omitted variables to bias the estimation. To avoid this problem, the author includes a fixed effect of exporter and importer as well as industry and year, instead of a set of country characteristics.","[Hyun, Hea-Jung] Kyung Hee Univ, Global Campus, Yongin, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Hyun, HJ (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Global Campus, Yongin, South Korea.",hjhyun@khu.ac.kr,"Hyun, Hea-Jung/AAF-7952-2021","Hyun, Hea-Jung/0000-0001-5132-445X",,,,,56,5,6,4,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We review 29 studies extracted from the EconLit and Web of Science databases with a total of 877 relevant estimates. We find that the government negatively affects company performance regardless of its administrative level. In contrast, private ownership is positively associated with firm performance. However, the effect size and statistical significance are notably varied among different types of private ownership. While the effect of insider (employee and management) ownership is comparable to that of foreign investors, the effect of domestic outsider investors is considerably smaller. Our assessment of publication selection bias reveals that the existing literature does not contain genuine evidence for a series of ownership types and, therefore, some of the findings have certain limitations.","[Iwasaki, Ichiro] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan; [Mizobata, Satoshi] Kyoto Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kyoto, Japan; [Muravyev, Alexander] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Dept Econ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Muravyev, Alexander] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany",Hitotsubashi University; Kyoto University; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Iwasaki, I (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Tokyo, Japan.",iiwasaki@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education and Sciences in Japan [26245034]; Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26245034] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education and Sciences in Japan; Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research work was financially supported by a grant-in-aid for scientific research from the Ministry of Education and Sciences in Japan (No. 26245034) and the Joint Usage and Research Center of the Institute of Economic Research, Kyoto University (FY 2015-16).",,69,11,13,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,3,,,,,290,333,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442036,0.0,,,44,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF8JM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432216800002,0

These mechanisms are able to incorporate the short-term deterioration and the long-term improvement of the trade balance-the definition of the J-curve. However, the drawback of the established cointegration and error correction frameworks is that they assume symmetry in the equilibrium adjustment process. Incidentally, studies which have used the linear frameworks have found little support for the J-curve. Since the adjustment process could be nonlinear, a fresh investigation of the J-curve using nonlinear approaches could provide competing evidence. This paper retested the J-curve by using quarterly data for South Africa and her key trade partners (China, Germany, India, Japan, the UK and the USA) and found the linear specification to support the J-curve phenomenon in only two cases (India and the USA) under relaxed conditions. In contrast, the nonlinear specification supported the J-curve phenomenon in all cases at no cost of serial correlation and functional misspecification. We also found the real exchange rate changes to have significant nonlinear effects on the South African trade balance.","[Iyke, Bernard Njindan] Deakin Univ, Dept Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Ho, Sin-Yu] Univ South Africa, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",Deakin University; University of South Africa,"Iyke, BN (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Dept Finance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",bnjindan@deakin.edu.au,"Ho, Sin-Yu/AAH-1637-2021","Ho, Sin-Yu/0000-0003-0032-1616",,,,,21,9,9,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The threshold regression model with the GJR-GARCH process was applied for examination in this study; we found that pharmaceutical companies' market capitalization returns could be boosted after exposure to extremely low temperatures for a period of time. Besides, the delayed effect of cold weather is demonstrated to exist. This phenomenon can be illustrated by epidemiological evidence-related mental factors, not by traditional behavioural finance. Moreover, lower weekly average temperatures are beneficial for investors to gain weekly pharmaceutical companies' market capitalization returns.

Seemingly, markets have been demanding more stocks instead of bonds. Yet, instead of observing higher bond rates, paradoxically, bond rates have been persistently negative after the Lehman-Brothers collapse. To explain this paradox, we suggest that, in the post-Lehman-Brothers period, investors changed their perceptions on disasters, thinking that disasters occur once every 30 years on average, instead of disasters occurring once every 60 years. In our asset-pricing calibration exercise, this rise in perceived market fragility alone can explain the drop in both bond rates and price-dividend ratios observed after the Lehman-Brothers collapse, which indicates that markets mostly demanded bonds instead of stocks.

We contribute to the existing literature by examining the effects of a non-linear response of firm location decisions to changes in the tax rate. We also show that there are large variations in the sensitivity to tax rates across sectors and firm size groups. In particular, financial sector firms are more than twice as sensitive to changes in corporation tax rates relative to other sectors. Our baseline result is a finding that a 1% increase in the statutory or policy rate of corporation tax would lead to a reduction in the conditional location probability of 0.68%. Using the effective average tax rate, the marginal effect implies a reduction in the location probability of 1.15% following a 1% increase in the tax rate. Although overall tax has the expected negative effect on location probability, the marginal effect of an increase is lower at higher rates of tax.","[Lawless, Martina; McCoy, Daire; Morgenroth, Edgar L.

Now MSM has been extended to intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) which can easily express the vague information. However, the operational rules of IFSs used in the extended MSM operator didn't consider the interaction between the membership function and non-membership function, so there are some weaknesses. In this paper, in order to combine the advantages of the MSM and interaction operational rules of IFSs, we propose the intuitionistic fuzzy interaction Maclaurin symmetric mean (IFIMSM) operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted interaction Maclaurin symmetric mean (IFWIMSM) operator, respectively. Furthermore, we research some desirable properties and some special cases of them. Further, we develop a new method to deal with some multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems under intuitionistic fuzzy environment based on these operators. Finally, an illustrative example is given to testify the availability of the developed method by comparing with the other existing methods.","[Liu, Peide; Liu, Weiqiao] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, PD (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",peide.liu@gmail.com,"Liu, Peide/D-3392-2013; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771140, 71471172]; Special Funds of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province [ts201511045]; Shandong Provincial Social Science Planning Project [17BGLJ04, 16CGLJ31, 16CKJJ27]; Key research and development program of Shandong Province [2016GNC110016]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Funds of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province; Shandong Provincial Social Science Planning Project; Key research and development program of Shandong Province,"This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71771140, 71471172), the Special Funds of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province (No. ts201511045), Shandong Provincial Social Science Planning Project (Nos. 17BGLJ04,16CGLJ31 and 16CKJJ27), and Key research and development program of Shandong Province (No. 2016GNC110016).",,56,16,16,1,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Design/methodology/approach The author studies a theory about court's intervention over an arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction by studying some scholarly writings and compares the revised provisions in the KAA (2016) with those in the KAA (2010) and the UNCITRAL Model Law (2006). Findings There is no clear and internationally unified answer to which theory between the prima facie test and the full review test is appropriate for court's intervention to arbitration. The analysis of the provision shows that the revised ones in the KAA (2016) will make arbitration to be conducted faster and more efficiently by giving practical answers to issues raised. Research limitations/implications It has been just over one year since the KAA (2016) became effective, so it limits evaluation on whether these revised provisions related to court's intervention over jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal is successful or not. Originality/value This study is comparatively new one after the KAA (2016) became effective. So, it is expected to provide a guidance for further studies.","[Park, Eunok] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Commerce & Trade, Jeonju, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University,"Park, E (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Commerce & Trade, Jeonju, South Korea.",juliejuly@empas.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,1,13,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We develop a simple model of a world consisting of a large number of countries, which derive utility from energy consumption. Countries suffer from global warming and local air pollution, both caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, and decide individually on investments in clean technologies for energy production. A supranational environmental authority decides for each country on the maximally permitted amount of greenhouse gas emissions. We demonstrate that the authority faces a dynamic inconsistency problem that leads to welfare losses, but these losses can be kept small if the authority is endowed with an optimally designed mandate. The optimal mandate penalizes the cost of local air pollution very heavily relative to the cost of global warming. However, delegation of climate policy faces a further difficulty, as countries have a recurrent incentive to change the authority's mandate over time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis rests on the key variables of the search model, which are probability of finding a job, separation rate and labour market tightness. The possible interlinkages are detected via multivariate GARCH models between the particular regional labour market and the whole economy. The results show that by no means can it be expected that there are any stable links between the markets.

I propose a model of occupational choice in which heterogeneous workers must rely on their social contacts to acquire job-vacancy information. While occupational segregation implies benefits in terms of job-finding probability, it also leads to allocative inefficiencies. Efficient and equilibrium outcomes differ due to a network externality that leads workers to segregate too little, and a pecuniary externality that leads workers to segregate too much. Which effect dominates depends on the elasticity of wages to changes in the degree of occupational segregation.","[Pothier, David] DIW Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Pothier, David] Univ Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Vienna,"Pothier, D (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, DE-10117 Berlin, Germany.;Pothier, D (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",dpothier@diw.de,,,French Ministry of Education and Research,French Ministry of Education and Research,"I wish to thank Piero Gottardi, Fernando Vega-Redondo, Jan Eeckhout, Claudio Michelacci, participants of the EUI Microeconomics Working Group and the DIW Public Economics Cluster Seminar, and two anonymous referees for useful comments and suggestions.

Employing the single-stage stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) model, the study uses a unique balanced panel data set comprising bank-level annual data from the dominant commercial banks in Bangladesh for the period 1983-2012. The results show that bank cost has fallen due to financial deregulation. Our results from the data envelopment analysis do not vary significantly that we obtained from the SFA. In addition, the presence of politically linked directors on the bank board has an adverse effect on efficiency.

Reconsidering the internal logic of private ownership rights, the paper argues that, first, the emergence of modern private ownership rights should be the subject of analysis rather than ownership rights per se. Second, at least for some latecomer countries, modern ownership rights typically emerge when feudalistic multi-layered proprietary rights over land are abolished and replaced by ownership rights for the purpose of ensuring tax revenue, prompted by pressure from and/or the intrusion of a colonial power, rather than as an efficient response to changes in resource prices. Third, the socio-economic aspect of ownership rights that related to the manner of social formation tended to be concealed in the universal aspect of private property rights that focuses on the materialistic relation between a person and a thing. These arguments urge the bringing of social relations into the basic layer of analysis of ownership rights theory, as the original institutional economists such as Ely and Commons considered.","[Sato, Hajime] Nanzan Univ, Fac Policy Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",,"Sato, H (通讯作者)，Nanzan Univ, Fac Policy Studies, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",,,,,,,,50,3,3,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Under bounded memory (only recent periods are observed), long memory still yields bad reputation due to an echo where bad signals cause future motorists to not hire, causing further lack of hiring, and so on. Short memory avoids bad reputation by making it useless, because consumers never learn enough information to change their decisions. No happy middle exists under bounded memory where consumers learn valuable information without tempting the mechanic into harmful signaling and thereby unraveling the market. By contrast, fading memory (past periods are randomly sampled with fading probabilities) achieves this happy middle by offering valuable information in a way that bounds the probabilities of these reputational echoes. Possible fading memory implementations (e.g., for review websites) are described and generalized to a broader class of games.","[Sperisen, Benjamin] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University,"Sperisen, B (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",bsperise@tulane.edu,,,,,,,25,3,3,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Therefore, we conclude that the twin deficit hypothesis is valid for Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia but not for the case of Poland, Croatia, Romania and Slovenia in the long-run. Finally, we also present evidence for the existence of asymmetric effects in this context.","[Turan, Taner; Karakas, Mesut] Gebze Tech Univ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Econ, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,"Turan, T (通讯作者)，Gebze Tech Univ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Econ, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey.",tturan@gtu.edu.tr; mesutkarakas@gmail.com,"Turan, Taner/T-1047-2018; Turan, Taner/AAM-1935-2021","TURAN, TANER/0000-0003-3012-340X",,,,,47,8,9,1,3,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The underlying health mechanism is that the recipients of modern heating do not need to rely on traditional fuels to heat their homes and thus suffer from less exposure to indoor air pollution. Furthermore, the improved quality of heating leads to health improvements. This article exploits spatial and time variation in the implementation of China's centralized heating program, utilizing a difference-in-difference framework. Spatial variation takes the form of a discrete geographical cut-off between regions that receive centralized home heating and those that do not. Results show that areas with centralized heating have a 0.13% decrease in perinatal deaths and a decrease of 1.17% in the proportion of low-birth-weight infants. This translates into about 7000 fewer deaths and about 60,000 fewer low-birth-weight infants each year. Hence, there are enormous health benefits to the public provision of modern heat as a substitute for traditional heating methods, which are shown to be injurious to early-life health. These results strongly suggest that policymakers in developing countries should consider promoting cleaner heating methods.","[Xue, Yuhan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Xue, YH (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",xuey@uww.edu,,,,,,,36,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using two widely known dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, we simulate a hypothetical financial crisis and examine how each model performs when the misspecification occurs in the credit channel. We demonstrate that monetary policy suggested by misspecified models tends to destabilize the economy during crisis, even though one of the two models does reasonably well in estimating policy-invariant model parameters. We also show that the opportunity cost of using a misspecified model is high relative to the outcome achieved under a correctly specified model, particularly when public financial intermediation is available in the correctly specified model. Introducing labor-related variables in either the monetary policy rule or stabilization objectives has the potential of improving policy outcomes in the misspecified credit channel model.","[Yagihashi, Takeshi] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, 2021 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Yagihashi, T (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, 2021 Constant Hall, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",tyagihas@odu.edu,"Yagihashi, Takeshi/AAF-1254-2020","Yagihashi, Takeshi/0000-0001-9916-6008",,,,,74,6,6,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The fund manager chooses the optimal effort to maximize the present value of total fees and reduce liquidation risks, trading off extra return benefits against the cost of the effort. We find that the manager's effort depends on the ratio between the fund's assets under management (AUM) and the high-water mark (HWM), and endogenous fund liquidation has key influence on the dynamics of the effort. Our calibration suggests that when the fund is close to liquidation, the manager exerts greatest effort. The more distant the fund value is from the liquidation boundary, the less effort the manager chooses to make; when the fund value is approaching the HWM, the manager's optimal effort still decreases, but the rate of decline becomes far slower. The optimal effort contributes to both increasing the likelihood of survival for the fund and preserving the fund's going-concern value. A growth of degree of the effort cost, volatility of the AUM, exogenous liquidation probability or endogenous liquidation boundary decreases the optimal effort. We also find empirical evidence that may support our theoretical conclusion.","[Zhao, Li] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wenli] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Financial Res, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ba, Shusong] Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd, Hong Kong 999077, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Huang, WL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Financial Res, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhaolimath@zju.edu.cn; wlhuangmath@126.com,"WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023",,"National Scholarship Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11571310, 71371168]; Chazen Institute of International Business at Columbia Business School [11571310]",National Scholarship Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chazen Institute of International Business at Columbia Business School,"We thank Xin Li, Ying Wang, Jiaqi Zhu, Shenghong Li, Neng Wang, Jinqiang Yang, Zhaojun Yang and seminar participants at Zhejiang University, University of Science and Technology of China, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Yongan Science and Technology Co., Ltd for helpful comments.

However, assigning a value to the flow of services from dwellings is problematic. Many households own the dwelling in which they live, making this value unobserved; others receive free housing or face prices lower than those at the market. Over the last decades, several estimation techniques have been proposed and implemented by practitioners to overcome this issue. This paper provides a review of methods commonly used to impute rent and discusses the relative advantages and disadvantages of each. We find no consensus on which imputation method is the most appropriate for welfare analysis, as well as a lack of evidence regarding the distributional impact of including rents in the welfare aggregate, particularly in developing countries. Moreover, practices for imputing rents vary across countries, calling for the future development of a unified framework.","[Balcazar, Carlos Felipe; Ceriani, Lidia; Olivieri, Sergio; Ranzani, Marco] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Olivieri, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",solivieri@worldbank.org,,"Balcazar, Carlos Felipe/0000-0002-6426-0843",,,,,95,10,11,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This paper studies whether the use of a competitive pricing mechanism reduces such wasteful activities. We report data from a laboratory experiment where a powerful buyer can trade with one of two sellers an environment that can lead to very low prices for the sellers. We find that low procurement prices trigger significantly less punishment by sellers if the buyer uses a competitive auction rather than his price-setting power to dictate the same terms of trade directly. Our data suggest that the use of competitive pricing mechanisms can mitigate inefficient reactions to unequal distributions of trade surplus. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the recently established result that under network effects the firm prefers sequential efficient bargaining may be reversed when there are social concerns. Thus, firm's social responsibility restores also in network industries the conventional result of the trade-union economics that the firm prefers right-to-manage (RTM). However, this may result rather paradoxical because RTM is always welfare-inferior and thus the higher the social responsibility is, the lower the social welfare outcome due to the agenda selection. As a consequence an increase of the firms' social concerns in network industries may reduce, through the channel of the unionised labour market, social welfare, in contrast with the common sense. This sheds some light on so far unexplored effects of the promotion of social responsibility activities by policy makers when also labour markets are taken into account.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via Cosimo Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, PI, Italy; [Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Jagellonska St 57-59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland",University of Pisa; Kozminski University,"Buccella, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Econ, Jagellonska St 57-59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",luciano.fanti@unipi.it; buccella@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,42,10,10,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

We show that for the period 2000-2012, inequality using personal income is substantively lower than inequality measured using Census Bureau money income, and the trends in both inequality and median income are different.

For prior cohorts, life-cycle employment had a hump shape; it increased from the twenties to the forties, hit a peak, and then declined starting in the fifties. The new life cycle of employment is initially high and flat, there is a dip in the middle, and a phasing out that is more prolonged than for previous cohorts. The hump is gone, the middle is a bit sagging, and the top has greatly expanded. We explore the increase in cumulative work experience for women from the 1930s to the 1970s birth cohorts using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the Health and Retirement Study. We investigate the changing labor force impact of a birth event across cohorts and by education, and also the impact of taking leave or quitting. We find greatly increased labor force experience across cohorts, far less time out after a birth, and greater labor force recovery for those who take paid or unpaid leave. Increased employment of women in their older ages is related to more continuous work experience across the life cycle.","[Goldin, Claudia] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goldin, Claudia] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mitchell, Joshua] US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Goldin, C (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Goldin, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cgoldin@harvard.edu; joshua.w.mitchell@census.gov,,,,,,,14,72,99,44,84,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We use this model to better understand how development of the financial sector affects misallocation and occupational choice. Our model demonstrates three channels through which enforcement of credit contracts are tied to misallocation. Improvements in enforcement shifts the risks in variance of output from banks toward entrepreneurs; consequently, improved enforcement can serve as a form of risk sharing in the absence of state contingent loans. Second, reduction in the risk for bankers improves the appeal of banking and the general equilibrium effect shrinks the margin of intermediation, reducing the importance of initial wealth distributions. Finally, improved enforcement leads to more relaxed credit constraints, as banks are willing to lend more to entrepreneurs, further reducing the importance of initial wealth in occupational choice.

The empirical analysis is based on a unique dataset of 10,200 retail broadband offers spanning the 2003-2011 period and including 23 EU member states. Results show that an increase in tariff diversity provides a significant impetus to broadband adoption, wherefore demands by several public interest groups to limit price discrimination in broadband markets should be viewed with some caution as reduced price discrimination may come at the cost of lower penetration rates.","[Lange, Mirjam R.

There is an uninformed principal, and uninformed intermediary, and an informed agent. Under delegation the principal chooses an interval of actions to delegate to the intermediary, and the intermediary chooses a sub-interval from that interval to delegate to the agent. Under communication, the agent communicates with the intermediary, after which the intermediary communicates with the principal. We characterize the equilibrium outcomes under delegation and communication. We show that under delegation the principal can appoint a more biased individual to be the intermediary, and a less biased individual to be the agent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the principal can prefer to communicate with the subordinates rather than delegate decision rights to them if the intermediary and the agent have opposing biased.","[Liang, Pinghan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Chinese Publ Adm Res, Sch Govt, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Liang, PH (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Chinese Publ Adm Res, Sch Govt, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",liangph5@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Liang, Pinghan/0000-0003-4741-3083",National Natural Science Foundation of China [457 71503208],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The author acknowledges the useful comments from the Associate Editor and two referees.

J,"Lu, D",,,,"Lu, Ding",,,China's Growth Slowdown and Prospects for Becoming a High-Income Developed Economy,ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"After decades of hyper growth, China's economy has slowed significantly in recent years, causing widespread anxiety both within and outside the country. Although economists have not reached a consensus about China's growth potential, it is undeniable that the country has switched gears toward a new normal of moderate growth amidst ongoing structural change. To assess China's growth performance and prospects, this study modifies Masahiko Aoki's analytical framework of a unified growth theory into a multi-sector model and applies it to identify the sources of China's per capita income growth in recent decades. The analysis confirms Aoki's early observation that China entered the so-called Kuznets phase of development in the 1980s, which then became overlapped by the H-phase, in which human capital-based growth is characterized by high labor productivity growth. This study provides evidence that China's labor productivity growth has been predominantly driven by fixed capital formation. It also reveals that the Kuznets effect (with its labor reallocation effect) has now passed its peak and is fading away. The most alarming finding is that net total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the latest period has slowed to a near halt. This trend is particularly worrisome given that China has exhausted its past demographic dividend and its industrial structure has evolved to the end of industrialization stage. Meanwhile, demographic projections clearly indicate that China has entered what Aoki defined as the development phase of post demographic transition. Whether China can reverse the downward trend of TFP growth will determine how soon it can achieve the goal of becoming a high-income developed economy.","[Lu, Ding] Univ Fraser Valley, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada; [Lu, Ding] Xian Int Univ, 18 Yudou Lu, Xian, Peoples R China",University of Fraser Valley,"Lu, D (通讯作者)，Univ Fraser Valley, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada.;Lu, D (通讯作者)，Xian Int Univ, 18 Yudou Lu, Xian, Peoples R China.",Ding.Lu@ufv.ca,,,,,,,48,9,9,0,123,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Using a fixed effects spatial Durbin model with data from Swedish municipalities during 2002-2012, I estimate the elasticity of the own relative to neighbors' average price to 0.14. This behavior can be explained in terms of an informal yardstick competition: when consumers use neighboring municipalities' prices as benchmarks for costs or as behaviorally based reference prices, policy makers will face the risk of consumer complaints and reduced voter support if deviating too much from neighboring municipalities' prices. Further, I find some evidence that price mimicking is more pronounced in municipalities where voter support for the ruling coalition is weak.","[Lundin, Erik] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Lundin, E (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.lundin@ifn.se,,"Lundin, Erik/0000-0003-4313-1951",Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [H13-0467]; Swedish Competition Authority,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation; Swedish Competition Authority,"I would like to thank Richard Friberg, Par Holmberg, two anonymous referees, and participants at the 2014 ENTER-Jamboree for valuable comments.

This pseudo tax creates an incentive for the country receiving the flow of immigrants to lower its emissions, offering an offset to the costs incurred as a result of climate change. I show that the long-run carbon stock, and the entire time path of production (and hence emissions), is smaller in the presence of migration.

Evidence shows the mandate increased insurance coverage among affected young adults and also increased premiums for family health insurance policies. In this paper, we investigate the use of dependent tax exemptions as a mechanism families could use to pay for increased costs associated with expanded coverage. Using data on households from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we use a difference-in-difference methodology comparing changes in the likelihood of being claimed as a dependent on a tax return for the 19-25 year olds affected by the coverage mandate compared to 16-18 year olds that were unaffected. We find a significant increase in dependent tax exemptions among 19-25 year olds following implementation of the dependent coverage mandate. Family income gains from switching an exemption from a young adult child to the parent would shift a substantial portion of young adult insurance coverage costs (ultimately medical costs) to other taxpayers. Though we point to family health insurance cost as a likely driver of the increased dependent tax exemptions, we cannot rule out a role for other outcomes also affected by the mandate, including labor market changes among 19-25 year olds. We further compare the overall social costs and benefits of the mandate and show that absent significant health improvement to date, welfare gains likely depend on the positive contribution of young adults to insurance pools in terms of lower average costs.","[Shane, Dan M.] N244 CPHB Univ Iowa, 145 Riverside Dr, Iowa City, IA 52240 USA; [Zimmer, David M.] Western Kentucky Univ, Grise Hall 426, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",Western Kentucky University,"Shane, DM (通讯作者)，N244 CPHB Univ Iowa, 145 Riverside Dr, Iowa City, IA 52240 USA.",dan-shane@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,20,3,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

We find that sons that live in urban Indian districts with a greater exposure to trade liberalization have a higher probability of being in a better occupation than their father. Taken together, our results allow us to make two new contributions to the literature on trade and inequality. First, we show that the same mechanism that causes greater cross-sectional inequality, higher relative demand for skill, also facilitates intergenerational occupational mobility. Second, we show that increased investment in education alone need not facilitate intergenerational occupational mobility. Instead, it only does so in urban districts where there has been a sufficient increase in the employment share of high-skill occupations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This reveals that there have been several changes in Euro-area policy making, with a strengthening of the anti-inflation stance in the early years of the ERM, which was then lost around the time of German reunification and only recovered following the turmoil in the ERM in 1992. The ECB does not appear to have been any more conservative as aggregate Euro-area policy was under Bundesbank leadership. The estimates also suggest that the most appropriate description of policy is that of discretion, with no evidence of commitment in the Euro-area. As a result, although both 'good luck' and 'good policy' played a role in the moderation of inflation and output volatility in the Euro-area, the welfare gains would have been substantially higher had policy makers been able to commit. Adopting a flexible price level target would lead to outcomes close to commitment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In a laboratory experiment, we use dictator games for five groups to compare actual transfers to in-group and out-group agents with the respective beliefs held by dictators and recipients in these groups. We observe both in-group favoritism and discrimination across multiple out-groups. Individuals expect others to be in-group biased, as well as to be treated differently by different out-groups. We find that dictators' in-group favoritism is positively related to the degree of in-group favoritism they expect other dictators to exhibit. Moreover, we find that a dictator tends to be relatively more generous toward a specific out-group when he or she expects that dictators belonging to that out-group are generous toward members of his or her in-group. Thus, our study provides evidence for indirect reciprocation expectation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The structural impulse responses indicate that the past history of realized shocks plays a crucial role in determining the dynamic effects of monetary policy on the yield curve.

We do so in the context of the Papal visit to Brazil in October 1991, in which persuasive messages related to fertility were salient in Papal speeches during the visit. We use individual's exposure to such messages to measure how persuasion shifts short-run beliefs such as intentions to contracept and long-term fertility outcomes such as the timing and total number of births. To measure the short-run causal impact of persuasion, we exploit the fact the Brazil 1991 DHS was fielded in the weeks before, during, and after the Papal visit. We use this fortuitous timing to identify that persuasion significantly reduced individual intentions to contracept by more than 40 percent relative to pre-visit levels, and increased the frequency of unprotected sex by 30 percent. We measure the long-run causal impacts of persuasion on fertility outcomes using later DHS surveys to conduct an event study analysis on births in a five-year window on either side of the 1991 Papal visit. Estimating a hazard model of fertility, we find a significant change in births 9 months post-visit, corresponding to a 1.6 percent increase in the aggregate birth cohort. Our final set of results examine the very long-run impact of persuasion and document the impacts to be on the timing of births rather than on total fertility.","[Bassi, Vittorio] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, 3620 South Vermont Ave,Kaprielian Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Rasul, Imran] UCL, Dept Econ, Drayton House,30 Gordon St, London WC1H 0AX, England; [Rasul, Imran] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of Southern California; University of London; University College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bassi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, 3620 South Vermont Ave,Kaprielian Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",vbassi@usc.edu; i.rasul@ucl.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,68,22,26,0,12,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7782,1945-7790,,AM ECON J-APPL ECON,Am.

Two hypotheses may explain such specialization, with different implications for welfare, inequality, and trade policy. Fajgelbaum et al. formalize the Linder hypothesis that home demand determines the pattern of specialization and, therefore, predict that high-income locations export high-quality products. The factor-proportions model also predicts that skill-abundant, high-income locations export skill-intensive, high-quality products. Prior empirical evidence does not separate these explanations. I develop a model that nests both hypotheses and employ microdata on U.S. manufacturing plants' shipments and factor inputs to quantify the two mechanisms' roles in quality specialization across U.S. cities. Home-market demand explains as much of the relationship between income and quality as differences in factor usage.","[Dingel, Jonathan I.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Dingel, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,Institute for Humane Studies; Kathryn and Grant Swick Faculty Research Fund at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,Institute for Humane Studies; Kathryn and Grant Swick Faculty Research Fund at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business,"I am grateful to Donald Davis, Amit Khandelwal, Eric Verhoogen, Jonathan Vogel, and David Weinstein for invaluable discussions, guidance, and support.

Public bus service represents a standardized output for benchmarking the cost of local government service provision. Among the top twenty largest cities, there exists significant dispersion in the operating cost per bus mile with the highest being more than three times as high as the lowest Using a regression discontinuity design, we estimate the cost savings from privatization and explore the political economy of why privatization rates are lower in high cost unionized areas. Our analysis suggests that fully privatizing all bus transit would generate cost savings of approximately $5.7 billion, or 30% of total U.S. bus transit operating expenses. The corresponding increased use of public transit from this cost reduction would lead to a gain in social welfare of $524 million, at minimum, and at least 26,000 additional transit jobs.

I estimate the relationship between federal homelessness funding and homeless counts in 2011, 2013, and 2015 cross sections. I instrument for funding using a community's pre-1940 housing share, a key variable in an originally unrelated funding formula borrowed for homelessness grants. Funding increases sheltered homelessness; meanwhile, funding is unrelated to unsheltered homelessness. Lower bound estimates suggest that the minimum cost of reducing unsheltered homelessness has increased over time, from $16,400 in 2011 to $20,800 in 2013 to $50,000 in 2015. In 2013, an additional $1 thousand dollars corresponds to a .309 higher homeless rate per 10,000 people. The effect is larger for families than individuals. Funding is positively related to chronic homelessness and is unrelated to youth and child homelessness. My results suggest limitations on federal funding's ability to reduce homelessness among some of the most marginalized groups in society.","[Lucas, David S.] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, MS 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Lucas, DS (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, MS 3G4, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",dlucas6@gmu.edu,"Lucas, David/GXZ-5135-2022",,,,,,44,20,31,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

J,"Sheu, JT",,,,"Sheu, Jitian",,,"Impact of National Health Insurance on Entry and Competition in Remote Areas, Evidence from Taiwan's Dental Market",PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper assesses the change in the supply of dental clinics after the implementation of Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI). Even though the government has enforced lower prices of treatment since the implementation of NHI, the increase in use could actually result in higher revenue for dentists. The higher profit could prompt dentists to attempt to enter markets that were previously unprofitable. This paper tested if NHI increased the dental clinic supply in geographically isolated areas by investigating whether the required minimum market size was reduced. We found that following the implementation of NHI, the per-dental clinic minimum market size significantly decreased. In addition, the decreased minimum market sizes were enabled by a corresponding increase in variable profits which is equal to the difference between price and average variable costs. This implies that the NHI-enlarged health care demand compensates for the possible losses of dental clinics due to price regulation. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the post-NHI dental market becomes more competitive when there is a second entrant in the market, and the level of competition approaches perfect competition when three and more dental clinics serve one market.","[Sheu, Jitian] Chang Gung Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Chang Gung University,"Sheu, JT (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",jtsheu@mail.cgu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC94-24158-H-182-001, MOST 104-2410-H-182-030]",Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"The research support for this work provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC94-24158-H-182-001 and MOST 104-2410-H-182-030) in Taiwan is gratefully acknowledged.

This paper investigates the effects of a carbon intensity constraint policy (CICP) that the Chinese government put forward in 2009 on the green production performance (GPP, i.e., the environmentally sensitive productivity growth considering carbon emissions to be an undesirable output) of industrial sector (the largest carbon emitter in China) for the first time. Based on a non-radial and non-oriented DEA (data envelopment analysis) measure method, we first adopt the Luenberger indicator to estimate the GPP of China's 36 industrial sub-sectors over 2001-2013. Furthermore, regarding the CICP proposed in 2009 as a natural experiment, we assess the effects of such a policy on China's industrial GPP by using the quasi-difference-in-differences (quasi-DID) method. The results show that China's industrial GPP presents a circuitous downward trend after experiencing a transient rise. The heterogeneity of the GPP among industrial sub-sectors exists, and the increase in industrial output is the crucial driver of improving the GPP. China's industrial GPP has deteriorated after implementing the CICP, and the negative effect of such a policy is larger and larger over time. Such empirical results indicate that although the carbon regulation policy in China has achieved a surface success, the policy causes a factor substitution effect to hinder the improvement of the GPP. Therefore, China's current CICP is not effective in realizing the double dividend of carbon reduction and industrial growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of five different levels of wind power penetration on prices, ranging from Scenario A, 'no wind', to Scenario E that includes existing and planned wind power sufficient to meet Australia's original 2020 41TWh Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET). We find divergence in prices between states and similar prices for nodes within states. This supports the Garnaut Climate Change Review assessment on the prevalence of 'gold-plating' the intrastate transmission network and underinvesting in interstate connectivity. We find that increasing wind power penetration decreases wholesale spot prices but that retail prices have increased in deregulated South Australia and Queensland, similarly, in Victoria. We argue that there is a pressing need to split the large generator-retail companies into separate retail and generator companies and to reassess regulatory rules more generally. Interconnector congestion limits the potential for wind power to further reduce wholesale prices across the NEM. So the need for a high capacity transmission backbone in the NEM is becoming clearer and will become pressing when Australia moves beyond its current 2020 LRET. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

R&D expenses relate to a well-accepted profit shifting channel, strategic placement of intellectual property within a multinational entity. Using a unique hand-collected data set, we add a new perspective to the current base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) state of research and debate, in three ways: First, observing that primary studies report mixed evidence on how R&D expenses affect ETR, we provide a consensus estimate for this effect. Second, we consider this effect in more detail by separating a tax accounting effect and a profit shifting effect, which to our knowledge has not yet been investigated. We detect that one-third of the R&D effect on the ETR is due to the tax accounting effect and could be mitigated via book-tax conformity. We further find that 10% of the profit shifting effect can be traced back to R&D tax credits. Third, our meta-regression reveals factors that are possible sources of variation and bias in previous empirical studies.","[Belz, Thomas; von Hagen, Dominik; Steffens, Christian] Univ Mannheim, Sch Business, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"von Hagen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Sch Business, Mannheim, Germany.",vonhagen@bwl.uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,70,4,5,6,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We apply a block recursive structural Vector Autoregressive (VAR) approach that is adapted to a small open economy by adding the New Taiwan Dollar/US Dollar exchange rate to the block of economic activity indicators. We test the hypothesis that measures of money constructed using the Divisia index number formulation are superior indicators of monetary conditions when compared to the central bank's main policy rate, the Taiwanese discount rate. We find that using properly measured monetary data solves short-run price, output and exchange rate puzzles and leads to sensible long-run impulse responses to monetary shocks. Future work on the optimization of the construction of the Divisia index number formulation is recommended.","[Binner, Jane M.] Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Kelly, Logan J.] Univ Wisconsin, River Falls, WI 54022 USA",University of Birmingham; University of Wisconsin System,"Binner, JM (通讯作者)，Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

A collective household model with a matching framework predicts that changes in alimony laws would affect existing couples and couples-to-be differently. For existing couples, it benefits the intended beneficiary but, for couples not yet formed, it generates offsetting intra-household transfers and lower intra-marital allocations for the beneficiary. Our empirical analyses confirm these predictions. Among couples united before the reform, obtaining the right to petition for alimony led women to lower their labour force participation but not among newly formed cohabiting couples.","[Chiappori, Pierre-Andre] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Iyigun, Murat] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Iyigun, Murat; Lafortune, Jeanne; Weiss, Yoram] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lafortune, Jeanne] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Weiss, Yoram] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel",Columbia University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Tel Aviv University,"Lafortune, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Inst Econ, Vicuna MacKenna 4860, Macul, Chile.",jlafortune@uc.cl,"Lafortune, Jeanne/Q-7146-2019","Lafortune, Jeanne/0000-0003-0127-0646","NSF [1124277, SES-0527751]; Conicyt Programa de Investigacion Asociativa [SOC1102]; Fondecyt [1150337]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1124277] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Conicyt Programa de Investigacion Asociativa; Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Carolina Gonzalez-Velosa provided very useful research assistance.

We estimate the model using oil futures and options data, and find that the pricing of traded contracts is accurate for a wide,range of maturities and strike prices. The results suggest that at least three risk factors in the spot price volatility are needed to accurately fit the volatility surface of options on oil futures, highlighting the importance of using general multifactor models in pricing commodity contingent claims.

These markets, by design, have lacked the institutional or financial architecture supporting their capital base compared to more established markets. We make the initial attempt to examine four such stock markets (Saudi Arabia, UAE, South Africa and Israel). We perform multi-timescale analysis using wavelet-based time and frequency decompositions in order to investigate (i) whether the shocks transmitted were pure contagion or fundamental-based and (ii) also whether the dynamic evolution of stock market integration was mainly short-term or long-term. We find that prior to the 2008/09 US subprime crisis, the shocks generated pure contagion in contrast to the subprime crisis that reveals evidence supportive of fundamental-based contagion. Further, when exploring the dynamics of market integration, we find that integration strengthens over time as opposed to any immediate short-term outcome. This supports policies engendered to promote stock market resiliency and stability.","[Dewandaru, Ginanjar; Masih, Mansur] Global Univ Islamic Finance, INCEIF, Lorong Univ A, Kuala Lumpur 59100, Malaysia; [Masih, Rumi] FML Reliance, New York, NY 10022 USA",Lorong Universiti A; INCEIF,"Masih, M (通讯作者)，Global Univ Islamic Finance, INCEIF, Lorong Univ A, Kuala Lumpur 59100, Malaysia.",mansurmasih@gmail.com,,"Masih, Mansur/0000-0002-9965-0091; MASIH, RUMI/0009-0007-9911-5674",,,,,65,32,34,0,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

For the original returns series, this study finds that unidirectional linear Granger causality exists from crude oil markets to North American and European gas markets. However, for nonlinear characteristics, the crude oil and regional gas markets exhibit bidirectional nonlinear Granger causality. On the medium-term time scale, a bidirectional nonlinear spillover effect is found between the markets.

Commuting Costs in South African Cities,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,R41; R4; R; R48; Commuting costs; Urban economics; South African cities,CAPE-TOWN; POSTAPARTHEID,"In this paper, I describe the monetary and time costs of commuting to work in South African cities, and how these have changed in the post-Apartheid era. I interpret these results in light of a paper by Brueckner, who used a simple urban model to suggest that location and commuting patterns by race could change as a result of the repeal of Apartheid era legislation such as the Group Areas Act that made it impossible for black South Africans to live near the centre of cities. A key finding is that monetary and time costs of commuting in South African cities are high and have increased in the post-Apartheid period. Journey times are much higher than the OECD country average and a sample of developing country cities. Part of the explanation for increasing average commute times is population growth in South African cities, which has been substantial. Both the population and number of commuters doubled between 1993 and 2013 in the six metropolitan municipalities (metros) analysed in this paper. Since commuting costs a substantial amount and generates negative externalities through congestion I also explore the financing of public transport.","[Kerr, Andrew] Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, 3rd Floor,Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Kerr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, DataFirst, 3rd Floor,Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, Rondebosch, South Africa.",andrew.kerr@uct.ac.za,,,"Research Project on Employment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth","Research Project on Employment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth","The paper has benefited from the comments of participants at SALDRU and CSSR (University of Cape Town) and RESEP (Stellenbosch University) seminars, Jan Brueckner and the anonymous reviewer.

The analysis embraced 16 regional operational programmes (ROPs) between 2007-2013. The frame of reference adopted in the research was the centre-periphery model. Classes of peripherality were distinguished for each voivodeship, and absorption profiles of EU funds were determined for areas differing in their levels of peripherality. The goal of the article was achieved in a multi-stage research procedure ending in the construction of a synthetic index of the spatial orientation of support within the ROPs. The analysis demonstrated that the features of the polarising model tended to predominate in intra-regional policy. In most cases, however, the distribution of EU support represented a mixed model, with a shift towards the polarising one.","[Kisiala, Wojciech] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Spatial & Environm Econ, Poznan, Poland; [Bajerski, Artur] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Socioecon Geog & Spatial Management, Poznan, Poland; [Stepinski, Bartosz] Publ Profits Ltd, Res & Evaluat Agcy, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Kisiala, W (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Spatial & Environm Econ, Poznan, Poland.",wojciech.kisiala@ue.poznan.pl; bajerski@amu.edu.pl; bartosz.stepinski@publicprofits.pl,"Bajerski, Artur/D-3180-2012","Kisiala, Wojciech/0000-0003-3342-3985; Bajerski, Artur/0000-0002-1301-0596",,,,,51,5,5,1,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We propose an oligopoly model with network effects to account for an exchange industry that consists of two MTFs and an historical exchange. Based on the observation that banks are both owners and clients of MTFs, we examine banks' incentive to influence the pricing policy of MTFs. We show that when brokerage and trading activities are particularly important for banks' revenue relative to their profit as MTF operators, certain market outcomes may emerge whereby both MTFs include banks' interest as clients in their objective function. We also demonstrate that accounting for banks' interest in MTFs' objective function acts as a competitive device that reduces the price and the profitability of the historical exchange.","[Lahet, Delphine; Vaubourg, Anne-Gael] Bordeaux Univ, LAREFI, Campus Pessac,Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",,"Lahet, D (通讯作者)，Bordeaux Univ, LAREFI, Campus Pessac,Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",Delphine.Lahet@u-bordeaux.fr; Anne-Gael.Vaubourg@u-bordeaux.fr,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In this paper, we study how international equity and bond market indexes impact asset allocations, capital flows, asset prices, and exchange rates across countries. We use unique monthly micro-level data of benchmark compositions and mutual fund investments during 1996-2014. We find that movements in benchmarks appear to have important effects on equity and bond mutual fund portfolio allocations, including passive and active funds. The effects persist after controlling for time-varying industry-level factors, country-specific effects, and macroeconomic fundamentals. Changes in benchmarks not only impact asset allocations, but also capital flows, abnormal returns in aggregate stock and bond prices, and exchange rates. These systemic effects occur not just when benchmark changes are announced, but also later, when they become effective. By impacting country allocations, benchmarks explain apparently counterintuitive movements in capital flows and asset prices, as well as contagion effects.

We find that participants' willingness to share personal data with anonymous recipients decreases with the number of recipients.

Evidence from a framing variation of rewards in experimental two-stage pairwise elimination contests indicates that decision makers neglect the option value of participation in future stages of the contest if the reward frame facilitates the separate consideration of stages, but not if the reward frame induces forward-looking behavior. Decision makers, account for the option value of participation in future stages of the contest independently of the reward frame, however, when complex strategic interactions in future stages of the contest are replaced by simple lotteries that facilitate the determination of the option value. The results present novel evidence for the prevalence and the determinants of choice bracketing as a means to cope with complexity.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; MALMQUIST INDEX; TIME HORIZON,"This study compares three DEA approaches for environmental assessment, all of which are designed to examine the level of simultaneous achievement on economic prosperity and environmental protection, so measuring the degree of sustainability development. DEA, standing for Data Envelopment Analysis, has been widely applied for performance assessment in the past five decades. A new type of applications is referred to as DEA environmental assessment and it measures the performance of many organizations that utilize inputs to produce not only desirable outputs (e.g., electricity) but also undesirable outputs (e.g., CO2). In the previous studies, DEA-based performance evaluation for environment assessment is methodologically classified into radial or non-radial category. Recently, a new intermediate approach, analytically locating between the radial and non-radial measures, has been proposed as the third alternative. A use of the intermediate approach has several unique features, all of which cannot be found in the radial and non-radial ones. The new approach measures the degree of unified inefficiency on each production factor and determines the level of total unified inefficiency from the average of the sum of these inefficiency scores. This study discusses the analytical features by comparing the intermediate approach with the radial and non-radial ones. The methodological comparison attempts to convey a message that DEA is indeed an important methodology, but not perfect. Rather, it is an approximation approach to examine the performance of various organizations. Many DEA applications on energy and environment often suffer from a methodological bias, implying that different approaches produce different empirical results. Thus, in guiding a large policy issue such as the global warming and climate change, it is necessary for us to compare several different approaches (e.g., models and concepts) to derive a reliable empirical suggestion. The importance of such a message is applicable to not only DEA but also the other types of empirical research in natural and social sciences. Therefore, this study discusses the methodological bias issue from the practicality of the three DEA approaches in assessing various concerns on energy and environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

When the possibility of substitution between property rights is relatively high, inefficiency arises in the overusage of a common resource (i.e. commons tragedy).

This paper exploits a period of substantial income volatility in Russia to examine the extent to which, as well as how individuals protect their energy intakes in the face of unanticipated shocks to household income. Using rich data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, our results suggest that households use substitution, disproportionally cutting back spending on non-foods to protect spending on foods, change the composition of the consumption basket, and increase the consumption of 'cheaper' calories. Taken together, however, we find that total energy intakes as well as the nutritional composition of the diet are almost fully protected against income shocks. Specifically, we find that 12-16% of the effect of permanent income shocks on food expenditures is transmitted to energy intakes, with 84-88% protected through insurance mechanisms.

This can happen for many reasons, including dishonesty, forgetfulness, or insufficient intrinsic motivation. Social scientists have explored the reasons for persistent failures to follow through, suggesting that eliciting explicit promises can be an effective way to motivate action. This paper presents a field experiment that tests the effect of explicit promises, in the form of honor pledges, on loan repayment rates. The experiment was conducted with LendUp, an online lender, and targeted 4,883 first-time borrowers with the firm. Individuals were randomized into four groups, with the following experimental treatments: (1) having no honor pledge to complete (control); (2) signing a given honor pledge; (3) re-typing the same honor pledge as in (2) before signing; and (4) coming up with a personal honor pledge to type and sign. I also randomized whether or not borrowers were reminded of the honor pledge they signed prior to the repayment deadline. The results suggest that the honor pledge treatments had minimal impacts on repayment, and that reminders of the pledges were similarly ineffective. This suggests that borrowers who fail to repay loans do so not because of dishonesty or behavioral biases, but because they suffer from true financial hardship and are simply unable to repay.

We present a wealth model of a two-country economy where financial assets and goods are traded. We consider the case where the agents are risk neutral, a very common assumption in finance in order to have explicit solutions for prices, and, in particular, in international finance for exchange rates using the non-null Pareto optima. We show that the Pareto optima in the international assets and goods markets are found to coincide with the net trade allocations. More notably, under a no-arbitrage condition in the assets markets, we can define an exchange rates system for which PPP holds. We provide conditions to have a non-null Pareto optimum to compute the exchange rates. We give an example with a non-null Pareto optimum associated with the determination of the exchange rate.

We investigate whether these investors exert some form of control over the recommendations they receive, and, if so, which one. Investors can push advisors to provide better recommendations either by asking for a second expert's opinion, such as in the case of credence services, or by monitoring closely the advisor's activity themselves. We find that three quarters of investors do not exert any control on advisors. Different types of financial competence-self-assessed or test-based-serve different purposes. The investors featuring higher self-assessed financial competence are more likely to control the advisor's activity. The mechanism through which investors exert control over the advisors' activity depends instead on the investors' degree of test-based financial literacy. Investors with high financial literacy directly monitor the advisors' activity. Investors with low financial literacy are more likely to seek a second professional opinion in support of the recommendations previously received. Our findings suggest that improving investors financial knowledge may foster direct control of the advisor's activity. Moreover, facilitating the comparison between financial products by standardized and centralized information may be very effective to protect poorly literate investors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Third, a relevant share of new open-ended positions is characterized by part-time contracts. Fourth, the increase in employment is concentrated among older work-force (over 50 years old). Finally, new permanent jobs increase in low-skilled and low-tech service sectors, while the opposite occurs in manufacturing (particularly in high-tech industries).","[Cirillo, Valeria; Guarascio, Dario] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiti della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Fana, Marta] Inst Etud Polit Paris, Paris, France",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Cirillo, V (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiti della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",v.cirillo@sssup.it,"Guarascio, Dario/AAF-4189-2019","Fana, Marta/0009-0008-2805-0591; Guarascio, Dario/0000-0002-2748-6472; Cirillo, Valeria/0000-0003-4562-2359",European UnionGs Horizon research and innovation programme [649186-ISIGrowth],European UnionGs Horizon research and innovation programme,"This paper is produced as part of ISIGrowth project on Innovation-fuelled, Sustainable, Inclusive Growth that has received funding from the European UnionGs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 649186-ISIGrowth.

Then the empirical work is performed via a novel hybrid approach and WN model (Westerlund and Narayan, 2012, 2014) that account for characteristics of persistency, endogeneity, and heteroskedasticity. The empirical results show that investor attention does exhibit statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting power to directly forecast oil prices for both daily data and weekly data.

The fiscal policy specification posits that government spending, lump sum transfers, and distortionary taxation on labor income, capital income and consumption expenditures respond to the level of government debt and the state of economic activity. Analysis of the data from 2000 to 2015 shows that distortionary capital taxes play a critical role in stabilizing government debt in the U.S., whereas non-distorting fiscal instruments are the primary means of fiscal adjustment in Korea. Regarding the magnitude of debt-financed fiscal stimuli, the substantial trade openness of Korea is significant in that it produces relatively smaller government spending and transfer multipliers compared to the U.S.","[Hur, Joonyoung] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Econ, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Kang Koo] Natl Assembly Budget Off, Fiscal Policy Anal Div, 1 Uisadang Ro, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Lee, KK (通讯作者)，Natl Assembly Budget Off, Fiscal Policy Anal Div, 1 Uisadang Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",joonyhur@gmail.com; klee@nabo.go.kr,,,,,,,40,4,4,0,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using a simple labour production economy, we first derive an analytically tractable solution for optimal degree of fiscal transfers. In this economy, fiscal transfers can improve welfare by moving the competitive equilibrium with fiscal transfers closer to the social planner's solution. We then extend the model to a DSGE setting with capital, international bond and linear taxes, and we analyze how implementation of a simple revenue sharing rule affects welfare and macroeconomic variables over time. Simulation results show that risk sharing through fiscal transfers always improves welfare in the long run. However, under certain model specifications, short-run transitional welfare loss can outweigh the long-run benefits. These results suggest that, in designing fiscal transfers across countries, government should take into consideration the intertemporal nature of welfare gains.","[Kim, Jinill] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Sunghyun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",shenrykim@skku.edu,,"Kim, Sunghyun/0000-0002-9326-1028",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A5A8024907],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"We thank Fabio Canova, Chris Sims, Harald Uhlig, Jurgen von Hagen and seminar participants at numerous places.

While constitutions require, in most cases, qualified majorities in order to be approved at the constitutional assembly, they normally require only simple majorities to be ratified at the referendum. We analyze the set of conditions under which each majority rule is preferable for constitutional referendums. We argue that the simple majority requirement for referendums in constitution-making, which is nearly universally used, lacks a clear theoretical justification. Qualified majority rules increase legitimacy and provide additional checks on the drafters. We further highlight when simple majority rules have advantages: when decision-making costs in the referendum are high. Thereafter, we present an evaluation mechanism to identify the cases in which each majority rule should be used to increase stability and legitimacy. We then apply this evaluation mechanism to the constitution-making processes in Poland, Bolivia and Egypt, which are three examples of diverging majority rules.","[Michel, Stephan] Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Johnsallee 35, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [Cofone, Ignacio N.] Yale Law Sch, Informat Soc Project, 127 Wall St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",University of Hamburg; Yale University,"Michel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Law & Econ, Johnsallee 35, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",stephan.michel@ile-hamburg.de,,,,,,,48,7,8,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2017,70.0,3,,,,,402,424,,10.1111/kykl.12143,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ8QN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404992000003,0

Further, this study investigates the impact of renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions and economic output in a panel of the G20 countries. The empirical analysis was carried out on the full sample as well as on sub-samples of developed and developing economies of the G20 member countries. The results confirm a significant long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables across the panels. Further, the long-run elasticities suggest that FDI significantly reduces CO2 emissions in the full sample and developing economies while stock market growth reduces in developed economies. Similarly, the renewable energy consumption substantially reduces CO2 emissions and increases economic output across the panels. Our findings have important policy implications. For instance, the policy makers have to initiate effective policies to promote the renewable energy sources to meet the increasing demand for energy by replacing the use of conventional energy such as coal, gas and oil. This will therefore help to reduce the CO2 emissions and also ensure sustainable economic development in the G20 nations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of a decrease in demand for older workers in the 1970s and 1980s. It can be argued that the impact of ICT on demand for older workers is skill-biased. However, the skill-biased demand for older workers is mainly reflected in the skill-biased changes in employment shares rather than relative wages. There is some evidence of a gradual deskilling of older workers. We find that labour market institutions such as the national minimum wage, social pacts on wage issues and union density mostly benefit skilled older workers, while coordination of wage setting, extension of collective agreements, social pacts on pensions and centralisation of wage bargaining can alleviate the adverse effects of skill-biased technological change.","[Peng, Fei] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Dept Econ, 2800 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Peng, Fei] Birmingham Business Sch, CREW, Univ House,Edgbaston Pk Rd, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, 2800 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA 8001, Australia; [Kang, Lili] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, Sch Business Adm, 995 Shangchuan Rd, Shanghai 201209, Peoples R China",Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; University of Birmingham; University of the Sunshine Coast; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; University of South Australia; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance,"Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",pengfei@lixin.edu.cn; SAnwar@usc.edu.au; lxk699@126.com,"Peng, Fei/W-5409-2019; Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013; Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023; 康, 丽丽/AAC-9220-2021","Peng, Fei/0000-0001-6985-351X; Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309; Kang, Lili/0000-0002-4726-050X",China National Social Science Fund [14BJL028]; Shanghai Young Eastern Scholar [QD2015049]; Shanghai ShuGuang program [15SG53],China National Social Science Fund; Shanghai Young Eastern Scholar; Shanghai ShuGuang program,This paper has greatly benefitted from very helpful comments and suggestions received from several colleagues.

Firms experience random productivity shocks after factor employment. A cap-and-trade regulation controls pollution emissions. Trade in emission permits entails transactions costs. Under proportional permit trading costs, the equilibrium depends on total per unit trading cost; its incidence between buyers and sellers does not matter. Under fixed trading costs, both buyers' and sellers' costs matter. Under proportional costs, permit trade always occurs when total trading costs are below net trade surplus. If these costs are sufficiently low, the production-emission outcome is as under costless trade with full utilization of production capacity and emission permits. With fixed costs, trade occurs if costs are sufficiently low, but production capacity and emissions permits are never fully utilized. Under proportional costs, trade is impeded most when the emission cap is either relatively high or low. There exists a nonmonotonic relationship between the emissions cap and a lower bound for trading costs that obstructs trade. Under fixed costs, a similar relationship holds only if the output variance is scale independent. Under proportional costs, capacity utilization decreases with output variance; the result is the opposite under fixed costs.","[Singh, Rajesh; Weninger, Quinn] Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA",Iowa State University,"Weninger, Q (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 260 Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",rsingh@iastate.edu; weninger@iastate.edu,,,,,,,29,12,13,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

A multi-criteria decision-making method (analytic hierarchy process) was used for the evaluation of relationship of these managers to sustainable development. A benefits, opportunities, costs and risks approach was applied for the structuring of the elements. The significance of the individual elements has been detected using Saaty's method. Three alternatives were formulated about the benefits to be a business that is interested in sustainability development. It was identified that the alternative, it is advantageous to be business interesting in sustainability development' is the most preferred. On the other hand, it was also identified, that managers will be responsible for sustainability development and their attitude must bring them benefits. This article contributes to the fulfilment of the research gap in the field of research related to small businesses and their surroundings. Identified impacts can be used for practical creation of conditions which would further encourage small businesses to take a proactive approach to sustainability development.","[Mikusova, Marie] Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Management, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Mikusová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Management, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",marie.mikusova@vsb.cz,"Mikusova, Marie/H-2967-2018","Mikusova, Marie/0000-0003-0183-806X","Faculty of Economics, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava [SP2016/123]; ESF [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]","Faculty of Economics, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava; ESF","This work was supported by the Faculty of Economics, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava [grant number SP2016/123]; ESF [grant number CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296].",,38,32,33,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

As an answer, governments' desire to obtain rents from the financial system or to manage public debt servicing have been suggested as the typical underlying incentives. It has been argued in 1970s and 1980s that especially in developing economies, financial repression would have negative consequences on economic growth and financial development, although more recently financial repression policies are back as governments in the developed economies aim at obtaining low-cost funds from the financial markets in the aftermath of the global financial crises.In this article, a simple two-sector model is set up in order to show that governments may institute financial repression policies to internalise production and investment externalities. It is shown that such a government policy is welfare improving and abolishment of selective credits may cause welfare loss. The model also provides a case where financial policy is designed according to the priorities of industrial policy.","[Yulek, Murat A.] Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Ctr Ind Policy & Dev, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Ticaret University,"Yülek, MA (通讯作者)，Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Ctr Ind Policy & Dev, Istanbul, Turkey.",myulek@ticaret.edu.tr,"Yulek, Murat/CAF-6210-2022","Yulek, Murat/0000-0001-7533-5882",,,,,48,9,9,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The first part examines the descriptive and statistical evidence on these traps. The second discusses the various arguments that have been put forward to explain the existence, and persistence, of middle-income traps. These arguments include diminishing returns to physical capital, exhaustion of cheap labor and imitation gains, insufficient quality of human capital, inadequate contract enforcement and intellectual property protection, distorted incentives and misallocation of talent, lack of access to advanced infrastructure, and lack of access to finance, especially in the form of venture capital. The third part considers public policies aimed at avoiding, and escaping from, middle-income traps. The concluding part identifies a number of directions in which the empirical and theoretical literature could fruitfully evolve.","[Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Agenor, Pierre-Richard] Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.;Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Manchester, Lancs, England.",pierre-richard.agenor@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,83,50,55,3,52,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

In this paper, we characterize immigration policy in a richer model where migrants are also a source of cultural externalities stemming from either preferences or the functioning of formal and informal institutions in receiving countries. While in terms of pure economic effects, immigrants do not generally have any more incentives than low-skilled natives to allow for more immigration in the future, this is not the case when accounting for cultural externalities. Therefore, insofar as past immigrants have a voice in affecting future policies, a time-consistent immigration policy entails back-loading; as natives attempt at limiting voice of immigrants in the future, the economic effects of immigration flows as well as the cultural externality they introduce. Furthermore, natives exploit any pre-commitment device to limit immigration flows, e.g. building walls, limiting immigrants' political rights, or accumulating fiscal surpluses.","[Zanella, Giulio] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy",New York University; University of Bologna,"Zanella, G (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,"ZANELLA, GIULIO/0000-0001-8963-2351",,,,,41,4,4,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

To apply the two-step method, one needs to identify which coefficient function is the smoothest one and undersmooth all other functions in the first stage, In this paper we propose an alternative approach which assigns each smooth function a different bandwidth and we choose the bandwidths simultaneously.

The empirical failure of the rational expectations theory of the yield curve, however, limits its applicability to monetary policy analysis. The success of agent-based behavioral asset pricing models and behavioral macroeconomic models in replicating statistical regularities of empirical data series motivates to apply them to yield curve modeling. This paper analyses how the interaction of monetary policy and market sentiments shape the yield curve in a behavioral model with heterogeneous and bounded-rational agents. One result is that the behavioral model replicates empirical facts of term structure data. Moreover, it overcomes one major deficiency of rational expectations models of the yield curve in explaining the empirically observed uncertain responses of longer term yields to changes in the central bank rate. These are explained by the behavioral model's ability to generate different responses of market sentiments to shocks at different times which lead to a variety of interest rate responses. Further results of this paper can be used as policy advice on how central banks can target the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve by targeting market sentiments about inflation and the business cycle.","[Demary, Markus] Cologne Inst Econ Res, Konrad Adenauer Ufer 21, D-50668 Cologne, Germany",,"Demary, M (通讯作者)，Cologne Inst Econ Res, Konrad Adenauer Ufer 21, D-50668 Cologne, Germany.",demary@iwkoeln.de,,,,,,,46,1,1,2,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

We explore the hypothesis that personality plays a role in decision making in situations of uncertainty but not in situations of risk. In addition to offering support for this main hypothesis, we explore the various pathways through which personality exerts its influence. What we find is that in uncertain environments, where decision makers are able to acquire information about the unknown probability distributions they face, personality variables influence the type of information people acquire, which then influences their choice. Our experimental design brings in two novel aspects of choice under uncertainty: information acquisition and advice. The findings indicate that indeed, under uncertainty, personality matters for choice in a way it does not under risk. Furthermore, the results suggest that personality can play a role at multiple levels, such as people's preferences for certain types of information and the likelihood of following advice.

Using newly collected panel data on annual migration flows to seven districts over the period 1883-1900, we find that the response of migration to increased demand for labor, proxied by a rising tea price, was lower for the contract that had a bad reputation.

Most of the fall in TFP in services is accounted for by a large negative TFP shock in 2008-2012. By decomposing the change in average labour productivity, it is shown that declines in the intermediate inputs-labour (rather than the capital-labour) ratio and decreases in TFP were responsible for the fall in labour productivity.","[Harris, Richard; Moffat, John] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Durham University,"Moffat, J (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",john.moffat@durham.ac.uk,,"Harris, Richard/0000-0001-8066-3629; Moffat, John/0000-0002-9529-1749",,,,,51,25,25,2,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This unique pattern, rooted in China's dual-track reform strategy between state and non-state sectors, did not prevent a strong economic performance in the past, but is now a main cause of economic inefficiency and financial risks. The rapid development of digital finance is a back-door way of financial liberalization, responding to both old repressive policies and new technologies. To accomplish the mission of building an efficient financial system, the government needs to take at least three further steps in financial reform: creating a level-playing field; freeing up the market mechanism; and improving regulation. The key test lies in the effective enforcement of market discipline for corporate and financial institutions.","[Huang, Yiping; Wang, Xu] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Huang, YP (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yhuang@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"Huang, Yi-Ping/GQZ-6811-2022",,,,,,24,33,33,1,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

In a real world election, using experimental variation in the perceived reduction of the fine for abstention I estimate that receiving information about a reduction in the fine by 50 (75) percent causes a decrease in turnout of 2.6 (5.3) percentage points. These estimates imply a cost elasticity of voting of -0.22. The reduction in turnout is driven by voters who are in the center of the political spectrum, hold less political information and have lower subjective value of voting. The increase in abstention does not change aggregate preferences for specific policies. Further, involvement in politics, as measured by the decision to acquire political information, is independent of the level of the fine. Additional results indicate that the reduction in the fine reduces the incidence of vote buying and increases the price paid for a vote.","[Leon, Gianmarco] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Leon, Gianmarco] IPEG, Barcelona, Spain; [Leon, Gianmarco] Jaume 1 Bldg,20-1E74,Ramon Trias Fargas,25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University,"León, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.;León, G (通讯作者)，IPEG, Barcelona, Spain.;León, G (通讯作者)，Jaume 1 Bldg,20-1E74,Ramon Trias Fargas,25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",gianmarco.leon@upf.edu,"Leon-Ciliotta, Gianmarco/AAL-6893-2020","Leon-Ciliotta, Gianmarco/0000-0002-9738-8050","Institute of Business and Economic Research (IBER); Center for Evaluation and Global Action (CEGA); Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075, ECO2014-55555-P]",Institute of Business and Economic Research (IBER); Center for Evaluation and Global Action (CEGA); Inter-American Development Bank (IADB); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government),"I am grateful to Elisabeth Sadoulet for her patient guidance.

But financialized governance may not actually work well for most shareholders, and even when it does, significant tradeoffs and inefficiencies can arise from the conflict between maximizing financialized measures and society's broader interests. Effective governance requires that those in control are accountable for actions they take. However, those who control and benefit most from corporations' success are often able to avoid accountability. The history of corporate governance includes a parade of scandals and crises that have caused significant harm. After each, most key individuals tend to minimize their own culpability. Common claims from executives, boards of directors, auditors, rating agencies, politicians, and regulators include we just didn't know, we couldn't have predicted, or it was just a few bad apples. Economists, as well, may react to corporate scandals and crises with their own version of we just didn't know, as their models had ruled out certain possibilities. Effective governance of institutions in the private and public sectors should make it much more difficult for individuals in these institutions to get away with claiming that harm was out of their control when in reality they had encouraged or enabled harmful misconduct, and ought to have taken action to prevent it.","[Admati, Anat R.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Finance & Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Admati, AR (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Finance & Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",admati@stanford.edu,,"Admati, Anat/0000-0002-9201-4017",,,,,76,30,42,0,18,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

As a consequence, many power generation utilities now act as unregulated companies that technically compete to sell power on an open market. This paper analyses the performance in term of cost efficiency for electricity generation in OECD power sector while accounting for the impact of electricity market structures. We employ the short run cost function in which capital stock is treated as a quasi-fixed factor input. Empirical models are developed for the cost function as a translog form and analysed using panel data of 25 countries during the period 1980 to 2009. We show that it is necessary to model latent country-specific heterogeneity in addition to time varying inefficiency. The estimated economies of scale are adjusted to take account of the importance of the quasi-fixed capital input in determining cost behaviour, and long run constant returns to scale are verified for the OECD generation sector. The research findings suggest there is a significant impact of electricity market regulatory indicators on cost. In particular, public ownership and vertical integration are found to have significant and sizable increasing impacts on cost, thereby indicating policy lessons on the desirable ways to implement structural electricity generation reforms.

We solve our model for the balanced growth path and find that a unique low growth equilibrium is attained when environmental quality is given less weight in the utility function. Multiple equilibria exist if environment quality is given greater weight in the utility function. We also perform local stability analysis of our model. We conclude that an economy in which the environmental quality is given relatively less importance by the agents will be caught in low growth, high consumption poverty traps as is the case for many developing countries while other economies can potentially reach a relatively low consumption, high growth steady state if they place greater weight on environmental quality. Finally we look at how the gap between low and high growth equilibria shrinks when individuals place greater weight on environmental quality and how governmental policies can promote growth when societies give less weight to the environment.","[Chaudhry, Azam; Tanveer, Hafsa] Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Lahore 53200, Pakistan; [Naz, R.] Lahore Sch Econ, Ctr Math & Stat Sci, Lahore 53200, Pakistan",Lahore School of Economics; Lahore School of Economics,"Chaudhry, A (通讯作者)，Lahore Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Lahore 53200, Pakistan.",Azam@lahoreschool.edu.pk,"Naz, Rehana/I-5254-2013; Naz, Rehana/N-3246-2017","Naz, Rehana/0000-0001-6232-4957; Chaudhry, Azam/0000-0003-0401-7099",,,,,32,5,5,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Our findings show that, by assuming non-constant biased technical change, a purely technological approach is able to replicate the sectoral transformations in the U.S. economy not only after but also prior to World War II.","[Cruz, Edgar] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finance, 4th Floor,Fraccionamiento 1,Col Establo S-N, Guanajuato 36250, Mexico",Universidad de Guanajuato,"Cruz, E (通讯作者)，Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finance, 4th Floor,Fraccionamiento 1,Col Establo S-N, Guanajuato 36250, Mexico.",be.cruz@ugto.mx,"Cruz, Edgar/P-8615-2019","Cruz, Edgar/0000-0001-6727-9403",Universitat de Barcelona through the grant APIF; CONACYT [383793],Universitat de Barcelona through the grant APIF; CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"I thank my thesis advisor, Xavier Raurich, for his helpful suggestions.

Empirical estimates show that, as in standard consumption-based models with power utility preferences, the movements of the implied risk-free rate are entirely determined by the variations of expected consumption growth. This leads to a negative relationship between LRR Euler equation rates and money market rates. Nevertheless, when the low-frequency movements of consumption growth are accounted for, the long-run component of consumption growth is a key element to partially capture the countercyclical variations of the money market rates.","[d'Addona, Stefano] Univ Rome Tre, Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"d'Addona, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rome Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Via G Chiabrera 199, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",daddona@uniroma3.it,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The scholarly literature on the 'externalisation' of policy advice has questioned the analytical rigour of such externalised advice. An embryonic literature on policy externalisation in Australian local government has demonstrated that serious flaws exist in numerous consultant reports. In an effort to contribute to this nascent body of empirical scholarship, this paper critically examines ACIL Allen's (2016) An Economic Assessment of Recasting Council Boundaries in South Australia which prescribes the wholesale amalgamation of South Australian local councils.

An estimation using Real Options,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transmission Expansion Planning; Real options; Option to defer; Binomial tree; Flexibility,RESTRUCTURED ELECTRICITY MARKETS; VALUATION,"In deregulated markets, Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is usually performed by a central network planner seeking to maximize social welfare. In doing that, the network planner commonly follows a traditional project valuation, considering a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology, although incorporating uncertainty and reliability considerations. Accordingly, once the optimal transmission expansion plan is determined, the network planner frequently auctions the needed investments, obligating the investor to execute the expansion in the fixed (inflexible) terms defined in the bidding process. A key problem is that DCF does not take into account the responses of the planner when uncertainties are resolved because DCF evaluates the project with the information available today. In TEP, managerial flexibility may be valuable because optimal decisions may change over time with the release of new information. Transmission investors may want to defer or expand according to such information. The aim of this article is to estimate the value of adding some flexibility in TEP through real options. In particular, by means of using a real-option approach with binomial trees, we study the benefits for a social network planner of having the option to defer some transmission investments. Our results suggest that incorporating flexibility in TEP may increase social welfare. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We document material deprivation differences between immigrants and nationalsthe deprivation gapand measure the extent to which income differentials (and other sociodemographic differences) explain this gap using a combination of non-parametric methods and a versatile graphical device. We find a large and significant deprivation gap against Portuguese immigrants, whatever the indicator considered. The extent to which the gap is merely a reflection of differences in income, however, depends on what deprivation items are taken into consideration. Income differences almost fully account for material deprivation differences when the latter is measured using the items included in the official EU social indicator of material deprivation. Inclusion of housing condition indicators mitigates this relationship and we then find compelling evidence that the deprivation gap is not entirely accounted for by income differentials.","[Hildebrand, Vincent A.] York Univ, Glendon Coll, Dept Econ, York Hall 363,2275 Bayview Ave, Toronto, ON M4N 3M6, Canada; [Alperin, Maria Noel Pi; Van Kerm, Philippe] LISER, 3 Ave Fonte, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Alperin, Maria Noel Pi] Univ Montpellier, LAMETA, Montpellier, France",York University - Canada; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier,"Hildebrand, VA (通讯作者)，York Univ, Glendon Coll, Dept Econ, York Hall 363,2275 Bayview Ave, Toronto, ON M4N 3M6, Canada.",vincent@econ.yorku.ca; marianoel.pialperin@liser.lu; philippe.vankerm@liser.lu,"Van Kerm, Philippe/B-5998-2015; Hildebrand, Vincent/AAF-9662-2021; Van Kerm, Philippe/N-8822-2019","Van Kerm, Philippe/0000-0002-0639-9097; Van Kerm, Philippe/0000-0002-0639-9097; Hildebrand, Vincent/0000-0002-4055-2374",Luxembourg Fonds National de la Recherche [FNR/06/15/08]; Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg; Bourse Formation-Recherche from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg [BFR08-019],Luxembourg Fonds National de la Recherche(Luxembourg National Research Fund); Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg; Bourse Formation-Recherche from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg,"This research is part of the MeDIM project (Advances in the Measurement of Discrimination, Inequality and Mobility) supported by the Luxembourg Fonds National de la Recherche (contract FNR/06/15/08) and by core funding for CEPS/INSTEAD from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg.

We study two main factors, fines and social monitoring, that influence the firm's decision in that situation. First, we find all the possible equilibria of our model and examine conditions of those two factors that lead to each equilibrium. Using the equilibrium conditions, we then study the optimal enforcement policies that induce the most socially desirable equilibrium and improve social welfare within each equilibrium. Our main findings are as follows. First, the two factors have a complementary relationship in getting the most desirable equilibrium: Certain high levels of fines and social monitoring are both needed. Second, if making the social monitoring above the certain critical level is impossible, setting the level of the fines as high as possible may be the optimal enforcement policy. Finally, if setting the fines above the certain critical level is not available, either, setting the level of the fines as low as possible might be optimal, and the higher level of the social monitoring does not necessarily bring higher social welfare.","[Lee, Dongryul] Sungshin Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 02844, South Korea; [Baik, Kyung Hwan] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Sungshin Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 02844, South Korea.",dongryul78@gmail.com,"Baik, Kyung Hwan/ABE-6007-2021; Baik, Kyung Hwan/IAQ-5601-2023","Baik, Kyung Hwan/0000-0003-3032-9686",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A5A8024891],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"We are grateful to Shrawantee Saha, Wooyoung Lim, Gyun Cheol Gu, Eric Bahel, Jong Hwa Lee, and seminar participants at Sungshin University, Konkuk University, Sogang University, and UNIST for their helpful comments and suggestions.

However, such analyses neglect to consider the effects of failed collusion attempts, wherein information revealed in the negotiation process may affect bidding behaviour. We experimentally test a setup in which theory predicts no collusion and no information revelation in first-price auctions. The results reveal a hitherto overlooked failing of the first-price mechanism: failed collusion attempts distort bidding behaviour, resulting in a loss of seller revenue and efficiency. Moreover, the first-price mechanism does not result in less collusion than the second-price mechanism. We conclude that, while the features of the first-price mechanism may have the potential to deter bidder collusion, the role of beliefs in guiding bidding behaviour make it highly susceptible to distortions arising from the informational properties of collusive negotiation. Auction designers should take this phenomenon into account when choosing the auction mechanism. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It tries to characterize a business practice that consists in reducing prices and maintaining (or increasing) profit margins by reducing the quality of goods and services while still presenting them as the same as before. The paper is primarily concerned with the practice of producing inferior quality goods by reducing the quantity of inputs used in the production process, or mixing inputs with cheaper constituents. The proposed term for this practice, industrial seigniorage, is based on the historical privilege of feudal lords (from Old French seigneur), whopossessing the right to mint gold coinsmade a profit by adding cheaper base metals to the bullion. The present, essentially exploratory investigation attempts to delineate the widespread existence of such practices in various industrial sectors. It strives to explain the fundamental elements of consumer behavior that enable this practice to exist and discusses the effects of industrial seigniorage on several social issues. The attempt of the paper is finally to show that contrary to the ideology of capitalism, competition does not necessary lead to benefits for consumers or to an increase in product quality.","[Melmies, Jordan] Univ Lille, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille,"Melmiès, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, Econ, Batiment SH2, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",jordan.melmies@univ-lille1.fr,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Using a sample of 20 countries with dual banking systems over the 2000-2014 period, our results show significant differences in the drivers of Islamic and conventional banks' pricing behavior. Conventional banks with stronger market power set lower deposit rates but market power is not significant for Islamic banks. In predominantly Muslim environments, conventional banks set higher deposit rates and further higher when their market power is lower. Whereas conventional banks are influenced by the competitiveness of Islamic banks, Islamic banks are only affected by their peers in predominantly Muslim countries. Our findings have important implications regarding competition and bank stability in dual banking markets.","[Meslier, Celine; Risfandy, Tastaftiyan; Tarazi, Amine] Univ Limoges, LAPE, 5 Rue Felix Eboue, F-87031 Limoges, France; [Risfandy, Tastaftiyan] Univ Sebelas Maret, Fac Econ & Business, Jl Ir Sutami 36A, Surakarta 57126, Indonesia",Universite de Limoges; Sebelas Maret University,"Risfandy, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sebelas Maret, Fac Econ & Business, Jl Ir Sutami 36A, Surakarta 57126, Indonesia.",celine.meslier@unilim.fr; tastaftiyan.risfandy@staff.uns.ac.id; amine.tarazi@unilim.fr,"Tarazi, Amine/GQP-4387-2022; Risfandy, Tastaftiyan/U-7855-2019; Meslier, Céline Crouzille/AAQ-4136-2021","Tarazi, Amine/0000-0001-8385-2994; Risfandy, Tastaftiyan/0000-0002-5544-726X; Meslier, Céline Crouzille/0000-0002-6194-1272",DG-RSTHE (DIKTI) of the Republic of Indonesia,DG-RSTHE (DIKTI) of the Republic of Indonesia,"We thank participants of the conference The Future of Islamic Banking and Economics in Search of New Normal at the Central Bank of Turkey in 2016 for the constructive comments in the early version of this paper.

We review how financial conditions and outright financial crises have posed difficulties for each of the main international monetary systems in the last 150 years or so: the gold standard, the interwar period, the Bretton Woods system, and the current system of floating exchange rates. We argue that even as the world economy has evolved and sentiments have shifted among widely different policy regimes, there remain three fundamental challenges for any international monetary and financial system: How should exchange rates between national currencies be determined? How can countries with balance of payments deficits reduce these without sharply contracting their economies and with minimal risk of possible negative spillovers abroad? How can the international system ensure that countries have access to an adequate supply of international liquidity-financial resources generally acceptable to foreigners in all circumstances? In concluding, we evaluate how the current international monetary system answers these questions.","[Obstfeld, Maurice] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Obstfeld, Maurice] Int Monetary Fund, Res, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Taylor, Alan M.] Univ Calif Davis, Econ & Finance, Davis, CA 95616 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Obstfeld, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Obstfeld, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",,,,,,,,94,26,32,1,22,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Although two firms are ex-ante identical, there are asymmetric Cournot equilibria as well as the symmetric equilibrium under the price-cap regulation, when the price-cap level is binding. By contrast, the Stackelberg equilibrium is unique and equivalent to the most asymmetric Cournot equilibrium under a binding price-cap level. We present several comparative statics results with respect to the equilibrium outcomes. The main concern of this study is the welfare effect of a change in a price-cap level. We show that when asymmetric Cournot equilibria or the Stackelberg equilibrium are focused on, a reduction in a price-cap level may be socially harmful even if the price-cap level is more than the competitive price.","[Okumura, Yasunori] TUMSAT, Dept Logist & Informat Engn, Koto Ku, 2-1-6 Etchujima, Tokyo 1358533, Japan",,"Okumura, Y (通讯作者)，TUMSAT, Dept Logist & Informat Engn, Koto Ku, 2-1-6 Etchujima, Tokyo 1358533, Japan.",okuyasu@gs.econ.keio.ac.jp,"Okumura, Yasunori/AAO-2073-2021",,JSPS KAKENHI [JP16K03612]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03612] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","An earlier version of this paper is presented at the ISS Industrial Organization Workshop at the University of Tokyo.

But I find that the quasi-experiment is invalid, as teacher switching is correlated with changes in student preparedness. Adjusting for this, I find moderate bias in VA scores, perhaps 10-35 percent as large, in variance terms, as teachers' causal effects.

This analysis focuses on road freight transport of selected produce (carrots, cabbage, apples and pears) with the aim to appraise the sustainability of road freight transport of these for the Slovene market. To this end, we take into account self-sufficiency, import and export features, transport needs, produce origin and prices differences between domestic and non-domestic produce. The method used for obtaining transported quantities, exported from and imported to the county, was material flow accounts (MFA). Then we undertook an analysis of sustainability of road transport of produce where we considered the country's transport needs. The study finds that road freight transport for selected produce is not sustainable. Recognising the normative dimensions of sustainability, the role of social marketing in this context is explored and suggestions on how to promote more sustainable transport solutions advanced.","[Bonca, Sandra; Udovc, Andrej] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Rodela, Romina] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, Huddinge, Sweden",University of Ljubljana; Sodertorn University,"Bonca, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",sandrabonca@gmail.com,"Udovč, Andrej/AAX-1091-2020","Rodela, Romina/0000-0003-0070-6794; Udovc, Andrej/0000-0002-3589-488X","Slovene Ministry of higher education, science and technology as part of Innovative scheme","Slovene Ministry of higher education, science and technology as part of Innovative scheme","The main author acknowledges funding received from the Slovene Ministry of higher education, science and technology as part of Innovative scheme for co-financing doctoral study.

The factors influencing the emissions of individuals are largely undocumented, but they are assumed to be the same for all, be they low or high emitters. We use a household travel survey conducted in the metropolitan area of Barcelona to differentiate the factors that result in different rates of emission. It shows that the top 10% of emitters produce 49% of total emissions while 'non-daily' emitters make up 38.5% of the sample. We adopt a quantile regression approach, which reveals significant socioeconomic differences between groups of emitters. Gender, income and home-municipality type are influential in accounting for CO2 emissions for all groups. Educational level appears to be less significant, and occupation shows no significance at all. The study confirms the ineffective nature of toll policy design in the area. Overall, socioeconomic factors have different impacts on different emitting groups, but these characteristics do not impact equally across all the population. Quantile regression using mobility survey data gathered from various cities would provide useful evidence for improving the design of urban mobility policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We first construct a theoretical model in which imports stimulate innovation through cost-reducing knowledge spillovers. We then employ a combined micro dataset of Chinese manufacturing firms to estimate the effects of imported intermediates on the firm's R&D investment. The dataset allows us to construct firm-year level instruments for importing and exporting that are uncorrelated with the innovation decision of the firm. Our estimations find that: (1) importing intermediates tends to increase importing firms' R&D intensity; and that (2) exporting also increases importing firms' R&D intensity. Examining the channels through which importing affects innovation, we find that importing from high-income sources has a greater impact on innovation. High-tech firms tend to experience greater increases in innovation intensity, as do private firms. Our results are supported by a series of robustness checks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We outline a method to construct country-level wind resource supply curves, delineated by resource quality and other parameters. Using mesoscale reanalysis data, we generate estimates for wind quality, both terrestrial and offshore, across the globe. Because not all land or water area is suitable for development, appropriate database layers provide exclusions to reduce the total resource to its technical potential. We expand upon estimates from related studies by: using a globally consistent data source of uniquely detailed wind speed characterizations; assuming a non constant coefficient of performance for adjusting power curves for altitude; categorizing the distance from resource sites to the electric power grid; and characterizing offshore exclusions on the basis of sea ice concentrations. The product, then, is technical potential by country, classified by resource quality as determined by net capacity factor. Additional classifications dimensions are available, including distance to transmission networks for terrestrial wind and distance to shore and water depth for offshore. We estimate the total global wind generation potential of 560 PWh for terrestrial wind with 90% of resource classified as low-to-mid quality, and 315 PWh for offshore wind with 67% classified as mid-to-high quality. These estimates are based on 3.5 MW composite wind turbines with 90 m hub heights, 0.95 availability, 90% array efficiency, and 5 MW/km(2) deployment density in non-excluded areas. We compare the underlying technical assumption and results with other global assessments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This is arguably counter intuitive since the gains from doing the R&D required for technological catch up are thought to be very high and Griffith et al. (2004) have documented that in the OECD returns increase dramatically with distance from the frontier. Exploiting recent advances in instrumental variables in a varying coefficient context we find that the rates of return follow an inverted U: they rise with distance to the frontier and then fall thereafter, potentially turning negative for the poorest countries. The findings provide a new mechanism underlying the twin income peaks - poor countries cannot exploit technological transfer for convergence while middle income countries can converge rapidly to the frontier. The low returns found for poor countries does not diminish the centrality of technological transfer for development, but rather suggests the importance of factors complementary to R&D, such as education, the quality of scientific infrastructure, the overall functioning of the national innovation system, and the quality of the private sector, which become increasingly weak with distance from the frontier and offset the catch up effect, (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Goni, Edwin] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA; [Maloney, William F.] EFI, Kernersville, NC 27284 USA; [Maloney, William F.] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Inter-American Development Bank; The World Bank,"Maloney, WF (通讯作者)，EFI, Kernersville, NC 27284 USA.;Maloney, WF (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",wmaloney@worldbank.org,,,Knowledge for Change Trust Fund (KCP),Knowledge for Change Trust Fund (KCP),"We thank Aart Kraay, Daniel Lederman, David Mayer-Foulkes and Luis Serven for very helpful comments.

Innovative entrants use both consumption goods in their innovation technologies to capture international technological spillovers. Households also consume both goods. Specifically, I compare the equilibrium implications from the model with technology spillovers to the ones from an equivalent model without technology spillovers, i.e. a model where entrants only use domestic final goods in their R&D expenditures. With these two models at hand, new insights on the interplay of endogenous growth and long-run risks, technology spillovers, complete financial markets, and international trade are obtained, particularly with respect to international macro and asset pricing anomalies. The novel technology spillover channel has the potential to help explaining a number of these anomalies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

At present, ownership unbundling is the predominant form of unbundling in Europe. From a policy perspective, a successful unbundling regime would require that the benefits of increased competition in power generation would at least offset the associated efficiency losses from vertical divestiture. Since evidence on this topic is scarce, this study helps fill this void by empirically estimating the magnitude of economies of vertical integration (EVI) between electricity generation and transmission based on a quadratic cost function. For this purpose we employ unique firm-level panel data of European electricity utilities. Our results confirm the presence of substantial EVI of 14% for the median sized integrated utility.

Not only do we implement simulations in order to detect prospective defaulters, we also estimate the probabilities of actual firm bankruptcies and compare the predicted defaults and actual defaults. We find, first, that an economically sizable number of firms are predicted to fail when their customers default on their trade debt. Second, these prospective defaulters are indeed more likely to go bankrupt than other firms. Third, firms that have abundant external sources of financing or whose transaction partners have such abundant sources are less likely to go bankrupt even when they are predicted to default. This provides evidence for the existence and relevance of firms - called deep pockets by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) - that can act as shock absorbers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Women's labor supply particularly increases in response to a young child if there are older siblings or other adults in the household.

The present paper analyzes the value of climate services which are aimed at improving agricultural productivity through a reduction in weather-associated risks. The first part provides a theoretical foundation for estimating the value of climate services based on a stochastic life-cycle model of a rural household which faces uncertainty with respect to the timing and the size of an adverse weather shock. We subsequently calibrate the model to match the environment of coffee producers in the Cusco region of Peru and provide a range of estimates for the value of climate services for a single average household, the region, and the country as a whole. In the second part of the paper we use empirical data to corroborate the numerical estimates. We assess the value of climate services in the agricultural sector in Cusco based on a choice experiment approach. Data are analyzed using a standard as well as a random parameter logit model allowing for preference heterogeneity. Farmers show a significant willingness-to-pay for enhanced climate services which is particularly related to the service accuracy and geographic resolution. On average, the yearly value of a climate service in the coffee sector is found to be $21 per ha and $8.2 million for Peru as a whole. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

I use a comprehensive firm-level administrative dataset and exploit kinks in hiring incentives generated by the quotas to estimate the effects of this policy. I find that the program increased native employment at substantial cost to firms, as demonstrated by increasing exit rates and decreasing total employment at surviving firms.

Using a sign-identified structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model that allows for both time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility, we find that supply and demand shocks are the main drivers of natural gas price fluctuations during 1993-2015, with speculative activities playing a minor role during a portion of the sample period. We also find that after the recent shale boom, the supply and demand of natural gas in the US have become somewhat more elastic. An examination of several volatile episodes during the sample period suggest that though natural gas price fluctuations are predominately determined by fundamental factors, supply and demand shocks have significantly evolved over time.

An empirical investigation of the hypothesis presents a challenge due to concerns of endogeneity and selection: the post-conflict level of democracy is endogenous to the pre-conflict level. Further, for a given time period, either a number of countries have not experienced civil war; or if they did, did not resolve the conflict. We overcome this selection bias by implementing a three-step extension to the Heckman procedure using an unbalanced cross-country panel of 77 countries over the period 1971-2005. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that a standard deviation improvement in the existing level of democracy reduces the probability of civil war by approximately 9 percentage points and a corresponding improvement in expected post-conflict democratization increases the probability of conflict by approximately 48 percentage points.","[Bang, James T.] St Ambrose Univ, Dept Econ, Davenport, IA 52803 USA; [Mitra, Aniruddha] Bard Coll, Econ Program, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA",Saint Ambrose University,"Bang, JT (通讯作者)，St Ambrose Univ, Dept Econ, Davenport, IA 52803 USA.",BangJamesT@sau.edu,"Bang, James T./AAI-5922-2020","Bang, James T./0000-0002-7701-8220",,,,,44,2,2,1,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

We focus more specifically on situations where high inequalities and widespread access to credit coexist, and argue that, even when institutions maintain more or less equal access to finance, there may be a dynamic, positive circular relationship between inequality and financial development. However, even if there is some evidence in the literature of a positive causal impact of inequality on credit, this does not preclude other important, cofounding factors. The conclusions concerning the distributional impact of finance are more ambiguous. A survey of the empirical literature highlights several issues that must be tackled. First, endogeneity: reverse causality and coincidental factors are major concerns. Second, the choice of consistent measurements for the key variables (both credit and inequality) has strong empirical implications, and must be grounded on relevant theoretical channels. Third, those circular dynamics have substantial policy implications for emerging economies, since an increasing number face a joint increase in inequality and credit.","[Bazillier, Remi] Univ Orleans, LEO, CNRS UMR 7322, Y Orleans, France; [Hericourt, Jerome] Univ Lille, LEM, CNRS UMR 9221, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Hericourt, Jerome] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, ICI EA 2652, Brest, France; [Hericourt, Jerome] CEPII, Brest, France",Universite de Orleans; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"Bazillier, R (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, LEO, CNRS UMR 7322, Y Orleans, France.",remi.bazillier@univ-orleans.fr,,"Hericourt, Jerome/0000-0002-1870-7931; Bazillier, Remi/0000-0001-6106-3484",FEPS,FEPS,"The authors would like to thank FEPS and members of the FEPS 'Finance and Inequality' project (in particular Gary Dimsky and Annina Kaltenbrunner) for their support and fruitful discussions.

An equilibrium is Markov if play depends on the history only through the firms' beliefs about costs and calendar time. We characterize symmetric linear Markov equilibria as solutions to a boundary value problem. In every such equilibrium, given a long enough horizon, play converges to the static complete information outcome for the realized costs, but each firm only learns its competitors' average cost. The weights assigned to costs and beliefs under the equilibrium strategies are non-monotone over time. We explain this by decomposing incentives into signalling and learning, and discuss implications for prices, quantities, and welfare.","[Bonatti, Alessandro; Cisternas, Gonzalo] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Toikka, Juuso] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bonatti, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,45,15,19,4,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In this paper, I document evidence that this intergovernmental incentive inherent in public sector defined benefit pension systems distorts the amount and timing of income for public school teachers. I use the introduction of a policy that required experience-rating on earnings increases above a certain limit in a differences-in-differences framework to identify whether districts are willing to pay the full costs of their earnings promises. Because of the design of the policy, overall earnings of teachers near retirement did not change. Instead, districts that previously provided one-time pay increases shifted to smaller increments spread out over several years. In addition, some districts that did not practice pension-spiking prior to the reform appear to begin providing payments up to the new, lower limit, perhaps due to increased salience of the fiscal incentive. Therefore, the policy was ineffective at decreasing pension costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the second study, the actions of the receivers were compared to their answers on the World Values Survey question on trust; and in the third study, a target-specific measure of trust was compared to the actions of the receivers.

However, Ogawa (Int Tax Public Finance 20 (3): 474-484, 2013) has shown that the simultaneous-move outcome prevails when capital is entirely owned by residents. We develop a model in which capital ownership can vary freely between these two polar cases. We show that there exists a unique degree of residential capital ownership such that the equilibrium switches from the Stackelberg to the simultaneous-move outcomes. The chance for the simultaneous-move outcome to prevail increases with the extent of production asymmetry between regions. Partial ownership also induces a novel effect of tax leadership that we call the preference reversion effect.","[Hindriks, Jean] Catholic Univ Louvain, Dept Econ, Voie Roman Pays 34,L1-03-01, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Hindriks, Jean] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34,L1-03-01, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Nishimura, Yukihiro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Osaka University,"Nishimura, Y (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama Cho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",jean.hindriks@uclouvain.be; ynishimu@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology [24530348, 15K03511]; Strategic Young Researcher Overseas Visits Program for Accelerating Brain Circulation (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) [J2402]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03511, 24530348] Funding Source: KAKEN; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J2402] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Strategic Young Researcher Overseas Visits Program for Accelerating Brain Circulation (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","The authors would like to thank the Editor-in-Chief (Ronald Davies) and two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions to our paper.

To study the effect of debt on the investment-consumption dynamics in those countries, we first discuss the causes, sources, and adjustment processes of current account deficits in industrialized economies, with a particular focus on the Eurozone member states. We then introduce new empirical measures of sustainability. Instead of using the common measure of external debt over GDP, we use debt over assets. To study the dynamics of external debt sustainability we use an intertemporal model of finite time horizon, which we numerically solve through Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method. Using our numerical solution method, we provide a calibration of the external debt sustainability for Italy, Spain, and Germany.

We compare the impact of two types of shocks: i) stock market volatility shocks and ii) policy uncertainty shocks. Using quarterly data from 1986Q1 to 2016Q1, this issue is analysed using Bayesian VAR models. Our results suggest that policy uncertainty seems to matter more than stock market volatility. Stock market volatility shocks appear to robustly have significant effects on Danish GDP growth. Policy uncertainty shocks, on the other hand, reliably lowers GDP growth in all five Nordic countries in a statistically significant manner. Statistically significant effects of policy uncertainty shocks on the Anglo-Saxon countries in our sample are harder to establish and are, in our preferred specification, only found for the United Kingdom.","[Stockhammar, Par] Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden; [Osterholm, Par] Univ Orebro, Sch Business, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Orebro University,"Stockhammar, P (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden.",par.stockhammar@konj.se; par.osterholm@oru.se,"Österholm, Pär/ABD-8486-2020","Österholm, Pär/0000-0002-4840-7649",,,,,33,19,20,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The model includes wage inflation as an additional target jointly with domestic price inflation and the output gap in a Taylor-type interest rate rule operating with a sterilized foreign exchange (FX) intervention rule. Our results show a complementary relationship between wage inflation targeting and price inflation targeting. That is, by supplementing price inflation targeting with wage inflation targeting, welfare improves for cases with and without sterilized FX intervention. When intervention is in place, wage inflation targeting has the added advantage of reducing the volatilities of nominal exchange rate and foreign exchange reserves thereby promoting a more sustainable conduct of FX intervention.","[Xie, Taojun] Singapore Management Univ, Sim Kee Boon Inst Financial Econ, Singapore, Singapore; [Liu, Jingting; Alba, Joseph D.; Chia, Wai-Mun] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Singapore Management University; Nanyang Technological University,"Xie, TJ (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sim Kee Boon Inst Financial Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",tjxie@smu.edu.sg; jtliu001@e.ntu.edu.sg; ajoalba@ntu.edu.sg; aswmchia@ntu.edu.sg,"Alba, Joseph/AAH-2545-2020","Xie, Taojun/0000-0001-7855-1118; Liu, Jingting/0000-0002-0965-652X; Alba, Joseph Dennis/0000-0002-0916-8884",Singapore's Ministry of Education (MOE) AcRF Tier 1 Research Grant [2014-T1-002-096],Singapore's Ministry of Education (MOE) AcRF Tier 1 Research Grant,"We thank Guay Lim, Tim Robinson, Efrem Castelnuovo, the anonymous referee and the editor for their constructive and helpful comments.

In the theoretical part of the paper, by developing a Solow Swan growth model augmented with financial markets in the tradition of Wu, Hou, and Cheng (2010), we show that debt from credit markets and equity from stock markets are two long run determinants of GDP per capita. In the empirical part, the long-run relationship is estimated for a panel of 40 countries over the period 1989-2011 by means of Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common-Correlated Effects (CCE), both of which allow cross-sectional dependencies. While the cross-sectional findings vary across countries, the panel data analyses reveal that both channels have positive long-run effects on steady-state level of GDP per capita, and the contribution of the credit markets is substantially greater. As a policy implication, we recommend that policy makers place special emphasis on implementing policies that result in the deepening of financial markets, including institutional and legal measures to strengthen creditor and investor rights and contract enforcement. Thus, by fostering the development of a country's financial sector, economic growth will be accelerated. (C) 2016 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Assuming that deposits are traded on a market with a uniform price, we find that the outcome is efficient if the coalition is a price taker in both markets, but inefficient if it acts strategically in the deposit market but not in the fuel market, or acts strategically in both markets. The latter result demonstrates that Harstad's (2012, Theorem I) 'efficiency-despite-strategic-action result' is not robust with respect to changes in the concepts of the deposit market and market (or bargaining) power.

This paper shows, both analytically and numerically, that beliefs-driven aggregate instability associated with such a balanced-budget rule is less of a problem in a small open economy integrated in the world asset and goods markets. This is because cross-border capital flows and endogenous international price adjustments produce income effects that reduce the likelihood of sunspot equilibria. From a policy perspective, our results relieve possible concerns that balanced-budget rules and reliance on income taxes to achieve budget objective could have destabilizing effects on the economy.

Combining data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey, the Deslnventar database, the U.S. Geological Survey, and district-level employment indicators, this paper explores how a large earthquake in Indonesia affected labor market outcomes, in particular the evolution of wages across sectors. I find that the earthquake had a positive effect on wage growth for workers who were employed in the agricultural sector at baseline. I propose two mechanisms for this result: a higher growth rate of the price of rice and a downward shift in the supply of workers in the agricultural sector. I show that evidence mainly supports the latter: labor shifted out of the agricultural sector into the construction sector, raising the marginal product of labor in agriculture.","[Kirchberger, Martina] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Kirchberger, M (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",martina.kirchberger@tcd.ie,"Kirchberger, Martina/HGU-3436-2022",,AXA Research Fund,AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),"I am indebted to Stefan Dercon and Doug Gollin for their support, generous time, and many helpful discussions.

Sufficient conditions are known under which the first-order approach (FOA) is valid when the spanning condition holds. In this paper, a complete solution to the problem is provided. Thus, the problem is solved even when the FOA is not valid. The solution has two main steps. The first step fully characterizes the set of implementable actions. The second step establishes that the optimal contract can be found by applying the FOA to the newly identified set of feasible actions. This procedure correctly solves a famous counterexample due to Mirrlees in which the standard FOA is not valid. A much simpler and economically more compelling counterexample is provided. Moreover, the model provides a tractable environment in which it is possible to study comparative statics even when the FOA is not justified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We examine the optimal policy combination of tax rate, disaster-preventive expenditure, and productive government expenditure in a neoclassical growth model, in which natural disasters occur stochastically and partially destroy existing capital. Based on this model, we can decompose the welfare effect of raising preventive expenditure into three effects: the damage reduction, crowding out, and precautionary effects. By identifying these marginal benefits and costs, we obtain the policy conditions that maximize household welfare. Furthermore, we show that optimal prevention is increasing in disaster probability, and by using a numerical example, we show that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between the expected growth rate and disaster probability.

The prevailing view is that anticipation of imitation reduces exporters' incentive to export goods to jurisdictions with 'Weak' patent regimes. This empirical paper uses new measures of how the destination-country patent system can affect trade. In contrast with existing studies which assume would-be exporters can always get a patent in the target foreign market, we construct measures of the bias against foreign patent applicants and patents Which may block imported goods. We find evidence that the presence of destination-country blocking patents has the larger (negative) impact on international trade. Being refused a patent also has a negative impact on trade but the magnitude is smaller. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Much of the recent work in econometrics has emphasized two themes: The first is the fragility of statistical identification. The other, related theme involves the way economists make large-sample approximations to the distributions of estimators and test statistics. I will discuss how these issues of identification and alternative asymptotic approximations have been studied in three research areas: analysis of linear endogenous regressor models with many and/or weak instruments; nonparametric models with endogenous regressors; and estimation of partially identified parameters.

Previous literature on service and marital stability is comprised of mixed results and has often ignored the timing of these effects. This timing is important as it helps disclose the nature of causality and has implications for both military and social security policies. Using a trajectory specification, I estimate the effect of military service on the likelihood of divorce during the volunteer's period of service and the years following. Two veteran cohorts are examined, those who served during the early twenty-first century wars and those who served during the early 1980s. Among my results, the former cohort is shown to have had their divorce probability increased in the first 2 years post-service, while the opposite effect is found for the latter cohort. Unlike many previous studies of military service and marital stability, I find that effects are not overly dissimilar across racial groups.","[Routon, P.

Solutions to these problems are not straightforward and the methods often used in the literature are contentious, as this review aims to make clear.

Excessive household debt arises due to exuberance shocks on house price expectations, which drive a wedge between the actual and the underlying fundamental value of houses. The estimated model also features long term fixed-rate borrowing and lending across two types of households, and differentiates between the flow and the stock of household debt. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) Monetary tightening is able to reduce the stock of real mortgage debt, but leads to an increase in the household debt-to-income ratio. (ii) Among the policy tools we consider, tightening in mortgage interest deduction and regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) are the most effective and least costly in reducing household debt, followed by increasing property taxes and monetary tightening. (iii) Although mortgage interest deduction is a broader tool than regulatory LTV, and therefore potentially more costly in terms of output loss, it is effective in reducing overall mortgage debt, since its direct reach also extends to home equity loans. (iv) Lowering regulatory LTV and mortgage interest deductions from their current levels would be welfare improving, while we find weak support for systematic leaning against household imbalances through monetary policy.","[Alpanda, Sami] Univ Cent Florida, Coll Business Adm, Dept Econ, 4336 Scorpius St, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Zubairy, Sarah] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Zubairy, S (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",sami.alpanda@ucf.edu; szubairy@tamu.edu,,"Zubairy, Sarah/0000-0002-5452-0250",,,,,51,62,66,1,40,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

Using the industry-level method in the R&D literature, e.g. Griliches (1973), we regress industry TFP growth on lagged external knowledge stock growth, where the latter are outside industry measures weighted by matrices based on (a) flows of intermediate consumption or (b) workers. Our main new result is that we find (controlling for time and industry effects) statistically significant correlations between TFP growth and knowledge stock growth in (a) external R&D and (b) total intangibles (excluding R&D).

Projections for the population growth rate in urban areas do not paint a very optimistic picture for energy conservation policies. In addition, the concentration of economic activities around coastal areas calls for new prospects to be formulated for energy policy. In this context, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, we analyse the effect of the urbanization process of the Chinese economy in terms of the long-run patterns of residential energy consumption at national level. By using the concept of club convergence, we examine whether electricity and coal consumption in rural and urban areas converge to the same long-run equilibrium or whether in fact they diverge. Second, the impact of the regional concentration of the economic activity on energy consumption patterns is also assessed by source of energy across Chinese regions from 1995 to 2011. Our results suggest that the process of urbanization has led to coal being replaced by electricity in urban residential energy consumption. In rural areas, the evidence is mixed. The club convergence analysis confirms that rural and urban residential energy consumption converge to different steady-states. At the regional level, we also confirm the effect of the regional concentration of economic activity on residential energy consumption. The existence of these regional clusters converging to different equilibrium levels is indicative of the need of regional-tailored set of energy policies in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In comparing four estimated medium-scale NK DSGE models with real and nominal frictions, we seek to shed light on the quantitative implications of omitting trend inflation, that is, positive steady state inflation. We compare certain population characteristics and the IRFs for the four models by applying two loss functions based on a point distance criterion and on a distribution distance criterion, respectively. Finally, we compare the RMSE forecasts and we consider also an indirect inference test. We repeat the analysis for three sub-periods: the Great Inflation, the Great Moderation and the union of the two periods. We do not find strong evidence that a model with trend inflation should always be preferred. During periods of high inflation or when a backward looking component, indexed to past inflation, is not incorporated in the model, using a model that employs trend inflation can improve the analysis. Nevertheless, where there is uncertainty concerning the change of an inflation regime, such as the recent drop, we suggest adopting a traditional approach that does not use trend inflation.","[Loberto, Michele] Banca Italia, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Perricone, Chiara] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Perricone, C (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",michele.loberto@bancaditalia.it; chiara.perricone@uniroma2.it,,"perricone, chiara/0000-0002-1575-6068",,,,,31,0,0,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using a sample of 1,169 Spanish subsidiaries owned by foreign OECD and EU parent companies and a sample of 317 EU subsidiaries owned by Spanish parent companies, taken from the AMADEUS Database for the period 2005 to 2014, and a simple tax rate difference as a measure of the tax incentive, the authors obtain a negative effect of corporate income taxes on reported profits. When the tax rate differences between Spain and the foreign countries vary by one percentage point, reported profits vary by approximately 2.7 to 3%. This is consistent with profit shifting activity by corporations and matches the empirical results in the literature. Furthermore, the authors calculate the impact of this activity on Spain's tax revenues from the sample of Spanish subsidiary companies. They obtain that the tax revenues vary from year to year, depending on the level of taxation of the main investor countries in Spain in comparison to the Spanish tax rate.","[Castillo Murciego, Angela; Lopez-Laborda, Julio] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Murciego, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.",acasmur@unizar.es,,,"Government of Aragon; European Regional Development Fund; Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport","Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Regional Development Fund(European Union (EU)); Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport","We would like to thank the reviewers and readers of the e-journal Economics for their comments and suggestions, and the Government of Aragon and the European Regional Development Fund (Public Economics Research Group) for the funding received.

Overall, our results indicate that, besides age population composition, education level has a big impact on the economic behavior of households and, hence, on the aggregate economy. Educated households tend to participate more and longer in the labor market, to produce more and, consequently, to consume more. As differences in consumption are lower than in labor income, they are able to contribute to the public system with higher taxes and contributions, and they depend less on public transfers over their lifecycle.

Underpricing is also related to several control variables (offering size, previous IPO number and previous market return).","[Acedo-Ramirez, Miguel A.; Ruiz-Cabestre, Francisco J.] Univ La Rioja, C Ciguena 60, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"Acedo-Ramírez, MA (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, C Ciguena 60, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain.",miguel-angel.acedo@unirioja.es,"Cabestre, Fco.

We estimate a four-equation system that explains the main obstacles young people face in their insertion process: part-time work, overeducation, fixed-term contracts and long unemployment spells; the model also considers the impact of the latter variable on the other three. Moreover, a synthetic indicator of transition quality based on the estimation of this model is developed. We conclude that men experience a better insertion process than women at every level of education (except for higher vocational training), although the gender gap is greater for long-cycle university programmes. Furthermore, when field of study is considered, men from most specializations enjoy a smoother transition than their female counterparts; nevertheless, women have the advantage in some female-dominated fields. A further analysis of gender differences reveals that they are due to the fact of being male or female to a great extent. The results also highlight that school-leavers from work-oriented programmes and those specialized in fields that provide them with more specific skills are more likely to succeed in the transition.","[Acosta-Ballesteros, Juan; Pilar Osorno-Del Rosal, M.; Maria Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Olga] Univ La Laguna, La Laguna ULL, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Dept Econ Contabilidad & Finanzas, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Osorno-Del Rosal, MP (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ Contabilidad & Finanzas, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Apartado 456, San Cristobal la Laguna 38200, Santa Cruz De T, Spain.",mosorno@ull.edu.es,"Acosta-Ballesteros, Juan/K-7742-2014; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Olga M/K-9414-2014; Acosta-Ballesteros, Juan/ABD-5381-2020","Acosta-Ballesteros, Juan/0000-0002-0044-3042; Acosta-Ballesteros, Juan/0000-0002-0044-3042; Osorno-del Rosal, Maria del Pilar/0000-0003-2085-1999",Universidad de La Laguna (ULL) [1075/2015],Universidad de La Laguna (ULL),This work was supported by the Universidad de La Laguna (ULL) grant number 1075/2015.,,51,4,4,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To that end, we estimate a simultaneous seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) model with data from the Spanish Time Use Survey for 2009-2010. Results indicate that being female generates a positive influence on the time devoted to computer communication, and being male generates a positive influence on the time devoted to computer gaming. We also find that a greater number of family members with secondary studies generates a positive influence on the time spent on computer gaming. Children with better health spend more time on both of these activities and, finally, living in a larger city produces a positive effect on the time dedicated to computer gaming.","[Alberto Molina, Jose; Carlos Campana, Juan; Ortega, Raquel] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain; [Alberto Molina, Jose] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Zaragoza; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Molina, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.;Molina, JA (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",jamolina@unizar.es,"Molina, Jose Alberto/H-1676-2015; Campaña, Juan Carlos/AAB-5880-2019; Ortega, Raquel/ADX-2812-2022","Molina, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-9437-4606; Campaña, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7749-1122;",Spanish Ministry of Economics [ECO2012-34828],Spanish Ministry of Economics(Spanish Government),Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economics [Project ECO2012-34828] is gratefully acknowledged.,,24,5,6,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We propose a theoretical model of happiness that makes a distinction between ex ante evaluations of happiness and ex post assessments. The main assumptions of the model are tested through three studies based on anchoring vignettes. We show that, even if, ex ante, consumers fear high risk and do not associate it to a high level of happiness, their ex post evaluation of well-being is generally higher when identical consequences result from a high-risk situation than from a low-risk situation. Control over risk-taking reinforces the gap between ex ante and ex post measures of happiness. Thus, our article provides empirical evidence about a positive relation between risk and individual well-being, suggesting that risky experiences have the potential to increase consumer well-being.","[Ayadi, Nawel] Univ Tunis, ISG Tunis, Paris, France; [Ayadi, Nawel; Paraschiv, Corina] Univ Paris 05, CEDAG, Paris, France; [Paraschiv, Corina] Inst Univ France, Paris, France; [Vernette, Eric] Univ Toulouse 1 Capitole, IAE, CRM UMR 5303, Toulouse, France",Universite Paris Cite; Institut Universitaire de France; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Ayadi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tunis, ISG Tunis, Paris, France.;Ayadi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 05, CEDAG, Paris, France.",nawel.ayadi.isg@gmail.com,"AYADI, Nawel/GYJ-6333-2022","AYADI, Nawel/0000-0002-5298-0077; Paraschiv, Corina/0000-0001-8762-9482",,,,,74,15,16,5,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using a boots-trap-based stochastic dominance (SD) test and monthly MSCI prices of Islamic stock market indices and their conventional counterparts in 38 countries from North and Latin America, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, we find that SD relationships between Islamic and conventional optimal-diversified portfolios change systematically according to investment region and market regime. Essentially, for all regimes, US investors are indifferent between Islamic diversification and its conventional counterpart, which implies that arbitrage diversification opportunities are rare and short lived in all regions. However, across all regions, especially in a crisis regime, Islamic portfolio diversification can be a good substitute for conventional diversification. Islamic portfolio diversification in North and Latin America, Europe and Global regions is an optimal choice for the risk-averse American investors. Finally, results imply that portfolio diversification among Islamic market indices can be a good hedge, offering investors superior investment alternatives during any financial meltdown or economic slowdown due to the conservative nature of Sharia-compliant investments.","[Bahloul, Slah] Univ Sfax, Higher Sch Business Adm, Dept Management, Rd Airport 4, Sfax 3018, Tunisia; [Mroua, Mourad] Univ Sfax, Inst High Business Studies, Dept Management, Sfax, Tunisia; [Naifar, Nader] Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Finance & Investment, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Universite de Sfax; Universite de Sfax; Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU),"Bahloul, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Higher Sch Business Adm, Dept Management, Rd Airport 4, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",slah.bahloul@fsegs.rnu.tn,"Mroua, Mourad/AAK-6771-2021; Naifar, Nader/AAJ-2859-2020; Bahloul, Slah/AAB-3184-2019","Naifar, Nader/0000-0001-9554-8236; Bahloul, Slah/0000-0001-5939-4639",,,,,47,14,14,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The 2013 shutdown represented a significant and unanticipated income shock for federal government workers, with no direct effect on permanent income. We exploit both the differences between unaffected state government employees and affected federal employees as well as between federal employees required to remain at work and those required to stay at home to generate variation in income and available time. We find strong evidence for excess sensitivity of consumption patterns, violating the permanent income hypothesis. We demonstrate that increased home production, changes in spending allocations, and credit constraints all play significant roles in driving spending. We discern detailed categories of household spending with widely varying elasticities. The results demonstrate the importance of household liquidity, leisure, and home production when constructing stimulus or social insurance policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Social interactions between different cultures can induce value changes, which can result in shifts in consumption and saving behaviour. International trade allows consumers to have easier access to status goods, stimulating consumption and dampening saving. Extending from Veblen's conspicuous consumption theory, saving may also decrease when globalization leads to greater population mobility and fosters urbanization, thus enhancing the importance of consumption as a way to display wealth. In addition, financial globalization reduces credit constraints and allows households to save less. Using cross-country data from the United Nations (UN), the OECD, and other sources, this article finds evidence that household saving declines as globalization deepens, especially in the social and cultural dimensions.","[Chen, Xiaofen] Truman State Univ, Dept Econ, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA",,"Chen, XF (通讯作者)，Truman State Univ, Dept Econ, 100 East Normal Ave, Kirksville, MO 63501 USA.",xiaofen@truman.edu,,"Chen, Xiaofen/0000-0001-7220-1993",College of Arts and Sciences of Truman State University,College of Arts and Sciences of Truman State University,"I am grateful to the College of Arts and Sciences of Truman State University for providing a summer grant for this research, to an anonymous reviewer of the Journal for a number of useful suggestions, and to Adrian Lopez and Matthew Jacobson for their assistance in gathering data.",,46,3,3,3,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The estimation implies a negative yet relatively small impact of the credit supply shock from the financial crisis on R&D investment and the mitigation of the negative impacts by cash holdings after the onset of the financial crisis, whereas the data show decreasing R&D investment and sales for the whole period.

Contrary to the existing literature, we provide evidence that this relationship is time varying. The time variation is attributed to the observed temporal replacement effect between private and public investments. Furthermore, we show that there are two distinct correlation regimes in this relationship and unless we concentrate on them, we cannot fully unravel the real link between uncertainty and investments. Finally, we examine whether the use of the two correlation regimes provides better forecasts for investments compared to the use of the uncertainty indices alone. The forecasting exercise reveals that the use of correlation regimes provides statistically superior out-of-sample forecasts.","[Degiannakis, Stavros] Pante Univ, Dept Econ & Reg Dev, Athens, Greece; [Filis, George] Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England; [Palaiodimos, George] European Cent Bank, Directorate Econ, Fiscal Policy Div, Frankfurt, Germany",Panteion University; Bournemouth University; European Central Bank,"Filis, G (通讯作者)，Bournemouth Univ, Execut Business Ctr, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Bournemouth, Dorset, England.",gfilis@bournemouth.ac.uk,"Filis, George/HHS-1048-2022; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAD-2502-2019; Degiannakis, Stavros/AAF-2415-2021; Filis, George/N-5012-2017","Filis, George/0000-0002-4912-0973;",,,,,23,3,3,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Whether Vietnam's official exchange rate is appropriately valued has important implications for the economy's international competitiveness, trade balance and gross domestic product (GDP). The main aim of the paper is to assess whether the official exchange rate has been valued appropriately with reference to macroeconomic fundamentals, as proposed by the purchasing power parity and the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate approaches to evaluating equilibrium exchange rates. Our main empirical finding based on co-integration analysis using quarterly data from 1995 to 2014 is that according to both these approaches the Vietnamese Dong was significantly overvalued for extended times, most notably due to Vietnam's relatively high inflation rate.","[Duy Hung Bui] Banking Acad, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Makin, Anthony J.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Makin, Anthony J.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Asia Inst, Nathan, NSW, Australia; [Ratnasiri, Shyama] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan, NSW, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University,"Makin, AJ (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia.;Makin, AJ (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Asia Inst, Nathan, NSW, Australia.",t.makin@griffith.edu.au,"Ratnasiri, Shyama/AAP-9863-2021; Makin, Anthony/C-6738-2017","Makin, Anthony/0000-0002-5556-9590; Ratnasiri, Shyama/0000-0002-9295-4076",,,,,41,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

On the dust jacket, Tyler Cowen proclaims it one of the very best philosophical treatments of libertarian thought, ever and Deirdre McCloskey calls it a long and friendly conversation between Friedrich Hayek and John Rawls - a conversation which, astonishingly, reaches agreement. The book does present an authoritative state of the debate across the spectrum from right libertarianism, on one end, to high liberalism (that shares some ideas with democratic socialism), on the other end. My point is not to question Tomasi's own version of market democracy as a remix of Hayek and Rawls, but to use his sympathetic restatements of views across the liberal spectrum in order to show the basic misframings and common misunderstandings that cut across the liberal-libertarian viewpoints surveyed in the book. The heart of the debate is not in the answers to carefully framed questions, but in the framing itself.","[Ellerman, David] Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Ellerman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",,"Ellerman, David/AAI-9466-2020","Ellerman, David/0000-0002-5718-618X",,,,,48,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

A bivariate VAR model and a univariate autoregressive model are examined. Out-of-sample probability forecasts, generated based on both a bootstrap-like simulation method and a nonparametric kernel-based simulation method, are evaluated from both calibration (reliability) and sorting (resolution) perspectives. The results from calibration test indicate that including interest rates in the model improves the model's ability to issue realistic probability forecasts of stock returns (be well-calibrated). Considering stock returns also enhances the prediction of interest rates with respect to calibration. Assessment through Brier score and Yates partition suggests that the model performs better in distinguishing stock returns that actually occur and stock returns that do not occur after incorporating the influence of interest rates. Overall, interest rates help in forecasting stock returns in China in terms of both calibration and sorting.","[Fang, Lu; Bessler, David A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Fang, L (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",lufangtamu@tamu.edu,,,,,,,45,2,2,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Estimating the significance of each adjustment is of key importance for performing credible valuation. Adjustments should include factors such as location, physical and functional characteristics of residential properties and external influential factors. The aim of the article is to determine importance of influential factors and to quantify adjustments that arise from selected factors. Analytical results about the importance of factors influencing the appraised value of residential properties as perceived by different experts are presented in the empirical part of the article. The following factors were included in the study: orientation, views from the property, noise, number of storeys, and the age of the building. Data needed in the study were collected through interviews with authorised real estate appraisers, court sworn appraisers and real property agents. The key scientific problem was to determine mathematical functions for adjustment that arise from the storey of an apartment and from the age of the building. The findings of the study indicate that the location in relation to the distance from the city centre is the most important influential factor on the property value, similarly as in other countries across the world. Furthermore, the survey results show that the impact of the views and noise on the residential property value in Slovenia is also comparable with other studies. Results on the quantification of adjustments expectedly show that prices rise per storey in case there is an elevator in the building, but the result is opposite in case there is no elevator in the building. Results also show the influence of age on the value of the building. Based on mean values a linear function of annual depreciation rate has been set, which is the key novelty of the research. This function and the adjustments presented in the article are usable in valuation practice.","[Ferlan, Nadja; Bastic, Majda; Psunder, Igor] Univ Maribor, Smetanova 17, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Ferlan, N (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Smetanova 17, SI-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",nadja.ferlan@um.si; majda.bastic@um.si; igor.psunder@um.si,,,,,,,42,18,19,2,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In this study, we consider sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as our dependent variables. Our key independent variables are FDI and trade. Our study finds evidence that foreign investment and trade have had a negative impact on our selected emissions. However, our models also estimate turning points which are below the current GDP per capita values for all CAFTA-DR member countries. This is an encouraging trend in terms of the potential reduction in emissions in the region.","[Frutos-Bencze, Dina] St Anselm Coll, Econ & Business, Manchester, NH 03102 USA; [Bukkavesa, Kanix] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Fac Business Adm, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Kulvanich, Nat] Chulalonkorn Univ, Fac Commerce & Accountancy, Stat, Bangkok, Thailand",Mahidol University; Chulalongkorn University,"Frutos-Bencze, D (通讯作者)，St Anselm Coll, Econ & Business, Manchester, NH 03102 USA.",dfrutosbencze@anselm.edu,"Frutos-Bencze, Dina/ADT-9104-2022","Frutos-Bencze, Dina/0000-0001-8584-6790",,,,,27,17,17,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

However, it has relied on models that provide a limited description of energy flows in the economic system and do not allow an adequate analysis of energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel energy input-output model, the multi-factor energy input-output model (MF-EIO model), which is obtained from a partitioning of a hybrid-unit input-output system of the economy. This model improves on current models by describing the energy flows according to the processes of energy conversion and the levels of energy use in the economy. It characterizes the vector of total energy output as a function of seven factors: two energy efficiency indicators; two characteristics of end-use energy consumption; and three economic features of the rest of the economy. Moreover, it is consistent with the standard model for EIO analysis, i.e., the hybrid-unit model. This paper also introduces an approximate version of the MF-EIO model, which is equivalent to the former under equal energy prices for industries and final consumers, but requires less data processing. The latter is composed by two linked models: a model of the energy sector in physical units, and a model of the rest of the economy in monetary units. In conclusion, the proposed modelling framework improves EIO analysis and extends EIO applications to the accounting for energy efficiency of the economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years the experiences of emerging market countries suggest that a paradigm shift is taking place in SME finance. Particularly in fast-growing emerging market countries such as Turkey, banks are increasingly targeting SMEs as a new line of banking business. This research analyzes how macroeconomic factors have contributed to increased commercial bank lending to SMEs in six emerging market countries: Turkey, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Poland. Based on time series and panel data analysis, we find that a high GDP growth rate and increased competition in the banking sector have contributed to increased banking sector credit to SMEs. The findings also reveal that curbing the high inflation rate and reducing government domestic borrowing have significantly encouraged bank lending to the SME segment.","[Jenkins, Hatice; Hossein, Monir] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Jenkins, H (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Banking & Finance, Famagusta, Turkey.",hatice.jenkins@emu.edu.tr; monireul@hotmail.com,,,,,,,29,6,7,2,25,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,1,,,,,77,92,,10.2298/PAN140213008J,0.0,,,16,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ET2TF,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400126300006,0

We posed three questions in this research study about main banks' influence on corporate clients' earnings management. First, does a weakened main bank relationship influence corporate clients' financial reporting quality? Second, does Japan's firewall deregulation influence firms' earnings quality? Finally, does the relationship between accounting firms and main banks affect client firms' earnings quality? Our main findings were that main banks are not related to client firms' earnings management; however, main banks mitigate client firms' earnings management after firewall deregulation. On the other hand, firewall deregulation does motivate firms to manipulate their earnings management. Finally, using Pong and Kita's (2006) study as a framework, we found that main banks and client firms using the same accounting firms had no influence on earnings management. Based on these evidences presented, our findings suggest that the quality of corporate clients' financial reporting changes before and after firewall deregulation.","[Kobori, Kazuhiko] Shu Zen Coll Med & Management, Dept Appl Japanese, Luju Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Hutchinson, Robert] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Business Adm, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Lee, Ping-Chang; Tsai, Yao-Chuan] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tainan, Taiwan; [Wu, Tsing-Zai C.] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Accounting, Tainan, Taiwan",Michigan Technological University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University,"Kobori, K (通讯作者)，Shu Zen Coll Med & Management, Dept Appl Japanese, Luju Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",kobori@ms.szmc.edu.tw,"Wu, Tsing/KDN-1522-2024",,,,,,45,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In the empirical analysis, we use microdata to construct consistent time series over a forty-five year period, and document that the fraction of employment reallocated annually across occupations is highly stable in the long run. We go beyond description and use an equilibrium model to identify potential changes in the productivity shocks and mobility costs that govern worker reallocation across occupations. We uncover the joint evolution of these factors by deriving a simple mapping between data and the model. Our analysis shows that constant reallocation rates across occupations mask slow-moving increases in the volatility of productivity shocks since the mid-1980s, and a pronounced upward shift in the cost of switching occupations in the period surrounding the Great Recession.","[Lale, Etienne] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 ITN, Avon, England; [Lale, Etienne] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Bristol; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Lalé, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Priory Rd, Bristol BS8 ITN, Avon, England.;Lalé, E (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JAN,2017,44.0,,,,,,51,68,,10.1016/j.labeco.2016.12.001,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EQ8LI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398337200004,0

In addition, it attempts to compare and evaluate them in light of the discipline of comparative law. Design/methodology/approach - In order to achieve the purposes of the study, it executes a comparative study of the rules as to the formation of contracts of the CISG, Korean law and the Amendment Draft of the KCC. The basic question for this comparative study is placed on whether a solution from one jurisdiction is more logical than the others and to what extent each jurisdiction has responded to protect the reasonable expectations of the parties in the rules as to the formation of contracts. Findings - The comparative study finds that most of the rules under the CISG are quite plausible and logical and they are more or less well reflected in the proposals advanced by the KCC amendment committee. On the other hand, the other rules under the CISG which have brought criticisms in terms of their complexity and inconsistent case law invite us their revision or consistent interpretation. The drawbacks of the CISG have also been well responded in the Amendment Draft of the KCC. Nevertheless, it is quite unfortunate that the Amendment Draft of the KCC still has a rule that regards any purported performance with non-material alteration of the terms of an offer as an acceptance. Originality/value - This study may provide legal and practical advice to both the seller and the buyer when they enter into a contract for international sales of goods. In addition, it may render us an insight into newly developed or developing rules in this area and show us how they interact with each other.

While SFA concludes that union establishments show higher technological efficiency, the results are the opposite when estimating production functions with MFA. In SFA, unionized establishments appear to be more efficient because they remain closer to their own production frontier; however, in MFA - where groups with heterogeneous technology can be compared - we find that nonunionized establishments are more efficient because they are closer to the meta-frontier than their unionized counterparts.","[Lee, Daeho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Interact Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Kyunam] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Intellectual Property, Coll Econ & Business Adm, Suwon, South Korea; [Choe, Chung] Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Ansan, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Kyonggi University; Hanyang University,"Choe, C (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Dept Econ, Ansan, South Korea.",choechung@hanyang.ac.kr,"Choe, Chung/L-6921-2013","Choe, Chung/0000-0002-5173-9644",,,,,9,5,5,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

J,"Lee, S; Cho, J",,,,"Lee, Sanghack; Cho, Jungran",,,Optimal number of ports and implications for Korea's port policy,JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Port; Competition policy; National welfare; Port competition; Port efficiency; Transshipment,PRIVATIZATION,"Purpose - Many governments around the world have strategically privatized their ports. The privatized ports try to maximize profits by setting higher charges for port services and attracting transship cargos. This paper shows that such privatization of ports can be complemented by adjusting the number of ports. Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to derive the optimal number of ports in cases in which ports serve transship and domestic cargos. Design/methodology/approach - This paper constructs a theoretical model in which ports compete with each other for transship and domestic cargos. In the first stage, the government determines the number of ports. In the second stage, the ports compete with each other in quantity to maximize profits. The authors have derived the optimal number of ports that maximizes national welfare. Findings - The optimal number of ports is expressed as a function of the slope of the demand curve, the slope of the supply curve, and the share of domestic demand relative to total demand for port services. It is shown that the optimal number of ports tends to increase as the share of domestic cargo increases. The optimal number of ports, n*, is given as n* = 1/(1-theta), where theta denotes the share of domestic demand in total demand for port services, when the unit cost of port services is constant. Research limitations/implications - The analysis in the present paper is confined to the case of unilateral intervention by the government of the domestic country. Analyzing interaction among governments via competition policy would offer valuable policy implications. Practical implications - The results of the current research offer important implications for Korean port policy in the context of maritime industrial changes, in particular, China's New Silk Road initiative. In particular, the findings of this study suggest that Korea's investment in ports should be concentrated on ports with competitive advantages. Originality/value - Relatively scant attention has been paid to the possibility, or need, of strategic privatization being complemented by governmental competition policy. Filling this knowledge gap, the authors have shown that the government can mitigate the negative effects of privatization on domestic consumer surplus by introducing competition in the supply of port services.","[Lee, Sanghack] Kookmin Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, Jungran] Inha Univ, FTA Studies, Incheon, South Korea",Kookmin University; Inha University,"Cho, J (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, FTA Studies, Incheon, South Korea.",jungran@inha.ac.kr,,,,,,,10,7,7,3,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Furthermore, this paper illustrates that the outcome that VCG mechanism causes is equilibrium and all participates will be honest on their real valuation when they bid. In addition, this paper then focuses on the pros and cons of the VCG mechanism in the real application; put simply, this mechanism will lead to the total welfare maximization, but the case in reality is often that it is not computationally feasible to get the optimal solution, and hence the VCG mechanism will not be realized.

This article establishes and empirically implements a methodology for estimating the size of the SE as a direct function of the tax and unemployment rates. This link is found to be extremely relevant in countries with high unemployment rates (such as Greece and Spain) and less relevant in countries with moderate unemployment rates (such as Germany and Italy). Unemployment's contribution to the SE is shown to be significant, especially in the years following the economic downturn of 2008. The calculation of the variance and distribution of these estimates is another significant contribution. The common criticism that SE estimates are unreliable is addressed by calculating the variance and the distribution of the estimates, and the large size of the SE in Greece and Spain is once again confirmed.","[Mauleon, I.] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Fundamentals Econ Anal, Madrid, Spain; [Sarda, J.] Rovira & Virgili Univ, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Sardà, J (通讯作者)，Rovira & Virgili Univ, Dept Econ, Reus 43204, Spain.",jordi.sarda@urv.cat,,"Mauleon Torres, Ignacio/0000-0003-1378-6834",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2013-42884-P]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-42884-P],Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science: [Grant Number ECO2013-42884-P]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-42884-P].,,58,29,29,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The theory shows that when producers face negligible marginal costs and desired spending is below the economy's capacity, the economy features slack in equilibrium, even when prices are flexible and there are no other frictions. A heterogeneous household version of the model demonstrates how an economy can enter a capacity trap in response to a temporary negative demand shock: when demand by some consumers falls temporarily, other consumers' permanent income (and hence their desired consumption) also falls. Since output is determined'by demand, the permanent fall in desired consumption causes a permanent state of excess capacity.","[Murphy, Daniel] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Murphy, D (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",murphyd@darden.virginia.edu,,,,,,,29,19,20,0,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

This need is driven primarily by the concern of governments, insurance and actuarial professionals and individuals to be able to fund their old age. In particular, to quantify the costs of increasing longevity we need suitable model of mortality rates that capture the dynamics of the data and forecast them with sufficient accuracy to make them useful. In this article, we test several of the leading time series models by considering the fitting quality and in particular, testing the residuals of those models for normality properties. In a wide ranging study considering 30 countries we find that almost exclusively the residuals do not demonstrate normality. Further, in Hurst tests of the residuals we find evidence that structure remains that is not captured by the models.","[O'hare, Colin] Monash Univ Melbourne, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Li, Youwei] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Monash University; Queens University Belfast,"O'hare, C (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Melbourne, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",colin.ohare@monash.edu,"Li, Youwei/K-1898-2014","Li, Youwei/0000-0002-2142-7607",ARC Linkage [LP160101038]; Australian Research Council [LP160101038] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,ARC Linkage(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the ARC Linkage [LP160101038];,,20,6,6,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

According to him, criminals are rationally thinking people who compare costs and returns from a crime. If the costs of breaking of institutions are lower than returns then breaking of rules will pay off. The article also pays attention to expecting costs of crime, which are very low in the Czech Republic. If we want to decrease crime, it is necessary to increase the expecting costs of crime. The crucial part of the article deals with problem of the economic factors influencing crime such as gross domestic product, inflation rate, unemployment rate, average gross monthly wage, public expenditures for safety and public order and the number of policemen.

It focuses on two indicators of globalization, namely, foreign ownership and export, and confines the scope to developing economies. Design/methodology/approach - This analysis uses firm-level data with observation over 60,000 collected from 94 developing economies. The paper employs the probit model to examine how firm characteristics related to globalization affect corruption perception (CP) and incidence. Findings - The empirical results reveal that for foreign-invested companies, there is a substantial discrepancy between the perceived corruption and the actual. Although they are involved in bribery as frequently as, or less frequently than local firms, they have greater CPs. Exporting firms are more frequently solicited for bribes, but the effect disappears when time spent for government contact is controlled for. Consequently, foreign investment partly contributes to the corruption control, but the export orientation of firms rather aggravates corruption due to regulative environments in developing economies. Practical implications - This study provides policy implications that the corruption control through globalization requires streamlining of administration procedure related to foreign investment or trade and, thus, shortening time to deal with public officials. In addition, governments need to emphasize the importance of foreign investment and prevent unethical practices mediated by local partners. Originality/value - The greatest novelty of this paper lies in using firm level data instead of country level unlike most of the literature. Moreover, the authors focus on firms only in developing economies. As well, unlike most studies using only perception indicators as the proxy of corruption, this paper considers both CPs and actual incidence, and compares each other.","[Park, Bokyeong] Kyung Hee Univ, Global Campus, Yongin, South Korea; [Khanoi, Onon] Natl Dev Agcy Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia",Kyung Hee University,"Park, B (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Global Campus, Yongin, South Korea.",bokyeong23@khu.ac.kr,"Park, Bokyeong/AAK-8927-2020",,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A3A2046224],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2015S1A3A2046224),,45,3,3,2,16,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The question that is also researched and accentuated is the relationship between the autonomy of HEIs and the accountability to the society according to certain criteria. The financing aspect of higher education is also one of the most problematic aspects in the system of higher education. None of the models applied for the financing of higher education and measures chosen in Lithuania was able to ensure the accessibility of studies, quality, nor could attract qualified pedagogical personnel. It is stated that insufficient financing of higher education has direct influence on other dimensions of higher education system. If the universities are not granted autonomy, they cannot be innovative and react effectively to social and economic changes, they are not able to correspond to social and economic needs of the state that cannot fulfil expectations of the students to achieve better quality of life. The aim of the paper is to analyse the impact of the financing method of higher education institutions chosen by the state on economic activities of the HEIs and their financial autonomy. In the first part of the paper the trends of the financing of the system of Lithuanian higher education are analysed. The second part of the paper analyses the impact of state financing on institutional autonomy of HEIs. The third part reveals the significance of financial autonomy of HEIs and its impact on the economics of higher education.","[Praneviciene, Birute; Puraite, Aurelija; Vasiliauskiene, Violeta] Mykolo Romerio Univ, V Putvinskio G 70, LT-44211 Kaunas, Lithuania",,"Praneviciene, B (通讯作者)，Mykolo Romerio Univ, V Putvinskio G 70, LT-44211 Kaunas, Lithuania.",praneviciene@mruni.eu; aurelija.puraite@gmail.com; v.vasiliauskiene@mruni.eu,"Pūraitė, Aurelija/GZL-0133-2022; Vasiliauskienė, Violeta/HPF-2272-2023; Pranevičienė, Birutė/AAE-1591-2022","Pūraitė, Aurelija/0000-0001-9228-1396; Vasiliauskienė, Violeta/0000-0003-0743-4015;",,,,,46,1,1,2,23,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Incentive compatibility and efficiency are primary concerns when designing such mechanisms. We construct the full class of group strategy-proof and Pareto-efficient mechanisms and show that each of them can be implemented by endowing agents with control rights over resources. This new class, which we call trading cycles, contains new mechanisms as well as known mechanisms such as top trading cycles, serial dictatorships, and hierarchical exchange. We illustrate how one can use our construction to show what can and what cannot be achieved in a variety of allocation and exchange problems, and we provide an example in which the new trading-cycles mechanisms are more Lorenz equitable than all previously known mechanisms.","[Unver, M.

The volatility estimate and forecast is computed from the interday return and intraday range-based data of the exchange's flagship index, CNX NIFTY, for the time period spanning 1 January 2009 through 31 December 2013. These are our findings: First, we determine that the time-varying volatility of the index is asymmetric with qualities of stationarity and leptokurtic distribution. Second, the one-step-ahead volatility forecast derived from the univariate time series parameters through the GJR-GARCH process indicates that the model evaluation criteria of the autoregressive process tends towards range-based models vis-a-vis a return-based model. The validity of this methodology is further analysed with the superior predictive ability test, the outcome of which supports the use of range-based conditional models. Finally, among the evaluated range-based model variants, the model confidence set procedure favours the Yang-Zhang estimator as being better suited to forecast the exchange's volatility than the ones by Parkinson, Garman-Klass and Rogers-Satchell.","[Raju, Karthik] Anna Univ, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Rangaswamy, Saravanan] Anna Univ, Sch Management, Sri Krishna Coll Technol, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Anna University; Anna University Chennai; Anna University; Anna University Chennai,"Raju, K (通讯作者)，Anna Univ, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",research@karthik.in,,,,,,,58,4,4,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The study also implements this interrelationship for two groups of countries based on their level of development. Two models applying different factors reflecting countries' economic and trade policies are proposed to measure the targeted efficiencies using data envelopment analysis method. Evidence from the simultaneous equations models to identify a relationship between economic efficiency and trade efficiency supports the bidirectional causality between them in all three categories of countries. It has been also found that both economic and institutional factors have a significant positive influence on trade and growth performance, with the effect of political factors being especially pronounced for developing countries that suffer from weak institutional capacity. These empirical findings are of particular interest to policy-makers as they help to build sound policies in order to maximize trade performance as well as economic efficiency.","[Rasekhi, Saeed; Sheidaei, Zahra; Asadi, Seyed Peyman] Univ Mazandaran, Dept Econ, Babol Sar, Iran",University of Mazandaran,"Rasekhi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mazandaran, Dept Econ, Babol Sar, Iran.",srasekhi@umz.ac.ir,"Rasekhi, Saeed/AAS-3088-2021","Rasekhi, Saeed/0000-0002-6280-7243; asadi, seyed peyman/0000-0002-2411-9247",,,,,90,3,3,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The Chinese government has implemented strict restrictions on the number of births for each family since the 1970s, resulting in the creation of millions of only-child families. Using the 2011 baseline data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, we find that the bereavement of a child is associated with lower levels of mental health and happiness and higher levels of loneliness for the parents, even after we adjust for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The effects are significantly stronger for losing all the children. Results have strong implications for the population-control, elderly-care and mental-care policies especially in China and developing countries, where the social security system is not yet sound.","[Ren, Qianping] Gennlife Beijing Technol Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ye, Maoliang] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Sch Econ, Dept Publ Finance, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Ye, Maoliang] Xiamen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Xiamen University,"Ye, ML (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Sch Econ, Dept Publ Finance, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.;Ye, ML (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Econometr, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China.",maoliang.ye@post.harvard.edu,"Ye, Maoliang/AAF-7534-2020","Ye, Maoliang/0000-0003-0240-8686; Ren, Qianping/0000-0003-2551-0771","Youth Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences Research, Chinese Ministry of Education [14YJC790156]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [20720161075]","Youth Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences Research, Chinese Ministry of Education; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the Youth Grant for Humanities and Social Sciences Research, Chinese Ministry of Education [grant number 14YJC790156] and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 20720161075].",,22,12,12,2,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The importance of barriers to innovation and their actual influence on innovation depend on firms' characteristics such as sectoral affiliation, technological behavior and their response to perceived obstacles to innovation. Firms either continue to engage in innovation, or they avoid the activity altogether. This paper explored the nature and perceived importance of the obstacles to innovation that firms confront, in a developing-country context; we build on survey data about firms in Mexico. Our findings suggest that two kinds of policy interventions should help offset a firm's perception of barriers to innovation. On the one hand, policies should enhance the innovation capacity of firms interested in innovation; on the other hand, policies need to tackle factors that reduce the interest of firms in innovation. Policies that boost demand for locally generated innovations would assist in achieving both these goals.","[Santiago, Fernando] Sci Metrix, 486 Gladstone Ave, Ottawa, ON K1R 5N8, Canada; [De Fuentes, Claudia] St Marys Univ, Sobey Sch Business, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Dutrenit, Gabriela; Gras, Natalia] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Xochimilco, Postgrad Program Econ & Management Innovat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Saint Marys University - Canada; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Santiago, F (通讯作者)，Sci Metrix, 486 Gladstone Ave, Ottawa, ON K1R 5N8, Canada.",fernando.santiago@science-metrix.com,"Gras, Natalia/AAZ-1133-2021; Santiago, Fernando/AAB-8845-2021; DUTRÉNIT, GABRIELA/AAF-4448-2020","Gras, Natalia/0000-0002-2653-8314; Santiago, Fernando/0000-0003-1601-8689; DUTRÉNIT, GABRIELA/0000-0002-1760-8544",Competitiveness and Innovation Division of the Inter-American Development Bank; CONACYT,Competitiveness and Innovation Division of the Inter-American Development Bank; CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),"The authors are indebted to CONACYT, Mexico for facilitating access to the data used in this study.

Most estimators do not provide support for the empirical validity of RET and long-run cointegration between public and private saving. The increases in household saving (HHS) seem to have been engendered by the provision of saving incentives, institution of saving schemes, self-driven motivation to save, and the precautionary accumulations induced by uncovered uncertainties in incomes, rather than by Ricardian behaviour of households. The self-imposed aversion to debt and debt bequest, borrowing and liquidity constraints, and the intertemporal smoothing of consumption have been the added catalysts that contributed to the increases in HHS. The households with binding borrowing constraints, inadequate or no insurance and uncovered uncertainties in incomes seem to have been saving more to pay for higher inflation-tax. The fiscal consolidation and generation of public saving are essential to reduce the tax burden (both explicit through fiscal taxes and implicit through inflation-tax), minimize the likelihoods of economic and financial crises, and maintain the internal and external value of domestic currency.","[Singh, Tarlok] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Singh, T (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",Tarlok.Singh@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,63,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The first part presents the development of mortality in past and motivates the necessity to capture mortality development with mortality models. This includes short overview of considered models and calibration methods used. Next, we present qualitative and quantitative measures that are used for the comparison of mortality models. We consider the following measures: quality of fit, reasonableness, parsimony, robustness and completeness of these models. Comparison of mortality models is illustrated using tables and charts presenting the results with the ranking of each model. Finally, the paper summarizes the results and concludes the main results of the comparison on the Czech mortality data with the recommendation of the most appropriate model.","[Sotona, Petr] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sotona, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",Petr.Sotona@seznam.cz,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1481,1491,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300148,0

This article examines the role of courts, specifically the speed of court decisions, the enforcement of edicts, and the impartiality of decision-making as perceived by firms of various sizes, and the impact this has on firm investments in real property. The article analyzes a panel of 6,300 firms from 27 countries in the period from 2002 to 2009 to find that (i) firm size affects perceptions positively, while (ii) paying bribes affects perceptions negatively. At the same time, (iii) a firm's connections to the government have no apparent impact. More importantly, while all three components have a positive correlation with the amount firms invest in land and machinery, the speed of courts has the greatest significance and the highest marginal effect. Firms perceiving courts to be quick invest nearly four times as much as the average real property investment. This finding suggests that policymakers should focus on reducing backlogs in the court system, perhaps by encouraging more arbitration or staffing more clerks.","[Troilo, Michael] Univ Tulsa, Collins Coll Business, Int Business, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA; [Collins, J.

The simulations revealed that, given the entire stochastic environment, macroprudential instruments can indeed help stabilize the economy with smaller costs, and the loan-to-value instrument qualified as the best approach. Furthermore, in case of a financial shock, the use of credit requirements may be desirable because of their neutral effect on the exchange rate.","[Viziniuc, Madalin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Finance Doctoral Sch, Tache Ionescu St 11, Bucharest 010352, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Viziniuc, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Finance Doctoral Sch, Tache Ionescu St 11, Bucharest 010352, Romania.",madalin.viziniuc@fin.ase.ro,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Evidence favorable to the growth hypothesis (EPC -> GDP) is found for eight countries, while data of three countries support the conservation hypothesis (GDP -> EPC).

Path analysis is used to investigate the direct and indirect links between four performance variables and organization capital. A hypothesis is developed based upon the incorporation of knowledge-based resources. The idea is that the board of directors has monitoring and consultation functions, propelling organizational development. We use panel data with random effects for 1,355 firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 2001 to 2012. The two-stage least-squares method is used to explore the mediating effect among board function, organization capital and corporate performance. Both an aggregated model and the EP model are investigated specifying both a direct link and a mediated link with organization capital. It is concluded that the governance effect has a direct influence in the relationship between board function and corporate governance, and that organization capital is significantly associated with the performance variables. In terms of the counselling function of the board, inside directors are significantly related to dynamic capacity, which improves corporate performance for the long run.","[Wang, Mu-Shun] Kainan Univ, Grad Sch Banking & Finance, 1 Kainan Rd, Taoyuan 33857, Taiwan; [Lu, Shih-Tong] Kainan Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 1 Kainan Rd, Taoyuan 33857, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; Nan Kai University Technology,"Wang, MS (通讯作者)，Kainan Univ, Grad Sch Banking & Finance, 1 Kainan Rd, Taoyuan 33857, Taiwan.",sunrise034@yahoo.com.tw,,,,,,,122,1,1,1,12,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In addition, compared with state-owned listed companies, the negative influence of oil price uncertainty on corporate investment is more significant for non-state-owned listed companies.

First, the definition of KIBS trade, in light of the available data from the balance of payments statistics, is presented. Then, using a panel data set from the EU countries over the period 2000-2009, a panel cointegration approach to estimating the model is adopted. The empirical study shows that among the old EU countries only those with high income are competitive in KIBS exports. Estimation results demonstrate that their competitiveness in KIBS exports is positively determined by domestic and imported KIBS intensity in the economy, as well as by the KIBS sector's technology advancement. The new EU countries usually were not competitive in KIBS exports, and those which were successful in this field seem to have derived their success mainly from international outsourcing rather than from building their own capacities. Their competitiveness in KIBS exports was positively determined by the KIBS sector's endowment in human capital, or via domestic KIBS intensity in the economy together with lower labour costs.","[Wyszkowska-Kuna, Joanna] Uniwersytet Lodzki Wydzial Ekon Socjol, World Econ & European Integrat, Lodz, Poland",,"Wyszkowska-Kuna, J (通讯作者)，Uniwersytet Lodzki Wydzial Ekon Socjol, World Econ & European Integrat, Lodz, Poland.",jkuna@uni.lodz.pl,,"Wyszkowska-Kuna, Joanna/0000-0002-0750-1719",,,,,67,5,5,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Comparisons were made between farms with and without a change in efficiency when each farm's risk preference was included in the analysis. As expected, risk preference plays an important role in explaining farm inefficiency. Failure to account for risk preferences overstates inefficiency, particularly for slightly risk averse and risk neutral farms.","[Yeager, Elizabeth A.] Kansas State Univ, 1603 Old Claflin Pl,337A Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Langemeier, Michael R.] Purdue Univ, Ctr Commercial Agr, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Kansas State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Yeager, EA (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, 1603 Old Claflin Pl,337A Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",eyeager@ksu.edu,,"Yeager, Elizabeth/0000-0002-4286-2659",,,,,22,3,3,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Compared to banks, nonbank financial institutions are more likely to provide credit help to high operation risk firms. State-owned listed firms have a higher probability to get finance from nonbank financial institutions than private firms, which highlights the situation that private firms are in a weak position to get credit help from China's financial system.

Changes in the demographic situation also refer to the students' families, which is being manifested by high popularity of the same-sex marriage. There is a process of maturation of students. We have reasons to mark out three generations of students. The first involves the students under 30, the second includes more mature students of older age, and the third includes people of pre-retirement and retirement age. The object of the study was the community of older learners. The purpose of our paper was to identify how demographic factors influence structural changes of the students' community. We assumed that students' maturation and acquisition by older learners characteristics of the particular group will force the system of higher education to become more flexible and elaborate new principles of interaction with the students and new educational technologies.","[Zborovsky, Garold; Ambarova, Polina] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Zborovsky, G (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",garoldzborovsky@gmail.com; borges75@mail.ru,"Zborovsky, Garold/E-6142-2014; Ambarova, Polina A./R-6839-2016",,Russian Science Foundation [16-18-10046]; Russian Science Foundation [16-18-10046] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),The article has been prepared in the framework of the Russian Science Foundation Grant project (No 16-18-10046) Forming nonlinear model of the Russian higher education in the region in the context of economic and social uncertainty.,,12,1,1,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1914,1922,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300191,0

We provide evidence of the redistributive character of public education provision. We estimate structural quantile treatment effects of household income on the distribution of expected educational transfers in kind. Under the assumption that education quality is a normal good, better services (ancillary to the core education mission) supplied by private schools increase quality therein and reduce the incentives for wealthy households to enroll in public education. Because of these incentives, rich families benefit less from educational transfers in kind and the public education system is redistributive. Using household survey data from Italy, we find that an increase in net income reduces the value of the expected educational in kind transfers for compulsory education.","[Andreoli, Francesco] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Casalone, Giorgia; Sonedda, Daniela] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Via Perrone 18, I-28100 Novara, Italy; [Casalone, Giorgia] Dondena Ctr Res Social Dynam & Publ Policy, Milan, Italy; [Sonedda, Daniela] Ctr North South Econ Res CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Andreoli, F (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res LISER, 11 Porte Sci, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",francesco.andreoli@liser.lu; giorgia.casalone@uniupo.it; daniela.sonedda@uniupo.it,"Sonedda, Daniela/H-9232-2019","Sonedda, Daniela/0000-0002-0587-3308; CASALONE, Giorgia/0000-0003-4776-9565",Universita del Piemonte Orientale,Universita del Piemonte Orientale,"We are grateful to Rolf Aaberge, Erich Battistin, Lorenzo Cappellari, Daniele Checchi, Carlo Fiorio, Alessio Fusco, Paolo Ghinetti, Gyorgy Gyomai, Christine Le Clainche, Arnaud Lefranc, Javier Olivera, Enrico Rettore, Jonah Rockoff, Philippe Van Kerm, Francesca Zantomio, Claudio Zoli, two anonymous referees and the Associate Editor for valuable comments.

Few empirical estimates exist, however, on the implications of existing rules on firms' political spending.

Using both high dimensional fixed effects and regression discontinuity designs, we demonstrate that firms constrained by campaign contribution limits spend between $549,000 and $1.6M more on lobbying per election cycle, an amount that is more than 100 times the campaign contribution limit.

To view plausible scenarios, we evaluate the case of a unilateral action on the part of the United States, as well as a scenario where China retaliates by imposing an equally high 45 percent tariff on its imports from the United States. In addition, because the high U.S. trade deficit with China is a factor that underpins calls for tariff action, we explore simulations where the trade balance is restored to balance as well as a scenario in which the trade balance is unchanged. In all of the scenarios, the calibration exercise suggests that a trade war triggered by high U.S. import tariffs will lead to a collapse in U.S.-China bilateral trade. In all of the scenarios, the United States will experience large social welfare losses, whereas China may lose or gain slightly depending on the effect of trade war on the U.S.-China trade balance. Globally, some small open economies may experience small benefits, while other countries may suffer collateral damage.","[Guo, Meixin; Lu, Lin] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Liugang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Miaojie] Peking Univ, CCER, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Peking University,"Guo, MX (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",guomx@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; lulin@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; lsheng@cuhk.edu.hk; mjyu@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"Yu, Miao/HRC-0342-2023",,"National Science Foundation of China [71203121, 71303128, 71625007, 71573006]; Humanities and Social Sciences Research Fund by Tsinghua University [2013WKYB004]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Research Fund by Tsinghua University,"We thank Professors Wing Thye Woo, Fukunari Kimura, Barry Eichengreen, and participants of the Asian Economic Panel Meeting in Kuala Lumpur in March 2017 for their helpful suggestions and comments.

This paper constructs an inter-provincial R&D spillover network based on geographic economic distance matrix, and measures the centrality index of each province using the social network analysis method. Regarding inter-provincial R&D direct technology spillovers effect (DS) and indirect technology spillovers effect (IS) as the proxy variables of technology progress, DS and IS are introduced into a panel econometric model for CO2 emissions factor analysis. The panel data of 29 provinces in China from 2000 to 2013 are used for empirical analysis. The results show that DS has a significant inhibitory effect on CO2 emissions in nationwide, eastern and central regions, except in western region. The role of IS on CO2 emissions varies widely in sub-regions. Specifically, IS has a significant inhibitory effect on CO2 emissions in central region, IS measured by closeness and betweenness is significantly positively correlated with CO2 emissions in western region, while IS has no significant effect on CO2 emissions in eastern region.

Even if it is not a new innovation in the field of sales promotion, its popularity does not decrease, and what's more, in many countries it is still one of the most successful forms of promotion and communication with customers. Purpose of the article: This article brings an answer to the question of how to plan a successful store flyer campaign. The goal is to design the process of planning such campaign based on the knowledge of price elasticity of demand. The rate of success is represented by the level of fulfillment of goals set by the merchant. Methods: The area of the research is the Czech retail food market. The knowledge of the price elasticity of demand is based on the analysis of real terms of prices, sales volumes and margins, and the typology of goals we want to achieve. The proposed method of planning determines the evaluation rules for products in terms of their suitability for inclusion in a store flyer. The calculated values of price elasticity of demand and their changes during the time phases of the campaign are used as a knowledge base for a planning of consumers' responses to the store flyer. The principle of planning is demonstrated in a case study. Findings & Value added: The practical output of the proposed process is the answer to the question of which goods should be included in the store flayer to achieve the goals set for the campaign. This study gives the method of identifying the groups of products which are suitable for inclusion in the store flyer and recommends the rules for the planning of the campaign.","[Kucerova, Vladimira; Zeman, Jaroslav] Brno Univ Technol, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Kucerová, V (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",kucerova@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,12,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

We propose a simple model where advertising disproportionately benefits non-dominant political parties, because voters are uncertain about and biased against such parties. We test this argument in Mexico, where one of the three main parties dominates in many localities. To identify the effects of exposure to campaign advertising, we exploit differences across neighboring precincts in campaign ad distribution. These differences originate from cross-state media coverage spillovers induced by a 2007 reform that equalized access to ad slots across all broadcast media. We find that, on average, ads on AM radio increase the vote shares of the PAN and the PRD, but not the previously hegemonic PRI. Consistent with our model, campaign advertising is most effective in poorly informed and politically uncompetitive electoral precincts, and against locally dominant parties of intermediate strength.","[Larreguy, Horacio A.; Snyder, James M., Jr.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Marshall, John] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Harvard University; Columbia University,"Larreguy, HA (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hlarreguy@fas.harvard.edu; jm4401@columbia.edu; jsnyder@gov.harvard.edu,"Arbesu, Horacio Larreguy/AAF-2867-2020","Arbesu, Horacio Larreguy/0000-0001-8491-6400",,,,,54,9,16,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

The impact of bank mergers on other firm outcomes (growth in total borrowing, distance to default and investment) is also examined. A merger announcement by a firm's main bank results in a contraction in credit supply from the merging bank. Firms are not able to compensate for the reduced credit supply from the main bank, so overall borrowing also declines.","[Montgomery, Heather] Int Christian Univ, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan; [Takahashi, Yuki] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",International Christian University; Stockholm School of Economics,"Montgomery, H (通讯作者)，Int Christian Univ, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Montgomery, Hugh/L-1229-2019; Montgomery, Heather/JNS-8503-2023; Montgomery, Hugh/C-2592-2008","Montgomery, Heather/0000-0002-0129-3701; Montgomery, Hugh/0000-0001-8797-5019",JSPS KAKENHI Grant [26380398]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26380398] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 26380398.

The ascending proxy auction of Ausubel and Milgrom (Front Theor Econ 1:1-42, 2002) is considered in a stylized environment with two goods, two local bidders, and one global bidder. Local bidders shade bids in the equilibrium because of the free-riding incentive. We examine the effect of reserve prices. We show that a reserve price for individual goods increases the equilibrium local bids, whereas they may be decreased by a reserve price for the package of goods.

There is one seller and two potential buyers who simultaneously decide on which link(s) to form. A link represents a trading opportunity between a seller and a buyer and is formed if both offer it. If the seller is linked to both buyers, the seller gets the entire surplus. If the seller is linked to only one buyer, the linked buyer gets a small share of the surplus and the seller has the larger share. Link costs are incurred when the link is established. We study two levels of link costs: zero and positive. The competitive network is the outcome of undominated strategy play only with zero link costs. In both link cost levels, the only way both buyers can earn strictly positive payoffs is by turn taking. We find evidence that both the buyers and the seller facilitate tacit collusion, regardless of the payoff structure. The proportions of groups that engage in collusion and turn taking do not seem to depend on the payoff structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The adopted methodology allows us to identify causal networks based on the measurements of observed correlations and partial correlations, without relying on a priori assumptions. Results from the contemporaneous analysis indicate that the Bitcoin market is quite isolated, and no specific asset plays a dominant role in influencing the Bitcoin market. However, we find evidence of lagged relationships between Bitcoin and some assets, especially during the bear market state of Bitcoin. This finding suggests that the integration between the Bitcoin and other financial assets is a continuous process that varies over time. We conduct forecast error variance decompositions and find that the influence of each of the other assets on Bitcoin over a 20-day horizon does not account for more than 11% of all innovations.

Our method can avoid the so-called curse of dimensionality and handle the case that the number of assets is time-varying. In particular, we propose four (V)HAR-type dynamic models for predicting high-dimensional covariance matrices. All of them can well characterize the long memory behavior of realized eigenvalue series and be easily estimated by OLS. The empirical evidence shows that they outperform the competing models without consideration of long memory behavior in terms of in-sample fitting, out-of-sample prediction, and out-of-sample portfolio allocation.","[Jian, Zhihong; Deng, Pingjun; Zhu, Zhican] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology,"Jian, ZH (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhihong.jian@hust.edu.cn; dengpingjun@hust.edu.cn; 707089412@qq.com,,"Jian, Zhihong/0000-0003-4327-7301",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST: 2016AD007],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We sincerely thank the two anonymous referees and the editor for their constructive comments which have greatly improved this paper.

J,"Saghafian, S",,,,"Saghafian, Soroush",,,Ambiguous partially observable Markov decision processes: Structural results and applications,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,POMDP; Unknown probabilities; Model ambiguity; Structural results; Control-limit policies,ROBUST-CONTROL; CHOICE; MODEL,"Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been widely used as invaluable tools in dynamic decision making, which is a central concern for economic agents operating at both the micro and macro levels. Often the decision maker's information about the state is incomplete; hence, the generalization to Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). Unfortunately, POMDPs may require a large state and/or action space, creating the well-known curse of dimensionality. However, recent computational contributions and blindingly fast computers have helped to dispel this curse. This paper introduces and addresses a second curse termed curse of ambiguity, which refers to the fact that the exact transition probabilities are often hard to quantify, and are rather ambiguous. For instance, for a monetary authority concerned with dynamically setting the inflation rate so as to control the unemployment, the dynamics of unemployment rate under any given inflation rate is often ambiguous. Similarly, in worker-job matching, the dynamics of worker-job match/proficiency level is typically ambiguous. This paper addresses the curse of ambiguity by developing a generalization of POMDPs termed Ambiguous POMDPs (APOMDPs), which not only allows the decision maker to take into account imperfect state information, but also tackles the inevitable ambiguity with respect to the correct probabilistic model of transitions. Importantly, this paper extends various structural results from POMDPs to APOMDPs. These results enable the decision maker to make robust decisions. Robustness is achieved by using alpha-maximin expected utility (alpha-MEU), which (a) differentiates between ambiguity and ambiguity attitude, (b) avoids the over conservativeness of traditional maximin approaches, and (c) is found to be suitable in laboratory experiments in various choice behaviors including those in portfolio selection. The structural results provided also help to handle the curse of dimensionality, since they significantly simplify the search for an optimal policy. The analysis also identifies a performance guarantee for the proposed approach by developing a bound for its maximum reward loss due to model ambiguity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on the capability approach as conceptual framework, I apply the Alkire-Foster method to the German context. Special attention is paid to the conceptual integration. Specifically, I argue for including material deprivation and employment as important dimensions, but against using an additional lack-of-income indicator. The results are consistent with previous findings and also offer new insights. In particular, I find specific poverty profiles (e.g., for the elderly), but also that gaps in poverty between subpopulations change over time. Importantly, the results suggest that genuine multidimensional measures add unique insights, which neither a single indicator, nor a dashboard approach can offer. Finally, the analysis reveals multidimensional and income-poverty measures to disagree on who is poor. The subsequent analysis of this mismatch lends empirical support to abandon a lack-of-income dimension.","[Suppa, Nicolai] TU Dortmund, Dept Econ, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany",Dortmund University of Technology,"Suppa, N (通讯作者)，TU Dortmund, Dept Econ, D-44221 Dortmund, Germany.",nicolai.suppa@tu-dortmund.de,"Suppa, Nicolai/AAF-7808-2020","Suppa, Nicolai/0000-0002-4773-3864",German Research Foundation (DFG) [RI441/6-1],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author gratefully acknowledges funding by the German Research Foundation (DFG), Grant No. RI441/6-1.

Therefore, I develop the Uzawa-Lucas model in which the accumulation of human capital follows a mixture of a Brownian motion process and many Poisson jump processes, and obtain the closed-form solution.

In one case, joint asymptotics apply when both the sample size diverges and the threshold effect shrinks to zero, whereas sequential asymptotics operate in the other case in which the sample size diverges first and the threshold effect shrinks subsequently. The two operations lead to the same limit distribution, thereby linking the two different cases. The proofs make use of ideas involving limit theory for sums of a random number of summands.

We show that the bulk of it is lognormally distributed, followed by a power law tail at the limit. The distributions coincide with each other under normalization by mean expenditure and log scaling even though the data is sampled across multiple dimension including, e.g. time, social structure and locations. This phenomenon indicates that the dispersions in consumption expenditure across various social and economic groups are significantly similar subject to suitable scaling and normalization. Further, the results provide a measurement of the core distributional features. Other descriptive factors including those of sociological, demographic and political nature, add further layers of variation on the this core distribution.

This new approach is global, defined in the equilibrium version of the household's Euler equation, applies to economies for which there are no known existence results, and existing methods are inapplicable. Our methods are able to distinguish different structural properties of recursive equilibria. In stark contrast to the extensive body of existing work on these models, our methods make no appeal to the theory of smooth dynamical systems that are commonly applied in the literature. Actually, sufficient smoothness to apply such methods cannot be established relative to the set of recursive equilibria. Our partial ordering methods also provide a qualitative theory of equilibrium comparative statics in the presence of multiple equilibrium. These robust equilibrium comparison results are shown to be computable via successive approximations from subsolutions and supersolutions in sets of candidate equilibrium function spaces. We provide applications to an extensive literature on local indeterminacy of dynamic equilibrium.","[Datta, Manjira; Reffett, Kevin] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wozny, Lukasz] Szkola Glowna Handlowa, Dept Quantitat Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Warsaw School of Economics,"Datta, M (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",manjira@asu.edu,"Wozny, Lukasz/HGV-1542-2022","Wozny, Lukasz/0000-0002-4777-0163",,,,,65,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In the model, households choose between two behavioral modes: cooperative or noncooperative. Spouses receive wage offers and allocate time to supplying labor market hours and to producing a public good. Personality traits, measured by the so-called Big Five traits, can affect household bargaining weights and wage offers. Model parameters are estimated by Simulated Method of Moments using the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) data. Personality traits are found to be important determinants of household bargaining weights and of wage offers and to have substantial implications for understanding the sources of gender wage disparities.

Specifically, a woman is more likely to win a Jeopardy! episode and, within the show, to respond to a clue. Once responding, she is also marginally more likely to respond correctly. Potentially most surprising, even the sizeable gender gap in risk-taking (analyzing Daily Double wagering decisions) disappears once a woman competes in an otherwise all-male field of competitors. Men, on the other hand, wager significantly less when paired against women only, but the gender of opponents does not affect their competitive performance otherwise. Our rich sample allows us to control for a host of potentially confounding factors and player-fixed effects, thereby eliminating potential biases from unobservable individual characteristics.

First, sellers post intervals of possible surplus splits (i.e. the payoffs that would result from posting possible prices) that direct buyers to approach them. Second, after matching occurs, final surpluses are determined by ultimatum game bargaining. We investigate the interaction between bargaining and competition in the preliminary search stage, with a focus on how preferences for fair bargaining outcomes affect search. The main results confirm that behavior in the ultimatum game is consistent with preferences for fair outcomes, and the main effect on search is to drive up the posted buyer surplus lower bounds above the competitive equilibrium towards more equal surplus splits. Our main treatment variable is the number of buyers in the market, and when the number of buyers is increased, lower bounds and ultimatum offers to buyers decrease. This is consistent with fairness perceptions being influenced by competition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Investment in outside options is a prime example of such opportunism and often leads to inefficiency, for example by exerting effort to search for alternative business partners even if it does not add trade value. We experimentally investigate a bilateral trade relationship in which standard theory assuming self-regarding preferences predicts that the seller will be better off by investing in the outside option to improve his bargaining position. The seller's investment, however, might negatively affect the buyer's other-regarding preferences if the investment is viewed as opportunistic. We find overall support for our hypotheses that arise from the link between other-regarding behavior and opportunism. Our findings suggest that when the transaction cost economics approach is applied to the design of a governance structure, other-regarding preferences should be taken into account.","[Morita, Hodaka] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan; [Morita, Hodaka] UNSW Sydney, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Servatka, Maros] Macquarie Grad Sch Management, MGSM Expt Econ Lab, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Servatka, Maros] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",Hitotsubashi University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Economics Bratislava,"Morita, H (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.;Morita, H (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",hodakamorita@gmail.com,,"Morita, Hodaka/0000-0001-5996-008X","UNSW Business School; Australian Research Council; College of Business and Economics, University of Canterbury; Macquarie Graduate School of Management","UNSW Business School; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); College of Business and Economics, University of Canterbury; Macquarie Graduate School of Management","We are particularly grateful to Daniel Woods, Zuzana Brokeova, and Michal urinik for excellent research assistance and to the editor Laura Razzolini, three anonymous referees, David Cooper, Cary Deck, Nick Feltovich, David Fielding, Richard Holden, Hideshi Itoh, Tatsuyoshi Saijyo, John Spraggon, James Tremewan, Rado Vadovi, Mike Waldman, seminar participants at the University of Canterbury, University of Edinburgh, University of Mainz, University of Otago, MGSM, Academia Sinica, QUT, Kochi University of Technology, Massey University, University of Technology Sydney, University of Tasmania, University of Adelaide, and participants of the 8th ANZ workshop on experimental economics, 2014 Bratislava Economic Meeting, 2014 ESA in Auckland, 2014 ESA in Honolulu, 2014 ESA in Ft.

We exploit the 2003-2004 California workers' compensation reforms which reduced medical spending disproportionately for workers incurring low back injuries. We link administrative claims data to earnings records for injured workers and their uninjured coworkers. We find that workers with low back injuries experienced a 7.6 percent post-reform decline in medical care, and an 8.1 percent drop in post-injury earnings relative to other injured workers.","[Powell, David] RAND, 1200 S Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Seabury, Seth] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Emergency Med, 635 Downey Way,VPD 414C, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Seabury, Seth] Univ Southern Calif, Leonard D Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, 635 Downey Way,VPD 414C, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",RAND Corporation; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Powell, D (通讯作者)，RAND, 1200 S Hayes St, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",dpowell@rand.org; seabury@usc.edu,,,NIA [1R01AG046290]; Bing Center for Health Economics,NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Bing Center for Health Economics,"Powell: RAND, 1200 S.

We use an administrative panel dataset to establish that such asymmetries are a feature of West German labor markets. We find that the elasticity of real wages with respect to output is very close to zero in downswings but positive and highly significant in upswings. In a separate analysis we find that after controlling for match fixed effects, the cyclicality of new hire wages is approximately the same as that for incumbent wages, regardless of whether or not they joined the establishment from unemployment. This is supportive of equal treatment. We also show that a four parameter version of the equal treatment contracting model of Snell and Thomas (2010) can replicate reasonably well the salient time series properties and co-properties of real wages, output, and unemployment, in particular the asymmetric response of wages to output that we find in the data.

This study investigates how another form of segmentation that we observe, the segmentation of government bond markets across countries, can be exploited by the central bank of a currency union in which fiscal coordination is not attainable. It is shown first that, under general conditions, government bond purchases which lower bond yields have first-order effects on demand and hence inflation through a fiscal channel, even in the absence of heterogeneity in investment opportunities. The total effect on aggregate demand can be broken down into an income-from-debt-issuance effect and a primary-surplus effect. As a result, the central bank is able to use government bond purchases to control the terms of trade and achieve asymmetric degrees of stimulus across the members of the currency union without a transfer of resources if there is cross-country segmentation in bond markets and home bias in government spending. The paper characterises the welfare optimising mix of conventional interest rate policy and bond purchases in this scenario and gives an upper bound on the welfare benefits from using the additional tool.

Non-parental care, especially that from grandparents or formal care, helps alleviate the constraint females facing and thus permits the families to have more children. Extending from the theoretical framework in Ermisch (1989), this study incorporates grandparents' health status to provide a theoretical justification for its effect on family size. Based on the data taken from the Panel Study of Chinese Family Dynamics (PSFD) from 2006 to 2011, it is found that grandparents in different age groups exhibit differential influence on family fertility decisions. Specifically, healthy grandparents in the 55-64 age group are found to have a persistent and positive impact on the family's probability of having more children as predicted by the theoretical model. Nonetheless, when grandparents' health effect is compounded by the age effect, more elderly healthy grandparents in the 75-and-up group will reduce the couple's desire for more children. This negative effect can be explained by the couple's consideration of lower childcare quality and larger age gaps leading to great differences in the childcare ideas. The number of healthy grandmothers are found to have an even greater influence on family fertility decisions, suggesting grandmothers still take the major responsibility of childcare in the family and thus constitute an absolutely crucial resource in the Chinese society.","[Zhang, Yiyun; Luh, Yir-Hueih] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Luh, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",yirhueihluh@ntu.edu.tw,,"Luh, Yir-Hueih/0000-0003-1765-6156",,,,,48,8,8,4,35,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

This behaviour can be rationalised by assuming that individuals seek lump-sum payments and struggle to hold savings. Structural estimation of this model accounts for the behaviour of 75% of participants. Of these, two-thirds have high demand for lump-sum accumulation but savings difficulties.

In this context, it is the very instrument with which society tries to reduce the reigning uncertainty that, paradoxically, can ultimately drive uncertainty up. Our results show that the prediction error for the new emerging parties is significantly higher than for the traditional parties and this error is not sensitive to solutions for increasing the reliability of surveys, such as increasing sample size, transparency constantly conducting periodical surveys, the closeness of the approaching election or the survey mode that is used. It can be observed that pollsters do not want to make predictions that vary greatly from the average of the other polls. Finally, editorial bias appears to play a significant role, especially in the case of traditional parties.","[Castillo-Manzano, Jose I.; Lopez-Valpuesta, Lourdes; Pozo-Barajas, Rafael] Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Castillo-Manzano, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Seville, Spain.",,"Castillo-Manzano, Jose I./F-8859-2015; Pozo-Barajas, Rafael/G-2139-2015; Lopez Valpuesta, Lourdes Soledad/G-2322-2015","Lopez Valpuesta, Lourdes Soledad/0000-0003-1808-1032",,,,,41,1,1,0,3,"UNIV ZARAGOZA DEV COOPERATION CHAIR, SPANISH NETWORK DEV STUDIES",ZARAGOZA,"GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA, 50005, SPAIN",1133-455X,,,REV ECON APL-SPAIN,Rev.

Are they complementary policies for improving the welfare of consumers? We address this question in a dynamic general equilibrium model with innovation-driven growth. Under concave utility, the answer is yes for two cases: (1) the economy does not begin from steady state and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) is relatively large; (2) the economy begins from steady state with either a sufficiently small initial consumption and a relatively large EIS or a sufficiently big initial consumption and a relatively small EIS. Under linear utility, the answer is yes if the discounted lifetime utility is finite in equilibrium, no matter the economy begins from the steady state or not. As empirical evidence finds cross-country heterogeneity in EIS, they are not complementary for all economies. We also identify reasonable cases whereby they are substitute policies, so we show when it is not welfare-enhancing to simultaneously implement both policies.","[Dai, Darong] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Dai, DR (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",dai496@tamu.edu,,,,,,,38,7,8,0,26,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Whereas traditional models see an increase in house prices as a dynamic multiplier that contributes positively to business cycle swings, the paper considers additional transmission mechanisms via the competitiveness channel (wages) and productivity. As house prices rise, wages tend to follow in order to make up for the loss in real disposable income, which limits employment creation. In addition, with rising house prices, the relative size of the construction sector - a low-productivity industry - tends to increase, lowering aggregate productivity growth, further dampening competitiveness. The paper estimates a stylised dynamic general equilibrium model with unemployment flows. Introducing different transmission mechanisms through which the housing market influences labour and macroeconomic dynamics, the size and direction of the housing market channel is being analysed. The estimation results show that housing shocks can have long-lasting negative effects on employment even though a housing boom can generate a short-lived stimulus on growth and employment. The paper also offers some policy advice simulating housing shocks under different types of structural reforms and macro-prudential regulation.","[Ernst, Ekkehard] Int Labor Org, Res Dept, Geneva, Switzerland; [Saliba, Faten] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester, England",University of Manchester,"Ernst, E (通讯作者)，Int Labor Org, Res Dept, Geneva, Switzerland.",ernste@ilo.org,"Ernst, Ekkehard/HKO-1953-2023","Ernst, Ekkehard/0000-0001-6822-9766",,,,,56,7,7,1,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Literacy frequently is a prerequisite for employment and its relevance for productivity and wages is magnified by the fact that it is only through literacy that many other skills become usable. More so than for natives, this argument applies to migrants: even those with high levels of human capital acquired in the country of origin often have it rendered worthless by the absence of literacy in the host-country language. Using novel data from a large-scale German adult literacy test (leo.-Level-One Studie, or LEO), we investigate the determinants of literacy and show that migrants have systematically lower language skills than natives. We find that any observed raw employment and wage gaps between natives and migrants can be fully explained by these differences.","[Himmler, Oliver] Max Planck Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Jaeckle, Robert] Tech Hsch Nurnberg Georg Simon Ohm, Nurnberg, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Jäckle, R (通讯作者)，Tech Hsch Nurnberg Georg Simon Ohm, Dept Business Adm, Bahnhofstr 87, D-90402 Nurnberg, Germany.",robert.jaeckle@th-nuernberg.de,,,,,,,58,13,14,2,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Economic miracles and failures are embedded within extended phases of either growth or decline. In this paper, we analyze the growth patterns of developing and newly industrialized countries on the basis of structural breaks and growth regimes experienced. Emphasizing the presence of broken trends, we focus on the difference between expansionary and recessionary regimes of medium length, and we show that models of takeoffs and exponential growth are inadequate to characterize the majority of observed growth dynamics. Then, we move to a systematic classification of different patterns and we isolate an additional stylized fact characterizing the process of growth and development. In particular, our results show that expansionary regimes are associated with convergence and positive correlation between growth and (short run) volatility. By contrast, in recessionary regimes, poorer countries face deeper failures and a negative correlation between growth and volatility is found, indicating that output fluctuates less around the trend during strong rather than mild recessions. Catching-up phenomena are infrequent but more likely to occur across categories of growth patterns rather than within. Finally, we discover that regimes of growth and recession show similar average length (about 16 years). Although recessions are, on average, remarkably pronounced (14% loss of GDP per capita), the magnitude of growth is much larger during expansions. In sum, our results underline that stable positive growth is hardly achieved in developing countries, which rather alternate long phases of expansions with equally long phases of recession. Moreover, cross-sectional empirical regularities are found to differ between regimes of positive and negative growth.","[Lamperti, Francesco] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Lamperti, Francesco] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Mattei, Clara Elisabetta] New Sch Social Res, 6 E 16th St,Room 1119, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Mattei, Clara Elisabetta] Scuola Super Sant Anna, 6 E 16th St,Room 1119, New York, NY 10003 USA",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Fondazione Mattei; The New School,"Lamperti, F (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.;Lamperti, F (通讯作者)，Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Piazza Martini della Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",f.lamperti@santannapisa.it; matteic@newschool.edu,,,,,,,58,9,9,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Marmot argues that in developed countries, poor health does not cause low incomes; rather, low socioeconomic status leads to poor health, but not because of proximate factors like differential health care access, which can explain only a small portion of these gaps. Therefore, to eliminate health gaps, policy should focus on the deep causes of disease: poverty, education, and occupational mobility, among others.

Many studies use assumptions (i.e., price elasticities) that were estimated using historical information; however, if a price change has not been experienced in the past, the response may not be statistically predicted. While other papers have explored price response behavior internally through microeconomic principles, many factors affect a household's electricity use, including the construction of the dwelling, outdoor air temperature, and efficiency of the air conditioner. We have superimposed a physical model, which determines hourly power loads, with a utility maximization component. The dwelling itself is calibrated to one in Saudi Arabia, but we test households that have various preferences in their utility function, levels of thermal insulation, and income. We further analyze a wide range of electricity pricing schemes; some are progressive tariffs, while one is defined hourly. The extent to which the prices are raised in the alternative schemes has never been experienced in Saudi Arabia.

We implement an extended version of the semi-nonparametric tests introduced by Barnett and de Peretti on US monthly data from January 1967 to December 2012. The test, first, checks for the necessary existence conditions of an overall utility function and a monetary subutility function, and then tests for the separability of the latter. On different subsamples, our results suggest that only the DM1 aggregate meets the separability criterion. Implemented on macroeconomic data, we have tested a joint assumption about separability and the existence of a representative agent. Thus, the rejection of the null could also be due to the rejection of stringent Gorman's conditions. More advanced tests for weak separability are clearly required to confirm the results found in this paper.","[Mattson, Ryan S.] West Texas A&M, Canyon, TX USA; [de Peretti, Philippe] Univ Paris1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris, France",,"de Peretti, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CES, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",philippe.de-peretti@univ-paris1.fr,,"de Peretti, Philippe/0000-0002-0695-277X",European Union [320270 SYRTO]; PRES heSam [ANR10LABX0095]; National Research Agency (ANR) within the project Investissements d'Avenir Paris Nouveaux Mondes [ANR11IDEX000602],European Union(European Union (EU)); PRES heSam; National Research Agency (ANR) within the project Investissements d'Avenir Paris Nouveaux Mondes(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-SSH/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 320270 SYRTO.

The primary effects of the shocks are on the supply side of the economy in oil-importing countries and on the demand-side in oil-exporting countries. However, in addition to these direct effects, which are widely studied in the literature, the oil price shocks also generate spillover effects through trade and labour migration. The multi-country studies often do not consider the heterogeneities and spillover effects and cannot fully capture the differences in institutions and political structures across countries. In this study, we investigate the heterogeneous effects of oil price shocks on the Canadian economy, which includes autonomous oil-exporting and oil-importing provinces in a federal system under the same institutions, monetary policy, and political structure. Furthermore, trade and labour migration take place across provinces without significant barriers observed in international relations. We set up a panel VAR model to estimate the dynamic responses of provinces to oil price shocks accounting for the provincial heterogeneities and the spillover effects. We also test for asymmetric effects of positive and negative oil price shocks on provinces and examine the differences in the pre- and post-2000 periods. The results indicate that the oil price shocks generate positive impacts on both oil-exporting and oil-importing provinces, which is in contrast to the results often reported for individual countries or regions. The effects are asymmetric for positive and negative oil price shocks and more pronounced in the post-2000 period. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the few studies that have estimated intergenerational income elasticity (IGE) at different points of the distribution in the U.S. were limited by small samples, arrived at disparate results, and had not estimated the trend of elasticity over time. Using the PSID database, a large sample of income observations in the 1980-2010 period for the U.S. is built, which allows us to obtain robust quantile estimates of the IGE both for the pooled sample and for each wave. For the pooled sample, the IGE shows a U-shaped relation with the income distribution, with higher values at the tails (0.64 at the tenth percentile and 0.48 at the ninety-fifth percentile) and a minimum value -highest mobility- of 0.38 at the seventieth percentile. The trend evolution of the IGE also varies across the income distribution: at the lower and mid quantiles, income mobility increased during the 80s and 90s but declined in the 00s, while for the higher quantiles it remained relatively stable along the whole period. Finally, the impact of education and race on mobility is evaluated. Both factors are found to be important and related to the position at the income distribution.","[Palomino, Juan C.; Rodriguez, Juan G.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Palomino, Juan C.; Marrero, Gustavo A.; Rodriguez, Juan G.] EQUALITAS, Madrid, Spain; [Palomino, Juan C.; Marrero, Gustavo A.; Rodriguez, Juan G.] CEDESOG, San Cristobal De La Lagu, Spain; [Marrero, Gustavo A.] Univ la Laguna, San Cristobal De La Lagu, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad de la Laguna,"Palomino, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.;Palomino, JC (通讯作者)，EQUALITAS, Madrid, Spain.;Palomino, JC (通讯作者)，CEDESOG, San Cristobal De La Lagu, Spain.",juancpal@ucm.es; gmarrero@ull.es; juangabr@ucm.es,"Palomino, Juan C./JAC-9415-2023; PALOMINO, JUAN CÉSAR/AAC-9015-2021; Marrero, Gustavo A./A-4745-2008","Palomino, Juan C./0000-0003-2340-0640; PALOMINO, JUAN CÉSAR/0000-0003-2340-0640; Marrero, Gustavo A./0000-0003-4030-0078; RODRIGUEZ, JUAN GABRIEL/0000-0002-0256-8789","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [ECO2016-76506-C4-1-R, ECO2016-76818-C3-2]; Comunidad de Madrid (Spain) [S2015/HUM-3416-DEPOPORCM]; Fundacion Caja Canarias (Spain) [CSOCTRA07]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government); Comunidad de Madrid (Spain)(Comunidad de Madrid); Fundacion Caja Canarias (Spain),"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for excellent suggestions that contributed to significantly improve the paper.

The negative impacts of financial incomes from interests and dividends are particularly strong for the pre-crisis period.

A design that generates an anomalously high level of coordination, Rankin et al. (Games Econo Behav 32(2):315-337, 2000), varies payoffs each period in repeated play rather than holding them constant. These payoff perturbations are eerily similar to those used to motivate the theory of global games, except the theory operates under incomplete information. Interestingly, that equilibrium selection concept is known to coincide with risk dominance, rather than payoff dominance. Thus, in theory, a small change in experimental design should produce a different equilibrium outcome. We examine this prediction in two treatments. In one, we use public signals to match Rankin et al. (2000)'s design; in the other, we use private signals to match the canonical example of global games theory. We find little difference between treatments, in both cases, subject play approaches payoff dominance. Our literature review reveals this result may have more to do with the idiosyncrasies of our complete information framework than the superiority of payoff dominance as an equilibrium selection principle.","[Van Huyck, John; Brown, Alexander L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Viriyavipart, Ajalavat] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; American University of Sharjah,"Viriyavipart, A (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",aviriyavipart@aus.edu,"Viriyavipart, Ajalavat/AAF-8575-2021","Viriyavipart, Ajalavat/0000-0002-7152-6742; Brown, Alex/0000-0002-5582-5304",Texas A&M Humanities and Social Science Enhancement of Research Capacity Program,Texas A&M Humanities and Social Science Enhancement of Research Capacity Program,"Financial support was provided by the Texas A&M Humanities and Social Science Enhancement of Research Capacity Program.

After narrowing from 1940 to the mid-1970s, the median black-white level earnings gap has since grown as large as it was in 1950. At the same time, the median black man's relative position in the earnings distribution has remained essentially constant since 1940, so that the improvement then worsening of median relative earnings have come mainly from the stretching and narrowing of the overall earnings distribution. Black men at higher percentiles have experienced significant advances in relative earnings since 1940, due mainly to strong positional gains among those with college educations. Large relative schooling gains by blacks at the median and below have been more than counteracted by rising return to skill in the labor market, which has increasingly penalized remaining racial differences in schooling at the bottom of the distribution.","[Bayer, Patrick] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago,"Bayer, P (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,,,,,53,78,113,2,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

The dilemma of electric utility networks,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity; Price cap; Ramsey; Revenue cap; Welfare,SLIDING-SCALE REGULATION; INCENTIVE REGULATION; YARDSTICK COMPETITION; POWER SECTOR; INDUSTRIES; EMISSIONS; COUNTRIES; REFORM; CHINA; INDIA,"In this paper I analyse the behaviour of a monopoly electricity provider that serves three distinct markets under a price cap or revenue cap plan. I make comparisons in terms of their effects on price setting, energy conservation, and social welfare. In addition to contravening the Ramsey pricing rule, I find that under conditions of information asymmetry, when demand becomes more elastic or marginal cost increases, revenue cap price increases are larger relative to price cap regulation. In this specific setting, revenue cap price increases can encourage energy conservation but is less likely to do so when marginal cost is large in a market that is more elastic relative to others. In contrast to a price cap plan, these overall results show that revenue cap schemes are welfare-reducing. For public policy decision-making purposes, price cap regulation is more desirable especially in developing economies that often experience substantial inflationary pressures from global oil market developments but is less suitable than revenue cap regulation when electricity supply constraints and climate change are major policy concerns.

Using panel data over the period 1998-2008 and for 108 countries, it emerges that the effect of 'decentralization' (taken to be an increase in the number of government levels) broadly decreases both diesel and gasoline subsidies, with this effect being more pronounced when the level of political accountability is low. For developing countries, for which political accountability is low, decentralization decreases gasoline and diesel subsidies by at least 6.98% and 12.99%, respectively. For developed countries, for which political accountability is high, decentralization does not have any impact on both gasoline and diesel. What this evidence points to is that in developing economies, where voters are poorly informed and accountability is low, decentralization appears to be associated with lower fuel subsidies.

As a result, people's degree of happiness eventually returns to a stable reference level. We use a multicountry field experiment to examine the impact on subjective measures of well-being of the provision of improved housing to extremely poor populations in order to test whether they exhibit hedonic adaptation when their basic housing needs are met. After 16 months, we find that subjective perceptions of well-being improve substantially for recipients of improved housing but that, after, on average, eight additional months, 60% of that gain has dissipated. Extrapolation achieved through estimation of a structural model of hedonic adaptation suggests that the decay rate of the treatment effect is 20% per month. As a result, after 28 months of treatment exposure, we forecast that the entire treatment effect will have disappeared.

The emerging pattern of trade and finance in this engagement is in the course of sustaining the problem of trading in primary commodities in Africa. Thus, this engagement is found to hinder structural transformation of the continent, is leading to low quality growth and has limited effect on poverty reduction. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without addressing such structural problems related to primary commodity trade with China through structural transformation of the continent. Although the engagement has both challenges and opportunities the persistence of challenges, as opposed to opportunities, in the current engagement shows the lack of both human and institutional capacity and the resulting lack of informed-policy to benefit from the China-Africa current economic engagement. Without such capacity and informed policy for strategic engagement, Africa may not benefit from its current engagement with China in the long run.","[Geda, Alemayehu] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Addis Ababa University,"Geda, A (通讯作者)，Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Econ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",ag112526@gmail.com,,,,,,,143,7,7,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Incomes from fishing can be highly variable and difficult to predict and it is possible that fishermen set specific revenue targets for their fishing trips to simplify decision making. In this paper a discrete choice stopping model is used where the fishermen must decide to stop or continue fishing after each haul. At average trip length, the results indicate that when revenues are higher than expected, fishermen are more likely to return to port. This is in line with the revenue target hypothesis. When using estimated revenue targets the results suggest that the effect of getting higher revenues than expected is stronger when the targets have been reached.","[Hammarlund, Cecilia] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Box 730, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Hammarlund, C (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Box 730, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",cecilia.hammarlund@agrifood.lu.se,,,Swedish research council Formas (SoundFish project),Swedish research council Formas (SoundFish project),The author thanks Kaveh Majlesi for valuable comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Analysis can be further complicated if high levels of public debt affect the performance of stabilization policy. We construct a framework capable of handling these issues with an application to Euro Area data. In order to incorporate multiple macroeconomic series from each country but, simultaneously, treat country-specific fiscal policy, we develop a hierarchical factor-augmented VAR with zero restrictions on the loadings that yield country-level factors. Monetary policy, then, responds to area-wide conditions but fiscal policy responds only to its country-level conditions. We find that there is broad quantitative variation in different countries' responses to area-wide monetary policy and both qualitative and quantitative variation in responses to country-specific fiscal policy. Moreover, we find that debt conditions do not diminish the effectiveness of policy in a significant manner, suggesting that any negative effects must come through other channels.

Such mechanisms include popular vote requirements following insufficient majorities in the legislature. This paper analyzes a one-period legislative bargaining game whose outcome can be challenged through a referendum. I study the effects of this institution on the bills passed in the legislature and analyze the incentives it provides for reaching legislative deals. The proposer party's trade-off between a larger winning prize and a more threatening opponent in the referendum summarizes the bargaining problem. The results indicate that measures of post-bargaining power do not necessarily translate into higher equilibrium payoffs and that the equilibrium bill may include no concessions from the majority to the minority party. Moreover, caps on campaign spending may incentivize a costly referendum over unanimity in the legislature. These results carry policy implications for regulating various forms of post-bargaining power, such as campaign finance laws for referenda.","[Karakas, Leyla D.] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"Karakas, L (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",lkarakas@maxwell.syr.edu,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

(J Econ Theory 100:22-72, 2001, J Econ Theory 121:51-74, 2005). Their work extends the theory of value beyond the scope of the Walrasian single market linear price model. Our arguments include a new and general result on the existence of linear price equilibrium with multiple markets. Each market has its own price vector (linear functional), and agents' involvement in various markets is heterogeneous. As a result, price differences across markets may prevail in equilibrium. We present an example in which single market linear price equilibrium does not exist, but certain corresponding equilibrium with two markets does. This example is a particular instance of a prevalent nonexistence problem in atomless economies with differential information. Bypassing the nonexistence problem is one of the achievements of the nonlinear equilibrium theory. Our equilibrium with multiple markets, on the other hand, offers a solution with a more standard economic interpretation. Besides, our general framework is a model of multiple markets in their own right, and our results are related to the role of economic intermediation and bilateral trade.","[Klishchuk, Bogdan] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Klishchuk, B (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",bogdan.klishchuk@anu.edu.au,,"Klishchuk, Bogdan/0000-0001-6632-7303",,,,,34,0,0,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Based on the decomposed time series and the copula dependence, the Value-at-Risk (VaR), conditional VaR (CoVaR) and delta CoVaR (Delta CoVaR) are quantified to analyze the upside and downside risk spillovers from oil market to China stock market in raw, short- and long-run investment horizons before and after the financial crisis. The empirical results show that, first, the recent financial crisis enhances the dependences between the crude oil market and China stock market, and the long-run dependence increases more significantly than that of short-run. For the raw return series, there are symmetric upper and lower tail dependencies in full sample and pre-crisis subsample periods, but an average dependence in post-crisis subsample period. Second, the VaR of China stock market increases heavily around the financial crisis, but the average VaR after the crisis deceases compared to the risk before the crisis. Third, the risk spillovers from crude oil price to China stock market are found in each sample periods. Before the crisis, however, it mainly exists in long-run horizon, while after the crisis, it happens in both short- and long-run horizons. Finally, the risk spillovers from oil price to China stock market display strong asymmetric features, with larger long-term, downside risk spillovers in post-crisis subsample. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We develop experimental evidence on cooperation and response to sanctions by running prisoner's dilemma and third party punishment games on three different pools of subjects; students, ordinary criminals and Camorristi (Neapolitan 'Mafiosi'). The latter two groups were recruited from within prisons. Camorra prisoners show a high degree of cooperativeness and a strong tendency to punish defectors, as well as a clear rejection of the imposition of external rules even at significant cost to themselves. The subsequent econometric analysis further enriches our understanding demonstrating inter alia that individuals' locus of control and reciprocity are associated with quite different and opposing behaviours amongst different participant types; a strong sense of self-determination and reciprocity both imply a higher propensity to punish for Camorra inmates, but quite the opposite for ordinary criminals, further reinforcing the contrast between the behaviour of ordinary criminals and the strong internal mores of Camorra clans.

A new, largely complete legal CBI dataset, covering 182 countries was used for the work. The results indicate that the effect of legal CBI on price stability depends on the strength of the rule of law. Moreover, the results reveal that legal CBI has no significant effect on price stability when the rule of law is weak. The findings also show that 67% of advanced countries possess a rule of law that is strong enough to maintain price stability by increasing central bank autonomy, while only 4.5% of developing countries possess it.","[Nurbayev, Daniyar] Eurasian Res Inst, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",,"Nurbayev, D (通讯作者)，Eurasian Res Inst, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan.",daniyar.nurbayev@eurasian-research.org,"Nurbayev, Daniyar/E-1623-2015","Nurbayev, Daniyar/0000-0002-9006-5208",,,,,60,11,11,1,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Using the German Socio-Economic Panel, we find that a job loss due to a plant closure has no long-lasting effect on locus of control. The common assumption of its stability is thus not rejected. However, during unemployment, control perception decreases by 30 percent of one standard deviation. The effect holds true independent from unemployment duration or socio-demographic characteristics and vanishes as soon as the unemployed find a new job. We therefore conclude that stated locus of control is affected by unemployment. Using this trait as explanatory variable can thus lead to biased estimations when this temporary deviation in measurement is not accounted for.","[Preuss, Malte; Hennecke, Juliane] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Hennecke, Juliane] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",Free University of Berlin; University of Potsdam,"Preuss, M (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",malte.preuss@fu-berlin.de,"Hennecke, Juliane/L-3844-2019; Hennecke, Juliane/AAE-9863-2020","Hennecke, Juliane/0000-0002-8169-4862; Hennecke, Juliane/0000-0002-8169-4862",,,,,60,20,22,4,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,AUG,2018,53.0,,,,,,63,74,,10.1016/j.labeco.2018.05.007,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,GT6VX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444660100005,0

The demand functions of automotive gasoline, ethanol and compressed natural gas (CNG) were estimated by employing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and Harvey's Structural Time Series Model (STSM). The importance of considering a more flexible approach incorporating both UEDT and APR was confirmed by the data. We identified that consumer response to changes in price is not linear. The model also inferred a high substitutability between gasoline and ethanol. Both in the short and the long term, demand for ethanol is more price elastic than demand for gasoline. Empirical analysis suggests that the decision to refuel a vehicle with CNG is not influenced by price variations in ethanol, which indicates that competition only occurs between CNG and gasoline. Therefore, the inclusion of UEDT and APR provides more precise information on the effect of price and income changes on automotive fuel demand. Such information is relevant for establishing public policies, as refinery expansion plannning and CO2 emission mitigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Subjects acting as fund managers receive imperfect private information concerning the fundamental value of a stock, which they then trade in sequence with a market maker. When prices are flexible, subjects regard their private information and herd less frequently than when the price is constant. When price is fixed, subjects evaluated by relative performance tend to go with the flow to reduce any price deviation from their peers, but when the price is flexible, herd behavior almost disappears under relative performance evaluation as the increasing trading costs squeeze the net profit of follow-up imitators.

After implementing a social network census, one of three village-level treatments determined which treated nodes in the village received information about composting: random assignment, nodes with the highest degree, or nodes with high betweenness. We then look at how information diffuses through the network. We find information diffusion declines with social distance, suggesting frictions in the diffusion of information. Aggregate knowledge about the technology did not differ across targeting strategies, but targeting nodes using betweenness measures in village level networks excludes less-connected nodes from new information. Women fanners are less likely to receive information when betweenness centrality is used in targeting, suggesting there are important gender differences, not only in the relationship between social distance and diffusion, but also in the social learning process.","[Beaman, Lori] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Dillon, Andrew] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Northwestern University; Michigan State University,"Dillon, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",dillona6@msu.edu,,,"German Development Ministry (BMZ); International Food Policy Research Institute; Millennium Challenge Corporation; Millennium Challenge Account-Mali; Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research; National Science Foundation [1254380]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1254380] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","German Development Ministry (BMZ); International Food Policy Research Institute(CGIAR); Millennium Challenge Corporation; Millennium Challenge Account-Mali; Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The authors acknowledge financial support for fieldwork from the German Development Ministry (BMZ), International Food Policy Research Institute, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Millennium Challenge Account-Mali, and Northwestern University's Institute for Policy Research.

These conditions form a system of functional equations which we solve numerically. The solution takes into account simultaneously the effect of the government policy on individual allocations, the resulting optimal distribution of agents in the steady state and, therefore, equilibrium prices. We illustrate the methodology on a Ramsey problem with heterogeneous agents, finding the optimal limiting tax on total income. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We show that: (1) both firms choose the quantity strategy when the cost efficiency of the subcontractor is low; (2) the choice of competition strategy is the price strategy for the subcontractor and the quantity strategy for the outsourcer when the cost efficiency of the subcontractor is moderate; (3) both firms choose the price strategy when the cost efficiency of the subcontractor is sufficiently high.,"[Chang, Ray-Yun] Chinese Culture Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hu, Jin-Li] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Inst Business & Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Lin, Yan-Shu] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Hualien, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Dong Hwa University,"Lin, YS (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Hualien, Taiwan.",ylin@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,"Hu, Jin-Li/S-6534-2019","Hu, Jin-Li/0000-0002-7337-2935",National Science Council [NSC-102-2410-H-259-003-MY3],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We are grateful to two referees for their valuable comments, leading to substantial improvements of this paper.

In our experiment, we first increase the number of students per match from 4 to 40; when we do so, participant truth-telling increases under DA but decreases under IA, leading to a decrease in efficiency under both mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that DA remains more stable than IA, regardless of scale. We then further increase the number of participants per match to 4,000 through the introduction of robots. When robots report their preferences truthfully, we find that scale has no effect on human best response behavior. By contrast, when we program the robots to draw their strategies from the distribution of empirical human strategies, we find that our increase in scale increases human ex-post best responses under both mechanisms.

Using a unique data set on foreign affiliates of Korean MNCs, I find that most foreign affiliates have managers transferred from their parent companies. These transferred managers at first comprise a significant portion of the managerial positions at foreign affiliates, but gradually become outnumbered by local managers as the affiliates grow. Despite the transferred managers being comparatively few in number, they are positively associated with the growth of the affiliates' productivity. The empirical findings provide evidence that knowledge transfers stemming from the transfer of managers from the parent to foreign affiliates are a source of benefit to foreign affiliates.

Instantaneous learning by owners maximizes the number of owners with private information, but also maximizes the trading volume and welfare. This result is contrary to the traditional view that information asymmetry hurts trade efficiency. Public disclosure of information is not always optimal and its welfare implication depends crucially on the source of gains from trade. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We document that adoption lags between poor and rich countries have converged, while the intensity of use of adopted technologies of poor countries relative to rich countries has diverged. The evolution of aggregate productivity implied by these trends in technology diffusion resembles the actual evolution of the world income distribution in the last two centuries. Cross-country differences in adoption lags account for a significant part of the cross-country income divergence in the nineteenth century. The divergence in intensity of use accounts for the divergence during the twentieth century.","[Comin, Diego] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, 6106 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Comin, Diego] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Comin, Diego; Mestieri, Marti] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Mestieri, Marti] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, 2211 Campus Dr, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Northwestern University,"Comin, D (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, 6106 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Comin, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Comin, D (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",diego.comin@dartmouth.edu; marti.mestieri@northwestern.edu,,,National Science Foundation; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Agence Nationale de la Recherche at TSE,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute for New Economic Thinking; Agence Nationale de la Recherche at TSE(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This paper - subsumes the working paper An Intensive Exploration of Technology Adoption.

Our experiment involved students from an Italian University who took an exam that was partly evaluated on the basis of relative performance. Students were matched in pairs on the basis of their high school grades and each pair was randomly assigned to one of three different tournaments. Random assignment neutralizes selection effects and allows us to investigate if larger prize spreads increase individual effort. We do not find any positive effect of larger prizes on performance. Furthermore, we show that the effect of prize spreads on students' performance depends on their degree of risk-aversion: competing in tournaments with large spreads negatively affects the performance of risk-averse students, while it does not produce any effect on students who are more prone to taking risks.
