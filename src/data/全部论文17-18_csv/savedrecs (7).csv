In this paper, we account for this issue by analyzing the effects of the monetary policy shock in a structural fractionally integrated VAR. Our main findings are: a) there is overwhelming evidence of long memory, with the traditional framework, decisively rejected by the data; b) allowing for long memory has strong implications for the analysis of the responses of the variables to non-systematic policy actions; c) typical VAR specifications lead to a misleading assessment of the importance of the monetary policy shock; d) the long memory properties of inflation remain stable across the usual sample splits in the literature, consistent with the view that long memory is an intrinsic property of inflation data arising in the construction of the price indexes. This result is robust to alternative specifications of the model.","[Lovcha, Yuliya] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; CREIP, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Lovcha, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain.",yuliya.lovcha@urv.cat,"perez-laborda, alejandro/O-1459-2019; Lovcha, Yuliya/AAA-8833-2019","perez-laborda, alejandro/0000-0003-4247-598X; Lovcha, Yuliya/0000-0002-0481-7785",Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-42884-P],Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),"This paper is based on a preliminary work entitled A fractionally integrated approach to monetary policy and inflation dynamics.

However, in the case of the US, the term spread's predictive power has diminished from the mid-1980s till present. This paper provides new evidence to the debate on why the term spread leads output growth. We do this by structurally accounting for the decline in the predictive power of the US term spread. Our findings indicate that it is changes to the composition of shocks hitting the US economy which has caused the term spread, through the endogenous monetary policy response, to be a less reliable indicator of future output growth in recent decades.","[Morell, Joseph] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Morell, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England.",jm828@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,73,7,8,1,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

To this end, I first calibrate the shock needed to generate the risk of hitting the ZLB that matches the U. S. data, based on a fully nonlinear method. I then resolve the model with different inflation targets and find that the optimal target is 3.4%. In addition, the optimal inflation target is a nonlinear function of the risk of hitting the ZLB and inflation indexation. It is always greater than 2% if the risk is greater than 2.5% or if the inflation indexation is higher than 0.5. Finally, the linear-quadratic approach overestimates the true optimal inflation target. In particular, based on the benchmark calibration, it generates an optimal target of 5.5%, compared with 3.4% found by the fully nonlinear method.","[Ngo, Phuong V.] Cleveland State Univ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University,"Ngo, PV (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, 2121 Euclid,RT 1705, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",p.ngo@csuohio.edu,,,,,,,35,6,7,1,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Its aim is to move the EU less developed countries and regions on path of R&D-based growth. This transformation requires not only endogenous knowledge and technology accumulation building but also coupling with international knowledge and production networks. Yet, internationalisation does not seem to be a crucial component in the design and development of Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3), which are at odds with the strong dependence of the EU New Member States (EU-13) on FDI and global value chains. Our analysis is grounded in the key 'stylised facts' related to EU-13 R&D&I activities, and the complex link between innovation and internationalisation. Innovation systems in the EU-13 are fragmented and based on largely public R&D systems and on predominantly production-oriented foreign direct investment (FDI). This structural weakness calls for stronger support for innovation-oriented activities and for the integration of global value chains (GVCs) and FDI into local innovation systems. We explore the main obstacles to the internationalisation of smart specialisation and discuss ways to overcome them. We highlight the policy action areas related to providing support for technology upgrading in relation to the internationalisation of smart specialisation.","[Radosevic, Slavo] UCL, Sch Slavon & East European Studies United Kingdom, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Ciampi Stancova, Katerina] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain",University of London; University College London; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Stancova, KC (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville, Spain.",Katerina.CIAMPI-STANCOVA@ec.europa.eu,"Radosevic, Slavo/AAH-6516-2019","Radosevic, Slavo/0000-0001-7905-2281",,,,,66,43,44,5,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

In addition, a growing importance of increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public entities can be noticed. These phenomena are visible in the implementation of the labour market policy. However, the EU countries represent a different approach to spending public funds on issues related to the implementation of labour market policy. Purpose of the article: The authors are presenting the main theoretical assumptions concerning effectiveness and efficiency of labour market policy. Moreover, in the paper the EU countries are classified in clusters according to their level of expenditure on different categories of LMP. A comparison of the situation over ten years - in 2004 and 2014 - has also been conducted. In 2004, ten new members entered the EU, and the year 2014 presents the most current data in the analyzed area. Methods: As a research method cluster analysis was applied. Cross-country labour market situation throughout the EU is presented by the analysis of the Eurostat data. 'The countries are grouped in clusters following Ward's and k-means methods. Findings & Value added: There is a need to work out a complex evaluation of labour market policies in the EU to provide comparative analysis of the EU countries (or groups of countries). It would allow to determine the level of development of the country in terms of the efficiency or labour market policies. The EU countries with the boat labour market indicators represent diverse levels of IMP expenditure.","[Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45 A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland; [Dabrowska, Edyta] Marshals Off Podlasie Voivodeship, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Rollnik-Sadowska, E (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45 A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",e.rollnik@pb.edu.pl,"Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa/AAV-4280-2020","Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa/0000-0002-4896-1199",,,,,42,36,36,0,15,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

In order to assess how entrepreneurial universities could play a primary role in creating an entrepreneurial culture, three-pillar activities of Italian higher institutions have been measured and correlated to specific economic variables at the local level. Starting from the concept of a learning region and using findings of the research, the final aim of the study was to introduce the concept of local intellectual capital and, in this perspective, to appreciate the function of entrepreneurial universities in fostering and enhancing the intangible resources of a territory. Therefore, through the analysis of research findings, entrepreneurial universities are considered as acquiring a crucial function as intermediaries that are able to manage and enhance local intellectual capital and to make possible the learning region growth. University managers have to comprehend the relevance of the surrounding environment and of developing an entrepreneurial mindset for the outliving of their institution; at the same time, governments need to design focused policies giving higher priority to nurturing local entrepreneurs, promoting successful entrepreneurial role models and removing bureaucratic impediments to start-ups and business-like initiatives.","[Trequattrini, Raffaele; Lardo, Alessandra; Cuozzo, Benedetta] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, Italy; [Lombardi, Rosa] Univ Rome, Dept Res, Link Campus,Via Nomentana 335, I-00162 Rome, Italy",University of Cassino; Sapienza University Rome,"Lardo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, Italy.",r.trequattrini@unicas.it; r.lombardi@unilink.it; a.lardo@unicas.it; b.cuozzo@unicas.it,"Trequattrini, Raffaele/AAI-3270-2021; Lombardi, Rosa/M-2292-2019","Lombardi, Rosa/0000-0003-0470-231X; Cuozzo, Benedetta/0000-0002-8814-5583",,,,,54,31,34,3,42,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

Two main advantages of this approach are (i) we obtain new axiomatizations of the two sharing methods based on axiomatizations of the conjunctive permission value, and (ii) by applying the alternative disjunctive permission value, obtained as the Shapley value of a different restricted game, we propose the new Upstream Limited Sharing method and provide an axiomatization.

We apply Johansen's multivariate co-integration technique. The findings from this study confirm that GPPP holds among SADC member countries included in this study on account of cointegration and stationarity in real exchange rate series. South African rand normalized long run beta coefficients of all the real exchange rates are below one except in the case of the Mauritian rupee and all bear negative signs except in the case of the Angolan New Kwanza and Mauritian rupee. This is evidence that supports monetary union in the region except for Angola and Mauritius. Moreover, the panel cointegration tests also confirm the cointegration among real exchange rate series of SADC countries. However, the absolute magnitudes of the short run adjustment coefficients of SADC countries' real exchange rates are low and bear positive signs in some cases. This finding implies that the observed slow speed of adjustment for (log) real exchange rate of SADC member states might constrain the effectiveness of stabilization policies in the wake of external shocks, rendering SADC countries vulnerable to macroeconomic instability in the region. This result has important policy implications for the proposed monetary union in SADC.","[Zerihun, Mulatu F.; Breitenbach, Marthinus C.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Zerihun, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",zerihunmf@tut.ac.za; martin.breitenbach@up.ac.za,"Zerihun, Mulatu Fekadu/W-8810-2019; Breitenbach, Marthinus C/AAO-7736-2020","Zerihun, Mulatu Fekadu/0000-0003-4797-928X; Breitenbach, Marthinus C/0000-0003-4623-2379",,,,,35,0,1,3,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

After examining potential explanations, we believe the observed pattern is best explained by a mixture of signaling and countersignaling: the better A restaurants use nondisclosure as a countersignal, while worse As and better Bs use disclosure to stand out from the other restaurants.","[Bederson, Benjamin B.] Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, 2117D Hornbake Lib, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 3114 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Leslie, Phillip] 1092 Nowita Pl, Venice, CA 90291 USA; [Quinn, Alexander J.] Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Zou, Ben] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Michigan State University,"Bederson, BB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, 2117D Hornbake Lib, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",bederson@cs.umd.edu; jin@econ.umd.edu; pleslie@fastmail.com; aq@purdue.edu; benzou@msu.edu,"Zou, Ben/IXD-8748-2023",,Sloan Foundation,Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

We find little evidence that a seat on an important committee makes a member of Congress more powerful, but members do experience a significant increase in power when they become chair of a committee.

The index is composed of four sub-indices-board composition/structure, board compensation, shareholder rights, and disclosure-assessing the quality of the firm's governance. Our empirical findings point to a decrease in the bond spreads for an improvement of the overall quality of the corporate governance index. When we analyze the impact of each of the sub-indices, only the quality of the board composition/structure as well as the disclosure quality seems to matter to bondholders. We interpret our finding within the Canadian comply or disclose approach to governance where more responsibility is put on investors to assess and judge the quality of the governance practices. In such context, bondholders value stronger boards (in terms of composition as well structured board can mitigate agency problems), and are also particularly concerned with the quality of the firms' disclosure policies (to reduce information asymmetry). In addition to the Board Composition and the Disclosure sub-indexes, we also find a significant negative relationship between shareholder rights sub-index and the cost of debt for issuers headquartered in Quebec. Only in Quebec, features that protect shareholders from the managers (and major shareholders)' potential misbehavior seem to reduce the cost of debt. This might be due to the lower confidence that bondholders have in the Quebec French-Common-Law-based jurisdiction even after the adoption of the new Quebec Business Corporations Act in 2011.

The analysis is carried out at two aggregation levels: first for the whole set of countries (joint analysis) and then separately for developed and developing states (group analysis). A powerful time series methodology adapted to a nonlinear framework that allows for quadratic trends with possibly smooth transition between regimes - is applied. This approach provides more robust conclusions in convergence path analysis, enabling (a) robust detection of the presence, and if so, the number of changes in the level and/or slope of the trend of the series; (b) inferences on stationarity of relative per capita CO2 emissions, conditionally on the presence of breaks and smooth transitions between regimes; and (c) estimation of change locations in the convergence paths. Finally, as stochastic convergence is attained when both stationarity around a trend and beta-convergence simultaneously hold, the linear approach proposed by Tomljanovich and Vogelsang (2002) is extended in order to allow for more general, quadratic models. Overall, joint analysis finds some evidence of stochastic convergence in per capita CO2 emissions. Some dispersion in terms of beta-convergence is detected by the group analysis, particularly among developed countries. This is in accordance with per capita GDP not being the sole determinant of convergence in emissions, with factors like search for more efficient technologies, fossil fuel substitution, innovation, and possibly industry outsourcing, also having a crucial role.

We evaluate the performance of inflation forecasts based on the single-equation forecasting specification implied by the model, exploiting the spatial pattern of international linkages underpinning global inflation. We find that incorporating cross-country interactions yields significantly more accurate forecasts of local inflation for a diverse group of 14 advanced countries (including the U.S.) than either a simple autoregressive model or a standard closed-economy Phillips curve-based forecasting model. We argue that modeling the temporal dimension but not the cross-country spillovers of inflation does limit a model's explanatory power in-sample and its (pseudo) out-of-sample forecasting performance. Moreover, we also show that global inflation (without domestic slack) often contributes the most to achieve the gains on forecasting accuracy observed during our sample period (1984:Q1-2015:Q1)-this observation, according to theory, is crucially related to the flattening of the Phillips curve during this time period of increased globalization.

The empirical evidence suggests that regulations that lessen overall default risk have a greater impact on IBs while those increasing default risk have a greater impact on CBs.

This paper examines the theoretical effect of this psychological bias on preferences over repeated investments by using a model of the belief in the law of small numbers. An alternation bias agent (ABA) has a different perception to a rational agent (RA) about the outcome distribution of the sum of n realisations of a lottery. The results show that an ABA, that maximises expected utility, could reject a single realisation of a lottery while accepting several repetitions in accordance with Paul Samuelson's fallacy of large numbers. Furthermore, the explanation of this type of preference, based on the alternation bias, is compatible with previous behavioural accounts. A more general result shows that the alternation bias increases (decreases) the expected utility of the perceived sum of identically distributed lotteries if individuals are risk averse (risk seekers).","[Robles-Zurita, Jose] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, 1 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Robles-Zurita, J (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, 1 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland.",JoseAntonio.Robles-Zurita@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Robles-Zurita, Jose/0000-0002-3862-8798",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [Proyecto codigo ECO2013-43526-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The author appreciates comments and suggestions from participants of seminars of the Department of Economics and Economic History at University of Seville, Department of Economic Theory at University of Malaga, and Department of Economics at University of Navarra.

That is the main question this article attempts to answer. A second concern is whether the choice of allocating the loan approval decision to the loan officer enables a microfinance institution to expand its number of loans and improve its loan portfolio quality after controlling for the endogeneity of the choice of decentralizing the loan approval. To achieve this goal, we study an independently pooled cross-section sample of 362 assessment reports for 267 MFIs from 2001 to 2012 across 67 countries. Results suggest that size, cooperative status, and solidarity lending are MFI-level variables that affect the likelihood of choosing a decentralized loan approval process. Allocating the decision-making authority to the loan officer improves MFIs' breadth of outreach (the number of active borrowers) but does not affect the size of the loan portfolio and does not deteriorate their loan portfolio quality.

Asymmetry in the cyclicality between firm birth and firm death is observed: aggregate firm birth is generally significantly procyclicat, while the (counter-)cyclicality in firm death is ambiguous and sensitive to the choice of cyclical indicator. Such a pattern exists within the majority of sectors as well and is mainly driven by small firms. Young firms are the main contributors to the findings on firm death activity. Further examination along the time-dimension discovers a reason for the contemporaneous cyclicality (or lack thereof) which can be documented as a new fact: firm births positively lead the usual business cycle measures and firm deaths positively lag them. Moreover, cyclicality in business openings and closings differs from establishment level to firm level due to the internal adjustment of continuing firms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In order to ensure equal protection to depositors in all European Union countries, the European Commission presented the common European Union risk-based deposit insurance system model in 2015. In this model, the individual risk of each bank should be measured. However, there are discussions in scientific literature that the amount of systemic risk of the banks should be measured. In the current economy it is very important to measure the arising amount of systemic risk in the banking sector, but even the new E.U. common deposit insurance system model of 2015 does not take systemic risk assessment into account. The aim of the research is to evaluate the risk-based common European deposit insurance system impact on deposit insurance premiums to Lithuanian banks: not only individual banks' risks, but the systemic risk as well. The most appropriate systemic risk assessment method was selected according to different scientific researchers and strong Lithuanian banking sector concentration. The results showed that inclusion of the systemic risk assessment in risk-based deposit insurance system helps to have more accurate bank risk assessment.","[Lakstutiene, Ausrine; Barkauskaite, Aida] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Witkowska, Justyna] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Econ Sci, Olsztyn, Poland",Kaunas University of Technology; University of Warmia & Mazury,"Lakstutiene, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Kaunas, Lithuania.",aida.barkauskaite@ktu.edu,"Witkowska, Justyna/ADH-4952-2022","Witkowska, Justyna/0000-0001-8478-0769",,,,,26,1,1,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Joseph A. Schumpeter, arguing that innovation could only be proposed by entrepreneurs and take place predominantly in the real sector, seems to propose a foundation for a contemporaray analysis of financial innovations. There is a lack of specific emphasis on the evolution of financial innovations in Schumpeter's work. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate that Schumpeter's analysis of entrepreneurial innovation, which takes place in the real economy, also proposes a theoretical account for understanding the dynamics of financial innovations. Our aim is to propose a comparative study between entrepreneurial innovations and financial innovations. Nevertheless, analyzing financial innovations in the framework of Schumpeter's economic theory doesn't mean to legitimize them all. This is also an investigation for diversifying financial innovations according to their impact on the real economy. We provide a basic foundation for a post-Schumpeterian description of the evolution of the capitalist system.","[Akdere, Cinla] Middle East Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Benli, Pelin] Middle East Tech Univ, Telecommun Sect, Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University,"Akdere, Ç (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Ankara, Turkey.",,"Akdere, Cinla/ABA-3739-2020","Akdere, Cinla/0000-0002-5315-851X",,,,,111,5,10,5,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This paper intends to define the concepts of WOM and customer equity and study the terminology of current purchase intention, customer loyalty and correlates to consumer decision making. The data were collected utilizing self-administrated questionnaires. The results are obtained using Smart PLS 2.0, then using the bootstrap algorithm the t-statistics are analyzed. The results indicate that customer equity drivers increase the customer loyalty and consequently ends in WOM by the customers. Despite the literature which has investigated the influence of customer equity drivers on the loyalty and purchase intention of the customers, this study contributes the analysis of drivers on WOM. Also, it reveals that if a firm invests in the customer equity drivers, the result will be loyalty and accordingly, the easiest way of advertisement that would be WOM.

The agents have discontinuous preferences over the total contribution with a jump when the project is completed. There is complete information about the environment but imperfect information about others' individual actions: in each period, each agent observes only the total contribution made, not other agents' individual contributions. Assuming the agents are time-inconsistent and sophisticated, we characterize the set of equilibria. We compare the set of equilibrium outcomes under sophisticated time inconsistent agents to that under time-consistent agents.

Unlike tests of misspecified linear models, our nonparametric causality-in-quantiles tests find causality in mean and variance from inflation to gold market price changes between the 0.20 quantile and the 0.70 quantile, implying that very low- and high-price changes in gold markets are not related to inflation. These changes should be related to other sources, such as financial shocks and exchange market shocks. We find support that gold serves as a hedge against inflation, but only in the mid-quantile ranges, i.e. quantiles from 0.20 to 0.70. Our results show that gold does not serve as a hedge against inflation during periods when gold market price changes are very low or very high, which are respectively quiet and highly volatile periods.","[Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famgusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev, Montpellier, France; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Ozdemir, Zeynel Abidin] Gazi Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Gunes, Serkan] Gazi Univ, Dept Ind Design, Ankara, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University; Montpellier Business School; University of Pretoria; Gazi University; Gazi University,"Ozdemir, ZA (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",zabidin@gazi.edu.tr,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Güneş, Serkan/HNP-0325-2023; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; Güneş, Serkan/0000-0003-4377-528X; ozdemir, zeynel abidin/0000-0001-8600-0463",,,,,27,12,12,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A consumer who decides to attend a theatre production faces multiple sources of price variation that involves a choice by the consumer among different ticket alternatives. Three modelling approaches are proposed in order to model ticket purchases: conditional logit with socio-demographic characteristics, nested logit and latent class. These models allow us explicitly to take into account consumers' preference heterogeneity with respect to the attributes associated with each ticket alternative (quality of the seat and day of the performance). In addition, the willingness to pay of choice attributes is estimated. Final results suggest that customers' characteristics in terms of age and frequency of theatre attendance characterize different patterns of behaviour in the choice of theatre ticket.","[Baldin, Andrea] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Venice, Italy; [Bille, Trine] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B,3 Floor, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Copenhagen Business School,"Bille, T (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B,3 Floor, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",tbi.mpp@cbs.dk,"Baldin, Andrea/G-9320-2019","Baldin, Andrea/0000-0002-4386-2423; Bille, Trine/0000-0002-0139-166X",,,,,28,11,11,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We characterize in a standard contracting framework the circumstances under which this combination is possible, in the sense that a commitment contract exists that implements the desired state-contingent consumption plan, thus offering both commitment and flexibility. The key condition that we identify is a preference reversal condition: high desired consumption today should be associated with low marginal utility at future dates. Moreover, there are conditions under which preference reversal naturally arises. The key insight of our article is that time-inconsistent preferences not only generate commitment problems, but also allow their possible solution, since the preferences of later selves can be exploited to punish overconsumption by earlier selves.","[Bond, Philip] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Bond, P (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",apbond@uw.edu,"Bond, Philip/Q-3302-2019",,,,,,36,15,17,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The grave economic crisis that started in 2008, which is known as the Great Recession, has deteriorated the level of political trust in several countries. Some authors have shown that those countries with an increasing level of unemployment experienced a sharp decline in political trust. In particular, the political distrust in Spain has suffered a high increase since the Great Recession. This paper tests the procyclicality of political trust in Spain through the analysis and modeling of the relationship between political trust and business cycle in Spain over the period 1996-2015. The cross-correlation analysis, the Granger causality test, and the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach coherently conclude the procyclicality of political trust in Spain. The unemployment rate shows a negative and statistically significant influence on political trust four quarters later.","[Caballero, Gonzalo] Univ Vigo, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Vigo, Spain; [Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos] European Commiss, DG Joint Res Ctr, Unit I1, Modelling Indicators & Impact Evaluat, Ispra, Italy",Universidade de Vigo; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Caballero, G (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Vigo, Spain.",gcaballero@uvigo.es; marcos.alvarez@ec.europa.au,"Caballero, Gonzalo/GZG-3828-2022; Alvarez-Diaz, Marcos/AGF-3176-2022","ALVAREZ-DIAZ, MARCOS/0000-0003-2372-1102","Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs [HAR2013-40760-R, ECO2014-52412-R]; Xunta de Galicia [GRC2014/022, ECOBAS AGRUP-2015/08]",Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs; Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),"Gonzalo Caballero acknowledges the financial support provided by the projects of the Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs (HAR2013-40760-R, ECO2014-52412-R) and Xunta de Galicia (GRC2014/022).

Attribute-specific polynomial trends showed the best fit among all models, which could possibly be explained by respondents' familiarity and sensitivity to different product attributes.

Using a real-effort work task and a piece-rate incentive scheme, we investigate the presence of the ratchet effect using two different methods for evaluating worker productivity: (i) when productivity is evaluated individually, and (ii) when productivity is evaluated collectively among a group of workers. We find strong evidence that workers restrict output when productivity is evaluated individually. However, we find little evidence of output restriction when productivity is evaluated at the group level, which we attribute to the coordination problem and the free-riding incentive that emerge within the group. Although, output restriction re-emerges if workers are able to communicate. We also examine an important dynamic implication of the ratchet effect, and our results indicate that output restriction reduces future productivity through reduced learning-by-doing.

Though the effects of positive and negative reviews to consumers' purchase decisions have been analyzed, they were examined statically and separately. In reality, online review community allows everyone to express and receive opinions and individuals can reexamine their opinions after receiving messages from others. The goal of this paper is to study how potential customers form their opinions dynamically under the effects of both positive and negative reviews using a numerical simulation. The results show that consumers with different membership levels have different information sensitivities to online reviews. Consumers at low and medium membership levels are often persuaded by online reviews, regardless of their initial opinion about a product. On the other hand, online reviews have less effect on consumers at higher membership levels, who often make purchase decisions based on their initial impressions of a product.","[Chen, Jia; Peng, Yi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Kou, Gang] Southwest Univ Finance & Econ China, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Peng, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",pengyi@uestc.edu.cn,,,,,,,57,12,12,8,49,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Consistent with recent research on the effects of business network formation, this paper finds that participation in the Innovation Network increases labor productivity and total factor productivity by almost 7 and 13 percent respectively after four years. In addition, participants in the Innovation Network program are about 5 percentage points more likely to participate in other Danish innovation programs in the subsequent four years, explaining one mechanism by which the Innovation Network facilitates productivity growth. Generally, those firms with lower than (industry) median levels of full time equivalent employees realize the largest benefits from program participation.

Mobile money is a mobile-based service, which provides access to low-cost financial services for people excluded from the banking system. It is designed to overcome the difficulties related to entering the banking system and the unavailability of banking infrastructure. Drawing on macroeconomic comparative and case study analysis conducted by practitioner experts, this study takes a wide macroeconomic approach to the adoption of mobile money adoption in 2011 and 2014, based on the alternative strategy of cluster analysis. We exploit the new technology diffusion frameworks to evaluate dissimilarity among groups of countries with similar levels of adoption of mobile money. We investigate whether adoption of mobile money services are highest in countries where access to formal banking services is lowest. Our analytical results support the predictions in the technology diffusion literature and nuance the potential of mobile money as a tool to counter banking exclusion.","[Della Peruta, Maelle] Univ Cote Azur, GREDEG, CNRS, 250 Rue Albert Einstein,Batiment 2, F-06560 Vabonne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Della Peruta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, GREDEG, CNRS, 250 Rue Albert Einstein,Batiment 2, F-06560 Vabonne, France.",maelle.della-peruta@unice.fr,,,,,,,78,41,42,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

(2007), Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009), and Hausmann and Hidalgo (2011) propose an outcome-based product space in which development traps can emerge due to low connectivity between products and countries' lack of productive capabilities. A recent stream of research suggests that this product space can be used as an instrument to guide public policy. To assess the potential effects of these policies on an economy's export performance, and on the ones of its competitors, we build a micro-founded simulation model of the evolution of countries' positions on the product space. We find that export subsidies and polices aiming at improving firm's innovation capabilities can be effective tools for increasing a country' export performance; however, this increase occurs at the expense of competing countries, as they support unpredictable changes in the variety of their exports.

Evidence from China,JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Aging; income inequality; demographic change,GROWTH,"Change in the population age structure affects the income inequality of an economy because income inequality often differs in different age groups. This paper proposes a theoretical framework to investigate the condition under which income inequality increases with demographic change and then proves that this condition is satisfied in China based on theory and empirical evidence. Accordingly, a hypothesis was developed, postulating that aging intensifies income inequality. We adopted the Gini coefficient as the measure of income inequality in an empirical study to test the hypothesis by using provincial panel data of China from 1996 to 2011. We determined that aging (represented by an increase in the elderly dependency ratio and decrease in the children's dependency ratio) increases income inequality significantly in current China. This finding suggests that the effect of aging on inequality be considered because it may have different policy implications.","[Dong, Zhiqiang] South China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tang, Canqing] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Dong, Zhiqiang; Tang, Canqing] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Wei, Xiahai] Huaqiao Univ, Inst Econ Dev & Reform, Xiamen, Peoples R China",South China Normal University; Guangdong University of Finance & Economics; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Huaqiao University,"Tang, CQ (通讯作者)，Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Tang, CQ (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",ctang11@utk.edu,"Dong, Zhiqiang/AAA-1737-2021","Dong, Zhiqiang/0000-0002-7692-5128",,,,,25,21,21,6,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Hence, there is a trade-off between stabilization and synchronization of national business cycles.","[Farvaque, Etienne; Huart, Florence] Univ Lille, LEM, CNRS, UMR 9221, Lille, France; [Farvaque, Etienne] Cirano, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lille; Universite de Montreal,"Huart, F (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, LEM, CNRS, UMR 9221, Lille, France.",florence.huart@univ-lille1.fr,"Huart, Florence/AGJ-6819-2022; farvaque, etienne/AAX-8898-2021","Huart, Florence/0000-0002-1491-3973;",,,,,40,1,1,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We compare computed markups and concentration with early estimates in South Africa and with other international benchmark countries. We then examine the market structure based on the concentration, firms size and entry and exit dynamics to rule out some potential explanations for relatively high markups.

Motivated by empirical evidence, in this economy the return on savings is a non-decreasing function of the amount saved. As expected, more patient households tend to become wealthier and more educated. The heterogeneity on portfolio returns is shown to be key to our main result: the model closely fits the data on income and wealth inequalities, being able to explain the existing Brazil's inequality patterns. The model was also calibrated to the US, with similar fit. We then evaluate two types of public policies based on cash transfer schemes (CTSs), that aim to reduce poverty and inequality.

However, because the nominally uninsured pay only a small share of their medical expenses, health insurance also provides substantial transfers to nonrecipient parties who would otherwise bear the costs of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured. The prevalence of uncompensated care helps explain the limited take-up of heavily subsidized public health insurance and the evidence that many recipients value formal health insurance at substantially less than the cost to insurers of providing that coverage. The distributional implications of public subsidies for health insurance depend critically on the ultimate economic incidence of the transfers that they deliver to providers of uncompensated care.","[Finkelstein, Amy] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mahoney, Neale] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Notowidigdo, Matthew J.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago; Northwestern University,"Finkelstein, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",afink@mit.edu,,,,,,,102,22,33,11,34,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Large, volatile price differences between locations can emerge when demand to ship exceeds capacity limits. This may have a significant impact on production, investment, and policy in exporting regions. Here, we assume the price difference between two locations follows a stationary process implying crude oil markets are integrated as oil prices in different locations move together. The investment decision is formulated as a linear complementarity problem that is solved numerically using a fully implicit finite difference method. Results show the value of an oil sands project and the incentive to invest in a new project will increase when the mean price difference decreases. Surprisingly, the standard deviation of the price difference has very little impact on project value or the incentive to invest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Many statistical methods were used to measure price deviations, nonetheless, they were insufficient to identify the economic collapse in 2008. As sustainable growth in the real estate sector has become a major priority, some alternative measures to analyse market deviations should be developed. Most recent studies showed that home prices in San Francisco, New York, Vancouver and other cities are soaring up to new unprecedented historic heights. The issue on whether this price growth is another bubble risk factor remains debatable since more scientific evidence needs to be presented. Therefore, this paper develops a new bubble index which provides additional insights in the current market situation from a broader perspective. The empirical research, which was conducted on four different metropolitan areas worldwide, which demonstrated an outstanding home price growth over the period 2008 to 2016. By applying factor and z-score analysis to seven different sub-indexes and aggregating them all into one, this paper developed the methodological framework that allowed to assess whether there is an under/over value situation in the real estate market. The research results have confirmed that 4 metropolitan areas (San Francisco, Vancouver, London and Sydney) are indeed in the bubble risk zones, which can lead to a market correction or even a new recession. The research suggests that although it is difficult to compare model accuracies, employment of factor analysis and z-score methods provides strong predictability capacity since it perfectly mimics the prior economic crisis and leads to the results somewhat similar to those obtained by employing the UBS bubble index.","[Grybauskas, Andrius; Pilinkiene, Vaida] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Grybauskas, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",andrius.grybauskas@ktu.edu; vaida.pilinkiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Argentina is an interesting case to explore given its high smoking rates, its recent experience with periods of very high and hyperinflation, and the mixed evidence of the effect of prices on smoking onset, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. We used data from four cycles of two large national surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011 and discrete-time hazard models. We found that tobacco prices had a statistically significant and fairly large impact on the hazard of smoking onset, and these findings were robust to alternative specifications. We also found that prices had little effect on the hazards of smoking onset during periods of hyper- and very high inflation, which provide some support for the notion that prices lose their informational role in such periods. Governments need to be cognizant that their most important policy tool to reduce tobacco use-taxes that increase real tobacco prices-is likely no longer effective during these times.","[Guindon, G.

In order to achieve this objective, 25 project success factors were identified by reviewing related literature. The factors were assessed for their impact and contribution to the actual performance of the project on three criteria: schedule, cost, and quality. Then a questionnaire was developed and sent to different experts in the construction industry. The collected data of 111 responses was then analysed statistically by using different tools such as: importance index, Spearman's rank correlation factor and T-test. As a result, company's technical capacity and scope and work definition were ranked the most important factors.

The distribution of investment efficiency index (IEI) of all 18 firms demonstrates a loss of around 40% of the rate of investment due to financing constraints.

Due to the ongoing low-yield environment and competitive pressure from new players, in particular technology-focused start-ups entering the markets, insurers are changing their business models and looking for new investment and business opportunities to improve their profitability and overall solvency positions. This is also reflected in increasing interest in mergers and acquisitions to achieve sufficient returns. However, there is no clear answer in the literature as to whether this strategy brings the anticipated positive results. This study empirically tests the effects of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on the share prices of European insurers via an event study.

Second, we introduce the results of our existing research and propose a catalogue of measures supporting transparent lobbying. Third, we identify sub-indicators in the five introduced indices of democratic quality related to transparent lobbying and assign a value to each individual indicator in the indices to determine whether measures of transparent lobbying have relevance with respect to these indicators.

We let these firms first bargain with labour union over their employees' wages and then compete either in the quantity space (Cournot competition) or in the price space (Bertrand competition). Our model shows that taking care of the consumers' interests when determining product market strategies may reverse the traditional ranking between Cournot and Bertrand equilibria. This implies that if shareholders in a CO firm can choose either a quantity or a price strategy, they will surprisingly choose the latter. Moreover, we show that the conflicting interests between main stakeholders are attenuated under Bertrand competition compared to Cournot competition.","[Le Pape, Nicolas; Wang, Yongying] Univ Caen Normandie, CNRS, CREM UMR 62117, Caen, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Caen Normandie,"Le Pape, N (通讯作者)，Univ Caen Normandie, CNRS, CREM UMR 62117, Caen, France.",nicolas.lepape@unicaen.fr,,"WANG, Yongying/0000-0001-5472-7270",,,,,40,4,4,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Our model generates three predictions that we confirm using a novel database of consistent-boundary neighbourhoods in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1880-2010, and spatial data for natural features such as coastlines and hills. First, persistent natural amenities anchor neighbourhoods to high incomes over time. Secondly, naturally heterogeneous cities exhibit persistent spatial distributions of income. Thirdly, downtown neighbourhoods in coastal cities were less susceptible to the widespread decentralization of income in the mid-twentieth century and experienced an increase in income more quickly after 1980.","[Lee, Sanghoon] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Lin, Jeffrey] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Res Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA",University of British Columbia; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Lin, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Res Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",jeff.lin@phil.frb.org,,"Lin, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0937-9606",,,,,58,62,77,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Over the period 1999-2013, we do find evidence of such long-run relations when accounting for a structural break in 2008. While money and credit follow similar long run trends, the short and medium term relation between money and credit overhang is weak, throwing doubt on the hypothesis that money creating potential drives credit booms. Especially in current account deficit countries, we observe a sizable build-up of credit overhang prior to 2008. Positive (negative) credit overhang is strongly related to net foreign borrowing (lending).","[Liu, Jingyang; Kool, Clemens J. M.] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Kool, Clemens J.

In result, all education tracks were extended by one year. Using the regression discontinuity design and data from the Polish LFS (2001-2005), we find that the reform had no impact on men's and women's hourly earnings.

Although there is now some acknowledgment that the search for yield was the major driver of ABS and CDO growth in the United States, the same is not true of the U.S. ABCP market where other factors such as regulatory arbitrage on the part of banks or the safety and liquidity concerns of institutional investors are seen as having been the more important growth driving force. This article argues that the search for yield did play a crucial role in U.S. ABCP growth between 2004 and 2007. To back up this argument, the article points to four variables that were closely correlated with this growth: the federal funds rate; U.S. money market mutual funds asset holdings; the change in the geographical breakdown of the institutions supplying ABCP; and, finally, the change in the program breakdown of the ABCP market.","[Lysandrou, Photis] City Univ London, City Univ Polit Econ Res Ctr CITYPERC, London, England",City University London,,m.shabani@uel.ac.uk,,"Shabani, Mimoza/0000-0002-1601-8032",,,,,13,1,1,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

China provides the scheduled disclosure system for annual report, which is seldom found in any other countries. The difference between actual filing date and scheduled date as timeliness proxy can better depict how annual report is delayed by sudden events such as restatements. Using manually collected data of accounting restatements from 2004 to 2014, we study the association between Chinese accounting restatement and the timeliness of annual report. The results indicate that with an accounting restatement, a company takes longer to file annual reports than scheduled, suggesting a negative association between Chinese accounting restatements and timeliness of annual reports. We also find that this result is not altered whether CEO/chairman or auditor is the same between misstatement period and restatement period. The results are robust when other timeliness measures are used. When further examining the association between various restatement characteristics and timeliness of annual reports, we find an overall negative association between restatement severity and the timeliness of annual reports.

First, firms become too optimistic after their business has improved, consistent with the over-extrapolation of their experience. Second, firms extrapolate improvements in their business more than deteriorations. Third, firms are more optimistic (pessimistic) than usual during business cycle peaks (troughs), suggesting that they do not anticipate reversals. Fourth, the German reunification provided a positive exogenous shock to the business of West German products. The industries most positively affected by the shock initially over-extrapolated the past downward trend just as much as the less affected industries, and thus failed to anticipate the reversal. Fifth, more overoptimistic firms subsequently report larger inventories and lower profits, suggesting that expectation errors entail (opportunity) costs. Sixth, older and larger firms show a smaller extrapolation bias, indicating that time and resources can alleviate the extrapolation bias. Seventh, firms that expect their business to improve tend to also expect their prices to increase, suggesting that firms mostly try to forecast demand shocks as opposed to supply shocks. Overall, these observations suggest that firms have a limited ability to anticipate changes in their activity and extrapolate their experience too much. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a data set of consistently measured top marginal tax rates for a panel of 18 OECD countries over the period 1965-2009, this article finds evidence in favour of a quadratic top tax-growth relationship. This represents the first reported evidence of a nonmonotonic significant relationship between top marginal income tax rates and economic growth. The point estimates of the regressions suggest that the marginal effect of higher top tax rates becomes negative above a growth-maximizing tax rate in the order of 60%. As top marginal tax rates observed after 1980 are below the estimated growth-maximizing level in most of the countries considered, a positive linear relationship between top marginal tax rates and GDP growth is found over the sub-period 1980-2009. Overall, results show that raising top marginal tax rates which are below their growth maximizing has the largest positive impact on growth when the related additional revenues are used to finance productive public expenditure, reduce budget deficits or reduce some other form of distortionary taxation.","[Milasi, Santo] Int Labor Org, Res Dept, Geneva 22, Switzerland; [Waldmann, Robert J.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Law & Inst, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Milasi, S (通讯作者)，4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",milasi@ilo.org,,,,,,,33,10,10,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Standard IV methods produce estimates of causal effects that are specific to individuals whose behavior can be manipulated by the instrument at hand. In many cases, these individuals are not the same as those who would be induced to treatment by an intervention or policy of interest to the researcher. The average causal effect for the two groups can differ significantly if the effect of the treatment varies systematically with unobserved factors that are correlated with treatment choice. We review the implications of this type of unobserved heterogeneity for the interpretation of standard IV methods and for their relevance to policy evaluation. We argue that making inferences about policy-relevant parameters typically requires extrapolating from the individuals affected by the instrument to the individuals who would be induced to treatment by the policy under consideration. We discuss a variety of alternatives to standard IV methods that can be used to rigorously perform this extrapolation. We show that many of these approaches can be nested as special cases of a general framework that embraces the possibility of partial identification.","[Mogstad, Magne; Torgovitsky, Alexander] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mogstad, Magne] Stat Norway, N-0177 Oslo, Norway; [Mogstad, Magne] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; Statistics Norway; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, N-0177 Oslo, Norway.;Mogstad, M (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com,,,,,,,104,27,31,3,14,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

The undercapitalization, which was perceived as a barrier to a higher performance of former transition economies was mainly present in the sectors, which have already been traditionally represented in the former socialist economies. It was not such a problem for sectors which newly formed only in the post-socialist period. Although the Slovak economy lagged in the capital intensity behind the most advanced economies, the position of the Slovak Republic was relatively favorable in the group of Central and Eastern Europe. However, in the process of undercapitalization overcome, the Slovak Republic did not experience similar structure of fixed capital formation as it is in the most advanced economies.

Second, we estimate an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model where we include our indicator of volatility among the main determinants of real GDP. Our findings imply that real GDP can be explained by three main variables: parallel market exchange rate, money supply, and oil exports. The long-run equilibrium reveals that parallel market exchange rate volatility has a negative impact on real GDP compared to the positive impact of money supply and oil exports. In contrast, the short-run impact of parallel market exchange rate volatility on real GDP growth is positive and very small counter to the long-run impact. Furthermore, the coefficient of the error correction term of the estimated ARDL model indicates that real GDP deviation from the equilibrium level will be corrected by about 10% after each quarter.","[Mrabet, Zouhair; Alsamara, Mouyad] Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Doha, Qatar",Qatar University,"Alsamara, M (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Doha, Qatar.",mouyadsamara@gmail.com,"AL SAMARA, Mouyad/M-9499-2019","AL SAMARA, Mouyad/0000-0002-3753-1361",,,,,27,5,5,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We argued that the intermediary framework is not an appropriate description of what financial institutions do. Instead, we proposed to broaden the endogenous money theory by incorporating non-bank financial institutions into it using the hierarchy of money. Our article generated a response by Bouguelli in which they argue that the traditional post Keynesian framework, with its clear-cut distinction between banks and NBFIs is better suited for understanding the different roles of these institutions and their symbiotic relationship. In this rejoinder, we respond to the critique of Bouguelli and clarify our position. We demonstrate that banks and nonbanks are similar in how they issue liabilities to finance positions in assets and settle on a netted basis using the liabilities of another entity higher up in the hierarchy. Moreover, we argue that NBFIs' reliance on banks is better captured by the framework of leveraging rather than that of intermediation.","[Nersisyan, Yeva] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Econ, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Dantas, Flavia] SUNY Coll Cortland, Cortland, NY USA",Franklin & Marshall College; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Cortland,"Nersisyan, Y (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Econ, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",,,"Nersisyan, Yeva/0000-0002-2034-843X",,,,,7,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

After controlling for factors shown to impact demand, this study applies spatial econometric methods via a spatial weights matrix to a panel municipal water consumption data set. While diagnostics suggest the presence of spatial lag and spatial error, thus indicating the potential usefulness of spatial empirical methods, several important pitfalls must be acknowledged. First, the application of spatial weights in a panel setting is computationally intensive, especially when the number of time periods or observations is large, and perhaps necessitates aggregation. Second, because most users in a municipality are likely to be subject to similar utility action, climate, etc., a spatial lag signal may be spurious. Third, because premises served by the utility may enter or exit the data set through time, the requirement of balanced panels requires careful consideration. Fourth, if the option to use premises-level (or similar) data or aggregated data is available, it is typically advisable to use premises-level data despite the possible presence of spatial effects.","[O'Donnell, Michael] Univ New Mexico, Bur Business & Econ Res, 400 Cornell Dr NE,Suite B37, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA; [O'Donnell, Michael; Berrens, Robert P.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 400 Cornell Dr NE,Suite B37, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA",University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico,"O'Donnell, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Bur Business & Econ Res, 400 Cornell Dr NE,Suite B37, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA.;O'Donnell, M (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 400 Cornell Dr NE,Suite B37, Albuquerque, NM 87106 USA.",mo8684@unm.edu,,"O'Donnell, Michael/0000-0002-4146-8668",,,,,13,2,3,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Labour supply behaviour of Thai women is investigated with synthetic cohort data defined by age, year of birth, and level of educational attainment, constructed from annual labour force surveys from 1985 to 2004. According to pseudo-panel estimates, wage increases lead to a reduction in hours worked, but also an increase in the employment/population ratio, with elasticity estimates that are robust across a variety of specifications. Estimates based on disaggregation by marital status show that marriage provides protection against wage decreases, allowing married women greater choice between hours of work and other household activities. Alternative disaggregations find that younger cohorts of women and those with the highest education show the greatest (positive) response of the employment rate to wage changes, leading to a future Thai labour force with more women and higher educational attainment.","[Paweenawat, Sasiwimon Warunsiri] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [McNown, Robert] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Inst Behav Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [McNown, Robert] Univ Colorado, Program Int Affairs, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University Thai Chamber Commerce; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"McNown, R (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",mcnownr@colorado.edu,"Paweenawat, Sasiwimon/AAE-3200-2022","Paweenawat, Sasiwimon/0000-0003-2636-0584",,,,,38,12,13,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This suggests that public objections to the VSL may not be caused by the specific description used nor can be ameliorated by refinement.

A particular focus is on the importance placed by the Cambridge approach on processes of social positioning and in exploring what this involves. The paper highlights that it is this general socio philosophical ontology that provides the basis for the critique of the dominant methods of modern economics since these presuppose an implicit ontology quite inconsistent with both it and indeed any realistic conception. This implicit ontology is also shown to constrain the way economic objects are characterized within mainstream economics. Finally the paper provides an illustration of how powerful accounts of specific social existents can be developed that are consistent with the broader social ontological conception that the Cambridge group defend by sketching one account of the firm and the modern corporation recently forwarded that draws systematically upon the notion of social positioning.","[Pratten, Stephen] Kings Coll London, Kings Business Sch, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Pratten, S (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Kings Business Sch, London, England.",stephen.pratten@kcl.ac.uk,,"Pratten, Stephen Bernard/0000-0001-6027-7528",,,,,21,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2520-1794,2520-1808,978-3-319-94529-3; 978-3-319-94528-6,VIRTUES ECON,Virtues Econ.,,2018,3.0,,,,,,35,49,,10.1007/978-3-319-94529-3_3,0.0,,,15,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL9EL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457322400003,0

Through a second stage analysis, the Simar and Wilson (2007) bootstrapped truncated regression analyzed contextual variables associated with inefficiency, and consequently with firm insolvency. The sample was composed of electricity distributors, whose financial information for the 2000-2015 period was available on the Brazilian Securities Exchange (CVM) website. The results indicated that the Actual Equivalent Frequency of Power Interruptions/Regulatory Equivalent Frequency of Power Interruptions and Overall Indebtedness were the most important indicators in explaining insolvency. The second-stage analysis showed that the inefficiencies calculated using the selected indicators are positively related to insolvency criteria used by the literature, state control, dollar and geographical location, and negatively related to the domestic inflation index.

By analysing the sources and the use of funds of India's corporate sector in further detail, this paper highlights a similar phenomenon of financialisation in the Indian economy which, ceteris paribus, adversely affected real investments during the 2000s along with a process of Ponzi financing during the post-crisis period.","[Sen, Sunanda; Dasgupta, Zico] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Sen, S (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, New Delhi, India.",,,,,,,,17,15,16,3,21,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

To foster the adoption of the new rules the government introduced also a generous subsidy for firms hiring workers with an open-ended contract. Using microdata on hiring and firing for one Italian region, Veneto, we exploit some differences in the design of the two policies to separately identify the effects of new firing costs on firm hiring. We find that around 8% of gross permanent hires occurred because of the reduction of firing costs (in addition to the positive and large effect of the hiring subsidies). The reform of firing costs contributed also to increase the monthly rate of conversion of fixed-term jobs into permanent positions. As suggested by the theory, we also find that the new firing rules made firms slightly less reluctant to offer permanent job positions to yet untested workers.","[Sestito, Paolo; Viviano, Eliana] Bank Italy, DG Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Sestito, P (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, DG Econ Stat & Res, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,14,19,19,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

I find a ceremonial-instrumental dichotomy in terms of the forces that enter the different phases of institutional change and the receptivity of the markets. Since the mid-twentieth century, the world leisure industries have rapidly advanced because they are not only interactively promoted by an increasing number of mass leisure institutions, but also due to technological advancements and industrial innovations. Indeed, the development paths of these industries in different countries are influenced by institutional factors, such as public interests, culture, and education, and their interactions and changes over time. Given that the paths may not be so straightforward, my findings show that Bush's related works provide a synthetic framework which deserves further examination in the economics of leisure.","[Siu, Ricardo C.

To do so, we incorporate asymmetry into the coefficients of a normalised beta weighting function within an Asymmetric Mixed Data Sampling (AMIDAS) framework. This enables us to examine both the timing, and the lagged marginal effects, of a change in retail petrol prices in response to a change in the oil price. We find evidence of asymmetries in both the timing, and magnitude, of retail petrol prices to a change in the oil price. Specifically, we find that while price falls are slowly and symmetrically passed onto consumers, price increases are more delayed, but higher in intensity over time. Depending on the capital city, when retailers eventually do increase petrol prices, in response to an oil price rise with delay, the price rise is between 2.1 and 3.4 times more than when retailers reduce petrol prices in response to a fall in the price of oil. This finding is consistent with retailers delaying substantial petrol price rises in order to mask the existence of uncompetitive practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Few researches investigate whether exporters can enhance export performance after M&A through higher levels of efficiency. Based on detailed information on M&A activities of Chinese firms, China's customs trade data and National Bureau of Statistics surveys, we investigate the causal effect of M&A on trade performance. In particular, the value and the volume of firm exports, product quality, product scope and the number of export destinations have been examined. We find positive and significant effects of M&A on all the examined indicators of export performance. These findings are generally robust to a variety of robustness checks. We further observe that state-owned firms are the least likely to benefit from M&A. We also obtain evidence that firms benefit more from M&A deals if they are targets or merge with foreign firms. Overall, this paper is to our knowledge the first study that uses micro-level data in multiple industries to examine the relationship between M&A and exports of heterogeneous firms. Our results deepen our understanding of the consequences of M&A by suggesting another potential benefit, and hence provide policy implications for merger regulation.","[Yan, Jing] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yan, J (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yan.jing@cufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,44,2,4,6,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We suggest that lines developed in this way can also be applied for the purpose of identifying the middle class (or secure). We illustrate that such vulnerability lines can be straightforwardly estimated with panel data, drawing on data from the USA and Vietnam. Importantly, given the relative scarcity of panel datasets, we show further that our method can be applied to synthetic panel datasets. We demonstrate this by means of an illustration using repeated cross-section data from India. Our results indicate that in Vietnam and India during the 2000s, the population shares that can be designated as poor and as secure have, respectively, been falling and expanding, with the vulnerable share of the population remaining fairly stable.

Subjects in our experiment first play a repeated Trust Game to create social histories in the laboratory, before engaging in a Common Resource Game, to measure deviant behavior. The results suggest that social history is an important determinant. Those who experienced deterioration in the evolution of play were more likely to extract large amounts from the common resource. We also document that anticipated social norms in the Trust Game explain extraction in the Common Resource Game, independently from the observed outcomes and the anticipated norms of deviance. This suggests an under-adjustment in behavior to changes in norms. The findings do not support a stable preference for deviant behavior. Thus, our results suggest policy, intended to counteract social history and influence social norms, may be more effective than sanctions in combating deviant behavior. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a simple model to explore whether and how the VAT pilot expansion affects corporate total tax burden. We find that it will reduce corporate total tax burden of small-scale taxpayers, while for general taxpayers, total tax burden change is uncertain. Using unique company-level half-yearly panel data and general setting for DID analysis for multiple groups and multiple periods, we find that the average treatment effects of the VAT pilot expansion on corporate total tax burden of general taxpayers are insignificant in the pooled sample. Furthermore, the VAT program shows no heterogeneity between the transportation and modern services industries. However, we find that the pilot effect varies by deductible items. In particular, the reduction tax effect is stronger in companies with higher intermediate input rates, and the largest effect is 60.4%. These results are consistent with our conceptual framework.

We run Granger-causality tests separately for risky and non-risky products advertising, finding that the behavioral model of advertising is supported when the ads of risky financial products and services are considered, while the rational model is true for the non-risky products ads. We ascribe this result to the dual process of reasoning operating at the level of the investor: when an investor evaluates the decision to buy risky financial products and services, he/ she activates the automatic, rapid decision making process. Advertising companies anticipate this trait and implement an advertising strategy that responds to market trends, confirming the use of a behavioral model. Consistently we find that the stock index Granger-causes risky financial products ads. When non-risky financial products ads are considered, a slow and sequential process, operates, compatibly with a rational decision making process: advertising companies are aware of this and implement a strategy unrelated to the stock index. Coherently, no significant relationship is found between the stock index and non-risky financial products and services ads. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Until recently, there had been very little quantitative testing of the microeconomic impact of the wide variety of New Deal programs. Over the past decade scholars have developed new panel databases for counties, cities, and states and then used panel data methods on them to examine the impact of New Deal spending and lending policies for the major New Deal programs. In most cases, the identification of the effect comes from changes across time within the same geographic location after controlling for national shocks to the economy. Many of the studies also use instrumental variable methods to control for endogeneity. The studies find that public works and relief spending had state income multipliers of around one, increased consumption activity, attracted internal migration, reduced crime rates, and lowered several types of mortality. The farm programs typically aided large farm owners but eliminated opportunities for share croppers, tenants, and farm workers. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation's purchases and refinancing of troubled mortgages staved off drops in housing prices and home ownership rates at relatively low ex post cost to taxpayers. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation's loans to banks and railroads appear to have had little positive impact, although the banks were aided when the RFC took ownership stakes.","[Fishback, Price] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Fishback, P (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-135744, SES-1061927, SES-0921732, SES 0617972, SES 0214483, SES-0080324, SBR-9708098]; Earhart Foundation; Koch Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Earhart Foundation; Koch Foundation,"University of Arizona.

As Swiss cantons enjoy considerable autonomy with respect to income taxation, it is possible to study the impact of the cantonal income tax burden, as well as the influence of tax competition, on cantonal top income shares. Using panel regressions covering all Swiss cantons from 1917 to 2009 we find the expected negative effect of the tax burden on the cantonal top income share. Further, we find evidence that tax competition is a driving force behind the income shares of the top 1, 0.5 and 0.1 percent. Lower tax rates in neighbor cantons induce competitive pressure and ceteris paribus reduce top income shares in a canton. For the very top incomes tax competition seems to be an issue of the last 30 years.","[Frey, Christian; Gorgas, Christoph; Schaltegger, Christoph A.] Univ Lucerne, Luzern, Switzerland",University of Lucerne,"Frey, C (通讯作者)，MA UZH Univ Lucerne, Dept Econ, Frohburgstr 3,Room 3-A23, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",christian.frey@unilu.cha,,,,,,,47,3,4,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Since 1990, several Swiss states (cantons) have been switching from a graduated to a flat tax rate scheme on profits. The paper assesses the effects of such a reform both on the number of establishments (i.e. extensive margin of investment) and on the number of employees (i.e. intensive margin) in a given jurisdiction by computing a difference-in-differences estimation. Our results suggest that the introduction of a flat tax reform on corporate income taxes has a negative and statistically significant impact on both margins of investment. Moreover, the effect is considerably larger for riskier firms, suggesting that progressive taxation acts as an insurance effect for risk-averse entrepreneurs.","[Galletta, Sergio] Univ Lugano, Inst Econ IdEP, Via G Buffi 6, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland; [Redonda, Agustin] Council Econ Policies CEP, Seefeldst 60, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland; [Galletta, Sergio] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Inst Econ IEB, C John Maynard Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Barcelona,"Redonda, A (通讯作者)，Council Econ Policies CEP, Seefeldst 60, CH-8008 Zurich, Switzerland.",sergio.galletta@usi.ch; ar@cepweb.org,,"Redonda, Agustin/0000-0002-2938-1711; Galletta, Sergio/0000-0002-2254-9147","Sinergia Project [130648, 147668, 15860, 167635]",Sinergia Project,"We are grateful to Johannes Abeler, Marius Brulhart, Sascha O.

At the same time, Chinese developers built 100 billion square feet of residential real estate. This boom has been accompanied by a large increase in the number of vacant homes, held by both developers and households. This boom may turn out to be a housing bubble followed by a crash, yet that future is far from certain. The demand for real estate in China is so strong that current prices might be sustainable, especially given the sparse alternative investments for Chinese households, so long as the level of new supply is radically curtailed. Whether that happens depends on the policies of the Chinese government, which must weigh the benefits of price stability against the costs of restricting urban growth.","[Glaeser, Edward; Huang, Wei; Ma, Yueran; Shleifer, Andrei] Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Glaeser, E (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",eglaeser@harvard.edu; huangw@nber.org; yueranma@g.harvard.edu; ashleifer@harvard.edu,", Wei/R-7886-2016",", Wei/0000-0003-4454-1485",,,,,30,210,241,35,394,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

J,"Grüner, HP",,,,"Gruner, Hans Peter",,,Mechanisms for the control of fiscal deficits,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal policy rules; Constitutional choice; Mechanism design,DYNAMIC THEORY; BUDGET; COMMITMENT; POLICY; DEBT,"This paper shows that a simple two-stage voting mechanism may implement a constrained optimal state dependent decision about the size of the fiscal deficit. I consider a setup with strategic fiscal deficits similar to Alesina and Tabellini (1990). Three groups of voters are informed about the relative desirability of current public spending. Voters differ in their preferences for public goods and swing voters' preferences may change over time. The current government decides on the current spending mix and it has an incentive to strategically overspend. A simple two-stage mechanism under which a deficit requires the approval by a supermajority in parliament approximates a constrained optimal decision and under certain conditions increases social welfare relative to both a strict rule and a laissez faire constitution. When the current majority is small, political bargaining may further increase social welfare. However, when the current majority is large, a supermajority mechanism with bargaining leads to a biased spending mix and it may reduce welfare whereas the laissez faire mechanism may yield the first best. An appropriately adjusted majority threshold can avoid inefficient bargaining whenever necessary. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this paper is to provide new micro-data-based evidence on the structural pattern of return migration. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and employ a flexible semiparametric model, which allows us to estimate bivariate interaction effects. This enables us to analyze variation in emigration behavior over the life cycle. For the majority of migrants, we find that return migration is highly likely during the transition into retirement, implying that migrants spend their savings and pensions in their home country. For labor migrants, return migration intensifies the skill selection of the original immigration flow. Furthermore, we find a strong influence of family characteristics on return migration. Our analysis demonstrates that outmigration is influenced by economic and non-economic factors and highlights that migrants incorporate the mobility costs of family members into their individual return decisions.","[Kuhlenkasper, Torben] Pforzheim Univ, Pforzheim, Germany; [Kuhlenkasper, Torben; Steinhardt, Max Friedrich] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Hamburg, Germany; [Steinhardt, Max Friedrich] HWWI, Hamburg, Germany; [Steinhardt, Max Friedrich] CELSI, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Steinhardt, Max Friedrich] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Steinhardt, Max Friedrich] LdA, Foggia, Italy",Helmut Schmidt University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Steinhardt, MF (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85, D-22043 Hamburg, Germany.",steinhardt@hsu-hh.de,"Steinhardt, Max Friedrich/ACK-1489-2022","Steinhardt, Max Friedrich/0000-0001-7994-4060",,,,,29,10,11,0,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

When firms are mobile across states, the federal dividend income tax rate affects both the intensity of competition among the states and the equilibrium level of state takeover regulations. Our model shows that increasing dividend tax rate weakens the competition for corporate charters under a condition: dividend-paying and the market for corporate control are complementary corporate governance mechanisms. This condition holds empirically, suggesting that dividend tax not only discourages firms from paying dividends but also weakens their corporate governance by disincentivizing states to improve their corporate laws.

Schumpeter's Analysis of the Cleansing Effect,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH; COST,"Schumpeter has often been interpreted as a liquidationist, someone who is convinced that economic crises are necessary and unavoidable, and thus that government nonintervention is a sound policy in such crises. The first two sections of this paper discuss Schumpeter's views in greater detail and suggest that categorizing him as a liquidationist is an oversimplification and as an unrepentant noninterventionist is incorrect. Although Schumpeter was certainly not a strong supporter of public interventions, he did see a role for public expenditure programs in particular circumstances. During periods of recession, Schumpeter believed firmly in what he described as the recuperative powers of capitalism. However, when a depression becomes pathological, there could be a role for government to intervene. In order to understand the overall picture of Schumpeter's message, we will first try to explain Schumpeter's analysis of recessions, depressions, and the other stages of business cycles. We will also discuss how Schumpeter perceived the recuperative powers of capitalism, a core concept in Schumpeter's analysis that allows him to distinguish between physiological and pathological recessions. In the 1990s, an active line of research examined the possibility that recessions may have a productive character along with their more obvious negative outcomes, because recessions in some way might hasten the process of reallocating economic recourses from slower-growth to faster-growth sectors. Such models were sometimes referred to as neo-Schumpeterian, but given our analysis of Schumpeter's work, we will question whether this label is appropriate.","[Legrand, Muriel Dal Pont] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, Econ, Nice, France; [Legrand, Muriel Dal Pont] Gest GREDEG, Econ, Grp Rech Droit, Valbonne Sophia, Antipolis, France; [Hagemann, Harald] Univ Hohenheim, Econ Theory, Stuttgart, Germany",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Cote d'Azur; University Hohenheim,"Legrand, MDP (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, Econ, Nice, France.;Legrand, MDP (通讯作者)，Gest GREDEG, Econ, Grp Rech Droit, Valbonne Sophia, Antipolis, France.",muriel.dalpont@gredeg.cnrs.fr; harald.hagemann@uni-hohenheim.de,,,,,,,42,5,6,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Our analysis shows that in this environment the performance of mixed markets is always dominated by pure forms.

We develop a collective household model to derive testable hypotheses about whether women's intra-household influence, together with their relatively strong marginal preference for ICSs, affects adoption. Using a joint adoption-influence econometric model, we find compelling evidence that women's influence over intra-household decisions significantly increases adoption. We further distinguish between alternative sources of women's influence, and argue that our distinction has potential implications for ICS dissemination policies. We find that while there is significant variation in women's influence across rural India due to cultural and other sociological factors, the effect of intra-household influence on adoption has a significant bargaining power component.

With the surge in demand for portable and easy-to-hide (discreet) assets such as artworks and collectible stamps, prices boomed. This suggests that discreet assets may be viewed as crypto-currencies, demand for which varies depending on the environment and the need to hide value. Regarding art market valuation, this article argues that while some economic actors derive significant utility from conspicuous consumption, others value the discretion offered by artworks.

Based on in-depth interviews with the Central Banks as regulators, MFI managers, practitioners and apex microfinance associations, the study finds that regulations in both countries have managed to professionalize the sector, but their effectiveness in augmenting the centrality of social goals to microfinance and MFIs remains doubtful. The poorly designed regulations are not only undermining social goals but also sending wrong signals to would be social investors, with implications for the social image of the industry. The study further finds that regulations have neither speeded the emergence of sustainable MFIs (especially in Zambia) nor accelerated the sectors' outreach to the poor and the financially excluded. Additionally, considerable levels of political interference and poor regulation have led to unintended consequences to the sector, further frustrating the ultimate goal of extending financial services to the poor. These findings have policy and practical implications for how microfinance engages with the regulatory logic and continues to serve those at the bottom of the pyramid.","[Siwale, Juliana }] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England; [Okoye, Ngozi] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England",Nottingham Trent University; University of Lincoln,"Siwale, J (通讯作者)，Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England.;Okoye, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lincoln, Lincoln, England.",juliana.siwale@ntu.ac.uk; NOkoye@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Siwale, Juliana/0000-0002-6315-0896",,,,,71,23,26,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

In this comment, I argue that although Arrunada's problem is a genuine one, it is part of a larger inadequacy in the economic analysis of property rights: property institutions have to manage complexity stemming from many kinds of interactions, making it problematic to focus solely on local interactions. Modular structures in property, including legal things' themselves, serve to manage this complexity. The larger problem of complexity allows us to set sequential exchange in its proper context.","[Smith, Henry E.] Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Smith, HE (通讯作者)，Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",hesmith@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,22,4,4,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

J,"Dvoskin, A; Petri, F",,,,"Dvoskin, Ariel; Petri, Fabio",,,Again on the Relevance of Reverse Capital Deepening and Reswitching,METROECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INVESTMENT,"Among the recent interventions in the capital controversy, the debate between Paola Potestio and Kurz & Salvadori has raised important issues. We agree with Potestio's rejection of the legitimacy of a value endowment of capital but we disagree with her dismissal of the relevance of reswitching and reverse capital deepening: these phenomena are very important because they undermine the demand-side role of the conception of capital as a single factor. For the marginal approach to be plausible, this demand-side role had to imply the stability of the savings-investment market even in shorter time frames than those required by a complete adaptation of the form' of capital; this was taken by Marshall to authorize doing without a given endowment of value capital, which opened the door to the shift to the modern neo-Walrasian versions of the marginal approach. With proof from Hayek, Hicks, Malinvaud, and Lucas we argue that a continuing belief in traditional time-consuming marginalist disequilibrium adjustments based on capital-labour substitution is the hidden reason why the claim often made by contemporary marginalist economists, that the economy can be assumed to be all the time on the equilibrium-growth path, is not found patently unacceptable. The true microfoundation of DSGE macromodels is not intertemporal equilibrium theory, but the time-consuming adjustment mechanisms on whose basis the marginal approach was born and accepted, and on whose basis monetarism was then able to re-assert a pre-Keynesian view of the working of the economy.","[Dvoskin, Ariel] Univ Buenos Aires CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Petri, Fabio] Univ Siena, DEPS, Piazza S.

The resulting 2D non-invertible demand system exhibits a rich dynamics. We focus on two special cases: The baseline case of two independent consumers and a situation in which the autonomous individual 1 is viewed as a representative member of a group that serves as a normative reference group for individual 2. The consumption behavior of individual 2 is determined by his own past consumption experience as well as by the observable consumption behavior of individual 1, who is in turn not influenced by individual 2. The associated map belongs to the class of triangular maps. Our analysis focuses on the coexistence of attractors and the mechanisms underlying qualitative transformations of attractors. Relying on a mix of analytical, numerical, and graphical methodology, we demonstrate how various bifurcations occur as the importance of the individuals' own past consumption as well as the strength of influence of individual 1 on 2 varies.

A picture featuring a Star has been exogenously released. The Star privately knows whether the picture is embarrassing or neutral and can decide to censor it, with the aim of having it unseen. Receivers observe the Star's action and make efforts to see the picture, that depend on how embarrassing they expect it to be. Censorship reduces the Receivers' chances to see the picture but also serves as a motivating signal to search for it. When players are fully rational, we show that censorship cannot occur if the picture has little chances to be found when believed neutral. Next, we consider that players may not fully understand the signaling effect of censorship and study how it affects the equilibrium outcome. We model such partial sophistication of players using analogical reasoning a la Jehiel (2005). We explain that partially sophisticated Receivers are less responsive to the Star's action, which makes censorship more likely. We also show that a partially sophisticated Star can censor in equilibrium while it gives the picture higher chances to be found than without censorship. The Streisand effect is at play, in the sense that censorship creates interest which is unexpected by the Star. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we test whether both financial and trade openness explain financial development and its variations across 44 developing economies. Questioning the functional specifications in previous studies, we propose a fully nonparametric modelling approach to validate the simultaneous openness hypothesis. Our findings from the parametric approach suggest that both openness dimensions positively impact financial development, providing a loose support for the simultaneous openness hypothesis. The results based on the nonparametric approach suggest a negative effect of closed economies (economies with relatively closed trade and capital accounts) on financial development, supporting the strong version of the simultaneous openness hypothesis. Correct model specification test results support the nonparametric model relative to the parametric model as appropriate for the sampled data. Our conclusion is therefore based on the nonparametric finding, which supports the simultaneous openness hypothesis for the selected developing countries.","[Karimu, Amin] Umea Univ, CERE, Dept Econ, Umea, Sweden; [Karimu, Amin] Univ Ghana, Business Sch, Dept Operat & Management Informat Syst, Accra, Ghana; [Karimu, Amin] Univ Ghana, Business Sch, Dept Finance, Accra, Ghana; [Marbuah, George] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Umea University; University of Ghana; University of Ghana; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Marbuah, G (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",nyoamink@gmail.com; george.marbuah@slu.se,"Marbuah, George/I-1975-2019; Karimu, Amin/JFK-6275-2023","Marbuah, George/0000-0003-4126-6270; Karimu, Amin/0000-0003-3931-8828",,,,,27,7,7,1,14,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

We shed light on the reasons why occupational segregation persists despite the increases in women's education and labor force participation, and why it results in a gender wage gap. Women express a stronger relative preference than men for occupations that are valuable to society, which we argue is captured by their occupational prestige. If women prefer occupations with higher occupational prestige, they will earn lower wages because of compensating wage differentials. Using conditional logit models of occupational choice, we find statistically significant support for this hypothesis. The effect is economically significant: the gender differences in the weights placed on prestige and wages can explain up to one half of the gender wage gap resulting from occupational segregation, or about one fourth of the overall gender wage gap. Our results are strongest for individuals with low ability, which suggests that social norms may be an important factor in generating these gender differences.","[Kleinjans, Kristin J.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Steven G Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Krassel, Karl Fritjof] VIVE, Kobmagergade 22, DK-1150 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Dukes, Anthony] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Mkt, Marshall Sch Business, 701 Exposit Blvd,HOH 331, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton; University of Southern California,"Kleinjans, KJ (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Steven G Mihaylo Coll Business & Econ, Econ, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",kkleinjans@fullerton.edu; kakr@kora.dk; dukes@marshall.usc.edu,"Dukes, Anthony/AAW-4545-2020; Kleinjans, Kristin/ABB-5054-2020","Kleinjans, Kristin/0000-0003-0255-8246; Dukes, Anthony/0000-0003-2699-8019",Milton A.

With a variety of copula functions and three risk-based dynamic measures, our results show that even though commodity futures are not helpful in improving the risk-adjusted returns of energy stocks, they can significantly reduce the volatilities and expected-shortfalls of the diversified portfolios. Such diversification benefits are much larger during large market downturns than during normal times. In particular, gold (copper) futures are the most (least) attractive in diversifying risks of energy stocks in most cases. The results also highlight that the non-linear dependence cannot be ignored when estimating the diversification benefits, and more various risk hedging strategies are expected for investors holding energy stocks, especially coal company stocks.","[Wen, Xiaoqian] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Financial Studies, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wen, Xiaoqian] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Collaborate Innovat Ctr Financial Secur, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Duc Khuong Nguyen] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, Paris, France; [Duc Khuong Nguyen] Indiana Univ, Sch Environm & Publ Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; IPAG Business School; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Wen, XQ (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Chinese Financial Studies, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Nguyen, DK (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG Lab, Paris, France.",wxqkou@sina.com; duc.nguyen@ipag.fr,"Nguyen, Duc Khuong/AAE-6889-2020","Nguyen, Duc Khuong/0000-0002-7796-8787",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71601157],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We greatly appreciate the careful work and constructive suggestions from the editor Professor Sushanta Mallick and the two anonymous reviewers, and are also grateful to seminar participants at 9th International Finance Conference for helpful comments.

Over 2001-11, the general improvement in technical efficiency of countries is almost outweighed by technological regress. Results indicate that differences in factor accumulation between OECD and emerging economies are more important than differences in TFP change to explain differences in economic growth. Results also indicate negative and significant random shocks for the OECD countries.","[Aguiar, Diana; Costa, Leonardo] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Porto, Portugal; [Costa, Leonardo] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CEGE, Porto, Portugal; [Silva, Elvira] CEF UP, Fac Econ Porto, Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade do Porto,"Silva, E (通讯作者)，CEF UP, Fac Econ Porto, Econ, Rua Doutor Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Porto, Portugal.",esilva@fep.up.pt,"Costa, Leonardo/JQI-1522-2023; Costa, Leonardo/AAL-3816-2021","Costa, Leonardo/0000-0001-8992-2519; Silva, Elvira/0000-0002-8189-4637",,,,,75,6,8,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Private firms can improve their chances of obtaining contracts by bribing politicians or public servants and funding political parties. In the same vein, firms can gain access to policymakers by hiring influential former politicians-a practice commonly referred to as revolving-doors. In this paper, we use information from 922 privatizations of water services in Spanish municipalities between 1984 and 2016 and multinomial logistic regression techniques to study the association between specific firms securing contracts and the political parties ruling the municipalities. We find robust statistical evidence of an association between the Popular Party (Partido Popular or PP) and the firm Aqualia, part of the large Spanish holding company Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC), which is known to have funded the Popular Party. Furthermore, former PP politicians have been appointed to top positions in the FCC Board of Directors. However, this relationship weakened after the institutional reform of 2007 on public procurement and financing of political parties, which is empirically evaluated in this paper.","[Albalate, Daniel; Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Albalate, Daniel; Bel, Germa] GiM IREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Gonzalez-Gomez, Francisco] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J.] Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain; [Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J.] INTECO Res Grp, Valencia, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Granada; University of Valencia,"Picazo-Tadeo, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Valencia, Spain.;Picazo-Tadeo, AJ (通讯作者)，INTECO Res Grp, Valencia, Spain.",albalate@ub.edu; gbel@ub.edu; fcojose@ugr.es; andres.j.picazo@uv.es,"Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008; González-Gómez, Francisco/F-3868-2010; Albalate, Daniel/N-8124-2019; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/C-2545-2011","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; González-Gómez, Francisco/0000-0002-9800-4944; Albalate, Daniel/0000-0002-4940-4589; Picazo-Tadeo, Andres J/0000-0002-7129-5606","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76866-R, ECO2016-75237-R]; Catalan government [SGR2014-325]; Valencian government [PROMETEOII/2014/053]; Andalusian government [P11-SEJ-7039]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Catalan government; Valencian government; Andalusian government,"We acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2016-76866-R and ECO2016-75237-R), the Catalan government (SGR2014-325), the Valencian government (PROMETEOII/2014/053), and the Andalusian government (P11-SEJ-7039).

Fueling the economic debate, various empirical assessments suggest that up to half of all jobs in western industrialized countries are at risk of automation in the next 10 to 20 years. This paper demonstrates that these scenarios are overestimating the share of automatable jobs by neglecting the substantial heterogeneity of tasks within occupations as well as the adaptability of jobs in the digital transformation. To demonstrate this, we use detailed task data and show that, when taking into accounting the spectrum of tasks within occupations, the automation risk of US jobs drops, ceteris paribus, from 38% to 9%.

Since empirical findings remain largely inconclusive, this study adds to this debate with counterfactual evidence from a laboratory experiment. In a creative real effort task simulating the innovation process, two distinct means of allocating subsidies are compared to a benchmark treatment without subsidies to identify their effects in fostering innovativeness. Furthermore, subjects' cooperative behavior in relation to subsidies is investigated. Overall, subsidies lead to a substantial crowding-out of private investment. While the individual revenues increase due to the subsidy, the innovative activity fails to increase and less sophisticated innovations are realized. Consequently, subsidies have no or negative effects on overall welfare, depending on the subsidy specifics. However, subsidies do not influence cooperative behavior. These findings imply that the additional costs of subsidies for innovations might not be warranted by gains from additional innovations and increased welfare.","[Brueggemann, Julia; Proeger, Till] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Brüggemann, J (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Fac Econ Sci, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jbruegg@gwdg.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; Hans-Bockler-Stiftung,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Hans-Bockler-Stiftung,"We are grateful to Lukas Meub and Kilian Bizer for their very helpful comments on this work, as well as Sven Orzel for his assistance in programming and running the experiments.

In this study, we conduct a field experiment in an apartment complex in India to test how information about electricity usage impacts the electricity consumption of urban middle class households. Our results, based on fifteen-minute electricity readings over an academic year, show that non-monetary messages that framed electricity consumption in terms of environmental and health impacts were more effective than messages emphasizing the monetary savings of reducing electricity consumption. Households in the environmental/health group accessed the online energy-monitoring dashboard more frequently and reduced their electricity usage by 18.4% relative to the control group. Households in the monetary group did not significantly alter their usage. These results about revealed preferences are contrasted with stated preferences disclosed in a survey of urban Indians who describe money, not health, as the main motivation for energy conservation.

Testing the prediction of Harris and Holmstrom (1982),LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Risk premium; Starting wages; Unknown productivity; Wage rigidity,FIRM,"In the model of Harris and Holmstrom (1982) labour market entrants pay an insurance premium to prevent wage decline. As employers are unable to assess the ability of an entrant, they would offer a wage equal to expected productivity of the worker's category and adjust it with unfolding information on true individual productivity. Workers are willing to accept a reduction in starting wage to prevent a reduction in their wage when their productivity is revealed to be below the expected value for their category. Harris and Holmstrom assume that entrant ability risk can be measured from wage variance of experienced workers, implying a negative effect of later variance on starting wages. Using Portuguese data covering virtually all private sector employees, we find that the prediction is unequivocally rejected. Robustness, flaws and pitfalls of the test are discussed.

The wage cuts were largely nominal. Wage cuts were larger in cities with higher initial compensation, but not in cities where compensation was initially out of line with (measured) fundamentals.

J,"Ross, MB",,,,"Ross, Matthew B.",,,Routine-biased technical change: Panel evidence of task orientation and wage effects,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Labor dynamics; Occupations; Tasks; Technological change; Wage polarization,JOB TASKS,"This analysis explores changes in the premium for abstract relative to routine tasks both across and within occupations over time. Previous theoretical and empirical work has linked growth in the relative task premium to changes in production technology that complement abstract but substitute for routine tasks, i.e. the Routine-Biased Technical Change hypothesis. The supporting empirical literature has relied almost exclusively on repeated cross-sections of workers and single cross-sections of task content. Thus, these studies have been unable to examine the evolution of wages in response to changes in task content within occupations over time and unable to control for unobserved individual and occupational heterogeneity. In this paper, I construct a new panel of occupational task content using incumbent-updated survey data from archived releases of the O*NET database. Estimating wage effects in a model with individual and occupation fixed-effects, I find that an increase of ten percentiles in the routine task distribution corresponds with a wage penalty of -0.09 to -0.35 percent in 2004 and declining to between -0.42 and -2.43 percent by 2013. In contrast, an increase of ten percentiles in the abstract task distribution corresponds with a wage penalty of 0.42-2.27 percent in 2004 and declining to between 0.42 and 2.43 percent by 2013. In contrasting estimates with and without individual fixed-effects, I also find evidence patterns of self-selection over time that are also consistent with the Routine-Biased Technical Change hypothesis.

Biomass energy consumption and trade openness as well as oil prices are considered as, additional determinants of economic growth, and consequentially of CO2 emissions. The bounds testing approach to cointegration is used to examine the long-run relationship between the variables in the presence of structural breaks. The causal relationship between the variables is investigated by applying the VECM Granger causality test and accommodating structural breaks. The results confirm the presence of cointegration between the variables. Moreover, the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions is not only inverted-U shaped but also N-shaped in the presence of structural breaks and biomass. Biomass energy consumption lowers CO2 emissions. Exports, imports and trade openness are also environment-friendly. The causality analysis underscores a feedback effect between biomass energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Economic growth still Granger causes CO2 emissions in this new setup. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This was noted, but not developed into a theory of the capitalist economy, by Marx. That development subsequently came in the work of Veblen, Hilferding and his critics Lederer and (implicitly) Kalecki, Keynes, Steindl and Minsky. The paper argues that the Great Schism in economic theory is not between Keynes and `the Classics', as argued by Keynes; or Keynes and the Neoclassical Synthesis, as contended by Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn; nor even between monetary production and barter exchange, as maintained by post-Keynesian writers; still less between political economists and apologetic theorists, as argued by Marxists. The key distinction in economic theory is between those who recognise the central role of long-term finance in the capitalist economy, and those theorists for whom finance is merely `savings' or another form of credit.","[Toporowski, Jan] Univ London, SOAS, Econ Dept, London, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Toporowski, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Econ Dept, London, England.",,,,,,,,50,0,1,0,17,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We exploit the cointegration properties of the macroeconomic time series, such that, when the series are I(1) and cointegrated, there is a factor representation, where the common factors are the common trends of the macroeconomic variables. Thus, we estimate a large non-stationary dynamic factor model using principal components (PC) as suggested by Bai (J Econom 122(1): 137-183, 2004), where the estimated common factors are used in a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model to forecast the Global Index of Economic Activity. Additionally, we estimate the common trends through partial least squares. The results indicate that the common trends are useful to predict Mexican economic activity, and reduce the forecast error with respect to benchmark models, mainly when estimated using PC.","[Corona, Francisco] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estadist, Calle Madrid,126, Madrid 28903, Spain; [Gonzalez-Farias, Graciela] Ctr Invest Matemat AC, Jaliso S-N, Guanajuato 36240, Guanajuato, Mexico; [Orraca, Pedro] El Colegio Frontera Norte, Dept Estudios Econ, Carretera Escen Tijuana Ensenada Km 18-5, Tijuana 22560, Baja California, Mexico",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Colegio Frontera Norte,"Corona, F (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Estadist, Calle Madrid,126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",fcorona@est-econ.uc3m.es; farias@cimat.mx; porraca@colef.mx,"Orraca Romano, Pedro P./ACR-4397-2022; Corona, Francisco/HLH-3046-2023; Gonzalez, Graciela/AAP-1412-2021","Orraca Romano, Pedro P./0000-0003-0215-1251;",CONACYT [CB-2015-01-252996],CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)),Partial financial support from the CONACYT CB-2015-01-252996 is gratefully acknowledged.,,58,5,5,0,4,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

A simple stylized model of heterogeneous expectations is considered to demonstrate that the impact of expectations' heterogeneity on wealth inequality depends nonlinearly on the level and persistence of expectations' dispersion. It is also shown that the heterogeneity of expectations generated by the empirically validated learning-from-experience model (Malmendier, Nagel, Q J Econ 2016) has a moderate but ambiguous impact on the distribution of wealth. The effect is sensitive to the calibration of the macroeconomic and learning parts of the model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous work (Alos-Ferrer, 2004) showed that in the presence of memory, imitative behavior leads to a non-trivial dynamics selecting all quantities between the Cournot and Walrasian outcomes. However, the scope of previous results was limited to specific assumptions on demand and cost functions, and did not provide information on the shape of the distribution of outcomes. We use computational simulations to address these limitations. We show that the selection result for non-trivial memory holds beyond the set of well-behaved Cournot games previously analyzed. Further, we find that, in Cournot games, the limit distribution of long-run outcomes is highly skewed towards the Walrasian quantity. Although longer memory increases the importance of the Cournot equilibrium, the competitive outcome remains the dominant prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Kenya shows strong volatility transmission and high persistence similar to other countries in transition to a more forwardlooking monetary policy framework.

We find a similar effect when interacting the prime with the Big 5 personality characteristic of agreeableness. We furthermore introduce a novel method for testing for priming, subliminity.

Although the proposed game is not easily solvable for the feedback case, i.e., it is not the linear quadratic case of game neither the degenerated game case, we calculate explicitly a stationary feedback equilibrium. In the proposed game the regulator has the ability to turn the optimal allocation of their efforts between pollution abatement and taxation of the polluting firms. During the game, the regulator's criterion is the minimization of the total discounted costs, while the criterion of the polluting firms is their utility maximization. Next, sensitivity analyses regarding the efficiency parameters of both players are provided. The conclusions are that a farsighted regulator should put much effort in abatement measures (instead of taxation measures) as well as in the improvement of abatement efficiency.

The primary result is that GDP and consumption respond positively to anticipated fiscal policy shock. In addition, the result of the historical decomposition that focuses on the period of Abenomics reveals that anticipated fiscal policy shock positively contributes to consumption dynamics.","[Morita, Hiroshi] Hosei Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Hosei University,"Morita, H (通讯作者)，Hosei Univ, Tokyo, Japan.",,,"Morita, Hiroshi/0000-0003-3967-7388",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for Young Scientists,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) for Young Scientists(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","I would like to thank Mototsugu Shintani (the editor) and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

In the long term, business location (and relocation) decisions, aggregate travel patterns and transportation infrastructure development are inter-dependent. In the medium-short term, in any neighborhood, the temporal profile of activity opportunities within a day, and destination and departure time (DDT) preferences of travelers are simultaneously determined. This paper explored these short-term interdependencies between the land-use supply and travel demand systems by developing a simultaneous model of time-of-day specific zonal employment intensity and non-mandatory tour DDT choices. The resulting model takes the form a panel linear regression model with employment intensity, as the dependent variable on the supply side and a mixed logit model with combinations of Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) and time periods as alternatives on the demand side. The modeling methodology accounts for possible endogeneity between the two systems and also considers importance sampling methods to reduce the computational burden due to explosion of choice alternatives in the discrete choice model component. The model was used to explore supply demand interactions in the Southern California region. The results not only underscore the importance of the proposed integrated modeling framework but also provide several useful insights into the factors that influence the temporal profile of zonal employment and its interaction with daily travel choices.","[Paleti, Rajesh] Old Dominion Univ, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Imani, Ahmadreza Faghih] Univ Toronto, Dept Civil Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Eluru, Naveen] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, 12800 Pegasus Dr,Room 301D, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Hu, Hsi-Hwa; Huang, Guoxiong] Southern Calif Assoc Govt, 818 W Seventh St,12th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90017 USA",Old Dominion University; University of Toronto; State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Paleti, R (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",rpaleti@odu.edu; a.faghihimani@mail.utoronto.ca; naveen.eluru@ucf.edu; hu@scag.ca.gov; huang@scag.ca.gov,"Eluru, Naveen/B-2965-2012; Imani, Ahmadreza Faghih/AAF-5947-2019","Eluru, Naveen/0000-0003-1221-4113; Imani, Ahmadreza Faghih/0000-0001-9687-3188",,,,,12,4,5,0,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

We use a fully decentralized economy, in which households and firms exchange labour and consumption goods in the corresponding markets with potential rationing. Their strategies are updated through an evolutionary learning process based on imitation and random experimenting. This learning process induces substantial coordination failures, especially between firms, which lead almost systematically to below equilibrium output levels and social welfare losses. The main underlying mechanism is a self-reinforcing uneven distribution of households' income, which results in a lack of aggregate demand. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this research is to explore direct influences of personal factors (attitudes toward the advertising, the need for individuality/uniqueness, price sensitivity) on shopping enjoyment, its impact on the word of mouth communication (WOM) and the moderating effects of demographic variables (gender and education) on these relationships. The research was conducted on the representative sample of 1000 Croatian respondents. The variety of statistical techniques, including SEM, was employed for data analysis. The results show that personal factors positively influence shopping enjoyment, which is positively related to WOM communication. Furthermore, the results confirm the moderating effects of gender and education on the relationship between the shopping enjoyment and WOM. These research findings contribute to the scientific knowledge enrichment and offer some practical marketing implications. Namely, the marketing experts can better understand the consumer's factors impacting shopping enjoyment, which can enable them to adequately assess the necessary appeals and to create an effective and persuasive marketing communication. At the end, the paper addresses the research limitations and offers some future research directions.","[Mihic, Mirela; Milakovic, Ivan Kursan] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia",University of Split,"Milakovic, IK (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split, Croatia.",ikursan@efst.hr,"Milakovic, Ivana Kursan/F-8599-2017",,,,,,117,11,12,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Such schemes usually imply that the member states of the federation can only partly internalize (marginal) tax revenue before redistribution. Aside from the internalized marginal revenue, referred to as the marginal tax-back rate, the remainder is redistributed. We investigate the extent to which state-level authorities in such federation under-exploit their tax bases. By means of a stylized model, we show that the member states have an incentive to align the effective tax rates on their residents with the level of the marginal tax-back rate. We empirically test the model using state-level and micro-level taxpayer data, OLS regressions and natural experiments. Our empirical findings support the results from our theoretical model. Particularly, we find that states with a higher marginal tax-back rate exploit the tax base to a higher extent.","[Boenke, Timm; Schroeder, Carsten] Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Jochimsen, Beate] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Jochimsen, Beate] German Inst Econ Res Berlin DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Schroeder, Carsten] German Inst Econ Res Berlin DIW, SOEP, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Berlin School of Economics & Law; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Bönke, T (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, Sch Business & Econ, Boltzmannstr 20, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",timm.boenke@fu-berlin.de,"Jochimsen, Beate/K-4876-2019","Jochimsen, Beate/0000-0001-6950-3026",,,,,56,3,3,2,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

(2014) to construct real-time output gap estimates for Switzerland over the out-of-sample period from 2003:Q1 to 2015:Q4. The model space consists of a large number of bivariate VAR specifications for the output gap and inflation, with each VAR specification using a different estimate of the output gap, lag order, and structural break information. We find that the linear opinion pool performs rather poorly. Real-time estimates of the output gap are no more accurate than those from some simple benchmark models, no more robust to ex post revisions than the real-time estimates of the individual univariate output gaps, and do not produce more accurate forecasts of inflation. The key driver of 'good' forecast performance is structural break information. Once the same structural break information is conditioned upon in all prediction models, the gain from averaging over many different pools of models that utilize various output gap estimates or lag structures in the VAR specification is of negligible magnitude.","[Buncic, Daniel] Cent Bank Sweden, Financial Stabil Dept, Res & Modelling Div, Sveriges Riksbank, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden; [Mueller, Oliver] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",Sveriges Riksbank; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Buncic, D (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Sweden, Financial Stabil Dept, Res & Modelling Div, Sveriges Riksbank, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",daniel.buncic@riksbank.se; omueller@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,47,1,1,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We consider a direct correlation device with messages phrased in terms of players' actions as well as an indirect device with a priori meaningless messages. According to the revelation principle, it does not matter whether the correlation device is direct or indirect so long as it implements a correlated equilibrium. However, we find that subjects had an easier time coordinating on the efficient correlated equilibrium with a direct rather than an indirect device. Nevertheless, subjects were able to learn to use the indirect device to better coordinate their play. We further find that, when paired with a fixed partner, subjects utilized history-contingent strategies (e.g., alternation) as a coordinating device and were more likely to ignore the correlation device in this setting; the fixed-matching protocol can thus serve as a substitute for a correlation device in achieving an efficient coordination outcome.","[Duffy, John] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Lai, Ernest K.] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Taylor St, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Lim, Wooyoung] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Lehigh University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Duffy, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",duffy@uci.edu; kwl409@lehigh.edu; wooyoung@ust.hk,"Lim, Wooyoung/AAI-4828-2020; Duffy, John/F-6968-2015","Lim, Wooyoung/0000-0002-9665-8127; Duffy, John/0000-0002-7660-2281",Hong Kong Research Grant Council [ECS-699613],Hong Kong Research Grant Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"We thank the editor, Dan Kovenock, the three anonymous referees, Vince Crawford, Nick Feltovich, and seminar participants at the 2nd China Meeting of the Econometric Society and HKUST for valuable comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.

Surprisingly, the vast majority of this literature has studied social norms in asocial decision settings, where individuals are observed to act in isolation from each other. In this paper we use a large-scale dictator game experiment (N = 850) to show that peers can have a profound influence on individuals' perceptions of norms of fair sharing, which we elicit in an incentive compatible way. However, in contrast to these strong peer effects in social norms of fair sharing, we find limited evidence of the influence of norms and peers on actual sharing behavior.

We assume that individuals sense relative deprivation from unfavorable (income) comparisons within their reference group and that comparisons take place within the same gender. The introduction of a female quota increases (decreases) the number of women (men) holding top positions. On one hand, the relative deprivation to which female individuals are subjected to increases. These female individuals respond to an increase in their relative deprivation by acquiring additional human capital which, because it enables them to increase their earnings, reduces their relative deprivation. On the other hand, male individuals invest less in human capital in response to a decrease in relative deprivation. We show that the human capital formed by women who are encouraged to do so by the quotas is larger than the human capital that men who are discouraged by the quotas refrain from forming. However, the positive human capital accumulation effect hinges on a certain level of ability by gender and on how much individuals perceive relative deprivation.","[Hyll, Walter] Leibniz Assoc, Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Hyll, W (通讯作者)，Leibniz Assoc, Halle Inst Econ Res IWH, Halle, Germany.",walter.hyll@iwh-halle.de,,,,,,,36,0,0,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The analysis is based on a new definition of bond yields convergence that can be interpreted either as strong or weak monetary policy convergence, depending on whether the conditions of uncovered interest-rate parity and ex-ante purchasing power parity hold or are violated, respectively. The empirical results provide evidence of either strong or weak monetary policy convergence to Germany only for five new countries, namely Croatia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia. In contrast, for the rest of the new EU countries the empirical evidence suggests lack of monetary policy convergence to Germany.

Next, we discuss the case of Cournot competition and illustrate that cost asymmetry may induce incumbents to engage in cost-raising lobbying.

Results from the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL)-bounds testing approach show that there is stable long run equilibrium relationship between CalFresh caseloads, oil prices and unemployment. They also show that adjustment in CalFresh participation due to changes in oil prices and unemployment is slow, and a 10% increase in unemployment led to a 33% increase in CalFresh enrollment Results from a modified Granger Causality method indicated causality running from unemployment to CalWORKs, and no causality from oil prices to CalWORKs participation. The GIRF confirmed that CalWORKs is more responsive to changes in unemployment than to oil price shocks. The FEVDC results demonstrated that contributions of the oil price shocks in explaining variations in CalWORKs were negligible.

There are numerous methods that efficiently support the forecasting of time series, such as electricity prices, which have high volatility. However, the performance of these approaches varies depending on data sets and operational conditions. In this work, the concept of composite forecasting is presented and implemented in a retrospective study, in real industrial forecasting conditions to show the potential of forecast performance improvement and comparable high consistency of a forecast performance across different 'Day Peak' and-Day Base' electricity price data sets for different seasons. As individual methods support vector regression, artificial neural networks and ridge regression are implemented. The forecast performances of these methods are evaluated and compared with their forecast combination using different error measures. The results show that composite forecasting processes with 'inverse root mean squared error' combination approach can generate, on average, a more accurate and robust forecast than using an individual methods or other combination schemas.

They may be also the basis for policy designs in developed countries like EU members. This paper develops a comprehensive econometric study on the main drivers of national emissions intensity in emerging countries in East Asia. This regional focus responds to their pivotal position in global economic growth and remarkable trends in carbon emissions intensity. The main hypothesis of this paper is that the nature of economic growth has a major effect on carbon intensity trends that deserves some attention. Accordingly, the novelty of this paper is to examine the contribution of intensive and extensive GDP growth for carbon intensity abatements. Labour productivity is revealed to be the main factor responsible for major carbon intensity reductions by Asian Dragons. Whereas household energy per capita and industrial energy per worker contributed in the opposite direction. Consequently, intensity targets may become meaningless for real climate action contributions if they do not take into account labour productivity trends. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The key insight of this paper is that the reason a small open economy uses trade protections is not because of the existence of search frictions in the labor markets, but the real motivation is from labor market inefficiency. I show that the restricted parameter space considered in Costinot (2009) generates an equilibrium with inefficiently high unemployment compared to the constrained efficient level of unemployment, and thus trade protections can improve welfare. In the more general parameter space considered in this paper, despite the existence of search frictions in a labor market, free trade can be optimal if the labor market is efficient. In addition, unemployment can be inefficiently low and import subsidies are preferable. The result holds true for standard matching functions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The SLE is conceived as a specific type of construct that is ascribed particular properties through its stabilization within and between different (legal and economic) discourses. By showing how the SLE, as a reified construct, is rendered meaningful, real and/or consequential, we illustrate how the 'social ontology' of the modern corporation is radically contingent and inescapably contested. Given that the social ontology of the corporation defies definitive specification, we regard the prospect of the completeness of its disclosure (e.g. by foregrounding a specific referent) as problematic. Indeed, any account of social ontology that foregrounds a specific referent is seen to obscure a political process in which the stabilization of the SLE rests on the contingent foregrounding of particular priorities. This leads us to reflect on the power-inflected social organization of knowledge generation. Key to the explication of social ontology, and with specific reference to the corporation, is not, as Lawson contends, the concept of 'community' but the inescapability of contestation within relations of power that translate ontological openness into specific but precarious forms of ontic closure.","[Veldman, Jeroen; Willmott, Hugh] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Bunhill Row 106, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Veldman, J (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Bunhill Row 106, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",jeroen.Veldman@cass.city.ac.uk,"Veldman, Jeroen/Q-4670-2019; Veldman, Jeroen/GQA-5223-2022","Veldman, Jeroen/0000-0001-8615-5844; Veldman, Jeroen/0000-0001-8615-5844; Willmott, Hugh/0000-0003-1321-7041",,,,,85,14,14,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Firm-level data of South African merger and acquisition activities in 74 host countries are used to estimate a number of model specifications that control for host-country economic, geographical, cultural and institutional characteristics. Estimations are carried out using random-effects negative binomial panel model. Capturing the host-economy market and enhancing efficiency are found to be the two major motives driving South African corporations' CBMA activities. Natural resources acquisition seems a less important motive, while strategic assets such as patents and technology do not appear to be attractive. The role of cultural and economic linkages between the home and the host country is found to be substantial. South African firms prefer investing in Africa, particularly in countries bordering South Africa.

Researchers privately have breakthroughs and decide how long to let their ideas mature before disclosing them, thereby establishing priority. Two-researcher, symmetric priority races have a unique equilibrium that can be characterized by a differential equation. We study how the shapes of the breakthrough distribution and of the returns to maturation affect maturation delays and research quality, both in dynamic and comparative statics analyses. Making researchers better at discovering new ideas or at developing them has contrasted effects on research quality. Being closer to the technological frontier enhances the value of maturation for researchers, which mitigates the negative impact on research quality of the race for priority. Finally, when researchers differ in their abilities to do creative work or in the technologies they use to develop their ideas, more efficient researchers always let their ideas mature more than their less efficient opponents. Our theoretical results shed light on academic competition, patent races, and innovation quality.","[Bobtcheff, Catherine; Mariotti, Thomas] Univ Toulouse Capitole CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Bolte, Jerome] Univ Toulouse Capitole CNRS, Toulouse, France; [Mariotti, Thomas] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Mariotti, Thomas] CESifo, Munich, Germany",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Ifo Institut,"Bobtcheff, C (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.",,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Mariotti, Thomas/JFJ-5596-2023",,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JS01-004-01 GAGA, ANR-10-BLAN-0112 JEUDY]; European Research Council [203929-ACAP]",Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"We thank the editor, Marco Ottaviani, and four anonymous referees for very thoughtful and detailed comments.

Using the November Current Population Surveys with the added Voting and Registration Supplement for the years 1990 through 2004 and exploiting changes in welfare policy across states and over time, we estimate the causal effects of welfare reform on women's voting registration and voting participation during the period in which welfare reform unfolded. During this time period, voter turnout was decreasing in the United States. We find robust evidence that welfare reform led to smaller declines in voting (about 3 to 4 percentage points, which translates to about 10% relative to the baseline mean) for women who were exposed to welfare reform compared to several different comparison groups of similar women who were much less exposed. The robust findings suggest that welfare reform had prosocial effects on civic participation, as characterized by voting. The effects were largely confined to presidential elections, were stronger in Democratic than Republican states, were stronger in states with stronger work incentive policies, and appeared to operate through employment, education, and income.

It presents new econometric estimates on the link between cumulative GDP growth and fiscal austerity measures during 2011-2013. The main empirical finding is that the depth of the economic crisis in the euro area's economies is closely related to the harshness of fiscal austerity. Cumulative multiplier estimates are found to vary in a range from 1.4 to 2.1, depending on the data source used to identify the intensity of fiscal consolidation. Given these multiplier values, a reasonable approximation of the size of the output losses due to fiscal austerity in the euro area during 2011-2013 is in the range of 5.5 to 8.4 percent of GDP. Against the background of the prevailing macroeconomic and institutional circumstances, fiscal consolidation is argued to be the cause of the double-dip recession.","[Heimberger, Philipp] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies WIIW, Linz, Austria; [Heimberger, Philipp] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Comprehens Anal Econ, Linz, Austria",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies; Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Heimberger, P (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies WIIW, Linz, Austria.;Heimberger, P (通讯作者)，Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Comprehens Anal Econ, Linz, Austria.",heimberger@wiiw.ac.at,,"Heimberger, Philipp/0000-0001-9874-7345",,,,,58,20,21,1,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

This paper studies a model of labor productivity where workers have heterogeneous abilities, and can differently affect the productivity of their fellow teammates. Applying the model to the setting of the National Basketball Association (NBA), I can identify the marginal value that a basketball player brings to a particular team lineup, both through his own individual contributions and his complementary contribution to teammates' productivity. Estimates from the model imply that teammates have a significant impact on individual player productivity, and that taking into account spillovers across teammates is important to assessing both overall team productivity and an individual player's contribution to team productivity. I then evaluate whether player complementarities are valued in the NBA labor market in terms of higher salaries, and find that they are undervalued, and that players are instead paid mainly for their individual offensive production. This creates an asymmetry between player incentives and the team objective. To assess the size of this inefficiency, the top trading cycle algorithm of Shapley and Scarf (1974) is used to identify a Pareto optimal matching between players and teams, that accounts for the complementarities between heterogeneous players' skill sets.

To date, such behavior has been modeled through the lens of gift-exchange and reciprocity. We provide an alternate rationale for gift-giving by nonprofit organizations based on the signaling model of Spence (1973). We first show that in the presence of uninformed donors there exists a separating equilibrium under which high quality charities expend scarce resources to signal quality and receive higher donations. We then explore how gift-giving and competition amongst charities impacts net public good provision. In doing so, we highlight a perverse effect - competition amongst charities can lead to lower public good provision when the likelihood a charity is of high quality is high and/or when the difference in quality across high and low type firms narrows.

This paper uses the complementarity between the two authors to build a comprehensive dynamic approach to people's 'functionings and capabilities'. Different groups of 'functionings' are thus characterised by their different patterns of development in interaction with the resources available and the social context. As a result, Sen's problems of evaluating 'functionings' and measuring 'capability' can be alleviated; harmful functionings can be predicted; children's welfare can be better evaluated; and Sen's definitions of 'capability', 'agency' and 'well-being' can be refined.","[Pugno, Maurizio] Univ Cassino, Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino,"Pugno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Dept Econ & Law, Campus Folcara, I-03034 Cassino, Italy.",m.pugno@unicas.it,"Pugno, Maurizio/AAG-5669-2019",,MIUR,"MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","University of Cassino.

While the job search literature recognizes the importance of the spatial distribution of employment, local labour market conditions have been a notable omission from the commuting literature. In the first study of its kind, we introduce local labour market conditions into a model of spouses' commuting behaviour in the UK. We find male commute times are more sensitive to local unemployment rates than women's, although both effects are inelastic, and are of a similar magnitude to that of labour income. The more conducive the local labour market is to female employment opportunities, the less time women spend commuting. Local unemployment rates have heterogeneous effects on commuting, e.g. arising from mode of transport, job change, and homeownership. Furthermore, housing market rigidities lead to longer commuting times and thus increase the social costs that a more flexible housing market could alleviate.","[Roberts, Jennifer] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Taylor, Karl] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England; [Taylor, Karl] IZA, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Taylor, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, 9 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.;Taylor, K (通讯作者)，IZA, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",k.b.taylor@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Roberts, Jennifer/0000-0003-2883-7251",,,,,69,13,14,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This final issue in the series features more work in the same vein, together with new contributions from Amit Bhaduri (writing with Srinivas Raghavendra) and Stephen Marglin themselves. Papers by Esteban Perez Caldentey and Matias Vernengo and by Peter Skott begin by striking a tone of sympathetic criticism. They call into question whether and how Keynesian macrodynamics should focus attention on wage-versus profit-led growth, suggesting either that such emphasis is unjustified (Skott), or that it is typically contextualized within the wrong theoretical framework (Perez Caldentey and Vernengo). Both Bhaduri and Raghavendra and Marglin, meanwhile, identify and rectify omissions in their earlier work. Taking Bhaduri and Marglin (1990) and Marglin and Bhaduri (1990) as their points of departure, they add analyses of the monetary and financial sectors (including, most notably, shadow banking activities) and distinctions between slow and fast wage/price adjustment regimes and corporate investment regimes (based on either capital widening or capital deepening), respectively. Together with the contents of previous special issues, it is hoped that the work in this issue will help to map out an agenda for future research into growth and distribution that focuses not just on the interaction between these variables, but also their interplay with other factors - real and financial - contributory to a fuller Keynesian account of capitalist macrodynamics.","[Setterfield, Mark] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Setterfield, M (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,1,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Before the Affordable Care Act required all employers in the United States to provide health insurance to employees' children until the age of 26 (before September 2010), many health insurance contracts covered dependents up until age 19. Using a regression discontinuity design framework, I find that approximately 6 percent of young adults lose their health insurance coverage once they turn 19. I also find that although losing health insurance coverage at age 19 does not have any significant impact on smoking, marijuana use, and risky sexual behaviors among young adults, it decreases the probability of consuming 5 or more drinks a day by approximately 2 percentage points. These results are robust under several different parametric and non-parametric models and not sensitive to the selection of samples based on gender.","[Yoruk, Baris K.] SUNY Albany, Econ, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"Yörük, BK (通讯作者)，SUNY Albany, Econ, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.",byoruk@albany.edu,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using the 2010 wave of Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey data, our analyses indicate a U-shaped relationship of both electricity use and other types of energy use (combined) with household expenditure. The findings imply that as income grows households increase their energy expenditure less than proportionally, up to a threshold level of income. Beyond the threshold income, energy use increases as a proportion of income, particularly for electricity use. We identify the threshold (turning point) for both electricity and other types of energy use.

We explore this using Australian Time-Use Survey data from 2006. We examine the effect of paid work in terms of the effect that total work time on a given day has on the amount of time spent on childcare; the allocation of time on activities across work and non-work days; and the effect of non-traditional work hours. The results show that mothers perform a large share of childcare, irrespective of their earning power or their partner's availability to take on some of these tasks. The use of formal and informal childcare by others allows the mother to balance the competing demands of work and her own childcare; an effect that does not hold for fathers. These effects on childcare are also almost solely concentrated in the routine component of childcare (e.g. preparing meals, changing nappies), with each parent 'protecting' interactive childcare from the effect of both paid work and the relative availability of their partner to take on some of this childcare.","[Argyrous, George] Australia & New Zealand Sch Govt, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rahman, Sara] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Argyrous, G (通讯作者)，Australia & New Zealand Sch Govt, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",g.argyrous@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,26,12,13,0,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

But the potential gains from foreign aid policy coordination may be limited by the willing participation of diverse and self-interested donor countries. If stability of the foreign aid agreement does not occur, then aid effectiveness fails. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of the stability of foreign aid agreement on income redistribution amongst countries. The findings show that stability has positive effects on income mobility from the rich to the poorest countries reducing global income inequality. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Using nationally representative panel data we analyze the links between mental health and two alternative workplace productivity measures - absenteeism and presenteeism (i.e., lower productivity while attending work) - explicitly allowing these relationships to be moderated by the nature of the job itself. We find that absence rates are approximately five percent higher among workers who report being in poor mental health. Moreover, job conditions are related to both presenteeism and absenteeism even after accounting for workers' self-reported mental health status. Job conditions are relatively more important in understanding diminished productivity at work if workers are in good rather than poor mental health. The effects of job complexity and stress on absenteeism do not depend on workers' mental health, while job security and control moderate the effect of mental illness on absence days.","[Bubonya, Melisa; Wooden, Mark] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, H04 Merewether Bldg, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.; Wooden, Mark] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Sydney; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Cobb-Clark, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, H04 Merewether Bldg, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia.",melisa.bubonya@unimelb.edu.au; deborah.cobb-clark@sydney.edu.au; m.wooden@unimelb.edu.au,"Cobb-Clark, Deborah A/H-1153-2013; Wooden, Mark/G-8073-2015",,Department of Social Services (DSS); Australian Research Council [DP140102614],Department of Social Services (DSS); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This paper uses confidentialized unit record file data from the HILDA Survey.

We run a panel regression of firm growth using the inverse of a country- and industry-specific relative energy intensity (REI) measure with the corresponding industrial sector in the reference case (the U.S. industry) in addition to the inverse of the traditional energy intensity measure (EI) after controlling several firm, industry, and country variables. We find that El and REI may have somewhat different impacts on firm growth in terms of profits and capital accumulation. When we control the heterogeneity in industrial dependence on energy, firm profits in the industry club with lower REI grow faster than the six-country average. Compared to the six country case, we find that the efficient use of energy inputs has made a smaller contribution to firm growth in Korea. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This divides taxpayers sharply into two groups-those who have experience of having paid it before and those who don't. Given the nature and the rate of the estate tax, the experience of having paid it is probably neither negligible nor forgettable. In this paper, using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances and a regression discontinuity design, I find evidence that the experience of paying the estate tax in the past increases the probability that the individual is currently engaged in estate tax avoidance behavior for their children.

We find that men's working time increases with that of their peers, and that men's happiness is negatively related to peer working time.

While some studies show that trade leads to growth, others have pointed to a reverse causation. In this paper, we develop a model of international trade and productivity growth in the presence of a misallocation of resources. Misallocation in a country arises as a result of lobbying by firms to establish barriers to the competitive allocation of labor. Misallocation prevents the country from exploiting its technological comparative advantage and leads to a reduction in the volume of trade in the absence of any explicit trade barriers. In the model, whether barriers diminish or worsen with productivity growth depends on the extent of the initial resource misallocation. If the initial resource misallocation is not severe, then productivity growth leads to diminishing barriers and vice versa. In either case, productivity growth strengthens the comparative advantage over time and therefore increases the volume of trade.","[Cothren, Richard] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Radhakrishnan, Ravi] Ctr Coll Danville, Dept Econ, 600 West Walnut St, Danville, KY 40422 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Radhakrishnan, R (通讯作者)，Ctr Coll Danville, Dept Econ, 600 West Walnut St, Danville, KY 40422 USA.",ravi.radhakrishnan@centre.edu,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,3,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

J,"Dollar, D",,,,"Dollar, David",,,United States-China two-way direct investment: Opportunities and challenges,JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,U.S.-China relations; Direct investment; Trade restrictions; CFIUS,,"There is surprisingly little cross investment between the U.S. and China, the two largest economies in the world. Only 1.5% of the stock of U.S. direct investment abroad was in China at end-2015. The stock of Chinese direct investment in the U.S. is also lower than would be expected given that the U.S. is the world's largest recipient of FDI. In recent years, however, the flow of direct investment from China to the U.S. has accelerated rapidly, and if current trends persist within a short time there will be a larger stock of Chinese investment in the U.S. than of U.S. investment in China. The small amount of U.S. investment in China can be traced to two primary factors: first, poor protection of property rights, including intellectual property rights (IPR), which limits the potential benefits that U.S. firms can receive from their technology and brands; and China's restrictions on direct investment in many sectors important to U.S. firms. Among G-20 countries, China is the most restrictive in terms of openness to direct investment. The relatively small amount of Chinese investment in the U.S. can also be traced to two factors: first, much of the initial impetus for Chinese firms to go out was to secure natural resources, while the U.S. is not a resource-rich country relative to its GDP or population; and second, the national security reviews of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. have soured many Chinese investors on the U.S. market. The two countries have agreed to negotiate a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). This could open the doors to large amounts of investment in both directions if it addresses key issues. For U.S. firms, access to more sectors and better protection of IPR are crucial. Chinese firms seek a less politicized environment in which to invest. In its Third Plenum decision of 2013 the Communist Party leadership indicated its intention to open more sectors to foreign investment and competition. A BIT could help lock in these necessary reforms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The impact of employment protection is analyzed by means of a regression discontinuity design (RDD) that exploits the variation in EP provisions in Italy across firms below and above a size threshold. We present three main findings. First, EP increases worker turnover, defined as the sum of hires and separations, thereby reducing rather than increasing worker security on average. Second, this can be entirely explained by the fact that firms facing more stringent EP make a greater use of workers on temporary contracts. Our preferred estimates suggest that the discontinuity in EP increases the incidence of temporary work by 2-2.5 percentage points around the threshold. Moreover, the effect of employment protection persists well beyond the threshold and may account for about 12% of the overall incidence of temporary work. Third, EP tends to reduce labour productivity. This is partly due to the impact of EP on worker turnover and the incidence of temporary work.","[Hijzen, Alexander; Scarpetta, Stefano] OECD, Paris, France; [Hijzen, Alexander; Scarpetta, Stefano] IZA, Bologna, Italy; [Mondauto, Leopoldo] Italia Lavoro, Rome, Italy; [Mondauto, Leopoldo] IMT Lucca, Lucca, Italy",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Hijzen, A (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",alexander.hijzen@oecd.org,,,,,,,36,25,26,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JUN,2017,46.0,,,,,,64,76,,10.1016/j.labeco.2017.01.002,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ4QN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404697700005,0

There is often a delay before action is taken and reform packages that would be most efficient to implement all at once are often done only gradually. We propose a theoretical model explaining this behavior and show that when voters have present-biased, time-inconsistent preferences, gradualism can arise in equilibrium and be welfare-enhancing. This is because without the possibility for gradualism, time-inconsistent voters would delay implementing the reform even more. Using a citizen candidate model, we allow the agenda setter, who decides which reform schedule to put to vote, to be endogenously determined. We show that voters who are aware of their own time inconsistency can use the election of the agenda setter as a commitment device and appoint an agent who is more patient than the median voter in order to avoid full procrastination and to achieve efficiency-maximizing gradualism.","[Hwang, Jisoo] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 02450, South Korea; [Mollerstrom, Johanna] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA USA; [Mollerstrom, Johanna] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; George Mason University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Hwang, J (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 02450, South Korea.",jhwang@hufs.ac.kr; jmollers@gmu.edu,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies,"We would like to thank Philippe Aghion, Alberto Alesina, Raj Chetty, Katie Coffman, Paola Conconi, David Laibson, Dani Rodrik, Ken Shepsle, Andrei Shleifer, and the participants at the Political Economy Workshop, the Macro Workshop, and the Theory Workshop at Harvard University for very helpful comments and suggestions.

This change of point of view is invoked by the needs of contemporary socio-economic evolution. If society wants to reach sustainable development, the bankruptcy should be perceived as an immanent part of normal cyclical economic development. Moreover, if the view of bankruptcy is changed in a positive way, it can be a stimulus for innovations, investment and global welfare. But it is not possible without an increase in the effectiveness of national and international bankruptcy law. Purpose of the article: The goal of this study is to analyse the position of a creditor in the case of a debtor's bankruptcy on the basis of comparative law in the Slovak Republic de lege ferenda. It is because we assume that continuous attention should be given to the issue of the creditor's position with regard to a debtor's bankruptcy to achieve sustainable economic development. Methods: The potential consideration de lege ferenda should be based not only on performed legal analysis, but also on performed economic analysis. So, selected countries have been evaluated according to specific economic and legal indicators. We used the interdisciplinary approach based on selection analysis and legal comparative analysis applied to international comparison of the status of creditor and the effectiveness of bankruptcy law from his point of view. Findings & Value added: The applied approach has led us to the detection of the most important insolvency laws, specifically the insolvency laws of the United States and Austria. These legislations were further applied in the context of consideration de lege ferenda over the position of a creditor in the case of a debtor's bankruptcy in the Slovak Republic.","[Kliestikova, Jana; Misankova, Maria; Kliestik, Tomas] Univ Zilina, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Kliestikova, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",jana.kliestikova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kliestik, Tomas/O-8070-2015; Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015; Majerova, Jana/N-8126-2015","Kovacova, Maria/0000-0003-2081-6835; Majerova, Jana/0000-0002-9770-2521",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under Grant number APVV-14-0841: Comprehensive Prediction Model of the Financial Health of Slovak Companies.,,23,51,51,0,23,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

This can be taken as evidence of unsustainable current account balances and loss of solvency for the underlying economies. Using the ARDL methodology we also report a statistical association between fiscal balances and current account balances, which implies that fiscal austerity can help these economies to reduce their current account deficits and restore their competitiveness. Our empirical evidence also suggests a particularly strong significant negative association between domestic investment and current account deficits in all three economies. The magnitude of this latter effect may have important policy implications concerning the ways in which investment is financed in order to alleviate current account deficits and improve the external competitiveness of these economies.","[Litsios, Ioannis] Univ Bradford, Dept Econ, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England; [Pilbeam, Keith] Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq City, England",University of Bradford; University of London,"Pilbeam, K (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Econ, Northampton Sq City, England.",I.Litsios@bradford.ac.uk; K.S.Pilbeam@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,17,19,2,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

City of New London (2005). Kelo can be interpreted as supporting eminent domain as a means of transferring property rights from one set of private agents-landowners-to another private agent-a developer. Under voluntary exchange, where the developer sequentially acquires property rights from landowners via bargaining, a holdout problem arises. Eminent domain gives all of the bargaining power to the developer and, as a result, eliminates the holdout problem. This is the benefit of Kelo. However, landowners lose all their bargaining power and, as a result, their property investments become more inefficient. This is the cost of Kelo. A policy of eminent domain increases social welfare compared to voluntary sequential exchange only when the holdout problem is severe, and this occurs only if the developer has very little bargaining power. We propose an alternative government policy that eliminates the holdout problem but does not affect the bargaining power of the various parties. This alternative policy strictly dominates a policy of eminent domain, which implies that eminent domain is an inefficient way to transfer property rights between private agents.",,,,marchesiani@gmail.com; ed.nosal@gmail.com,"marchesiani, alessandro/I-5844-2013","marchesiani, alessandro/0000-0002-1866-6279",,,,,7,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Against the background of new saving-enhancing policy initiatives, this paper asks to what extent the concern is founded, and whether the measurement of saving is really appropriate to guide economic policy. Comparing different macroeconomic concepts and measurements of saving, we show that the measure of saving in the national accounts (the residual between income and expenditure) understates the household savings rate compared to other measures. Specifically, an alternative measure from the balance sheets (the change in wealth) yields a significantly higher and non-declining figure. While households have not been putting aside their incomes, they have nevertheless grown richer, driven largely by the appreciation of asset valuations. We also examine the impact of taking non-financial saving and wealth into account, and conclude that household sector saving on the aggregate is significantly higher than the national accounts suggest. However, these adjusted measures are most relevant for the upper tail of the income and wealth distribution, raising important distributional concerns.","[Orthofer, Anna] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Orthofer, A (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa.",anna.orthofer@gmail.com,,,Economic Research Southern Africa [ERSA-2015-0084],Economic Research Southern Africa,"This work was supervised by Stan du Plessis, Dieter von Fintel and Monique Reid, whom I wish to thank for extensive discussions and invaluable comments.

Combined with detailed survey data, we causally identify the impact of exporting on firm performance. Treatment firms report 16-26% higher profits and exhibit large improvements in quality alongside reductions in output per hour relative to control firms. These findings do not simply reflect firms being offered higher margins to manufacture high-quality products that take longer to produce. Instead, we find evidence of learning-by-exporting whereby exporting improves technical efficiency. First, treatment firms have higher productivity and quality after controlling for rug specifications. Second, when asked to produce an identical domestic rug using the same inputs and same capital equipment, treatment firms produce higher quality rugs despite no difference in production time. Third, treatment firms exhibit learning curves over time. Finally, we document knowledge transfers with quality increasing most along the specific dimensions that the knowledge pertained to.","[Atkin, David] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY USA; Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Columbia University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Atkin, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,"International Growth Centre, Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries, Innovations for Poverty Action, Economic Growth Center at Yale University; McMillan Center at Yale University; Jerome A.

This study examines the variation in labor market withdrawal of older workers across 13 European countries over the period 1995-2008. We seek to contribute to the international comparative macro literature by analyzing the effects of non-standard employment. Accounting for a number of labor market institutions, the empirical analysis leads to the conclusion that part-time employmentand in particular voluntary part-time employmentis negatively related to labor market withdrawal of older men. As such, the results indicate that part-time employment functions as bridge employment' between full-time employment and retirement. Additionally, we find that part-time employment at older ages does not decrease the average actual hours worked. Taken together, our results show that in countries with a high prevalence of part-time employment among older workers, the labor supply of older workers is higher both at the extensive and the intensive margin.","[Been, Jim; van Vliet, Olaf] Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Been, Jim] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Tilburg University,"Been, J (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Dept Econ, Leiden, Netherlands.;Been, J (通讯作者)，Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.been@law.leidenuniv.nl; o.p.van.vliet@law.leidenuniv.nl,"Van Vliet, Olaf P/B-9609-2017",,,,,,68,7,8,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2017,70.0,2,,,,,163,188,,10.1111/kykl.12134,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398843600001,0

Analytical results suggest that, whether the purpose of the OBR policy is to compensate firms for carbon tax burdens or to maximize welfare (accounting for global emission reductions), the OBR rate should be positive in policy-relevant cases. Numerical simulations for Canada, with the US as the neighbouring trading partner, indicate that the impact of US policies on the OBR rate will depend crucially on the purpose of the Canadian OBR policies. If, for a given US carbon policy, Canada's aim is to restore the competitiveness of domestic emission-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) firms to the same level as before the introduction of its own carbon taxation, we find that the necessary domestic OBR rates will be insensitive to the foreign carbon policies. However, if not only the Canadian carbon tax but also an equally high US tax is introduced, compensatory Canadian OBR rates will be up to 50% lower, depending on the sector and on US OBR policy. If the policy objective is to increase economy-wide allocative efficiency (welfare) of Canadian policies by accounting for carbon leakage, the US policies will have only a minor downward pressure on desirable OBR rates in Canada. Practical choices of OBR rates hardly affect overall domestic economic performance; thus, output-based rebating qualifies as an instrument for compensating EITE industries without a large sacrifice in terms of economy-wide allocative efficiency.","[Boehringer, Christoph] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany; [Bye, Brita; Faehn, Taran] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, As, Norway",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Statistics Norway; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Fæhn, T (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",taran.faehn@ssb.no,,,Research Council of Norway; University of Oslo and user partners; European community [270089]; Stiftung Mercator (ZenTraClim),Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); University of Oslo and user partners; European community; Stiftung Mercator (ZenTraClim),"We are grateful to Yassid Dissou, Nic Rivers, Torbjorn Haegeland, the editor and three anonymous referees for valuable feedback on earlier drafts.

Various de-rating factors and/or penalties have been incorporated into such mechanisms in order to reward the unit based on the contribution they make to system security, which in turn depends on the unit's reliability. However, this reliability is known to the firm but not to the regulator. We adopt a mechanism design approach for capacity payments based on a declaration by the firm of their reliability. The mechanism scales payments and penalties according to this declared reliability such that the firm's profit-maximising strategy is to truthfully reveal its reliability. A stochastic mixed complementarity problem (MCP) is used to model the interactions between the firms, and we apply this methodology to a test system using Irish electricity market data. Truth-telling is induced, increasing the efficiency of capacity payments while eliminating the requirement for the regulator to allocate resources to discovering reliability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Many of Africa's conflicts have deep historical roots. In this paper, we contribute to understanding the determinants of historical African conflict by studying an important historical source of conflict: suppression of the slave trade after 1807. We use geo-coded data on African conflicts to uncover a discontinuous increase in conflict after 1807 in areas affected by the slave trade, indicating that suppression increased the incidence of conflict between Africans. In West Africa, the slave trade declined. This empowered interests that rivaled existing authorities, and political leaders resorted to violence in order to maintain their influence. In West-Central and South-East Africa, slave exports increased after 1807 and were produced through violence.","[Fenske, James] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Kala, Namrata] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Warwick; Harvard University,"Fenske, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",j.fenske@warwick.ac.uk; kala@fas.harvard.edu,,,ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,98,14,18,2,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

It responds to Ng's comments on Lipsey's original criticism of third-best theory. Under a relevant definition of informational poverty and Ng's other assumptions, the expected value of any policy-created divergence from the status quo is negative: If there is not enough known to determine what to do, nothing should be done, rather than establishing first-best conditions as Ng's analysis has it. It is argued that Ng's analysis of his two other information states adds little to what common sense suggests. To address Ng's argument that policies using context-specific objective functions lack the required welfare basis, the present paper studies how economic policy is actually pursued absent guides provided by welfare economics. Policies that follow from evolutionary economic theory imply that many things that are seen as distortions' in welfare economics are actually desirable forces that drive economic growth.","[Lipsey, Richard G.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Lipsey, RG (通讯作者)，1125 West 26th St, N Vancouver, BC V7R 1A4, Canada.",rlipsey@sfu.ca,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

While Graziani's triangular debtor-bank-creditor relationship remains central, the circuit operates in a perverse form in which household debt is stored on the balance sheets of shadow banks, allowing the banking system to break the historical connection between money creation and productive activity.","[Michell, Jo] Univ West England, Accounting Econ & Finance, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Michell, J (通讯作者)，Univ West England, Accounting Econ & Finance, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",jo.michell@uwe.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,16,16,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2017,68.0,2,,,SI,,354,377,,10.1111/meca.12149,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ER1IV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398544500006,0

Students with different cultural background differ in their concern for relative position in the classroom, which is modeled by reference-dependent preferences. We contrast competitive cultures, where students compare their performance with the best performance in class, and non-competitive cultures where the reference point is the average performance. Taking into account students with heterogeneous abilities, we show that the average performance in competitive cultures is maximized under comprehensive schooling and in non-competitive cultures under ability tracking. Segregation of abilities, however, always leads to a higher dispersion of performances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although Switzerland is a country belonging to the civil law family, many of its public companies have diffused corporate ownership, as do those in common law countries. This paper maintains that the Swiss exception relies on the complementarity between corporate ownership and policies addressing employment protection and innovation. The Swiss case presents two lessons. First, the current corporate governance is the result of a long and composite path in which politics plays a pivotal role; second, the institutional differences and similarities across countries, which one would try to explain along with the legal origin theory, can also emerge from politics-based accounts, such as those referring to policies on employment protection and innovation.","[Vatiero, Massimiliano] Univ Svizzera italiana, Law & Econ Brenno Galli Chair Econ Anal Law, Lugano, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Vatiero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera italiana, Law & Econ Brenno Galli Chair Econ Anal Law, Lugano, Switzerland.",vatierom@usi.ch,"Vatiero, Massimiliano/ABF-6606-2020; Vatiero, Massimiliano/C-3820-2013","Vatiero, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2886-9870;",Swiss National Science Foundation; Comparative Corporate Governance and Finance Program at Harvard Law School,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Comparative Corporate Governance and Finance Program at Harvard Law School,"Assistant professor of Law and Economics-Brenno Galli Chair of Economic Analysis of Law, Universita della Svizzera italiana, Lugano (Switzerland), email: vatierom@usi.ch.

When credit constraints are not binding, parents adopt a reinforcing intrahousehold investment strategy. When credit constraints are binding, the trade-off between the degree of parental aversion to inequality and the degree of complementarity between pre-natal endowments and family investments determines the parental strategy. The observed investment pattern of reinforcement or compensation does not necessarily reveal the underlying preference or technological parameters. Finally, we discuss empirical methods that may separately identify the preference and technological parameters and discuss the econometric challenges associated with these methods.

The theory extends the Becker Tomes model, introducing a production sector in which workers' human capital inputs are complements. In this setting the return to parental human capital investments is lower where skill complementarity is more intense, and this is reflected in less intergenerational persistence. We also show that education subsidies may be more desirable where skill complementarities are stronger, endogenously leading to a negative correlation between progressive public policy and IGE. Using microdata we construct location-specific measures of skill complementarity and document that patterns of geographic variation in IGE are consistent with this hypothesis. Geographic differences in skill complementarity directly account for roughly one fifth of cross-country variation in IGE, and possibly more if one allows for the indirect effect through government expenditure in public education.

Based on two waves of rich survey data for a sample of newly unemployed individuals in Germany, we perform a decomposition analysis including measures for reservation wages, detailed information on education, socio-demographics, labor market history, as well as personality traits. In order to address the potential endogeneity of reservation wages we exploit a generated instrumental variable strategy that relies on heteroscedasticity of the error terms. Our findings indicate that the gender wage gap becomes small and statistically insignificant once we control for reservation wages. Moreover, we perform a subgroup analysis that provides valuable insights about the importance of potentially unobserved characteristics that affect reservation wages and realized wages simultaneously. Reasons for differences in reservation wages could arise from productivity differences, the fact that women anticipate discrimination and different unobserved traits or preferences.

In this paper, we endogenize efficiency improvement in relation to the level of privatization. We show that in the short run, an improvement in efficiency associated with a state-owned firm reduces the output substitution among firms, and that the reduction in output substitution effect is proportional to the strength of the improvement in efficiency. Specifically, if the effect of efficiency improvement is sufficiently small, the magnitude of the improvement of social welfare is reduced. In the literature, the optimal policy in the long run is full nationalization. However, we argue that the optimal policy for a state-owned firm is partial privatization. Moreover, efficiency improvement provides the impetus for indirect entry regulation of private entrants.","[Chen, Tai-Liang] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Ave,East Lake High Tech Dev Zone, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Chen, TL (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, 182 Nanhu Ave,East Lake High Tech Dev Zone, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",tailiang.znuel@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,41,41,1,15,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

First, I find that the bulk of fluctuations in country-specific outputs, consumption, investments, and international relative prices can be attributed to country-specific neutral technology, investment-specific technology, and preference shocks. Second, my estimated model with economically meaningful shocks simultaneously accounts for the negative correlation between the real exchange rate and relative consumption and the negative correlation between the terms of trade and relative output. Last, through a marginal likelihood comparison exercise, I find that the success of the model depends on preferences with zero wealth effects; other frictions and alternative asset market structures play a less important role.","[Dey, Jaya] St Louis Univ, 220 Cook Hall, St Louis, MO 63103 USA",Saint Louis University,"Dey, J (通讯作者)，St Louis Univ, Dept Econ, 220 Cook Hall, St Louis, MO 63103 USA.",jdey2@slu.edu,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The different timings of county elections across states and the existence of a comparable group of cooperative banks-that are very similar to savings banks but lack their political connectedness-allow for identification of the effects of county elections on savings bank lending. These effects are economically meaningful and very robust to various specifications. We find that election-induced lending negatively impacts savings bank profitability and is associated with an increase in credit defaults roughly three years after an election. Examining the political-economy aspects of our findings, we provide evidence that savings bank excess lending and public spending at the county level are substitute levers for county politicians. Finally, we find indications that subpar pre-election economic county performance hurts re-election prospects and increases the intensity of lending cycles.","[Englmaier, Florian; Stowasser, Till] Univ Munich LMU, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Englmaier, F (通讯作者)，Univ Munich LMU, Munich, Germany.",englmaier@lmu.de; till.stowasser@econ.lmu.de,,,DFG [SFB/TR-15],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are grateful to the editor and three referees for excellent comments and suggestions.

It develops a growth model with human capital and incomplete insurance and credit markets that provides a closed-form solution for income inequality dynamics. We find that uninsured idiosyncratic risks are the most important determinants of inequality, growth and welfare. They are the source of nondegenerate wealth distribution. A lower weight of these shocks leads to lower steady-state inequality, higher growth and welfare. A redistribution of income that serves as social insurance against such risks increases welfare and decreases inequality. But, it also decreases growth by distorting individual consumption and saving decisions.","[Getachew, Yoseph Yilma] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Getachew, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.",yoseph.getachew@up.ac.za,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We analyse the determinants of the incidence of corruption as well as the tolerance of corruption. We used logit regressions that utilised data derived from Eurobarometer. The results strongly suggest gender, age, and education are important factors. We may say that anti-corruption policy ought to be targeted towards younger, less-educated, self-employed people with no children. On the other hand, a better-educated man in his early 30s seems to be a typical victim of corruption. The same is true for those having problems paying their expenses. Furthermore, contact with public officials appears to be one of the key issues, with Internet-based interactions with the government perhaps serving as the most effective solution to this problem. The rule of law, government effectiveness, and public accountability seem to be other factors that negatively correlate with the level of corruption within a country.","[Hunady, Jan] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Hunady, J (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",jan.hunady@umb.sk,"Hunady, Jan/B-9678-2019","Hunady, Jan/0000-0002-7075-2289",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-15-0322],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the Contract No. APVV-15-0322.

Second, the acquisition of this factor will distort the agent's choice of what activities to pursue. In contrast, when the factor and ability are substitutes, the agent will undervalue the factor.

By using the Two Stage Least Squares Instrumental Variable (2SLS-IV) estimator, it is found that a fall in rainfall-driven agricultural income leads to a decrease in per capita expenditure. The results show that the gender and the locality of the household head matter in the response of per capita expenditures to rainfall-driven agricultural income. Female-headed and rural households are more vulnerable to rainfall-driven agricultural income changes. The expenditure disaggregation indicates that female-headed households significantly reduce per capita non-food expenditure in times of rainfall-induced agricultural income decrease whilst the response of male-headed households focuses more on reducing per capita food and remittance expenditures.","[Akobeng, Eric] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Akobeng, E (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",ea211@leicester.ac.uk,,"Akobeng, Eric/0000-0003-2875-4018",Department of Economics of the University of Leicester,Department of Economics of the University of Leicester,"The author is grateful to Dr Jesse Matheson and Dr Barbara Roberts, for their invaluable contributions.

To explore how this empirical regularity affects moral hazard and investment, we develop an agency model with a firm size process having two features: the drift is controlled by the agent's effort and the principal's investment decision, and the volatility is proportional to the square root of size. The firm improves on production efficiency as it grows, and wages are back- loaded when size is small but front- loaded when it is large. Furthermore, there is underinvestment in a small firm but overinvestment in a large firm.","[Chi, Chang-Koo] Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Chi, Chang-Koo] Aalto Univ, Espoo, Finland; [Choi, Kyoung Jin] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Aalto University; University of Calgary,"Chi, CK (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.;Chi, CK (通讯作者)，Aalto Univ, Espoo, Finland.",chang-koo.chi@nhh.no; kjchoi@ucalgary.ca,"Chi, Chang-Koo/JXM-6428-2024",,,,,,39,8,11,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

The players' strategies are finitely additive probability measures, called charges. Since a strategy profile does not always induce a unique expected payoff, we distinguish two extreme attitudes of players. A player is viewed as pessimistic if he always evaluates the range of possible expected payoffs by the worst one, and a player is viewed as optimistic if he always evaluates it by the best one. This approach results in a definition of a pessimistic and an optimistic guarantee level for each player. We provide an extensive analysis of the relation between these guarantee levels, and connect them to the classical guarantee levels, and to other known techniques to define expected payoffs, based on computation of double integrals. In addition, we also examine existence of optimal strategies, with respect to these guarantee levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The equilibrium concept is consistent with rational expectations under certain conditions, while also permitting multiple, distinct, self-fulfilling equilibria, many of which are stable under least-squares learning. The equilibrium concept is applied to a Lucas-type monetary model and to a Fisherian monetary model with a Taylor rule. The existence of multiple equilibria is shown to depend on the aggressiveness of monetary policy in both models. In the latter, a more aggressive response to inflation is required in the Taylor rule than is typically found in this class of model to ensure a unique and learnable equilibrium. Real-time learning simulations with a constant gain illustrate some appealing properties of this approach including time-varying volatility and sharp movements in inflation, similar to actual data, while assuming only i.i.d. random shocks.","[Gibbs, Christopher G.] UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Gibbs, CG (通讯作者)，UNSW Australia, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",christopher.gibbs@unsw.edu.au,,"Gibbs, Christopher/0000-0003-3064-4969",,,,,53,6,7,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In 2013, 2,000 representatively chosen people were asked whether they have altered their consumption and saving behavior in response to the significant increase in public debt that occurred between 2008 and 2012. Our findings reveal notable deviations from RET. However, we cannot rule out that the majority of Germans behave 'partly' in a Ricardian manner. This could either indicate a large fraction of rule-of-thumb or impatient consumers in the economy, or a widely prevalent mix of partially Ricardian and partially non-Ricardian behavior. Moreover, using multinomial logit regressions, we find that individuals' consumption responses are significantly related to their economic situation, time preferences, education, and age.

We contribute to this literature by contrasting the evolution of cooperation in probabilistically and finitely repeated linear voluntary-contribution public-goods games (VCM). Consistent with past results, ceteris paribus, cooperation is found to increase in the marginal value of the public good. Additionally, as the number of decision sequences increases, there is a pronounced decrease in cooperation in the final round of finite sequences compared to those with a probabilistic end round. We do not, however, find consistent evidence that overall cooperation rates are affected by whether the number of decision rounds is finite or determined probabilistically. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using a new dataset on the hedging activities of 150 U.S. oil producers, we present empirical evidence that nonlinear hedging strategies are motivated by sensitivities of firm's investment expenditures and revenues to oil price fluctuations, and quantity-price correlation. We also find a non-monotonic relationship between the use of nonlinear hedges and financial constraints. Investment opportunities, production uncertainty, and changes in oil prices and volatilities also play a significant role in hedging strategy choice. Controlling for bias related to omitted variables and self-selection in the estimation of marginal treatment effects of hedging strategy choice, we find that oil producers with a higher propensity to use pure nonlinear hedging strategies tend to have higher marginal firm value.

Only ownership can be specified ex ante, so ex post efficiency requires reaching an agreement with the government. Besley and Ghatak (2001) argue that the party with the larger valuation should be the owner. We show that when transaction costs have to be incurred before the bargaining stage can be reached, ownership by the government can be optimal even when the NGO has a larger valuation. Our finding also contrasts with the standard private-good setup where the investing party (i.e., the NGO) should always be the owner. (C) 2017 The Authors.

All three sectors use the factors of capital, labor, and land as inputs. The constant-growth path (CGP), which is the trajectory along which the rental rate of capital remains constant, is used to reconcile the Kaldor and Kuznets facts, and plays a role in linking the wage rate and land rent in the three-factors model. Because the prices of agricultural goods and services are determined endogenously, the CGP condition is no longer the knife-edge condition. We find that the dynamic system along the CGP in the three-sector, three-factor model corresponds to the standard two-sector optimal growth model.","[Muro, Kazunobu] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Tokyo, Japan",,"Muro, K (通讯作者)，Meiji Gakuin Univ, Fac Dept Econ, Minato Ku, 1-2-37 Shirokanedai, Tokyo 1088636, Japan.",muro@eco.meijigakuin.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K21525] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,38,2,2,1,16,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In this context, the paper uses Mikami's (2010) model on consumer cooperatives to explain their emergence as a result of their ability to generate additional equity financing through the membership market. It focuses on the motivations of consumers to financially contribute to a cooperative by examining the risks and benefits associated with the investment. Based on a survey of 759 consumers, it links their motivations for joining a cooperative to different forms of risks and benefits associated with the investment. It shows that the risks related to cost sharing and switching costs are important determinants for consumers. Other factors that affected the likelihood of joining a cooperative were expected benefits with respect to user network externalities and infrastructure gains. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper carries out a systematic assessment on the sensitivity of Computable General Equilibrium models to technological and geographical scales in evaluating the economic impacts of carbon mitigation policies. In particular, we examine the impacts of sub-national details and technological. details of power generation on the estimate of carbon price and economic cost. Taking Italy as an example, we find that the estimation for carbon price and the economic cost of a de-carbonization pathway by means of a model with technological and regional details can be lower than a model without such details by up to 40%. Additionally, the effect of representing regional details appears to be far more important than the effect of representing the details of electricity technology in both the estimated carbon prices and the estimated economic impacts. Our results for Italy highlight the importance of modeling uncertainties of these two key assumptions, which should be appropriately acknowledged when applying CGE models for policy impact assessment. Our conclusions can be generalized to different countries and policy scenarios not in terms of absolute numbers but in terms of economic explanations. In particular, intra-national trade and the sub-national sectoral/technological specialization are important variables for understanding the economic dynamics behind these outcomes.

A simple, standard two country general equilibrium model shows that hedging of terms of trade movements and nonfinancial income risk produces non-trivial heterogeneity in portfolios across the wealth and income distribution within countries that is qualitatively in line with this evidence.","[Broer, Tobias] Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Broer, T (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",tobias.broer@iies.su.se,,,,,,,28,3,4,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

In such situations, socially responsible production is not a profit-maximizing strategy, even if the premium that consumers are willing to pay exceeds the costs. Only firms that are genuinely motivated by social responsibility would then produce in this way, and there would be too little socially responsible production. Improved opportunities for voluntary certification could potentially reduce this problem by allowing firms to signal their type. We examine how the possibility of certification affects the share of socially responsible production. Our main result is that increased certification may reduce the share of socially responsible production by reducing prices in the market for uncertified products and thus crowd out socially responsible producers who do not certify. This provide a mechanism through which certification might have adverse effects on socially responsible production, even when the certification process is perfect and when there is perfect competition among the producers.","[Cappelen, Alexander W.] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway; [Ognedal, Tone] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Oslo,"Cappelen, A (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Bergen, Norway.",alexander.cappelen@nhh.no,"CAPPELEN, ALEXANDER/AAY-1676-2021",,,,,,17,6,6,2,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

As individuals age and re-evaluate the benefits and costs of government programs, such as education, healthcare and old-age pensions, they also influence the level and composition of government spending. Using the Life in Transition Survey II for 34 countries of Europe and Central Asia, we find that older individuals are less likely to support hikes in government outlays on education and more likely to support increases in spending on pensions. These results are very similar across countries, and they do not change when using alternative model specifications, estimation methods and data sources. To our knowledge, this the first paper to provide evidence of the grey peril effect for a large group of developed, middle-income and low-income economies.

We use linked employer-employee data for the universe of private sector firms in Portugal, and exploit precrisis variation in financial vulnerability across industries for identification. We find that firms in more financially constrained industries hire a larger proportion of fixed-term workers with respect to permanent workers after the 2008-9 crisis, relative to less financially vulnerable firms. At the worker-level, workers hired by firms in industries that require significant external financing are more likely to be hired with a fixed-term contract after the crisis than comparable workers hired by other firms. Our results suggest that the crisis induced financially constrained firms to use the more flexible fixed-term contracts more intensively.","[Fernandes, Ana P.] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Ferreira, Priscila] Univ Minho, NIMA, Braga, Portugal",University of Exeter; Universidade do Minho,"Fernandes, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England.",a.p.o.fernandes@exeter.ac.uk; priscila@eeg.uminho.pt,"Ferreira, Priscila/I-2280-2019","Ferreira, Priscila/0000-0002-2847-4174; Fernandes, Ana/0000-0003-3296-6435","European Union European Regional Development Fund (FEDER, Portugal) [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-041505]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [EXPL/IIM-ECO/1207/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [EXPL/IIM-ECO/1207/2013] Funding Source: FCT","European Union European Regional Development Fund (FEDER, Portugal); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","We are grateful to two anonymous referees for valuable comments that contributed to improve our paper.

It undertakes an in-depth empirical investigation to quantify how much mercantilist and precautionary motives have contributed to the reserve build-up in China during 1998Q4-2011Q4. A substantial problem is that theory is consistent with employing two vastly differing approaches to defining and estimating the role of mercantilist reserve accumulation. A priori, either method could generate misleading results. The study shows, however, that the distinction between the two approaches is immaterial in China's case.

We apply Engle-Granger two-step procedure for cointegration test in panel setting which takes care of cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity across states. For panel Granger causality analysis, we employ Dumitrescu and Hurlin (Econ Model 29: 1450-1460, 2012) method and apply bootstrapping to account for cross-sectional dependence. We find robust evidence of cointegration between per capita income and credit per capita. Using panel FMOLS, we find that 1 % change in credit per capita results in 0.14 % change in per capita income. Panel Granger causality test reveals that there is bidirectional causality (feedback effects) in the absence of cross-sectional dependence. However, with cross-sectional dependence, we find evidence in favour of supply leading hypothesis. Probable policy implication calls for inclusive financial development and growth strategies in order to mitigate uneven income levels across states.","[Sharma, Rajesh; Bardhan, Samaresh] Indian Inst Technol Ropar, Rupnagar, Punjab, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Ropar,"Bardhan, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Ropar, Rupnagar, Punjab, India.",samaresh@iitrpr.ac.in,,,,,,,57,7,7,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

I estimate consumption changes using a randomized control trial in conjunction with a quasi-experiment. Households provided reports alone reduced summer season consumption by 7 percent. Price elasticity identified from cross-sectional and time series variation was estimated at 0.56. Against this benchmark, the impact of peer comparisons alone was equivalent to increasing tariffs by about 12.5 percent. Counter-intuitively, when weekly reports were augmented with monetary incentives rewarding electricity conservation, households no longer reduced consumption. Households receiving reports also show higher price elasticity relative to controls. These results provide new evidence identifying the response of developing country consumers to behavioral interventions while examining the interaction of prices, incentives and information.

We set up a real effort experiment, in which subjects enter data in four one-hour occasions and are paid a piece rate. From the second occasion onwards, we randomly assign half of the subjects to a treatment with higher piece rates, without the subjects being explicitly made aware of the random assignment into the two groups. At the end we ask subjects whether they want to donate a share of their earnings to a charity of their choice. We find that, despite large differences in earnings due to the different piece rates, subjects receiving the higher piece rate are actually less likely to give, and that givers in the two groups give the same share of their total earnings. Charities receive the same average donation from members of the two groups, indicating that charitable giving by subjects in this experiment does not increase with income. We discuss how these results can be explained by self-serving attribution bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We show that in addition to the factors that affect the real demand of household buyers and the development cost of property developers, investors' speculative behavior is an important factor explaining housing price evolution and dynamics. In particular, investors' extrapolative expectations may drive the housing price to persistently deviate from its benchmark value and even to explode. In contrast, investors' mean reverting strategy can balance out the position of trend extrapolators, which may stabilize an otherwise explosive housing market. Moreover, the evolutionary process of housing prices driven by investors' speculative behavior is path-dependent in the sense that different initial market conditions may result in different price paths, which corresponds to the localization property empirically documented in the real housing market. In addition, within the stylized model, we provide some policy implications through analyzing the limitation and effectiveness of policy adjustments via down payment and development cost, and find that the decrease of development cost is a better measure to adjust the housing market when it booms or busts.","[Zheng, Min] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Min; Wang, Shouyang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hefei] Renmin Univ China, Hanging Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chengzhang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Math & Stat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Renmin University of China; Central University of Finance & Economics","Zheng, M (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",mzheng@cufe.edu.cn; wanghefei@ruc.edu.cn; czwang@cufe.edu.cn; sywang@amss.ac.cn,"Z, Min/JZD-5679-2024; Wang, Hefei/GOE-3868-2022; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Wang, Shouyang/0000-0001-5773-998X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [11101449, 71571197, 71531012, 71271211]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9152016]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M561038]; Program for Innovation Research in CUFE",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Program for Innovation Research in CUFE,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (11101449, 71571197, 71531012, 71271211), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (9152016), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2014M561038) and the Program for Innovation Research in CUFE (2013, 2015).

However, it is difficult to assign a causal interpretation to these nonexperimental studies due to the presence of unobservable characteristics affecting violence and health outcomes simultaneously. The lack of credible instrumental variables applicable in several countries further limits our knowledge. I address this gap by using new partial identification methods to estimate the relative size of the unobservables needed to eliminate the estimated effects in nonexperimental studies. I also expand the external validity of the analysis by using data from five standardized nationally representative household surveys in Latin America. Consistent with previous studies, cross-sectional estimates show large negative associations between violence against women and an array of child health outcomes. However, when accounting for omitted variable bias, at best, two-thirds of the estimates remain robust and they are concentrated on the outcomes with the largest cross-sectional estimated impacts.","[Agueero, Jorge M.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,Unit 1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Agueero, Jorge M.] Univ Connecticut, El Inst, 365 Fairfield Way,Unit 1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Agüero, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,Unit 1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Agüero, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, El Inst, 365 Fairfield Way,Unit 1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",jorge.aguero@uconn.edu,,"Aguero, Jorge/0000-0003-2054-9634",,,,,10,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

To conduct the analysis, we estimate the augmented gravity model for the panel data of the exports of V-4 with the rest of the world by employing pseudoPoisson maximum likelihood estimator. Estimation results do not favour the creation of the ` hub-and-spokes' model, but rather demonstrate that integration within the EU was quite beneficial for V-4 without giving the origin neither to their peripherization nor to the loss of markets of the natural trade partners.","[Akhvlediani, Tinatin; Sledziewska, Katarzyna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Akhvlediani, T (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Ul Dluga 44-50, PL-00241 Warsaw, Poland.",takhvlediani@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Śledziewska, Katarzyna/ABF-8746-2020","Śledziewska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-0824-4582",National Science Centre of Poland [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/01040],"National Science Centre of Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work was supported by National Science Centre of Poland [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/01040].,,22,2,2,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

Using homogenous firm-level data for the largest EU Member States over the period 2007-2009, we test whether manufacturing firms receiving public subsidies spent more on R&D. The analysis is performed using both non-parametric techniques and parametric estimation methods accounting for the possible endogenous selectivity of R&D subsidies. The hypothesis of full crowding-out is rejected in all countries under exam as firms did not replace their own resources with public grants. However, these firms did not allocate additional funds to research and hence, differently from earlier works, we do not find evidence for additionality effects of R&D subsidies.

The analysis is carried out by employing a real option approach and by considering a set of firms that operate in various production sectors in the euro area. In particular, the revenues generated by the investment projects are modelled using a geometric Brownian motion, whereas the interest rate is specified as a stochastic process of Vasicek type. Moreover, using the volatility of the equity return as a proxy, the volatility of the revenues is calibrated to real firm data, while the parameters of the interest rate model are estimated by fitting the Euribor time series. To this aim, an ad hoc calibration procedure is developed which is based on the maximum likelihood principle and thus has the merit of being simple, fast and suitable for practical purposes. Our study reveals that the interest rate uncertainty reduces the valuation of investment projects. However, stochastic interest rates do not provide a substantial improvement with respect to constant interest rates, or at least the differences are not statistically significant.","[Ballestra, Luca Vincenzo] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat, Bologna, Italy; [Pacelli, Graziella] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ancona, Italy; [Radi, Davide] LIUC Univ Cattaneo, Sch Econ & Management, Castellanza, Italy",University of Bologna; Marche Polytechnic University; Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc,"Pacelli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Management, Ancona, Italy.",g.pacelli@univpm.it,"Ballestra, Luca Vincenzo/ABB-6093-2020; Radi, Davide/M-6403-2013; Radi, Davide/HHR-9023-2022","Ballestra, Luca Vincenzo/0000-0001-7205-6319; Radi, Davide/0000-0001-7809-1166; Pacelli, Graziella/0000-0001-8869-2504",,,,,31,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use panel data cointegration methods and control for spatial externalities linked to human and social capital. Our empirical results, robust to different specifications and additional control variables, show a significant direct effect of public R &D capital on productivity. No significant results are observed for private R & D capital. In contrast, the effect of patents is highly significant but proves to be small. Furthermore, Spain has greatly benefited from importing technology from leading countries. Spatial spillovers are crucial in explaining long-run productivity for the case of Spain. Human and social capital exert direct positive impacts, however, their effects are geographically bounded and negative spatial spillovers offset direct outcomes.

Manufacturing employment and the number of firms have been shrinking as a share of the total and in absolute levels. This paper uses a rich linked employer-employee dataset to examine this decline from 1994 to 2007. We propose a different approach to analyze deindustrialization and generate a series of novel stylized facts about the evolution. While most of the decline can be attributed to firm exit and reduced employment at surviving manufacturers, we document that a non-negligible portion is due to firms switching industries, from manufacturing to services. We focus on this last group of firms before, during, and after their sector switch. Overall this is a group of small, highly productive, import intensive firms that grow rapidly in terms of value-added and sales after they switch. By 2007, employment at these former manufacturers equals 8.7 percent of manufacturing employment, accounting for half the decline in manufacturing employment. We focus on the composition of the work-force as firms make their transition. In addition, we identify two types of switchers: one group resembles traditional wholesalers and another group that retains and expands their R&D and technical capabilities. Our findings emphasize that the focus on employment at manufacturing firms overstates the loss in manufacturing-related capabilities that are actually retained in many firms that switch industries.","[Bernard, Andrew B.] Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Dartmouth College; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research; Aarhus University,"Bernard, AB (通讯作者)，Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",,"Bernard, Andrew B/G-9809-2011",,,,,,31,39,47,3,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Using a spatial autoregressive model with inter-municipal group fixed effects, we show that spatial interactions among French municipalities are inflated by correlated effects that affect similarly municipalities that cooperate together. Removing these confounding effects leads to considerably smaller positive spatial interactions for tax decisions and even negative ones for capital expenditures. In addition, we observe a clear distinction between complementary choices on current budget items and substitutable choices on capital budget items.","[Breuille, Marie-Laure; Le Gallo, Julie] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, CESAER, AgroSup Dijon, Dijon, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon,"Breuillé, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, INRA, CESAER, AgroSup Dijon, Dijon, France.",marie.breuille@inra.fr,"Le Gallo, Julie/F-9167-2018","Le Gallo, Julie/0000-0002-7296-2415",,,,,49,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Worldwide, Alzheimer's constitutes a significant cost burden for health care budgets. The main cost drivers are the long-term stays of patients in institutions providing care and the opportunity costs of family caregivers. Many studies have proved that an early detection and a timely treatment of the disease are able to slow down its progression and reduce thus the life-long costs of the patients. In Czechia, no major effort to detect Alzheimer's early can be observed and a significant share of cases remain undiagnosed. Using the Monte Carlo simulation method, we estimate the costs if Alzheimer's started to be detected shortly after its onset. Subsequently, we compare these costs with the current situation in which the disease tends to be detected in its later stages.","[Broulikova, Hana Marie; Sladek, Vaclav; Arltova, Marketa; Cerny, Jakub] Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Broulíková, HM (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",xsmrh00@vse.cz; xslav20@vse.cz; marketa.arltova@vse.cz; xcerj129@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018; Broulikova, Hana M./GLT-1330-2022","Broulikova, Hana M./0000-0002-1662-3005; Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague [F4/38/2017]","Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague","Supported by the grant No. F4/38/2017 of the Internal Grant Agency of the University of Economics, Prague.",,13,1,1,1,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,215,224,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300021,0

Thanks to the establishment of the SME sector, unemployment in Poland was reduced, which allowed for the development of individual regions affecting the activation of the entire economy. In addition, the SME sector is an integral part of internal strength of the regions that determine its progress. Bearing in mind the arguments put forward it can be concluded that the SME sector is extremely compelling, both from a scientific as well as practical point of view. Because one of the tasks of undertaken considerations is to present the theoretical approach, and so the first part of the study is the presentation of the SME sector.

Besides the traditional sources considered by the literature, I include age-specific factors: a labor utilization index that accounts for the hours that employed youth work by showing the extent of part-time contracts; an age mix factor that indicates the share that youth comprise of total employment and, finally, changes in the inverse of the overall sectoral labor productivity, which describes variations in total labor demand. By applying this approach, I identify the core drivers behind the recent changes in the evolution of youth employment in each of the 15 countries; this is crucial for tailoring policy strategies. Results suggest that to foster youth employment, most Mediterranean countries should implement youth-specific measures while other EU15 countries could do so by enhancing overall employment.","[Carrascal Incera, Andre] Univ Santiago Compostela, GAME IDEGA, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Carrascal Incera, Andre] Univ Santiago Compostela, Dept Fundamentals Econ Anal, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Incera, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Compostela, GAME IDEGA, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.;Incera, AC (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Compostela, Dept Fundamentals Econ Anal, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",andre.carrascal@usc.es,"Carrascal Incera, Andre/AAT-8682-2020","Carrascal Incera, Andre/0000-0001-9762-1636","Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria, Xunta de Galicia [I2C/2014]","Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria, Xunta de Galicia","This work was supported by the Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria, Xunta de Galicia [Grant Plan I2C/2014].",,31,8,8,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Using naturally occurring field data, we find that lenders who join teams contribute 1.2 more loans ($30-$42) per month than those who do not. To further explore factors that differentiate successful teams from dormant ones, we run a large scale randomized field experiment (n = 22,233) by posting forum messages. Compared to the control, we find that lenders make significantly more loans when exposed to a goal-setting and coordination message, whereas goal-setting alone significantly increases lending activities of previously inactive teams. Our findings suggest that goal-setting and coordination are effective mechanisms to increase pro-social behavior in teams. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To address endogeneity, we exploit the variations in the director-age populations across the states in the US. We argue that firms with access to a larger pool of potential directors tend to have larger boards. Consistent with this notion, our empirical results show that firms located where the size of the director-age population is larger have significantly larger board size. Because the director-age population represents broad demographic trends outside of any firm's control, it is unlikely related to firm outcomes or policies and should be exogenous. Using the director-age population as our instrument, we estimate the effects of board size on firm value and profitability. Our approach is less vulnerable to endogeneity and is more likely to show a causal effect.","[Chintrakarn, Pandej] Mahidol Univ Int Coll MUIC, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Jiraporn, Pornsit] Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA; [Tong, Shenghui] China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Proctor, Richard M.] Siena Coll, Albany, NY USA",Mahidol University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA.",pxj11@psu.edu,,,,,,,5,5,6,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We find various results. First, the Service was pioneering in its collection and interpretation of British economic data. It was aided in this by the involvement of a host of noted economists from London and Cambridge. That this collaboration took place at all goes against the traditional view that these two institutions were always at loggerheads during the 1920s and 1930s. Second, the Service carried out important theoretical work in many areas, the focus here being on the construction of indices of industrial production.

These numbers are used to compare living standards across countries, by academics in studies of economic growth, particularly through. the Penn World Table, by the World Bank to construct measures of global poverty, by the European Union to redistribute resources, and by the international development community to draw attention to discrepancies between rich and poor countries. The International Comparison Program (ICP) collects the detailed prices on which these indexes are based on an irregular basis. In 2014, the ICP published PPPs from the 2011 round that are sharply different from those that were expected from extrapolation of the previous round, ICP 2005. These discrepancies will eventually have important implications for the Penn World Table, and for international comparisons of living standards given that the PPPs are used to convert countries' national accounts-GDP and consumption, for example from local currency to common, currency units (international dollars.) The world according to ICP 2011 looks markedly more equal than the world according to ICP 2005. This paper investigates why this happened. We identify a likely source of the problem in the way that the regions of the ICP were linked in 2005. We use two different methods for measuring the size of the effect. Both suggest that the 2005 PPPs for consumption for countries in Asia (excluding Japan), Western Asia, and Africa were overstated relative to the United States by between 18 to 26 percent. Per capita consumption in international dollars of these countries was therefore too low in 2005 and more likely to be accurately estimated in 2011.","[Deaton, Angus] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Dept Econ, Room 127,20 Washington Rd, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Aten, Bettina] 2332 Don Onofre Trail NW, Albuquerque, NM 87107 USA",Princeton University,"Deaton, A (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Dept Econ, Room 127,20 Washington Rd, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",deaton@princeton.edu; bettina.aten@bea.gov,,,,,,,27,32,36,0,16,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

Based on a representative survey of firms operating in Ukraine, an endemically corrupt environment, the authors explore some mechanisms for building trust. The study outcomes suggest positive correlations between the perception of corruption and trust among firms (especially through such mechanisms as using patronage at all levels, inviting business partners to restaurants or parties, and introducing business partners to family and friends), while other mechanisms (such as showing expertise in the field, developing communication competencies, and using notaries and lawyers to secure contracts) demonstrate no significant links. Moreover, the results demonstrate that foreign ownership might influence corruption and trust among firms. From a policy perspective, the authors recommend more work on understanding why firms engage in specific corrupt practices and less on destroying their informal relationships. International exposure might be an additional tool for mitigating corruption in Ukraine.","[Denisova-Schmidt, Elena] Univ St Gallen, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Prytula, Yaroslav] Ukrainian Catholic Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Business, Lvov, Ukraine",University of St Gallen; Ukrainian Catholic University,"Denisova-Schmidt, E (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen HSG, Gatterstr 3, CH-9010 St Gallen, Switzerland.",elena.denisova-schmidt@unisg.ch,"Denisova-Schmidt, Elena/R-8957-2016","Denisova-Schmidt, Elena/0000-0001-8234-4437; Prytula, Yaroslav/0000-0003-1791-5832",Center for Governance and Culture in Europe at the University of St. Gallen,Center for Governance and Culture in Europe at the University of St. Gallen,This study was conducted with financial support from the Center for Governance and Culture in Europe at the University of St. Gallen.

Real estate loans had an adverse effect on US bank profitability during the financial crisis and no effect after the crisis but consistently improved the profitability of Chinese banks. Interest margins have no effect on US bank profitability but a consistently positive effect on Chinese banks, confirming that China is a traditional bank-based economy. Interbank loans have a positive and significant effect on Chinese bank profitability, while interbank domestic loans have a negative effect on US bank profitability.

The K+S models embed the Schumpeterian growth paradigm into a complex system of imperfect coordination among heterogeneous interacting firms and banks, where Keynesian (demand-related) and Minskian (credit cycle) elements feed back into the meso and macro dynamics. The model is able to endogenously generate long-run growth together with business cycles and major crises. Moreover, it reproduces a long list of macroeconomic and microeconomic stylized facts.

There are two types of assessment error: undervaluation and overvaluation. In overvaluation, agents will not correct the assessment because their wages would then decrease. Although agents will want their undervaluation corrected, principals will not correct the error due to increased wage cost. Hence, correcting errors is complicated. However, this type of selfish behavior by agents and principals produces feelings of guilt, particularly when others trust them. In this situation, a high incentive is desirable for conscientious people with a strong sense of guilt or for nonconscientious people who do not feel guilt, but it is undesirable for intermediate-type people who are conscientious only to a certain extent.

We show, by means of examples, that a sovereign's creditworthiness is not necessarily limited by the ability to repay out of its future resources. Self-enforcing debt grows at the same rate as interest rates. If a sovereign's endowment growth rates are lower than interest rates, then debt limits eventually exceed the natural debt limits. This implies that there is asymptotic borrowing in present value terms. We show that this can be compatible with lending incentives when credible borrowers facilitate inter-temporal exchange, acting as pass-through intermediaries that alleviate the lenders' credit restrictions.

We study the nature of these spillovers in an observational learning game where two groups interact via a common player, and where conventions emerge when players follow the decisions of the members of their own groups rather than their own private information. We show that: (i) if a convention develops in one group but not the other group, then the convention spills over via the common player; (ii) when conventions disagree, then the common player's decision breaks the convention in one group; and (iii) when no convention has developed, then the common player's decision triggers the same convention in both groups.

The model breaks down the CPI into different components based on their price-formation mechanisms. The basic breakdown defines three components: PFLEX (fruits and vegetables, 3.6% of the basket), PREGUL (prices regulated by the government, 20.1% of the basket) and PFIX (the rest of goods and services, 76.3% of the basket). PFIX is the focus of the econometric analysis while PFLEX and PREGUL are considered exogenous. The explanatory variables are the monthly rates of: the price of bovine cattle at the domestic market, the international soy price, the price by ton of imported intermediate goods, the nominal exchange rate, the average wage of workers that are registered in Social Security and the productivity, measured by the GDP by employed worker. There was an informal indexation mechanism in the labor market. Average monthly wages rose at annual rates that were almost always higher than the sum of past annual inflation plus the annual increase in productivity. The over-indexation of the unit labor cost was the main inflationary factor in the period. The inertial component, represented in the model by the previous monthly rate, determines 60% of the current rate.","[Frenkel, Roberto] CEDES, Igis, Switzerland; [Frenkel, Roberto] Buenos Aires Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Friedheim, Diego] CEDES, Young Researchers Training Program, Igis, Switzerland",University of Buenos Aires,"Frenkel, R (通讯作者)，CEDES, Igis, Switzerland.;Frenkel, R (通讯作者)，Buenos Aires Univ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,,Ford Foundation,Ford Foundation,"The authors would like to thank Ford Foundation for its support and Gabriel Palazzo, Lorenzo Sigaut Gravina, Constanza Abuin and Pablo Carrera Mayer for their collaboration.",,6,3,4,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Our model has a two-stage decision process. In the first stage, an independent power producer (IPP) builds its optimal capacity, conditional on its perceived uncertainties in fuel cost and electricity demand. In the second stage, equilibrium prices and quantities are determined by IPPs competing in a Cournot market. Under the empirically reasonable assumption that per MWh fuel costs are log-normally distributed, we find that a profit-maximizing IPP increases its capacity in response to rising fuel cost volatility. Consequently, the expected profit of the IPP and expected consumer surplus increase with volatility, rejecting the hypothesis that rising fuel cost uncertainty tends to adversely affect producers and consumers. Expected consumer surplus further increases if the IPP hedges the fuel cost risk. However, the IPP's optimal strategy is not to do so. The policy implication of these results is that the government should not intervene to reduce the price volatility of a well functioning spot market for natural gas, chiefly because such intervention can have the unintended consequence of discouraging generation investment, raising electricity prices, and harming consumers.

We examine the role of maintenance expenditures on output and on the distribution of wealth in a heterogeneous agents model. In our model, maintenance affects the quality of existing infrastructure and thus the flow of services derived from it. Furthermore, maintenance expenditures also affect the depreciation rates of both public infrastructure and private capital. We calibrate our model to Mexico and consider several policies that increase the flow of resources to infrastructure and find that a policy that allocates all additional resources to new investment is dominated by policies that allocate at least some of the additional resources to maintenance. Specifically, focusing all additional resources on maintenance is shown to generate the largest reduction in inequality, while a more balanced policy that increases both investment and maintenance maximizes output growth.

We find that banks on average tend to have higher profitability, lower risk and lower efficiency after the reforms, and the results are robust with our difference-in-difference approach. Our results also show that the Big 5 state-owned banks (SOCB) underperform banks with other types of ownership when risk is measured by non-performing loans (NPLs) over the entire study period but tend to have fewer NPLs than other banks during the post-reform period. Our results provide some supporting evidence on the ongoing banking reforms in China, suggesting that attracting strategic foreign investors and listing SOCBs on stock exchanges appear to be effective ways to help SOCBs deal with the problem of NPLs and manage their risk.","[He, Liangliang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lei] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Liu, Frank Hong] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow,"Liu, FH (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Room 471,Gilbert Scott Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Hong.Liu@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is shown that the suggested methodology provides qualitative conclusions supporting effective marketing decisions. The study points out the option of using the balanced scorecard as a database for further analysis that can be carried out to identify the factors that influence the level of customer satisfaction and sales. The information base for the case study is comprised of internal documents of an industrial enterprise. Discriminant analysis and one-way ANOVA test are used to identify the factors that determine customer satisfaction level and its relation with the share of clients in total sales.

To be more specific, we examine the signalling effects for the detection of speculative stocks in relation to the degree of their prior IPOs underpricing. We also employ the market-feedback hypothesis to investigate this signalling process. Our results reveal a significant positive relationship between the magnitudes of the IPO underpricing and the probability of an IPO firm being classified officially as speculative on the TOL. Furthermore, we find that a 6-month abnormal return after going public increases the probability of speculative dealing in the IPOs. Next, we consider all listed firms in the Thai stock market and highlight the role of both abnormal return and trading volume in the transmission of probability for appearing on the TOL. In addition, we find that IPOs and non-dividend paying companies further increase the risk of being on the TOL.","[Komenkul, Kulabutr] Rangsit Univ, Dept Finance & Investment, Fac Business Adm, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Sherif, Mohamed; Xu, Bing] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Rangsit University; Heriot Watt University,"Xu, B (通讯作者)，Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",b.xu@hw.ac.uk,"Sherif, Mohamed/AAM-3888-2020; Sherif, Mohamed/O-7980-2018","Sherif, Mohamed/0000-0002-8670-672X; Xu, Bing/0000-0001-8779-0823; Komenkul, Kulabutr/0000-0002-0790-6257",,,,,42,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper contributes to the scant empirical evidence on the speed, sources and direction of technical change for various sectors and production factors. Assuming cost-minimization behavior, a CES framework is used to derive a system of equations that is estimated by a GMM system estimator. The estimated factor-augmenting technology parameters show that in most sectors, technical change was labor-augmenting and labor-saving. Statistically significant effects of manufacturing and services R&D were found on factor-augmenting technical change (with the highest R&D elasticities found in the high-tech manufacturing and transport, storage and communication sectors). Whereas in-house' R&D stimulates total factor productivity, R&D spilled over to other sectors has a capital-augmenting effect accompanied by a higher use of labor.

We found that category reporting significantly increased average donations relative to no reporting, and that this superiority was due to the dual presence of the category setting and the public reporting. The category setting anchors donations toward the category threshold and increased the average donations when the threshold was modestly set. The public reporting, on the other hand, only worked at the highest category level. It further increased the donations by providing extra social-image benefits.

While existing research has attempted to evaluate these trajectories as outcomes of elite politics or ideological incommensurability, an overlooked but no less important aspect is the connections between these trajectories, Mao-era regulatory policies and the post-1978 system of reciprocal accountability.

After these results were obtained, real values of Slovakia are compared to GMM EU-26 trend. The results of GMM estimation include a threshold value of fiscal decentralization, revealing the point at which a positive relation between fiscal decentralization and economic growth turns into negative. GMM estimation of the EU-26 countries sample confirms the inverted U-shaped relationship in case of revenue and tax decentralization. Expenditure decentralization seems to be insignificant.

Accordingly, international migration flows are explained with various socio-economic determinants which address different sources of migration, reinforced by the best-known theories and conceptual frameworks. A panel data analysis is performed at the level of rich and poor countries of the European Union to measure migration flows from the year 2000 until 2013. The results provide evidence indicating that there are some structural similarities and discrepancies between European rich and poor countries. These similarities (or discrepancies) make them responding similarly to certain economic conditions and changes. Thus, the association of earnings, inequalities (measured by the Gini Index) and poverty line could be positive or negative depending on wealth level of countries. Moreover, unemployment is a supply-push factor, but its importance is much higher in rich countries, diminishing in poorer countries. Economic freedom has a very strong positive effect on migration for all countries, but its relevance turned out to be the highest in the group of the poorest countries. Also, the association between Foreign Direct Investment and migration is negative, but it is more significant in the case of poorer countries.","[Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio; Cuenca-Garcia, Eduardo] Granada Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Int & Spanish Econ, Campus Cartuja, Granada 18071, Spain; [Kumpikaite-Valiuniene, Vilmante] Kauno Technol Univ, Ekon Vadybos Fak, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Management, Gedimino G 50-401, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Granada; Kaunas University of Technology,"Mihi-Ramírez, A (通讯作者)，Granada Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Int & Spanish Econ, Campus Cartuja, Granada 18071, Spain.",amihi@ugr.es,"Kumpikaitė-Valiūnienė, Vilmantė/D-3736-2016; , Eduardo/HIK-2340-2022; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906; Cuenca-Garcia, Eduardo/0000-0001-9976-8930; Kumpikaite-Valiuniene, Vilmante/0000-0002-8099-2737",,,,,60,11,11,1,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

We build on previous experimental studies of this well-known commitment problem by introducing communication. Allowing the upstream firm to chat privately with each downstream firm reduces total offered quantity from near the Cournot level (observed in the absence of communication) halfway toward the monopoly level. Allowing all firms to chat together openly results in complete monopolization. Downstream firms obtain such a bargaining advantage from open communication that all of the gains from monopolizing the market accrue to them. A simple structural model of Nash-in-Nash bargaining fits the pattern of shifting surpluses well. Using third-party coders, unsupervised text mining, among other approaches, we uncover features of the rich chat data that are correlated with market outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of the antitrust implications of open communication in vertical markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Second-moment statistical discrimination occurs when risk-averse managers make decisions regarding wage and hiring based on productivity variances. We provide a framework exploring managers' discrimination based on differences in average productivity and in variance of productivity. Furthermore, since discrimination is composed of two types (wage and hiring discrimination), our model allows for the interdependence between hiring practices and wages. Using our model, we examine the effects of various anti-discrimination policies along with changes to the labour market structure. We show that managers' behaviour may be driven by anti-discrimination policies and labour market structures. A firm reduces hiring when required to implement anti-discrimination policies to address wage inequality. A firm applying policies to promote employment equity must stimulate minority participation. A change in labour market structure does not alter the efficiency of policies promoting employment equity, but it does alter the efficiency of policies aimed at reducing wage differences.","[Picault, Julien] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Econ, 3333 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia Okanagan,"Picault, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Dept Econ, 3333 Univ Way, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",julien.picault@ubc.ca,"Picault, Julien/ABI-0076-2022","Picault, Julien/0000-0002-5726-2998",foundation Roger Charbonneau; CIRPEE; HEC Montreal,foundation Roger Charbonneau; CIRPEE; HEC Montreal,"I would like to thank Robert Clark and Nicolas Sahuguet for their numerous helpful suggestions, Faithe Picault and the anonymous referees for the constructive input, thank the departments of economics at the University of Western Ontario and HEC Montreal for hospitality and the excellent research conditions, and gratefully acknowledge financial support from foundation Roger Charbonneau, CIRPEE, and HEC Montreal.",,29,0,0,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Many researchers point to this very crisis of family as the main reason for depopulation. Since all scenarios of official demographic forecasts envisage declining fertility, the study of the possible manifestations of the crisis of the family institution appears pertinent and is the subject of this research. Our paper presents the results of time series analysis of demographic indicators that are commonly associated with the manifestation of the crisis of family. We modelled the trends and described the specifics of the dynamics of these indicators. The results showed that certain indicators that characterise negative changes in the institution of family fell in the 2000s. Other indicators during this period either did not have a clear trend or did not show an unambiguous growth trend. Some indicators did not reveal a negative trend even in the long run. We conclude that as of today, there is no manifestation of the crisis of the social institution of family in Russia at the behavioural level. Evidently, the negative demographic trend forecast for Russia in the long run could be related to other factors.","[Shmarova, Irina; Shubat, Oksana] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shmarova, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",i.v.shmarova@urfu.ru; o.m.shubat@urfu.ru,"Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144","Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02, A03.21.0006]",Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation,"The work was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract No 02.A03.21.0006.",,13,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1400,1408,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300140,0

Financial accounting literature highlights the importance of non-financial factors. Therefore, it is important for organizations to rely more on non-financial criteria than on financial factors to achieve higher competitive advantage. Identifying the most important non-financial factors that affect corporate performance and their relationship with capital structures (CS) is the main issue in today's dynamic conditions. This research examines the relationship between non-financial factors of IC and PEU and evaluates their influence on CS directly or indirectly by considering the mediation effects of corporate performance. Questionnaires were distributed to 339 public listed Iranian manufacturing companies selected based on census data. Data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The main findings of this study are as follows: IC can enhance corporate performance, PEU is positively linked to corporate performance, and corporate performance is positively linked to capital structure. The results also indicated a full mediation effect of corporate performance in the relationship between PEU and capital structure. Also, we analyze intellectual capital relation with 1) traditional vs. secular-rational values and with 2) survival vs. self-expression values. In order to determine the most efficient versions of intellectual capital, an Intellectual Capital Multiple Criteria Decision Support (ICMCDS) system was developed, consisting of a database, database management system, model-base, model-base management system, and user interface. This study contributes to determining capital structure decision making by considering IC and PEU in the context of companies in Iran. Further in-depth research is needed to examine the links between non-financial factors and capital structure with different measurement and perspectives to develop a deeper understanding of their effect on capital structure.","[Soheilirad, Somayeh; Sofian, Saudah; Mardani, Abbas; Darvishvand, Jafargholi Mohammadi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Skudai 81300, Johor, Malaysia; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kaklauskas, Arturas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Econ & Property Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Soheilirad, S (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Skudai 81300, Johor, Malaysia.",s_soheilirad@yahoo.com; saudah@utm.my; mabbas3@live.utm.my; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; arturas.kaklauskas@vgtu.lt; julianah@utm.my,"Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Kaklauskas, Artūras/AAC-4058-2019","Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X;",,,,,67,3,3,3,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Getting knowledge about significant determinants of non-profit sector is important both for policy makers and the founders of non-profit organizations in their strategic decision making. The results are based on panel data regression in the long-term period 2000-2014. The Visegrad Group was investigated because it is a cultural and political alliance of four Central European states. Selected indicators represent supply-and demand-side theory of non-profit sustainability. The results show that GDP per capita is the significant determinant of the non-profit sector in the country with no tax assignation. The different systems of care for the elderly have an impact on the determinants of the size of the non-profit sector serving households (old-age dependency ratio, life expectation index). The government failure theory was established only in the Czech Republic where obvious competition between non-profit sector and health care system exists. In most Visegrad countries non-profit organizations help governmental sector to cope with increasing number of refugees in need, which supports the interdependence theory.","[Spicka, Jindrich; Arltova, Marketa; Boukal, Petr; Smrcka, Lubos] Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Spicka, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jindrich.spicka@vse.cz; marketa.arltova@vse.cz; petr.boukal@vse.cz; lubos.smrcka@vse.cz,"Arltová, Markéta/P-4315-2018; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013; Smrcka, Lubos/AFV-1635-2022","Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544; Smrcka, Lubos/0000-0003-4966-2171; Arltova, Marketa/0000-0001-7313-6927",Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097 DYME]; [VSE IP309067],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic);,"This work was supported by the institutional support for long-term conceptual development of the research organization University of Economics, Prague (project Best practice in non-governmental organizations, VSE IP309067) and by the Czech Science Foundation Project No. P402/12/G097 DYME - Dynamic Models in Economics.",,37,1,1,1,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The VIX index and oil prices are the most important factors, followed by the Fitch credit rating changes and TED spread. There is evidence for the piggyback effect by S&P whose credit rating changes are driven by Fitch Ratings and Moody's decisions. Among macroeconomic fundamentals only exchange rate dynamics and foreign reserves appear significant. The importance of the fundamentals further decreases when Granger (no) causality tests are conducted.

Values of the first two principal components are utilized in evaluation of conditional probability. The resulting probability tables can help to detect buying signals for profitable trade opportunities or can provide a warning against a high financial loss. A time period of two weeks before an actual buying signal is analyzed. After one week of holding, the share is sold and the resultant relative price differences determine the group of profitability (high profit, profit, loss, high loss). For each group, tables of occurrences and conditional probabilities are evaluated using the PCA method.

Previous studies analysed the trade interdependency among various countries, but few studies have highlighted the quantitative evidence of production relationships. Thus, this study utilizes motherboard shipment volumes to predict the competitive relationships of industrial production on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Specifically, this work uses simultaneous non-linear least square regression in combination with GAs for numerical parameter optimization of the proposed Lotka-Volterra model. The results of parameter estimation reveal that shipment growth in China substantially promotes that in Taiwan, whereas the shipment growth in Taiwan curtails that in China. The standard deviation of the estimated parameters from the 3000 iterated simulations is small, confirming the reliability and stability of our parameter estimations. According to equilibrium analysis, the results of Lyapunov function prove that the shipments of China and Taiwan will reach a stable long-term equilibrium. The potential production from China will ultimately be nearly 16 times as large as that from Taiwan. Finally, the analytical results of forecast accuracy confirm that Lotka-Volterra model performs better than conventional S-curve diffusion model in predicting motherboard shipments.","[Tsai, Bi-Huei] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Management Sci, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Tsai, BH (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Management Sci, 1001 Ta Hsueh Rd, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan.",bhtsai@faculty.nctu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China [MOST 104-2410-H-009-005-MY2],"Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The Author would like to thank Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of China, for partially supporting this research under Contract No. MOST 104-2410-H-009-005-MY2.

I use smooth-transition vector-autoregression (ST-VAR) to examine the regime-dependent effect of uncertainty shocks, and a counterfactual decomposition to isolate the role of confidence when the economy is in different regimes, recessions and non-recessions. I find that shutting down the confidence channel leads to greatly dampened and less persistent effects of uncertainty shocks, especially during recessions.

We introduce inequality-averse and inefficiency-averse agents and model their conflict in ideology, triggered by envy. The socioeconomic dynamics generate a pendulum-like switch from markets to a centrally planned economy abolishing private ownership, and back to restoring market incentives.

While some kinds of inequality, caused by differential rewards to effort, might be associated with faster economic growth, other kinds, arising from unequal opportunities for investment, might be detrimental to economic progress. This study uses two new datasets, consisting of 117 income and expenditure household surveys and 134 Demographic and Health Surveys, to revisit the relationship between total inequality and economic growth. In particular, we ask whether inequality of opportunity, driven by circumstances at birth, has a negative effect on subsequent growth. Using the income and expenditure micro dataset, we find that while both total income inequality and inequality of opportunity are negatively associated with growth, the coefficient estimates are insignificant. The evidence is similarly equivocal using the Demographic and Health Surveys data. On balance, the data do not provide support for the hypothesis that inequality of opportunity is bad for growth.","[Ferreira, Francisco H.

How does competition shape it? How does it shape competition? To address these questions, we develop a model where each firm can freely commit to any observable degree of search obfuscation, which pins down the time cost of searching its product. Consumers have limited time for browsing around websites. This endogenizes consumer information and competition intensity and gives clear predictions about market welfare and surplus division. We find that competition for prominence and the fear of frustrating consumers keeps the negative welfare effects of obfuscation low. However, because obfuscation reduces price awareness and differentiation relaxes price competition, the obfuscation choices in the unique equilibrium are persistently positive and different.

To this end, we consider two integrated firms and one non-integrated retailer that compete in a horizontally differentiated retail market. The non-integrated firm relies on wholesale access provided by one of the integrated firms. Throughout several model variants we find that margin squeeze regulation lowers consumers' surplus. In reverse, firms are likely to benefit from margin squeeze regulation, because it leads to higher retail prices or facilitates tacit collusion. From a total welfare perspective, margin squeeze regulation is only beneficial if it prevents foreclosure of the retailer, but even then, this is due to increased industry profits and at the expense of consumers' surplus. These results question current European policy initiatives to augment the role of ex ante margin squeeze tests in sector-specific regulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These population groups, originating mainly from western Europe and secondly from North America, want to share their yearly stay between their home country and one or several desirable places for a long term; this phenomenon was called 'residential tourism'. Also, during the 1990s and after, a new movement of foreigners began to take place in Greece; a large number of economic migrants came in the beginning from the countries of the previous eastern socialist Europe and after from Asian and African war zones, aiming to find work in hard conditions. As an outcome, the insular space of the Aegean Sea and especially the Cyclades complex received a significant part of this double migratory flow.

The objective of this work is to determine the impact of technological innovations in the short and long term. In all the developed countries, the unemployed are rather low-skilled whereas highly skilled employees face less unemployment problems. Several studies have shown that technical progress leads to the casualization of non-skilled labor and to unemployment. This idea is based on the substitution of capital at work. Moreover, technical progress requires a skilled workforce capable of creating, innovating, and controlling further progress. Thus, technological innovations are not neutral; there are skill-biased technological changes. However, according to the theory of compensation, technological innovations reduce short-term employment (replacement effect) but create it in the medium and long term (compensation effect). The empirical validation of this work is based on the technique of structural VECM for the case of Tunisia. Unlike the theory of compensation, our results support the fact that the short-term effect of technological innovations on employment is positive; however, in the medium and long term, it is negative.","[Mnif, Sirine; Feki, Chiraz; Abdelkafi, Ines] Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Dept Econ, Rd Airport Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax,"Mnif, S (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Management Sfax, Dept Econ, Rd Airport Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",mnifsirine@hotmail.fr; fekichiraz@yahoo.fr; Inesabdelkafi@yahoo.fr,"ABDELKAFI, Ines/GZA-6483-2022",,,,,,57,3,3,7,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

These outcomes are compared to those which result from the behavior of selfish agents. A variant of Fehr-Schmidt preferences is employed that allows the externality from agents who are ahead to differ in magnitude from the externality from those who are behind in the income distribution. We find first, that inequality-averse preferences yield distributional outcomes that are analogous to tax-transfer schemes with selfish agents, and may either increase or decrease average consumption. Second, in a society of inequality-averse agents, a linear income tax can be welfare-enhancing. Third, inequality-averse preferences can lead to less redistribution at any given tax, with low-wage agents receiving smaller net subsidies and/or high-wage individuals paying less in net taxes.

Considering the important role played by Italy in this industry, this paper aims at providing a measure of the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry at regional level, focusing on positioning of Piedmont, a manufacturing vocation region. Despite the important role played by Italian manufacturing, literature concerning the creation of a synthetic regional index of this type of competitiveness is practically nonexistent. The paper bridges this gap throughout the development of a global index of regional competitiveness of the manufacturing industry. Methodology consists in a systematic analysis of drivers supported by literature at the base of the competitiveness of the regional manufacturing industry and in the validation of results by means of three focus groups composed of 30 stakeholders belonging to different organizations in two phases (Delphi method). Results show a system of measure based on eight competitive drivers, and its application to the Italian and Piedmont system highlights a strong heterogeneity among regions; this shows how Italian manufacturing industry depends on a few highly competitive regional systems and emphasizes the first position of Piedmont in this field. The creation of a ranking of the Italian regional systems on the base of the competitiveness of their manufacturing industry allows to draw important developing strategies. Main limits of this research involve the level of exhaustiveness of drivers and indices, chosen throughout criteria of relevance, transferability, and accessibility.","[Vrontis, Demetris] Univ Nicosia, Sch Business, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Tardivo, Giuseppe; Bresciani, Stefano; Viassone, Milena] Univ Turin, Dept Management, 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy",University of Nicosia; University of Turin,"Viassone, M (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Management, 218 Bis, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",vrontis.d@unic.ac.cy; giuseppe.tardivo@unito.it; stefano.bresciani@unito.it; milena.viassone@unito.it,"Bresciani, Stefano/U-2802-2019; Vrontis, Demetris/AAI-3458-2021","Bresciani, Stefano/0000-0003-0321-9174; Vrontis, Prof. Demetris/0000-0001-7570-6241",,,,,82,11,12,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

From a policy perspective, the estimation of the structural shocks allows us to simulate a counterfactual scenario, whereby we conclude that the effects of less rigid labour market are positive and significant.

Relatively less attention has been paid to the impact that financial development of a country can have on important development outcomes like transparency. As established by existing research, strong financial institutions in a country would imply an improved and transparent banking system, better corporate governance, ease of accessing credit, greater availability of information and best practices in investment protection. All these should theoretically promise a more transparent economic system. Our empirical findings confirm this.

Participants state their willingness-to-pay for both a fair trade and a conventional chocolate bar in private or publicly. A standard model of social image predicts that all participants increase their fair trade premium when facing an audience. We find that the premium is indeed higher in public than in private. This effect, however, is driven by participants who preferred a conventional chocolate bar over a fair trade one in a pre-lab choice. For those who chose the fair trade chocolate bar, public exposure does not change the fair trade premium. This is captured by a generalized model where intrinsic preferences and the concern for social approval are negatively correlated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Hold-up concerns have led to ancillary good regulations, such as transparency and price caps. The hold-up narrative, however, runs counter to evidence in many retail settings where ancillary good prices are set below cost (e.g., free shipping or limited card surcharging in countries where the no-surcharge rule was lifted). We argue that the key to unifying these conflicting narratives is that the seller may absorb partly or fully the ancillary good's cost so as not to miss sales on the basic good. A supplier with market power on the ancillary good market then takes advantage of cost absorption and jacks up its wholesale price. Hold-ups occur only when consumers are initially uninformed or naive about the drip price and shopping costs are high. The price of the basic good then acts as a signal of the drip price, since a high markup on the basic good makes the firm more wary of missed sales. Regardless of whether consumers are informed, uninformed but rational, or naive, mandating price transparency and banning loss-making on the ancillary good leads to (i) an efficient consumption of the ancillary good, and (ii) a reduction of its wholesale price, generating strict welfare gains.","[Gomes, Renato] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France; Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, IAST, Toulouse, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Gomes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, CNRS, Toulouse, France.",,,,"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [759733]; ERC [249429, 669217]; European Research Council (ERC) [669217, 759733, 249429] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"An earlier article titled Shrouded Transaction Costs was split into the present article and a paper written in collaboration with Helene Bourguignon.

On the other hand, it is known the payoff function cannot be nonparametrically identified without any a priori restrictions. Our identification of the discount factor is robust to any normalization choice on the payoff parameters. In IO applications, normalizations are usually made on switching costs, such as entry costs and scrap values. We also show that switching costs can be nonparametrically identified, in closed-form, independently of the discount factor and other parts of the payoff function.

For these children, average school grades at age 16 dropped significantly by 0.7% of a standard deviation per additional year that their mothers were exposed to the reform. Furthermore, we find that the reform affected single mothers by increasing their working hours (and thereby reducing their time at home). We find no average effect on disposable income (mothers traded off reductions in benefits with increases in earnings). Thus, reduced parental time at home seems to be the main mechanism for the observed moderate drop in children's grades. In line with this, we find that the reform increased the use of formal after-school care, and we find a larger reform effect for children of mothers with no informal network to help with child care.

This paper investigates whether China's 2008 tax policy change affected inward foreign direct investment. In contrast to previous studies, we break foreign investment down into suspect and real foreign investment using firm-level data from 1998 to 2008 and conduct a difference-in-difference estimation to determine the effect of the tax policy change on both types of foreign investment and compare these to the effect on domestic investment. The results show that the 2008 tax policy change reduced the amount of suspect foreign investment and its effect on real foreign investment was insignificant, indicating that foreign firms in China are more concerned with the investment environment and economic stability than taxes. Therefore, China should create a regulated business environment instead of readopting supernational treatment for foreign enterprises.","[Luo, Zhi] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Econ Dev Res, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Beijing Normal University,"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",luozhi@whu.edu.cn; wang.chen@mail.shufe.edu.cn; zhangxun@bnu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71773084, 71373186]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Zhi Luo, Associate Professor, Center for Economic Development Research, Wuhan University, China.

The empirical method used is quantile regression analysis. In addition, we allow for structural breaks and asymmetry by differentiating between positive and negative oil price changes. Unlike OLS analysis, quantile regression allows the coefficient estimates to vary throughout the distribution of the dependent variable, which provides a complete picture of the relationship between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable. Our results suggest that the coefficient estimates have not been constant throughout the distribution of stock returns; that oil price shocks have asymmetrical effects on stock returns; and that the effects of oil price shocks on stock market returns are affected by stock market conditions. Overall, the results suggest that rising oil prices increase stock returns only when stock markets are bullish (high quantiles) and normal (medium quantiles), and that falling oil prices lower stock returns only when stock markets are bearish (low quantiles) and normal (medium quantiles). This suggests that oil and stock markets are more likely to boom together or crash together.","[Nusair, Salah A.; Al-Khasawneh, Jamal A.] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, POB 7207, Hawally 32093, Kuwait",Gulf University for Science & Technology (GUST),"Nusair, SA (通讯作者)，Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Finance, POB 7207, Hawally 32093, Kuwait.",nusair.s@gust.edu.kw; AlKhasawneh.J@gust.edu.kw,"Nusair, Salah A/J-1274-2019","Nusair, Salah A/0000-0002-9601-5164; Al-Khasawneh, Jamal/0000-0003-3838-5578",,,,,63,19,19,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

In the basic model, I show that given strong heterogeneity in consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) and a moderately small consumer segment with low WTP, sequential moving outcomes can appear in equilibrium with the follower enjoying second-mover advantage. Owing to consumer heterogeneity in WTP, there is a local property that a firm's aggressive behaviour may lead to a competitor responding more aggressively. Hence, the sequential moves can restrict firms' total outputs to avoid a price collapse, and result in firms' strategic choices that Pareto dominate those under the simultaneous move. I further generalize my results and show that although firms compete in quantity, under some conditions of the demand function, features of strategic complements can appear.","[Pan, Cong] Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Business Sch, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Nagoya University of Commerce & Business,"Pan, C (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ Commerce & Business, Business Sch, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.",cong_pan@nucba.ac.jp,,"Pan, Cong/0000-0002-8334-9093","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15J05223, 18K12767]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18K12767, 15J05223] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper is based on some part of the author's paper Should brand firms always take pioneering position?, ISER discussion paper no. 938, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University, June 2015.

An empirical study estimated the contribution of the interest rate shocks to the variance in output growth at 5.1% in Mexico within the framework of stochastic growth models for small open economies. We replicate this study with the same dataset and investigate which parameters affect the contribution of the interest rate shocks to business cycles. Then, we estimate the same model for different emerging economies to investigate the relationship between the corruption level and macroeconomic contribution of the interest rate shocks. For this purpose, we use Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) to measure the corruption level. Finally, we investigate the correlation between the CPI and the estimated series of the interest rate shock. Our findings are as follows. First, the average size of the interest rate shocks is positively associated with the contribution of these shocks to the variability of output growth. Second, the average size of the interest rate shocks is also positively associated with the corruption level. Third, the estimated interest rate shock and the corruption level are positively correlated with each other. As we treat the corruption level as an exogenous variable in the model, these findings lead us to accept the hypothesis. The Appendix further clarifies a well-known hypothesis that the cycle is the trend in an emerging economy.","[Suzuki, Tomoya] Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka 5648680, Japan",Kansai University,"Suzuki, T (通讯作者)，Kansai Univ, Fac Econ, Osaka 5648680, Japan.",tomoya@kansai-u.ac.jp,"Suzuki, Tomoya/AAL-4315-2021","Suzuki, Tomoya/0000-0002-9462-7511",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); JSPS KAKENHI [16K03683]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03683] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author would like thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments.

To investigate the distributive properties of monetary policy the authors resort to an agent-based macroeconomic model where firms, households and one bank interact on the basis of limited information and adaptive rules-of-thumb. Simulations show that the model can replicate fairly well a number of stylized facts, especially those relative to the business cycle. The authors address the issue using three types of computational experiments, including a global sensitivity analysis carried out through a novel methodology which greatly reduces the computational burden of simulations. The result emerges that a more restrictive monetary policy increases inequality, even though this effect may differ across groups of households. In addition, it appears to be attenuated if the bank's willingness to lend is lower. The overall analysis suggests that inequality can constitute valuable information also for central banks.","[Chen, Siyan; Desiderio, Saul] Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Daxue Rd 243, Shantou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shantou University,"Desiderio, S (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ, Business Sch, Daxue Rd 243, Shantou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",saul@stu.edu.cn,,,Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310148],Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, under Grant No. 2018A030310148.

By human capital we mean an intangible asset, best thought of as a stock of embodied and disembodied knowledge comprising education, information, entrepreneurship, and productive and innovative skills, which is formed through investments in schooling, job training, and health as well as through research and development projects and informal knowledge transfers (cf. Ehrlich and Murphy 2007). The conjecture is that the ascendancy of the US as an economic superpower in the 20th century owes considerably to its faster human capital formation relative to that of the UK and 'old Europe.' This paper assesses whether the thesis has legs to stand on through both stylized facts and a supplementary quasi-experimental empirical analysis. The stylized facts indicate that the US led other major developed countries in schooling attainments per adult population member, beginning in the latter part of the 19th century and lasting throughout the 20th century, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels. The quasi-experimental analysis constitutes the first attempt to test the hypothesis that the US's ascendancy to a major economic power stems largely from the impact of the first Morrill Act of 1862, which launched the public higher education movement in the US through the establishment of land grant colleges and universities across the nation during the latter part of the 19th century. The higher education movement appears to have spearheaded a higher long-term rate of growth in per capita income in the US relative to the UK and other major European countries.","[Cook, Adam] SUNY Coll Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ehrlich, Isaac] IZA, Bonn, Germany",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Fredonia; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Cook, A (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll Fredonia, Fredonia, NY 14063 USA.",cook@fredonia.edu,,"Cook, Adam/0000-0002-0064-1399",,,,,34,2,4,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Considering competition between two groups of different size, we show that the small group's sharing rule is a strategic complement to the large group's sharing rule in the sense that if the small group chooses a more meritocratic sharing rule, the large group wishes to choose a more meritocratic rule as well. On the contrary, the large group's sharing rule is a strategic substitute to the small group's sharing rule, hence the timing of choice is crucial. For sufficiently private prizes, a switch from a simultaneous choice to the small group being the leader consists in a Pareto improvement and reduces aggregate effort. On the contrary, when the large group is the leader, aggregate effort increases. As a result, the equilibrium timing is such that the small group chooses its sharing rule first. If the prize is not private enough, the small group retires from the competition and switching from a simultaneous to a sequential timing may reverse the results in terms of aggregate effort. The sequential timing also guarantees that the small group never outperforms the large one.","[Balart, Pau] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Carretera Valldemossa, Palma De Mallorca 07022, Spain; [Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Flamand, Sabine] Univ Rovira & Virgili, CREIP, Ave Univ 1, Reus 43204, Spain; [Guertler, Oliver] Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Troumpounis, Orestis] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; University of Cologne; Lancaster University,"Balart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Business Econ, Carretera Valldemossa, Palma De Mallorca 07022, Spain.",pau.balart@uib.cat; sabine.flamand@urv.cat; oliver.guertler@unikoeln.de; o.troumpounis@lancaster.ac.uk,"Gürtler, Oliver/AAX-6418-2021; Balart, Pau/I-4213-2019","Gürtler, Oliver/0000-0001-7792-5325; Balart, Pau/0000-0002-9088-537X; Troumpounis, Orestis/0000-0003-1074-863X","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO201786305-C4-1-R, ECO2015-67171-P, ECO2016-75410-P]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Grant/Award Numbers ECO201786305-C4-1-R (AEI/ERDF, EU), ECO2015-67171-P, ECO2016-75410-P",,52,2,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Different measures of wealth inequality were also lower than elsewhere. Yet, there were revolutions in four countries and protests in several others. We explain this so-called inequality puzzle by first noting that, despite favorable income inequality measures, subjective well-being measures in Arab countries were relatively low and falling sharply, especially for the middle class, and in the countries where the uprisings were most intense. The increasing unhappiness, reflected in perceptions of declining standards of living, was associated with dissatisfaction with the quality of public services, the shortage of formal-sector jobs, and corruption. These sources of dissatisfaction suggest that the old social contract, where government provided jobs, free education and health, and subsidized food and fuel, in return for the subdued voice of the population, was broken. The Arab Spring and its aftermath indicates the need for a new social contract, one where government promotes private-sector jobs and accountability in service delivery, and citizens are active participants in the economy and society.","[Devarajan, Shantayanan; Ianchovichina, Elena] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Devarajan, S (通讯作者)，1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",sdevarajan@worldbank.org,"Ianchovichina, Elena Ivanova/AAK-5943-2021",,,,,,35,32,34,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We calibrate a model of the Eurasian gas network and distinguish between two steps of the reform: first, the opening of access to transit pipes and second, the opening of access to distribution systems, hence customers. Using the Shapley Value as a power index, we find a modest and rather heterogeneous impact from the first step. The impact of the second step is much larger and yields a clear pattern: all local champions lose, while all customers and all outside players gain. As one third of the losses of champions within EU leaks to players abroad, current reforms might enhance the dominance of already powerful outside producers. When network power is assessed with the nucleolus, in contrast, full liberalization of access to customers does not benefit outside producers at all. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Identification is complicated by parental preferences: if parents prefer certain sex compositions over others, children' s gender affects not only the outcomes of other children but also the existence of potential additional children. We employ two empirical strategies that both address this problem. First, we use a large sample of singletons to estimate whether first-borns are affected by the gender of their second-born sibling. Second, we look at a sample of dizygotic (i.e. non-identical) twins. We find that a same-sex sibling increases men's earnings and family formation outcomes (marriage and fertility), as compared to an opposite-sex sibling. The results for women are similar but the effects are smaller in magnitude and less robust. We argue that the income result for men could be driven by competition between brothers, as we find that men with brothers choose higher paying occupations. For women, we find suggestive evidence that the income premium may come partly from lower unemployment, which could be due to shared job search networks. The effects on family formation might stem from differential parental treatment for men, and from competition between sisters for women.","[Peter, Noemi] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Lundborg, Petter; Mikkelsen, Sara] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter; Webbink, Dinand] Erasmus Sch Econ Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lundborg, Petter; Webbink, Dinand] Inst Labor Econ IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Webbink, Dinand] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Lund University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Tinbergen Institute,"Peter, N (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",a.n.peter@rug.nl; petter.lundborg@nek.lu.se; sara.mikkelsen@nck.lu.se; webbink@ese.eur.nl,,"Peter, Noemi/0000-0002-2743-4883","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life, and Welfare, FORTE [2010-0745]","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life, and Welfare, FORTE","We are grateful to Hessel Oosterbeek, Erik Plug, Thomas Buser, Paul J.

Among other results, it is proved that producers may support an increase in the emission tax in the future or in the present, that emissions in the present may be increasing in the emission tax in the future and that the timing of emissions may affect the directions of some effects of a change in an emission tax on welfare variables. The results obtained are based on the interaction between present and future emission taxes, the intertemporal effects of such taxes, imperfect competition, the strategic behavior of each firm in stealing sales from its rivals in the present and in the future, the type of emission and the producers' commitment problem. The analysis is extended to the cases of monopoly and perfect competition.","[Sagasta, Amagoia] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Avda Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Usategui, Jose M.] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Empresa, Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Sagasta, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Avda Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",amagoia.sagasta@ehu.eus; josemaria.usategui@ehu.eus,"Sagasta, Amagoia/AAA-4313-2019","Sagasta, Amagoia/0000-0002-6490-9905; USATEGUI DIAZ DE OTALORA, JOSE MARIA/0000-0003-4692-2409","Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-35820, ECO2015-64467-R (MINECO/FEDER)]; Departamento de Educacion, Universidades e Investigacion, Gobierno Vasco [IT-783-13]","Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Departamento de Educacion, Universidades e Investigacion, Gobierno Vasco(Basque Government)","Financial support from Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2012-35820 and ECO2015-64467-R (MINECO/FEDER)) and from the Departamento de Educacion, Universidades e Investigacion, Gobierno Vasco (IT-783-13) is gratefully acknowledged.",,30,0,0,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Indeed, sustainable agricultural development is particularly important in China due to limits on resources and the presence of the largest population in the world. In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition of the overall inefficiency into three components of technical, mix, and scale effects at aggregate level by allowing for desirable and undesirable outputs in a non-parametric framework. We empirically investigate economic and environmental performance associated with resource misallocation (represented by input/output mix) in Chinese agricultural sector across the 31 provinces over the period 1997-2014. Our results show that average overall inefficiency in Chinese agricultural sector is 9.13% during the sample period, which suggests there exists a 7.94% possible improvement for gross output value and 1.19% potential reduction for carbon emission. Moreover, we find inefficiency is mainly due to the mix effect that requires an improvement in reallocation of inputs and this may be related to the ongoing supply side structural reforms in China. We also present a dual model of by-production technology for shadow price analysis and report upward trended carbon abatement costs in Chinese agriculture.","[Shen, Zhiyang] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, 962 CaoShan RD, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China; [Shen, Zhiyang] China Eximbank, 30 FuXingMenNei RD, Beijing 100031, Peoples R China; [Balezentis, Tomas] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos Str 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Chen, Xueli] China Radio Int, 16A ShiJingShan RD, Beijing 100040, Peoples R China; [Valdmanis, Vivian] Western Michigan Univ, Grand Rapids, MI 49503 USA; [Valdmanis, Vivian] IESEG Sch Management, F-59000 Lille, France",Anhui University of Finance & Economics; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Western Michigan University; IESEG School of Management,"Shen, ZY (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, 962 CaoShan RD, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.",zhiyang86@163.com,"Balezentis, Tomas/D-8609-2015; SHEN, Zhiyang/AAY-7556-2021","Balezentis, Tomas/0000-0002-3906-1711; SHEN, Zhiyang/0000-0002-5126-6461; CHEN, Xueli/0000-0003-0758-5243",China Scholarship Council [201308070020]; IESEG School of Management; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA216],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); IESEG School of Management; Major Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),We would like to thank Executive Editor Belton M.

The aggregate result of agents interactions can be summarised in the form of a Beveridge curve, which determines the relationship between unmatched agents, unemployed job seekers and vacancies in firms. We open the black box of matching technology, by modelling how agents behave (make proposals) according to their information perception. We observe more efficient results-in the form of a downward shift of the Beverage curve in the case of simple zero-intelligent agents. Our comparative statics indicate that market conditions, such as the heterogeneity of agents' preferences, will also shift the Beveridge curve downwards. Moreover, market thickness affects movement along the Beverage curve. Movement right-down along the curve if there is an increasing number of agents compared to positions within firms. Furthermore, we show that frictions in re-matching, such as commitment to a match, could be another factor shifting the Beveridge curve toward the origin.","[Veski, Andre] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Poder, Kaire] Estonian Business Sch, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology; Estonian Business School,"Veski, A (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",andre.veski@ttu.ee; kaire.poder@ebs.ee,"Põder, Kaire/N-6189-2019; Põder, Kaire/IAN-8847-2023","Põder, Kaire/0000-0001-6578-4852; Veski, Andre/0000-0003-1495-6292",,,,,54,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Evidence from a multiple bubble test,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hub pricing; Bubbles; Natural gas; Oil indexation,CRUDE-OIL; MARKET FUNDAMENTALS; PRICES; ENERGY; STOCK; FINANCIALIZATION; BEHAVIOR; FUTURES; IMPACT; SHOCKS,"Oil indexation and hub-based pricing are two competing pricing mechanisms in the international natural gas markets. The debates over whether hub-based pricing is preferable to oil indexation have become intense among academics and practitioners, for example, whether and when East Asia should adopt hub pricing. This paper contributes empirically to the debate using a multiple bubble test. Adopting the generalized sup augmented Dickey-Fuller test proposed by Phillips et al. (2015), we show that more explosive bubbles exist in Japan and European gas prices than in the US prices. The argument is that hub-based pricing mechanism can better reflect fundamental values in the gas markets and thus is less subject to speculations. Given the recent trend of financialization in energy markets, gas prices are more likely to deviate from fundamental values when they are not clear to investors. Although oil indexation is simple and has been an effective tool over the past few decades, our results suggest that hub pricing is associated with less extreme price movements in the market and thus is a better choice for both policy makers and practitioners.

This survey provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the causal mechanisms between religion and development discussed and tested in the economics literature, and reviews quantitative empirical evidence on the actual effects of religion on economic and social dimensions of development. We start by disaggregating the concept of religion into four religious dimensions and propose a framework to conceptualize causal mechanisms. Numerous mechanisms are possible but only a few uncontested findings exist. Religion is ambivalent vis-a-vis development: although religious ideas can foster certain forms of human capital acquisition and labor market participation, scholars have found a negative relationship between religious dimensions and both income and gender equality as well as innovation activities. Religious identity is also a source of labor market discrimination and has ambivalent effects on economic growth and social cohesion. Methodological challenges refer to the availability of fine-grained data, especially for developing countries, the use of concepts and definitions, and the lack of causal inference.","[Basedau, Matthias; Gobien, Simone; Prediger, Sebastian] GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Hamburg, Germany",German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Prediger, S (通讯作者)，GIGA German Inst Global & Area Studies, Hamburg, Germany.",Sebastian.prediger@giga-hamburg.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,We thank Anna Wolkenhauer for excellent research assistance.

When the asset pledgeability is low, the down payment is high, and bubble investment is unleveraged, as in a standard rational bubble model. When the pledgeability is high, the down payment is low, making it easier for leveraged borrowers to invest in the bubbly asset. As loans are packaged together into a competitive pool, the pricing of individual default risk may facilitate risk-taking. In equilibrium, credit-constrained borrowers may optimally choose a risky leveraged investment strategy - borrow to invest in the bubbly asset and default if the bubble bursts. The model predicts joint boom-bust cycles in asset prices and securitized credit. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Second, we look at the secular movements in margins of profits through a simple trend decomposition of the aggregate and two-digit mark-ups. We find that: (1) the aggregate and the majority of two-digit mark-ups behave pro-cyclically; and (2) the trend in margins of profits in the period is explained by a marked rise in the rate of surplus value and a fall in the composition of capital, indicating labor-saving/capital-using technical change.

We show that social comparisons of consumption lead to excessive labor supply for employed workers, but trade unionism results in under-employment. When conspicuous consumption meets trade unionism, the labor force exhibits an intensive margin under which the excessive labor supply caused by social comparisons of consumption is restrained by unionization. Conspicuous consumption can then achieve the social sub-optimum, without a need for government intervention, creating no distortions in consumption, capital accumulation, and output in a competitive equilibrium. When social comparisons in consumption are more intensive, a higher degree of unionization is required for restoring optimality. Given a specific degree of social comparison in consumption, a higher degree of unionization is socially desirable if the output elasticity of labor, the elasticity of labor supply, or the elasticity of substitution between working hours and employment is high. By contrast, a lower degree of unionization is socially desirable when the trade union displays a more favorable orientation toward wages. By shedding light on the role of trade unionism, our study also provides a reconciliation of the disparity between the theoretical prediction and the empirical findings.","[Chang, Juin-jen; Wang, Wei-neng] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Nankang, Taiwan; [Liu, Chia-ying] Aletheia Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Aletheia University,"Chang, JJ (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Nankang, Taiwan.",jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We thank the co-editor, an anonymous referee, Been-Lon Chen, Jang-Ting Guo, and Ching-Chong Lai for their helpful suggestions and insightful comments on an earlier version of this paper, whose inputs have led to a much improved paper.

We conducted a randomized trial in Uganda testing specialized packaging and messaging, designed to increase antimalarial adherence. We find that stickers with short, targeted messages on the packaging increase adherence by 9% and reduce untaken pills by 29%. However, the currently used method of boosting adherence through costly, specialized packaging with pictorial instructions had no significant impacts relative to the standard control package. We develop a theoretical framework of the adherence decision, highlighting the role of symptoms, beliefs about being cured, and beliefs about drug effectiveness to help interpret our results.

These prior authorization requirements have the potential to reduce risky prescriptions and to lower prescription drug costs, but little is known about their ability to do either. This study estimates the effect of a prior authorization requirement for certain costly and abuse-prone drugs on prescription drug use and costs for work-related injuries in Texas. The findings indicate that the prior authorization requirement reduces the likelihood that claimants receive non-preferred drugs as well as insurers' spending on non-preferred drugs. While there is some substitution to preferred drugs, I do not find evidence of large increases in spending on preferred drugs. The estimated effects on average total pharmacy spending are imprecise, though there is suggestive evidence that the prior authorization requirement reduces the likelihood that a claim has high prescription drug costs. The results provide strong evidence that the prior authorization requirement drastically reduces the likelihood that patients receive combinations of drugs that have contributed disproportionately to the rise in prescription drug overdoses. Despite the success of prior authorization in lowering spending on non-preferred drugs and in reducing high-risk prescriptions, I find little evidence that prior authorization has disproportionately large effects on the most dangerous prescription drug use and only weak, suggestive evidence that it has larger effects on prescription drug use that likely arises because physicians are not fully informed, suggesting that prior authorization requirements do not necessarily target the riskiest drug use.

Covariances of income levels and future growth rates therefore have strong identifying power for HIP. We show that adding such moments to an estimation can reverse seemingly strong evidence of HIP.

It argues that monetary policy at the ELB can be potent and that there has thus far been no convincing evidence that it has greater international spillovers through capital flows and exchange rates than comparable adjustments in interest rates. It may be more challenging to raise rates off the ELB than to raise rates from higher levels-possibly due to counterbalancing effects through the exchange rate-although there are only anecdotes to support this stickiness rather than any formal, empirical evidence.","[Forbes, Kristin] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Forbes, K (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,2,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Until very recently, scholars using various datasets have shown that residents of post-communist countries were significantly less satisfied with their lives than their counterparts in non-transition countries (controlling for income and other socio-economic characteristics). The literature has explained this finding by the great macroeconomic instability of the 1990s, by a substantial decrease in the quality and accessibility of public goods, by the major increase in inequality, and by the rapid depreciation of pre-transition human capital. All these factors were expected to subside over time at least after the post-Great-Recession recovery. In this paper, we consider two most recent datasets the third wave of the Life in Transition Survey (administered in 2015-16) and the 2010-2016 waves of the annual Gallup World Poll. We find that by 2016 the transition happiness gap had closed. This convergence has taken place both due to a happiness recovery in post-communist countries after the Great Recession and due to a decrease in life satisfaction in comparator countries in recent years. We also find that the convergence in life satisfaction was primarily driven by middle-income young, educated individuals, regardless of gender.","[Guriev, Sergei] European Bank Reconstruct & Dev, London, England; [Guriev, Sergei] Sci Po, Paris, France; [Guriev, Sergei] CEPR, London, England; [Melnikov, Nikita] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",European Bank of Reconstructon & Development; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Princeton University,"Guriev, S (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Paris, France.",sergei.guriev@sciencespo.fr,"Guriev, Sergei/AAE-4596-2020","Guriev, Sergei/0000-0001-6048-2169",,,,,12,20,21,0,17,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

This paper is mainly concerned with two questions: First, is the Dutch housing market localized? Second, to which factors can we trace back this localization? We find that the Dutch housing market is highly localized. Although there is an important common housing cycle explaining house price comovement across all regions, idiosyncratic factors play the most important role. Although notably, group specific factors, separating Randstad of non-Randstad regions, are only of minor importance. Nevertheless, they can explain region-specific housing supply shocks. This latter finding can be partly traced back towards an agglomeration effect for Randstad regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using the neoclassical growth model, I compare linear-quadratic, perturbation, and projection methods. All techniques are applied to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and the optimality conditions that define the general equilibrium of the economy. Two cases are studied depending on whether a closed-form solution is available. I also analyze how different degrees of non-linearities affect the approximated solution. The results encourage the use of perturbations for reasonable values of the structural parameters of the model and suggest the use of projection methods when a high degree of accuracy is required.","[Parra-Alvarez, Juan Carlos] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Parra-Alvarez, Juan Carlos] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Parra-Alvarez, JC (通讯作者)，Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",jparra@econ.au.dk,,"Parra-Alvarez, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-9076-9021",Danish National Research Foundation,Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"I would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for extremely useful comments and suggestions, as well as the participants of the 18th Annual Conference on Computing in Economics and Finance in Prague, the 6th CSDA International Conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics in Oviedo and the CDMAWorkshop on DSGE models in St. Andrews for their helpful comments.

Upon further investigation, these results were driven by an error that inappropriately calculated differences across counties (and years) in the dataset. This error has been acknowledged by the author. When corrected, the specification in the original paper produces no statistical significance for any of the broadband variables of interest. Thus, the reported finding of a positive association between broadband speed and employment is not valid. This updated result is in agreement with several other studies using the first-differenced methodology and county-level data from the U.S., and suggests that more work needs to be done to refine existing models and units of analysis to uncover the relationship (if one exists) between broadband speed and employment.

The diversified and changing nature of works in this field warrants us to stocktake, identify changes, and map out KM research framework for future exploration. The study involves three aspects. First, three stages of KM research in construction were distinguished in terms of the time distribution of 217 target publications. Major topics in the stages were extracted for understanding the changes of research emphasis from evolutionary perspective. Second, the past works were summed up in a three-dimensional research framework in terms of management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective. Finally, potential research orientations in the future were predicted to expand the existing research framework. It was found that (1) KM research has significantly blossomed in the last two decades with a great potential; (2) major topics of KM were changing in terms of technology, technique, organization, attribute of knowledge, and research objectives; (3) past KM studies centred around management organization, managerial methodology and approach, and managerial objective, thus a three-dimensional research framework was proposed; (4) within the research framework, team-level, project-level, and firm-level KM were studied to achieve project, organizational, and competitive objectives by integrated methodologies of information technology, social technique, and KM process tool; and (5) nine potential research orientations were predicted corresponding to the three dimensions. Finally, an expanded research framework was proposed to encourage and guide future research works in this field. The paper only focused on the construction industry. The findings need further exploration in order to discover any possible missing important research works which were not published in English or not included in the time period. The paper formed a systematic framework of KM research in construction and predicted the potential research orientations. It provides much value for the researchers who want to understand the past and the future of global KM research in the construction industry.","[Yu, Dengke] Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 999 Xuefu Rd, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jay] Queensland Univ Technol, Sci & Engn Fac, 2 George St,GPO Box 2434, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Nanchang University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Yu, DK (通讯作者)，Nanchang Univ, Sch Management, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 999 Xuefu Rd, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",yudengke@ncu.edu.cn; j.yang@qut.edu.au,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201072, 71563027]; China Scholarship Council",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71201072 and 71563027).

First, we try to understand the reasons that explain the decision made by companies with UK cross-listing to cross-list their shares in the US. Second, we study the impact of cross-listing on value creation. Our results shown that the motivations for such decision are related to the improvement of stock price informativeness and investor protection interests. Firms may also be motivated by reasons related to the global business strategy. However, the commitment to additional higher disclosure requirements and geographic proximity act negatively on the decision to cross-list. By applying a methodology taking into account the endogeneity of the cross-listing decision, we found results that support the positive effect of cross-listing on performance. The finding also revealed the existence of an indirect impact of the cross-listing decision through its determinants on performance. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Different solutions have been suggested to curb poverty. Economic growth and financial development are two such crucial tools for overcoming poverty, as frequently pointed out by economists. These tools work through the so-called trickle-down hypothesis, which contends that a well-functioning financial system would enhance poverty reduction by promoting economic growth. One country that appears to have manifested this hypothesis is China. However, the empirical test of the trickle-down hypothesis for China is scant. In addition, most of the existing studies have failed to account for regime-shift in parameters or structural breaks. This paper attempts to fill this void by testing the trickle-down hypothesis for China during the period 1985-2014. We utilized two standard proxies for financial development, namely: the domestic credit to private sector by banks as percentage of GDP, and money and quasi money as percentage of GDP; annual percentage change in real GDP per capita to proxy economic growth; and a standard proxy for poverty reduction namely: the household final consumption expenditure per capita growth.

That is, we found financial development to cause economic growth, which in turn causes poverty reduction in China at the national level.

We analyze an experiment in which we randomly give middle school math teachers access to existing high-quality, off-the-shelf lessons, and in some cases, support to promote their use. Teachers receiving access alone increased students' math achievement by a marginally significant 0.06 of a standard deviation. Teachers who received access and support increased students' math achievement by 0.09 of a standard deviation. Weaker teachers experience larger gains, suggesting that these lessons substitute for teacher skill or efforts. The online materials are more scalable and cost effective than most policies aimed at improving teacher quality, suggesting that, if search costs can be overcome, there is a real benefit to making high-quality instructional materials available to teachers on the Internet.

In a two-period electoral campaign with two policy issues, an incumbent and a possibly more competent challenger compete for election by voters who are heterogeneously informed about the state of the world. Due to the asymmetries in government responsibility between candidates, the incumbent's statement may convey information on the relevance of the issues to voters. In equilibrium, the incumbent sometimes strategically releases his statement early and thus signals the importance of his signature issue to the voters. We find that, since the incumbent's positioning on the issue reveals private information which the challenger can use in later statements, the incumbent's incentives to distort the campaign are decreasing in his quality, as previously documented by the empirical literature. The distortions arising in equilibrium are decreasing in the incumbent's true competence; however, the distortions may be increasing in the incumbent's expected competence on his signature issue.","[Manzoni, Elena] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Penczynski, Stefan P.] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Mannheim,"Penczynski, SP (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7 3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",stefan.penczynski@uni-mannheim.de,,"Penczynski, Stefan Peter/0000-0001-5477-6830; Manzoni, Elena/0000-0003-0223-8760",PRIN,"PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","We thank Madhav Aney, Leonardo Felli, Giovanna Iannantuoni, Gilat Levy, Andrea Mattozzi, Michele Piccione, Ronny Razin and participants of the 3rd GRASS Workshop, the 5th CESIfo Workshop on Political Economy and the SFB 884 Workshop on the Political Economy of Reforms in Mannheim.

However, this kind of intervention may also create Protection for Sale conditions in the market-which might, in turn, lead to an inefficient resource allocation. This paper examines the effect of an indirect intervention on regulated market welfare under Optimal Regulation and Protection for Sale conditions. Although under Optimal Regulation conditions there is zero welfare-loss as it derives from Differential Price Policy (DPP), it seems that under substantial Protection for Sale conditions this price policy increases the welfare-loss, and therefore a Uniform Price Policy (UPP) might achieve a smaller welfare-loss-due to the free-riding effect. Furthermore, this paper suggests that in between these two price policies lays a third option, a Combined Price Policy, that can balance between the accurate resource allocation (DPP) and the political pressure reduction (UPP) in order to reduce the welfare-loss and to increase the market efficiency.","[Nisani, Doron] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Nisani, D (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, POB12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.",doron.nisani@mail.huji.ac.il,"Nisani, Doron/HLW-5160-2023","Nisani, Doron/0000-0002-1392-614X",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"The author thanks Prof. Israel Finkelshtain and Dr. Iddo Kan for their guidance.

It presents an applied general equilibrium model which combines the theoretical foundations of an Eaton-Kortum (EK) model of international trade with the comprehensiveness of a global multi-region, multi-sector Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of production and consumption. The EK model features endogenous Ricardian productivity gains and non-tariff trade costs. Countries and sectors can be disaggregated, e.g. representing federal states and technology-specific power generation. The model calibration introduces a log-multiplicative structural estimation approach based on a gravity model with market clearing conditions to simultaneously estimate the EK model's trade elasticity, productivities and iceberg trade costs at the subnational sectoral level. Based on these estimates, policy simulations are carried out, in which the effect of climate and trade policy on CO2 emissions is decomposed into a scale, composition, technique and substitution effect. The policy simulations suggest that the removal of tariffs creates smaller welfare gains than a comparable reduction of non-tariff barriers but also a slightly smaller increase in European and global CO2 emissions, mainly via substitution and composition effects. The effects significantly differ between national and subnational model regions. Lower trade costs reduce the negative welfare effects of the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) for some of its members by lowering emissions. EU renewable energy support slightly reduces European and global emissions but also welfare compared to the EU ETS alone. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This is done by studying the precision of out-of-sample forecasts from Bayesian VAR models using a sample of quarterly data from 1996 to 2016. It is found that the inclusion of inflation expectations in the models tends to improve forecast precision. However, the improvement is typically small enough that it could be described as economically irrelevant. One exception can possibly be found in the expectations of businesses in the National Institute of Economic Research's Economic Tendency Survey; when included in the models, these improve forecast precision in a meaningful way at short horizons. Taken together, it seems that the inflation expectations studied here do not provide a silver bullet for those who try to improve VAR-based forecasts of Swedish inflation. The largest benefits from using these survey expectations may instead perhaps be found among analysts and policy makers; they can after all provide relevant information concerning, for example, the credibility of the inflation target or challenges that the central bank might face when conducting monetary policy.","[Stockhammar, Par] Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden; [Osterholm, Par] Orebro Univ, Sch Business, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden",Orebro University,"Stockhammar, P (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, Box 3116, S-10362 Stockholm, Sweden.",par.stockhammar@konj.se; par.osterholm@oru.se,"Österholm, Pär/ABD-8486-2020","Österholm, Pär/0000-0002-4840-7649",,,,,39,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

This paper uses this kind of implied volatility index of oil prices to investigate the impacts of oil price uncertainty on the aggregate and sectoral stock returns in China. This issue is resolved by using a quantile regression, which can provide a more detailed examination under different market conditions. Meanwhile, the asymmetric effects of uncertainty shocks are also examined by using the positive and negative changes of the OVX. Furthermore, we assess whether the reform of March 27, 2013 affected the OVX-stock nexus since this reform was a major step to relax the control of domestic oil prices in China. Our results reveal that OVX changes mainly show significantly negative effects on the aggregate and sectoral stock returns in the bearish market. In particular, these effects depend largely on the positive shocks of the OVX rather than the negative shocks of the OVX. Moreover, the reform of March 27, 2013 decreased the impacts of the positive OVX shocks on Chinese stock returns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The lower growth rates characterizing the post Global Financial Crisis era and the concerns about income inequality put to the fore the degree that better targeted investment in human capital may ameliorate the challenges facing the working poor. Using cross-country data, we find the association between the income shares of the working poor, dependence on manufacturing sector, and the availability of vocational education. Conditioning on tertiary educational attainment, improved access to better vocational education will probably contribute more than large increase in regular college attainment. Comparing the US to Germany suggests that pushing more students to BA granting colleges may no longer be the most efficient way to deal with the challenges caused by the decline in manufacturing employment affecting in particular lower-income households. We also note that a tracking of technical training and educational budget, shown in the case of Vietnam in comparison to Thailand, as well as government subsidies for reskilling of labour fource throughout their career in Singapore, is a potential explanation for their relative manufacturing competitiveness.","[Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Jinjarak, Yothin; Ngo, Nam; Noy, Ilan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington 6012, New Zealand",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Victoria University Wellington,"Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.;Aizenman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",aizenman@usc.edu,"Jinjarak, Yothin/F-2746-2010","Jinjarak, Yothin/0000-0001-5262-3718; Noy, Ilan/0000-0003-3214-6568",,,,,30,8,9,4,54,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Exogenous variation in party representation is generated by the assassination of the leader of the Congress party, which occurred midway through India's national elections in 1991, and dramatically increased the probability of Congress victory for a subset of constituencies. Representation by the Congress party leads to a substantial increase in the provision of public goods favored by the poor, consistent with the party's expressed populist agenda. Among the salient changes are increases in the availability of drinking water and primary education, and declines in agricultural and industrial electrification and telephone coverage. I compare these effects to those obtained using a regression discontinuity design, and find that the latter yields little effect of Congress representation on public goods allocations.

We find that although strengthening patent protection and raising R&D subsidies have the same macroeconomic effects of stimulating innovation and economic growth, they have drastically different microeconomic implications on income inequality. Specifically, strengthening patent protection increases income inequality whereas raising R&D subsidies decreases (increases) it if the quality step size is sufficiently small (large). An empirically realistic quality step size is smaller than the threshold, implying a negative effect of R&D subsidies on income inequality. We also calibrate the model to provide a quantitative analysis and find that strengthening patent protection causes a moderate increase in income inequality and a negligible increase in consumption inequality whereas raising R&D subsidies causes a relatively large decrease in both income inequality and consumption inequality.

This article provides a systematic review of the published literature to date on infant health production and how it has evolved over the past 3-4 decades as data have become more available, computing has improved, and econometric methods have become more sophisticated. While empirical research in most fields has expanded in corresponding ways, the infant health production research has become an important part of the broader and inherently multidisciplinary literature on intergenerational health. The strongest and most robust findings are that policies matter for infant health, particularly those affecting access to health care, and that prenatal smoking and other chemical exposures substantially compromise infant health. Promising directions for future research include elucidating relevant pathways, reconciling the largely inconsistent estimated effects of nutrition and education, and exploring the roles of preconceptional and lifetime health care, paternal factors, social support, housing, complementarity and substitutability of inputs, factors that modify effects of inputs, and evolving medical technologies.","[Corman, Hope] Rider Univ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Corman, Hope; Dave, Dhaval] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA USA; [Reichman, Nancy E.] Rutgers State Univ, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Rider University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Bentley University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences,"Corman, H (通讯作者)，Rider Univ, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.;Corman, H (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",corman@rider.edu; ddave@bentley.edu; reichmne@rwjms.rutgers.edu,,,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its support of the Child Health Institute of New Jersey at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University [67038, 74260]","Robert Wood Johnson Foundation through its support of the Child Health Institute of New Jersey at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University","First and foremost, this article was a labor of love for our mentor, life coach, and friend, Michael Grossman.

It is natural to assume that stricter regulatory policies incentivize a higher adoption of such technologies. Nonetheless, it has been shown that, under perfect competition, this is not always true. Methodology: This article offers a theoretical study of the incentives of three different environmental regulatory instruments (taxes, tradable permits and emission standards), on the adoption of a new abatement technology for a Cournot oligopoly. Results: As in perfect competition, if the marginal abatement cost curves of both technologies cross and the firms have different adoption costs, it is possible that high taxes, few tradable permits and a small emission standard (strict policies) discourage the adoption of new technologies. Conclusions: When choosing a regulatory instrument, it is important to take into account the structure of the available abatement technologies. Otherwise, instead of incentivizing the use of cleaner technologies, the regulator might do the opposite if the policies are too strict.","[Gama, Adriana] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Gama, A (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",agama@colmex.mx,"Gama, Adriana/W-4989-2019",,,,,,30,1,1,0,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We interpret this evidence through the lens of an equilibrium life-cycle, span-of-control model where managers invest in their skills. We use the model to quantify the importance of exogenous productivity differences and the size-dependent distortions emphasized in the misallocation literature. Our findings indicate that such distortions are critical to generate the observed differences in the growth of relative managerial earnings across countries. Distortions that halve the growth of relative managerial earnings, a move from the U.S. to Italy in our data, lead to a reduction in managerial quality of 27% and to a reduction in output of about nearly 7% - more than half of the observed gap between the U.S. and Italy.

A seller and potential buyers start out symmetrically uninformed about the quality of a good, but the seller becomes informed after the game begins. We show that this developing adverse selection gives rise to novel trading dynamics. In particular, if the seller's learning speed is high, the equilibrium features collapse-and-recovery behavior: Both the equilibrium price and the trade probability first drop and then increase over time. While the trade surplus monotonically decreases as the learning speed increases, the seller's surplus may change non-monotonically. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Since much of the corruption literature is plagued either by the lack of instruments or weak instruments, this paper makes a methodological contribution by drawing inferences based on Moreira's (2003) conditional likelihood ratio approach. We provide robust evidence that women's presence in parliament has a causal and negative impact on corruption while other measures of female participation in economic activities are shown to have no effect. Further, this negative relationship between women's presence in government and corruption is also found to hold in a regional analysis of 17 European countries alleviating concerns that the relationship is driven by unobservable country-fixed characteristics. Finally, we show that this relationship does not disappear when women gain similarity in social status. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain a set of new partial identification results for both the average treatment response and the average treatment effect. In particular, we find that the monotone treatment response and monotone treatment selection bound of Manski and Pepper, 2000 can be further tightened if we impose the smoothness conditions on the treatment response. Since it is unknown in practice whether the imposed smoothness restriction is met, it is desirable to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the smoothness assumption. We demonstrate how one can carry out a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect by varying the degrees of smoothness assumption. We illustrate our findings by reanalyzing the return to schooling example of Manski and Pepper, 2000 and also by measuring the effect of the length of job training on the labor market outcomes.","[Kim, Wooyoung] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kwon, Koohyun; Kwon, Soonwoo] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Columbia Univ, Ctr Microdata Methods & Practice, Inst Fiscal Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lee, Sokbae] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Yale University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Kim, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",wkim68@wisc.edu; koohyun.kwon@yale.edu; soonwoo.kwon@yale.edu; sl3841@columbia.edu,"Lee, Sokbae/F-7514-2011","Lee, Sokbae/0000-0003-4080-7733",European Research Council [ERC-2014-CoG-646917-ROMIA]; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01014041]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01014041],"European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We would like to thank the Editor, Rosa Matzkin, three anonymous referees, Steve Bond, Andrew Chesher, Toru Kitagawa, Charles Manski, Adam Rosen, Kyungchul Song, and Elie Tamer for helpful comments.

We instruct subjects that the rule is to take the costly action. Their willingness to incur such a cost reveals respect for norms. We show that choices in this task are similar across five countries.

The paper investigates derivative models and risk management by highlighting the grounds for their emergence, their establishment and their influence on market developments. A political economy of derivatives markets provides insights into the essential nature of derivatives, defining them against the material circumstances in which they arise, and allows the logical development of valuation models and risk management as the necessary complement to the large-scale derivatives markets that have developed since the 1980s. The paper builds from finding prices for potential new trades to valuing completed trades and risk managing portfolios to show how and why valuation models and risk management are bound up with today's derivatives markets.","[Lindo, Duncan] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Lindo, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",duncanlindo@yahoo.co.uk,"Lindo, Duncan/AAD-4626-2019","Lindo, Duncan/0000-0002-7847-6442",,,,,83,5,5,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We investigate daily gold and rupee exchange rates depreciation against set of currencies over the period of 1992-2015. Using wavelets at multiple time horizons; we find that gold act as a consistent short run hedge against exchange rate hence validating the exchange rate destruction hypothesis. This finding is helpful for speculators in their decision making while taking long and short positions accordingly. This finding suggests that central bank also need to keep other safe haven assets in reserves because the hedging ability of gold is only limited to short run. Further, the role of gold in providing protection against currency risks is also confirmed using quantile regression. These results assist portfolio managers and governments in formulating effectual diversification strategy for preserving investment portfolio during extreme event condition. Our results also suggest that gold has a lead relationship with exchange rate; however, this relationship switches over specific time intervals. This finding is of major concern for policy makers in determining the extent of stabilization in gold prices to bring consistency to exchange rate. Finally, the Granger coherence coefficients confirm that the strength of the causal relationship varies across over all frequencies. These conclusions have important implications for policy makers, economic analysts, portfolio managers and institutional investors. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling.

This paper argues that digital-industrial innovations make human capital more important than ever and the focus needs to shift to the complementarity between new technologies and human abilities. In particular, more effort should be devoted to (i) understanding what new skills will be needed, and how existing jobs will change; (ii) upgrading education and professional training schemes; (iii) reforming labor market institutions to support a future where a larger share of workers will change jobs and employers more frequently; (iv) reforming social benefits systems and bolstering social safety nets to smooth the economic transition and cushion the impact on the worst-affected workers. This paper presents an analysis of the challenges, addresses the key areas of action, and puts forward specific proposals, including policy actions, industry initiatives, and further research projects. The authors argue that the G20 could and should champion a comprehensive approach to leverage digital-industrial innovations for faster job creation and growth, with initiatives to re-align demand and supply of skills, labor market reforms, redesigned social safety nets, measures to promote digital innovation and facilitate the adoption of skills-augmenting technologies, and strengthened private sector training programs.","[Annunziata, Marco] Annunziata Desai Advisors, San Francisco, CA 94123 USA; [Bourgeois, Hendrik] Cargill, Wayzata, MN USA",Cargill,"Annunziata, M (通讯作者)，Annunziata Desai Advisors, San Francisco, CA 94123 USA.",annunziata.sf@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,8,8,0,57,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUN 28,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201842.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-42,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GL0FB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436639400001,0

LML represents the mixing distribution of a logit kernel as a sieve function (polynomials, step functions, and splines, among many other variants). In the first part of this paper, we conduct Monte-Carlo studies to analyze the number of required parameters (e.g., polynomial order) in three LML variants to recover the true population distributions, and also compare the performance (in terms of accuracy, precision, estimation time, and model fit) of LML and a mixed multinomial logit with normal heterogeneity (MMNL-N). Our results indicate that adding too many parameters in LML may not be the best strategy to retrieve underlying taste heterogeneity; in fact, over-specified models generally perform worst in terms of BIC. We recommend to use neither minimum-BIC nor the most flexible specification, but we rather suggest to start with the same number of parameters as a parametric model (such as MMNL-N) while checking changes in the derived histogram of the mixing distribution. As expected, LML was able to recover bimodal-normal, lognormal, and uniform distributions much better than the misspecified MMNL-N. Computational efficiency makes LML advantageous in the process of searching for the final specification. In the second part of the paper, we estimate the willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates of German consumers for different vehicle attributes when making alternative-fuel-car purchase choices. LML was able to capture the bimodal nature of WTP for vehicle attributes, which was not possible to retrieve using standard parametric specifications.","[Bansal, Prateek] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Daziano, Ricardo A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 305 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Achtnicht, Martin] Dresden & Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Leibniz Inst Ecol Urban & Reg Dev IOER, Mannheim, Germany",Cornell University; Cornell University; Leibniz Institut fur okologische Raumentwicklung; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bansal, P (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 301 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",pb422@cornell.edu; daziano@cornell.edu; m.achtnicht@ioer.de,"Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014","Bansal, Prateek/0000-0001-6851-8461",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1462289],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Award No. CMMI-1462289.

Our analysis uses a panel vector autoregressive model and novel measures of export-intensity adjusted final demand in China's secondary and tertiary sectors. Impulse-response analysis suggests that spillovers are largest for shocks to China's secondary sector: a one percentage point decline in demand growth from China's secondary sector reduces average partner country export growth by almost 0.3% points on impact, and about half this amount on average over the first year; the same size shock to China's tertiary sector has a much smaller effect. This suggests that spillovers to different trading partners will depend on their sectoral linkages with the Chinese economy. At the regional level, the analysis indicates that countries whose trade linkages with China are strongest-such as those in Asia-would be most affected. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In comparison to other methods in multivariate extreme value theory, our proposed method does not need the i.i.d. assumption. Our method can handle the situation where the extremes for different components do not occur at the same time. We justify our methods in two ways: first using thorough simulation studies and then applying the proposed method to real data on weekly stock indices from sixteen markets.","[Chaudhuri, Kausik] Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Sen, Rituparna] Indian Stat Inst, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Tan, Zheng] Adara Global, Mountain View, CA USA",University of Leeds; Indian Statistical Institute,"Chaudhuri, K (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",K.Chaudhuri@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,"Sen, Rituparna/K-5821-2019","Sen, Rituparna/0000-0002-2112-7532; Chaudhuri, Kausik/0000-0002-7492-1369",,,,,38,0,0,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

As a consequence, many policy makers and Central Banks are afraid of vulnerabilities of their countries arising from external risk drivers. In this paper we develop a multi-regime global VAR model to study the spillover effects in financial markets, in goods markets and between financial markets and goods markets across countries, which are assumed to be either in a high financial stress regime or in a low financial stress regime. It turns out that in both the high and the low stress regimes financial shocks to a country, big or small one, can have large and persistent impacts on financial markets of other countries, and only in the high stress regime financial shocks to a country can have some negative output effects on other countries. In the high stress regime output shocks of a big country can have larger effects on financial conditions than those of a small country, while in the low stress regime output shocks of a country, big or small, have little impact on financial conditions. Further, we study the effects of global and regional shocks, as well as the spillover effects of national monetary policies and internationally coordinated policies on the financial and real sectors) (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The current regimes give rise to various instate and interstate spillovers, which violate the basic tenets-neutrality and subsidiarity-of the single market. The trade-offs between the implications of these tenets-harmonization and diversity, respectively-can be reconciled by a bottom-up strategy of strengthening source-based taxation and narrowing differences in tax rates. The strategy starts with dual income taxation, proceeds with final source withholding taxes and rate coordination, and is made complete by comprehensive business income taxation.

During phases of optimism, credit is abundant, access to production capital is easy, the cash-in-advance constraint is lax, risks are undervalued, and production is booming. Upon reversal in market sentiment, the contraction is quick and deep. More over, the model is capable of replicating the stylized fact of a long and sustained simultaneous growth in credit, production and asset prices observed in the US since mid1990's.

While these suggestions have strong advantages, they also potentially increase the financial costs associated with data collection and, as a result, hamper the growth of experimental economics and limit the questions that may be addressed using experimental methods. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of extra credit as a reward medium as it is financially less taxing and readily available to most researchers as an alternative. We focus on experimental asset markets because data is particularly costly to collect for these experiments, e.g., a market consisting of 8-12 traders interacting over 15 trading periods is an independent observation. Our treatment variable is the reward medium, either extra credit or cash. We compare bubble measures in the two treatments and we find that bubbles observed in the extra-credit sessions are not significantly different from bubbles observed in the cash sessions. These results suggest that extra credit is an effective reward medium in experimental asset markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model endogenises pricing decisions by firms, wage setting by unions and interest rate setting by banks on both firm and interbank lending. Banks also set leverage targets and precautionary liquidity buffers on the basis of internal risk models. Our model produces endogenous fluctuations driven by the pricing behaviour of firms and the wage setting behaviour of unions. Fluctuations lead to loan defaults which are exacerbated as lenders reduce lending and charge higher interest rates, inducing a credit crunch. We also study how making the inter-banking network more connected affects the key outcomes of the economy and find that while the flow of funds from surplus banks to firms can be increased, the latter effect is soon dominated by increasing instability in the real sector as firms default at higher rates. While the banking sector experiences fewer defaults as a whole, losses on the interbank market increase as a source of bank defaults. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, after the realization of a relatively poor fit between the product and the consumers' taste, an introductory price is optimal from an ex-post perspective.

Then, using these estimated preferences, we compute and compare different well-being rankings corresponding to different ways of measuring well-being.

The findings of this paper suggest that countries with better institutions and high information flows receive high capital flows, and information flows also provides a partial explanation to the Lucas Paradox. The latter result is significant even after controlling for institutional quality, financial openness and human capital differences across countries, and using instrumental variable for information flows. This paper also examines the indirect effects of institutional quality on capital flows per capita through its impact on information flows and finds that countries with better institutional quality have higher levels of information flow. Accounting this indirect effect is economically important and papers that do not account for this indirect effect of institutions on capital flows per capita would underestimate the effect of institutions on capital flows per capita. Findings of this paper suggest that relatively poorer countries should improve their institutional quality and increase their access to worldwide information and promote investments in communications infrastructure to attract long-term capital flows.

This article combines two rich firm-level data sets to analyze the effect of a dense geographical concentration of industries on the innovativeness and productivity of firms. The results show that increased concentration of employment in the same industry (localization) is associated with higher innovation output and higher productivity. At the same time, however, a higher number of firms in the same industry are associated with lower innovation output and lower productivity. These two findings are visible within a distance of 500m away from the respective firms, but then vanish for longer distances. Furthermore, the article finds no evidence that increased concentration of employment in other industries (urbanization) is positively related to higher innovation output. In contrast, increased concentration of employment in other industries is strongly related to higher productivity, whereby this effect extends to large distances of up to 10 km. The results of the article thus suggest that those agglomeration externalities operating over longer distances, such as labor market pooling, work mostly across industries, while the comparatively more local knowledge spillovers tend to work mostly within industries.","[Ruffner, Jan; Spescha, Andrin] Eidgenossi Tech Hsch Zurich KOF Konjunkturforsch, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Ruffner, J (通讯作者)，Eidgenossi Tech Hsch Zurich KOF Konjunkturforsch, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",ruffner@kof.ethz.ch; spescha@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

Why have Ukrainian women, at the rear of the armed conflict in Donbas, volunteered to care for wounded or sick soldiers? Their commitment to volunteering has arisen out of the encounter between everyday emotional, affective and sentimental experiences and their sociological and biographical characteristics. Thanks to a particular attention paid to practices of their profane caregiving, light is also shed on the ties created among the care-givers themselves and, too, between them and hospitalized soldiers. The affective intensity of this experience (which extends to circles of sociability, love, family life and volunteer activities) makes it hard for these women to imagine being demobilized as long as the conflict continues, despite the occupational and financial marginalization to which their commitment exposes them.","[Shukan, Ioulia] Univ Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France; [Shukan, Ioulia] Inst Sci Sociales Polit ISP, Nanterre, France",,"Shukan, I (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.;Shukan, I (通讯作者)，Inst Sci Sociales Polit ISP, Nanterre, France.",ioulia.shukan@parisnanterre.fr,,,,,,,42,1,1,1,2,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Factor-augmented vector autoregressions are estimated with three separate factors identified. They are: real, monetary and financial factors. The main conclusion is that there is no 'one size fits all' when interpreting the domestic responses to an exchange rate shock. International policies that aim to define a particular exchange rate or exchange rate regime are unlikely to be able to deal with so many idiosyncratic responses. Nor is it the case that a particular monetary policy strategy, such as inflation targeting, can immunize a domestic economy against all external shocks. International cooperation should instead encourage individual economies to seek out the menu of policies that ensure that each ones house is in order.","[Siklos, Pierre L.] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Siklos, Pierre L.] Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Waterloo,"Siklos, PL (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada.;Siklos, PL (通讯作者)，Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",psiklos@wlu.ca,,,Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research,Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research,"I am grateful to the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research for financial support under their HIGMR seminar where an earlier version of this paper was presented, and to the Editor as well as four HKIMR working paper 2005-17.

In this article, we investigate this hypothesis using a dynamic model of political economy. As well as formalizing this argument, our model demonstrates its limits, elucidating a robust theoretical force making democracy less stable in societies with high social mobility: when the median voter expects to move up (respectively down), she would prefer to give less voice to poorer (respectively richer) social groups. Our theoretical analysis shows that in the presence of social mobility, the political preferences of an individual depend on the potentially conflicting preferences of her future selves, and that the evolution of institutions is determined through the implicit interaction between occupants of the same social niche at different points in time.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwestern University; University of Chicago; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023; Sonin, Konstantin/C-1146-2014; Sonin, Konstantin/Q-5660-2019","Sonin, Konstantin/0000-0003-1581-9951","Army Research Office, ARO MURI [W911NF-12-1-0509]; Carnegie Foundation","Army Research Office, ARO MURI(MURI); Carnegie Foundation","Acemoglu gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Army Research Office, ARO MURI W911NF-12-1-0509, and the Carnegie Foundation.",,47,25,27,1,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Positive productivity gains are often attributed to productivity spillovers; however, an alternative, much less emphasized channel is selection and market reallocation., whereby competition leads to factor and revenue reallocation within and between domestic firms and exits of the least productive firms. We investigate the roles of these different mechanisms in determining aggregate-productivity gains using a unifying framework that explores the mechanisms' distinct predictions on the distributions of domestic firms: within-firm productivity improvement shifts rightward or reshapes the productivity distribution, while selection and market reallocation move the revenue and employment distributions leftward and raise left truncations. Using a rich cross-country firm-level panel dataset, we find significant evidence of both mechanisms and effects of competition in product, technology, and labor space. However, selection and market reallocation account for the majority of aggregate-productivity gains, suggesting ignoring this channel could lead to substantial bias in understanding-the nature of productivity gains from multinational production.","[Alfaro, Laura] Harvard Sch Business, Morgan 461, Boston, MA 02445 USA; [Alfaro, Laura] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Chen, Maggie X.] George Washington Univ, 2115 G St 367 NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; George Washington University,"Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Morgan 461, Boston, MA 02445 USA.;Alfaro, L (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",lalfaro@hbs.edu; xchen@gwu.edu,,,World Bank Structural Transformation and Economic Growth project,World Bank Structural Transformation and Economic Growth project,"We are very grateful to four anonymous referees for insightful comments and suggestions.

Results show this to be the case: lower ability participants receive lower payoffs and are over-represented at the worst school. Under the strategy-proof Deferred Acceptance mechanism, payoff differences are reduced, and ability distributions across schools harmonized. Hence, we find support for the argument that a strategy-proof mechanism levels the playing field.

This paper proposes a small open economy model for a net commodity exporter to quantitatively study the triggers of these cycles. The economy consists of two sectors, one of which produces commodities with prices subject to exogenous international fluctuations. These fluctuations affect both the competitiveness of the economy and its borrowing terms, as higher commodity prices are associated with lower spreads between the country's borrowing rate and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly positive effects of commodity price increases on GDP, consumption, and investment, and a negative effect on the total trade balance. Furthermore, they generate excess volatility of consumption over output and a large volatility of investment. Besides explicitly incorporating a double role of commodity prices, the model structure nests the various candidate sources of shocks proposed in previous work on emerging economy business cycles. Estimating the model on Argentine data, we find that the contribution of commodity price shocks to fluctuations in post-1950 output growth is in the order of 38%. In addition, commodity prices account for around 42% and 61% of the variation in consumption and investment growth, respectively. We find transitory productivity shocks to be an important driver of output fluctuations, exceeding the contribution of shocks to the trend, which, though smaller, is not negligible.

This article presents, specifies and develops the model's underlying macroeconomic theory. The Rehn-Meidner theory is a synthesis between a flex-price Kaldorian model of profit margins and a Kaleckian model where profit margins are squeezed under full-employment conditions. The theory deviates from both the Kaldorian and Kaleckian models by stressing the importance of low profit margins for productivity growth. Moreover, in the Rehn-Meidner program, full employment is guaranteed irrespective of the level of aggregate demand. The Rehn-Meidner theory and policy deserve a prominent place in macroeconomics even in the age of globalization and financialization. However, some weaknesses of the model make it necessary to modify the arguments for and partly the composition of its policy program.","[Erixon, Lennart] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Erixon, L (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Econ, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",lex@ne.su.se,,,,,,,79,9,9,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1805 fitness centre clients. A confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group analysis was performed to test the difference between two invariance models. The findings indicate a greater weight in facilities and employees of the quality perceived from private low-cost fitness centres and a greater weight in programmes from public fitness centres.

An often proposed solution to motivating employees in multidimensional environments is for organizations to use incentive compensation. Incentive compensation can both direct employees' attention (attention-directing property) and motivate their effort levels (effort-inducing property) but incentive compensation might not always be optimal in multi-dimensional settings. Thus, it is important to better understand the two proposed properties of incentive compensation through which incentive compensation motivates employee performance. Conducting an experiment in a multidimensional environment that contains quantity and quality task dimensions, we find that the incremental effectiveness of the effort-inducing property over the attention-directing property on performance quantity and performance quality varies depending on the task dimension toward which attention is directed and effort is induced. Specifically, the effort-inducing property has a positive incremental effect over the attention-directing property on performance quality when the quality dimension is incentivized; however, the effort-inducing property does not have a positive incremental effect over the attention-directing property on performance quantity when the quantity dimension is incentivized. This study provides important insight regarding the properties of incentive compensation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Several variants of fictitious play including regret matching, generalized regret matching and smooth fictitious play, are known to be Hannan consistent.

The model endogenizes debt exclusion and provides a theory of reentry and a theory of debt dynamics within the exclusion period. It explains why countries may end up more indebted after the exclusion period. It offers an interpretation for the mixed evidence on the correlation between default probability and indebtedness.

Under what we term a sound finance rule' the interest rate targets output while the fiscal balance targets public debt; under a functional finance rule' the budget balance targets the output gap and the interest rate targets the debt ratio. The same unique combination of interest rate and fiscal balance will be consistent with output at potential and a constant debt-GDP ratio regardless of which instrument is assigned to which target. The stability characteristics of the two rules differ, however. At low levels of debt, both rules converge to the targets, but there is a threshold debt level above which only the functional finance rule converges. Contrary to conventional wisdom, therefore, the case for countercyclical fiscal policy becomes stronger, not weaker, when the ratio of public debt to GDP is already high. We apply our framework to describe the possibility of policy-generated cycles in the United States over the past five decades.","[Mason, J.

By paying return costs, the consumers may return less-preferred items and obtain refunds. The consumers shop sequentially and their shopping strategy is similar to the search strategy of a consumer in a sequential costly search model. Thus, the pricing strategies of firms are identical to those in a price-directed sequential search model. Price competition is more intense, and the symmetric equilibrium price is lower when returns are costlier. As a result, consumer surplus is increasing in the return cost. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical analysis is based on a state space model with time-varying coefficients, which is employed on a dataset from 11 New EU Member States. It is shown that the impact of consumer confidence (reflecting the overall uncertainty level in the country) skyrockets in the 2008 Great Recession, providing evidence that the recent crisis was to some extent psychologically governed. After that, the influence of consumer confidence on GDP mostly stabilizes at earlier levels. The EU accession seems not to play an important role in the observed relationship. The obtained conclusions are quite robust across countries and remain intact upon the inclusion of additional control variables in the model. A possible solution for keeping the psychological determinants of the crisis under control is a prompt, coherent, and clearly communicated crisis management policy, which might help preventing a momentous drop of consumer confidence and overall uncertainty.","[Soric, Petar] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Soric, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Trg JF Kennedya 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",psoric@efzg.hr,"Soric, Petar/AAB-9026-2019","Soric, Petar/0000-0002-6773-264X",Croatian Science Foundation [3858],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project No. 3858.,,30,19,19,1,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2018,45.0,2,,,,,261,282,,10.1007/s10663-016-9360-4,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GD0FR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430176500003,0

Income polarization can be closely linked to social exclusion, which is relevant for EU social policy, because combatting social exclusion is a central element of the Lisbon Agenda and the Europe 2020 Strategy. Rising income polarization has been observed outside Europe, but within the EU, polarization is relatively unexplored. This paper provides theoretical insights into this relatively new dimension of income distribution and analyzes trends in income polarization in 28 EU countries and 3 non-EU countries, using micro-data from EU-SILC over the period 2004-2012. Income polarization is rather stable over this period in European countries, and Europe-wide. It was rising among the old EU15 countries in the sub-period 2004-2008, but declining afterwards. The opposite development is witnessed for New Member States. Despite the Great Recession we find quite stable income polarization in Europe.","[Wang, Jinxian; Caminada, Koen; Goudswaard, Kees] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Wang, Chen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Urban & Reg Sci, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wang.chen@mail.shufe.edu.cn,,,Chinese Scholarship Council; Natural Science Foundation of China [71703088]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M591645]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [17PJC045],Chinese Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"Leiden University, Leiden University, Leiden University, and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, respectively.

The Chinese Government is very powerful, and fiscal policy plays an important role in China's economy. A dynamic Nelson-Siegel model is adopted to estimate the level, slope and curvature factors of the yield curve. Three aspects of fiscal behaviour, including government spending, revenue and budget balance, are considered. Significant relationships between fiscal behaviour and the sovereign yield curve are found and described in the present study. Higher government expenditure raises the level and slope factors of the yield curve, while increasing government revenue reduces the level factor and enhances the slope factor. Furthermore, improved budget balance decreases the level and slope factors of the yield curve. Fiscal behaviour also interacts with the macroeconomy in China. Fiscal policy is insensitive to price surges in contrast to the strong responses of monetary policy to higher inflation. In addition, crowding-out effects of government spending are demonstrated in this study.","[Yan, Yifeng; Guo, Ju'e] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Yan, YF (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",yanyifeng0123@163.com,,,,,,,34,5,5,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

In this setting, more productive firms respond less to shocks affecting their marginal costs than less productive firms. As a consequence, economies with a larger proportion of highly productive firms face a flatter Phillips curve. Moreover, when these two features concur, the Ramsey problem gives rise to an optimal non-zero long run inflation that amplifies the differences in relative prices between more efficient and less efficient firms, thus increasing the market share of the former. Nevertheless, in the presence of transitory technology shocks, optimal short term deviations from this positive long run inflation are negligible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When global banks have higher/lower market power in one economy than the others, they don't shift funds across countries by as much in response to shocks, and the economies become more stable with robust lending. The reason is that increasing (decreasing) loans causes a sharper decrease (increase) in global banks' returns in the economy where they have high market power. It is at moderate levels of market power at which global banks (unlike domestic banks that only lend locally) substantially reallocate funds across countries and generate high volatility. This finding, unlike the usual unidirectional relationships in the literature, implies that countries should either allow few large global banks to dominate their credit markets or minimize their exposure to global banking.

By means of a counterfactual analysis, we also point to worsening economic and income inequality conditions for all the EA countries, only partially ensued from austerity policies.

On the one hand there is evidence of dynamic structural change including offshoring/globalization and technological advances that are resulting in the loss of middle-skill (routine) employment. Other studies emphasize a less dynamic economy with slower growth, reduced labor market fluidity, a decline in startup activity, and even economic stagnation. This study exploits variation among U.S. states to assess the degree that stagnation and/or important structural changes in the economy contribute to the recent phenomenon of jobless recoveries. We find support for both the stagnation and structural change theories of jobless recoveries. On the stagnation side, we find evidence that lower startup rates are a significant predictor of jobless recoveries. We also find evidence that links dynamic structural change to the jobless recovery phenomenon. More specifically states experiencing a long-run downward trend in the share of routine employment are more likely to experience a jobless recovery. Our results are consistent with the polarization theory where routine-replacing technological advances permanently reduce demand for middle-skill labor, thus contributing to jobless recoveries.

We overcome several econometric issues such as the problems of unobserved heterogeneity, persistence, and endogeneity by adopting the system GMM estimator for linear dynamic panel models. We document that firm-specific characteristics drive growth in the ICT industry, contrary to the well-known Gibrat's law. In particular, we find compelling evidence that in the U.S. ICT industry, firm growth depends on firm size. Differing from most findings in the literature, however, small firms in the ICT industry do not grow faster than large firms. We find a non-linear and concave-in-size relationship between growth and size. We also find that: a) firm growth exhibits positive persistence; b) agency costs and financial leverage impede firm growth; and c) R&D investment and financial performance facilitate growth. As expected, the Great Recession (2007-2009) curbed firm growth in the ICT industry.","[Canarella, Giorgio; Miller, Stephen M.] Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas,"Miller, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Lee Business Sch, Dept Econ, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",giorgio.canarella@unlv.edu; stephen.miller@unlv.edu,"Miller, Stephen M/H-8251-2019","Miller, Stephen M/0000-0002-6754-0605",,,,,128,28,29,4,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Temporary alliance occurs when a local organization strategically affiliates with the national organization only to break away after accumulating enough capital. Alliance is more likely to arise and persist when the local chapter is smaller, when the local chapter's mission is closer to the national organization's, when the national organization is more efficient in production, and when the local chapter is more patient. Moreover, regulation that requires the local chapter to be affiliated with the national organization would be welfare reducing when the local chapter is large, when the local and national missions differ substantially, and when production at the national organization is inefficient.","[Chen, Jiawei] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Sacks, Michael] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Sacks, Michael] West Virginia Univ, Ctr Free Enterprise, 1601 Univ Ave,POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; West Virginia University; West Virginia University,"Chen, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",jiaweic@uci.edu; michael.sacks@mail.wvu.edu,"Chen, Jiawei/AEC-3274-2022; Sacks, Michael/JXN-1753-2024","Chen, Jiawei/0000-0001-6116-7232;",,,,,37,1,1,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Contrary to the cross-country results, we find that states with higher levels of economic freedom have lower rates of participation in exercise.","[Hall, Joshua C.; Humphreys, Brad R.; Ruseski, Jane E.] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Hall, JC (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",joshua.hall@mail.wvu.edu; brhumphreys@mail.wvu.edu; jane.ruseski@mail.wvu.edu,"Humphreys, Brad R/P-3340-2019; Ruseski, Jane/A-8811-2014","Humphreys, Brad R/0000-0003-0099-7237; Ruseski, Jane/0000-0002-7034-2597",Charles G.

This paper evaluates the keeping up with the Joneses phenomenon, examining the responsiveness of payment-to-income ratios for different debt types across the income distribution to changes in income among affluent households. The analysis provides evidence for the responsiveness of debt to rising top incomes. Middle- and upper-middle-income households take on more housing-related debt and have higher payments in places with higher top-income levels. Among lower-income households non-mortgage borrowing and debt payments decline, consistent with restrictions in the supply of credit.

Palfrey (1984) famously argued that if third candidate entry is expected after the two main candidates choose their platforms, the unique equilibrium is such that the two main candidates locate substantially far from each other. By conducting a laboratory experiment, we put this popular idea to test, for the first time. We allow entry to take place with four different probabilities and find that, indeed, the degree of polarization of the two main candidates' platforms increases as third candidate entry becomes more likely to occur, providing strong evidence in support of Palfrey (1984)'s formal results and underlying intuition.

We build a fully-fledged heterogeneous-agent model with an endogenous financial market of private credit and debt to rationalize these stylized facts. We show how financial development that promotes better credit allocations under more relaxed borrowing constraints can reduce the impact of non-financial shocks (such as TFP shocks, government spending shocks, preference shocks) on aggregate output and investment, and why this volatility-reducing effect diminishes with continuing financial liberalizations. Our simple model also sheds light on a number of other important issues, such as the Great Moderation and the simultaneously rising trends of dispersions in sales growth and stock returns for publicly traded firms.

We allow output elasticities and technical efficiency to depend on EF, estimate a smooth coefficient stochastic production frontier, and compare with parametric alternatives. Our results highlight the flexibility of semiparametric approaches as we find parametric approaches are too restrictive in estimating marginal productivity. Output elasticities of labor, human capital, and physical capital vary with the level of EF and our average efficiency estimates are at least 20% higher than those obtained from parametric counterparts.

(2018) criticise the balance-of-payments (BoP) view of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) crisis. I have no major objections to most of the single aspects of the crisis pointed out by these authors, except that they appear to underline specific sides of the EMU crisis, while missing a unifying and realistic explanation. Specific semi-automatic mechanisms differentiate a BoP crisis in a currency union from a traditional one. Unfortunately, these mechanisms give Febrero et al. the illusion that a BoP crisis in a currency union is impossible. My conclusion is that an interpretation of the eurozone's troubles as a BoP crisis provides a more consistent framework. The debate has some relevance for the policy prescriptions to solve the eurocrisis. Given the costs that all sides would incur if the currency union were to break up, austerity policies are still seen by European politicians as a tolerable price to pay to keep foreign imbalances at bay-with the sweetener of some European Central Bank (ECB) support, for as long as Berlin allows the ECB to provide it.","[Cesaratto, Sergio] Univ Siena, Econ, Siena, Italy",University of Siena,"Cesaratto, S (通讯作者)，Univ Siena, Econ, Siena, Italy.",,"Cesaratto, Sergio/JEF-9123-2023",,,,,,46,3,3,0,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Separately, however, these two frameworks deliver a limited amount of wage stickiness and thus require questionable calibrations to raise unemployment fluctuations. In this paper, we argue that the alternating offers model with one-sided asymmetric information, which combines the two frameworks, gives a more satisfactory answer to the puzzle. The results are improved along two dimensions. First, we show that this model is capable to generate large unemployment movements for a realistic calibration. Secondly, the model produces a right degree of real wage pro-cyclicality for such a calibration and therefore delivers a micro-founded explanation to real wage rigidities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using panel data on the income-emission-democracy nexus in 17 MENA countries from 1980 to 2005, we find evidence that improvements in the democratic development of the MENA countries help to mitigate environmental problems.

A social accounting matrix (SAM) was constructed and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model was developed. The CGE model was used to simulate separate and combined effects of a 25% reduction of subsidy to three energy products: natural gas, oil, and electricity. This policy shock was applied to the model in two scenarios. In each round, the subsidy reductions were applied to each energy product separately in turn and then finally simultaneously to all energy products. In the first scenario, subsidy reductions were applied and results were compared with the baseline scenario given in the SAM. This yielded adverse effects across a range of endogenous variables. It leads to large energy price increases, as high as 255% (for electricity). Gross Domestic Product (GDP) marginally declined, by 0.28%. In scenario 2, the subsidy reduction was accompanied with cash transfers to energy users a compensation for welfare loss, the amount of transfer was equivalent to the sum of the amount of subsidy reductions. The results indicated that such transfers would reduce the adverse effects of the policy reform. The effects on GDP was reversed, it rose by 1.01%. The price effect was slightly lower, electricity price rose by 245%. Finally, sensitivity of the model results was examined by varying the elasticity of the substitution of composite energy and capital in production. Greater possibility of substitution seems to cause subsidy reform to have much larger positive (or smaller adverse) economy-wide effects. The simulation experiments suggest that subsidy reform would need to be accompanied by demand side stimulus or supply side initiatives to encourage energy conservation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The introduction of actuarial adjustments in the German public pension system serves as a source of exogenous variation to estimate discrete time transition rates into retirement for individuals of age 60-66. Responses to benefit reductions are elaborated separately for manual and non-manual workers. On average, individuals postpone retirement by 13.2 months if pension benefits are reduced by 3.6 percent for each year of early retirement. This result is in line with the previous quasi-experimental literature and suggests that people respond to the incentive of reducing the implicit tax on further periods of work. However, among men the response is about 50 percent lower for manual workers compared to non-manual workers. Surprisingly, this does not necessarily indicate that retirement incomes of manual workers deteriorate. The explanation is that disability pensions are available at age 63without benefit reductions.","[Giesecke, Matthias] RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany",,"Giesecke, M (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",mattias.giesecke@rwi-essen.de,,,RGS Econ; Leibniz Association,RGS Econ; Leibniz Association,"I am grateful to John Abowd, Thomas K.

To achieve this goal, this paper uses an interregional input-output model, estimated for the Brazilian economy for the year 2004. The results of our analysis show that the sectors with the greatest importance in terms of emissions are cattle and soybean production, which are also the most prominent for the region's economic development. Although 63% of Brazil's anthropogenic emissions of CO2eq were concentrated in the Amazon Region, under a consumer perspective the region's responsibility corresponded to only 24% of emissions in the country, being surpassed by the consumer-based emissions of rest of Brazil (49%), as well as that belonging to foreign countries by means of exports (27%). This poses a dilemma that needs to be faced not only by Brazil but also by developed nations, as the burden of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the Brazilian Amazon region cannot be put only on the poor population of the region.","[Imori, Denise; Martins Guilhoto, Joaquim Jose; Waisman, Caio] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ FEA, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Martins Guilhoto, Joaquim Jose] Univ Illinois, REAL, 67 Mumford Hall,1301 W Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Imori, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ FEA, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",denise.imori@usp.br; guilhoto@usp.br; cwaisman@usp.br,"Guilhoto, Joaquim J M/B-9704-2012",,,,,,34,0,1,1,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We find that endowment heterogeneities limit the efficiency gains from these rule-based contribution schemes under random allocation. Under effort-based allocations, substantial efficiency gains relative to a VCM occur. These are largely driven by significant reductions of contributions in VCM, while the rule-based mechanisms generate stable efficiency levels, even though falling short in realizing the maximal efficiency gains.

We develop a computationally tractable stochastic version of that model wherein workers accumulate skills on the job and face a risk of skill loss after job destruction. We find that skill heterogeneity dampens the fluctuations of labor market variables, and that introducing skill loss offsets this effect and generates additional amplification. The main forces driving this result are pro-cyclical increases in the probability of skill loss during unemployment: these provide incentives to post proportionally more vacancies during upturns by raising the surplus from employing high-skill workers. Compositional changes in the unemployment pool, on the other hand, play a negligible role for empirically plausible rates of skill depreciation, which imply a relatively slow process compared to the duration of unemployment spells.

The dynamic generalized method-of-moments (GMM) results indicate that institutions play an important role in mediating the positive relationship between banking sector development and growth. This suggests that the marginal impact of financial development on growth depends on institutional quality. Using the four-way partition of institutions classified by Rodrik (2005), we also find that resilient market-regulating, market-stabilizing, and market-creating institutions act as mediators to the financial market in facilitating growth.

We do so for full sample of countries and then for developing Asia sample to access which factors are relevant for full sample and for developing Asia specifically. The estimation results show that per capita income, rule of law, and demographic characteristics significantly affect financial inclusion for both world and Asia samples. However, primary education completion and literacy significantly increases financial inclusion only in the full sample, not for the Asian sample. The findings also indicate that financial inclusion is significantly correlated with lower poverty and income inequality levels for the full sample.

Sourcing substitution reduced the prices paid by wholesale level buyers of these goods, but these price reductions were mostly not captured in the U.S. import price indexes and the U.S. GDP deflator. To find plausible values for sourcing bias we first use data on changes in sourcing patterns over 1997-2007 to predict the effect of the reported price discount from the new emerging market suppliers. Next, we compare adjusted import price indexes for products used for household consumption with consumer price indexes. In the GDP deflator for apparel imports, sourcing bias is found to average 0.6 percent per year, and for durable goods it averages 1 percent per year. During the decade of rapidly changing sourcing patterns, a tenth of the reported speedup in multifactor productivity growth of the U.S. private business sector may have come from sourcing bias in the deflators for imports.","[Reinsdorf, Marshall] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Reinsdorf, M (通讯作者)，6709 Kerns Rd, Falls Church, VA 22042 USA.",Marshall.Reinsdorf@cox.net,,"Reinsdorf, Marshall/0000-0002-3866-6591",,,,,31,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

This joint volume-price risk causes a risk-averse WPP to sell less energy than the expected generation, which discourages the WPP from fully enjoying the benefits of participating in forward electricity markets. In order to mitigate volume-price risks from the RT market, this paper proposes a financial instrument referred to as a risk exchange (REX) that enables the WPPs to trade random net payments from uncertain prices and generation outputs, after the day-ahead market is cleared. A negotiation for the REX is modeled by a bargaining game based on a conflict of interest in determining the REX amounts. Both Nash and Rubinstein's bargaining game models are addressed to analyze the REX bargaining game. It is shown that there is a unique outcome of the game which can be achieved by using a pure strategy. Moreover, a central planner who aims to minimize the aggregated risks of the WPPs is explored. Numerical examples demonstrate that the REX is able to reduce RTM risks successfully and encourages the WPPs to sell more energy to the DAM. Since the REX is not limited by physical constraints in power systems, it can be traded by the WPPs exposed to different locational marginal prices (LMP5). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal mechanism is implemented by a revenue tax that increases with the price cap. If the asymmetric information has large support, then the optimal mechanism consists of a laissez-faire regime for low-cost firms. That is, the firm's price cap corresponds to that of an unregulated monopolist, and it is not taxed.

Unlike previous papers, they find that the piracy rate is positively correlated with the tax burden rate but negatively correlated with the domestic market size and exports over GDP. The authors also separate the impacts of education and R&D on piracy, and find two effects with opposite signs. Moreover, they find that those countries with smaller, more efficient bureaucracies are likely to protect intellectual property more effectively.

Instead of a comprehensive approach, we focus on three elements. First, we study beliefs and values about the economic system present in Peron's speeches during the period 1943-55. Second, given that these beliefs are non-standard (for economists), we present two models formalizing some of the key aspects (for example, the idea that there is something more than a material exchange in labor relations). Third, we study survey data for the 1990s on the beliefs of Peronist and non-Peronist voters in Argentina and Democrat and Republican voters in the US. While income and education suggest that Peronists (in relative terms) look like the Democrats, their beliefs and values suggest that Peronists are the Argentine equivalent of the Republicans.","[Di Tella, Rafael] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Di Tella, Rafael] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Dubra, Juan] Univ Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidad de Montevideo,"Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Di Tella, R (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rditella@hbs.edu,"Dubra, Juan/Q-2846-2019",,Canadian Institute for Advanced Research,Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)),"We thank Esteban Aranda for suggestions and exceptional research assistance, and Andres Velasco for introducing us to Acario Cotapos.

The empirical investigation is conducted in the context of the modified cross-correlation function testing procedure of Hong (2001), after removing the influence of relevant regional and international factors and controlling for structural breaks in the conditional volatility process of either market. The results reveal the presence of mean and volatility spillovers from natural gas prices to stock prices in Qatar's emerging market, with the opposite direction being denied. The speed with which the stock market absorbs and reacts to variations in gas prices turns out to be somewhat slow. The findings have important implications for investors and policymakers.

In this way, by incorporating the behavioral responses of parents, teachers, and policymakers, the paper provides a rationale for the existing ambiguous empirical evidence on the effect of school resources.

While the academic literature has identified several factors behind the growth in unfunded state and local public pension liabilities, there is mixed evidence on how the composition of a pension system's board of trustees affects a pension's financial health. This article contributes to this literature by measuring how public pension board composition affects fund financial health as measured by state bond ratings. With a panel dataset of state pensions between 2001 and 2014 our results indicate that elected board members are consistently associated with lower bond ratings (and thus higher borrowing costs) while appointed and ex-officio board members are associated with higher bond ratings.

We identify its substantial medium-to-long run, pro-cylical swings and show that most of its variance lies beyond business-cycle frequencies. We explore the extent to which these empirical regularities can be explained by a calibrated micro-founded, nonlinear growth model with normalized CES technology and endogenous labor- and capital augmenting technical change driven by purposeful directed R&D investments. We demonstrate that dynamic macroeconomic trade-offs created by arrivals of both types of new technologies can lead to prolonged swings in the labor share (and other model variables) due to oscillatory convergence to the balanced growth path as well as emergence of limit cycles via Hopf bifurcations.

This study analyzes the macroeconomic and distributional effects of these government programs. We propose a quantitative model where households endogenously choose their mortgage types either with or without government guarantees. Households that take out mortgages with government guarantees pay an up-front insurance premium, while those that choose mortgages without guarantees face borrowing limits. Our results show that a hypothetical decline in government subsidies for mortgage guarantee programs can improve aggregate household welfare, mainly due to endogenous changes in mortgage interest rates and tax burdens, rather than in housing prices. The welfare implications are different across households, depending on their financial status. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has shown that the 1994 genocide reduced primary schooling in the short-term, but the long-term effects are not known. To identify the causal effect of the genocide, I analyze data from four cross-sectional household surveys and use a difference-in-differences identification strategy that exploits variation in conflict intensity across localities. I find that children whose educational attainment had been negatively affected by the genocide eventually caught up. By 2010, there were no detectable effects of the genocide on completed years of education. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce a theoretical link from imperfect information about WCR to firms' performance. Firms choose non-prepaid factors of production with uncertainty about required prepayments, where their access to credit is constrained by collateral. After realization, firms with higher WCR may face financial constraints. This uncertainty influences their demand for inputs, albeit risk-neutrality. Unable to employ the projected level of prepaid input, constrained firms encounter capacity underutilization, leading to misallocation of factors. Aggregate productivity and output, will thus be deteriorated during credit contraction due to higher inefficiency. Empirical assessment of our findings, using the Annual Survey of Iranian Manufacturing Enterprises, shows that higher requirement for working capital tightens firms' hired prepaid inputs, production, and capacity utilization. Furthermore, firms with more uncertain working capital will choose a lower level of production. These results are especially scaled up, when firms face financial constraints.

We focus in particular on whether the model can, in general equilibrium, produce a hump-shaped lifecycle consumption profile with a peak that matches data for the average U.S. consumer. For a simple four-period model, we show that an increasing income profile along with exogenously imposed retirement are sufficient to induce a hump. With no other mechanism that can account for a hump besides bounded rationality, the model best fits the salient features of consumption data with a planning horizon of 20 years, which is well-supported by the behavioral evidence found in surveys on retirement planning. Finally, we show that the age of the consumption peak is robust to the introduction of Social Security, mortality risk, and another species of bounded rationality, quasihyperbolic discounting. Moreover, Soda! Security can be welfare improving with a short planning horizon. We can calibrate the model to jointly explain the timing of the consumption hump and the optimality of the current Social Security system. With quasihyperbolic discounting instead, we can calibrate the model so the current Social Security system is optimal but we cannot also account for the timing of the consumption hump. If we add quasihyperbolic discounting in addition to a short planning horizon, the present bias has a negligible effect in equilibrium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To date, scale efficiency measurements have only been suggested for the entire production process. For multi-output producers, more detailed results are required. Hence, in this paper, we show how to provide such information at the output level. Attractively, our output-specific scale efficiency measurements are nonparametric in nature, they take the economic objective of the producers into account, they can be defined without observing the input prices, and they are easy to interpret and to use in practice. We apply our methodology to a sample of more than 3300 US electricity plants from 1998 to 2012, producing up to 10 types of electricity. We show that, while there is a scale improvement at the total electricity generation level, this is not the case for each of the 10 types of electricity. Also, we demonstrate that, in general, renewable electricity presents better scale of production than non-renewable electricity. Finally, we highlight the importance of multi-output plants in the US electricity sector, and show that this type of plant is preferable for the production of non-renewable electricity, while single-output plants are preferable for renewable electricity.

Modeling trade intermediaries as increasing marginal costs but decreasing fixed costs of exporting, we find that only firms with the highest quality-adjusted productivity levels choose to export directly. Under certain parameter restrictions, the model shows that direct exporters tend to be larger and charge higher prices for their goods.

Currency devaluation policy (against the US dollar) can non-linearly enlarge the positive contribution of trade openness and public debt on international reserves, and non-linearly reduce the negative impact of terms of trade on international reserves, as the Marshall-Lerner condition holds.

For the analysis purpose, researchers have employed error correction model to examine the short-run association amongst the variables; however, Johansen cointegration was used to investigate the long run association amongst the variables. The Granger causality approach has been applied to check the causal directionality between the pair of variables. Results of analysis exhibited that in a long run 1% increase in exports and imports cause 0.63% and 0.57% increase in the CPI (inflation) correspondingly. However, the coefficient of predictable error correlation signifies that approximately 1.18% deviance of inflation rate through the long run level of equilibrium has been adjusted every year. Whereas, the outcomes of variance decomposition analysis (VDA) demonstrated that exports employed the highest innovation influence on the CPI (inflation) amongst all three indicators in the overall arrangement of inflation.

We argue that the flexibility unconstrained firms have is valuable. Our empirical results indicate that UC firms outperform FC firms up to 36 months after the acquisition.

To assess validity of this hypothesis we construct and estimate a simple VAR model. The data for this model is acquired from results of an experimental study (lasted for 70 rounds), the purpose of which is to identify behavioral patterns of participants while meeting demand for credit, specifics of subjectively weighted assessment of credit risk, based on shock approach. The results of the study allow confirming institutional memory hypothesis. After initial shock of bad debts, number of periods to recover willingness to accept risk has increased by 39%, which supports the hypothesis of availability heuristic's influence. However, with improvement of loan portfolio's quality, willingness to take risk is restoring. In addition, we managed to confirm existence of risk's underestimation and overestimation periods in an experimental manner.","[Burakov, Dmitry] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Financial Markets & Banks, Moscow, Russia",Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation,"Burakov, D (通讯作者)，Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Financial Markets & Banks, Moscow, Russia.",dbur89@yandex.ru,"Burakov, Dmitry/S-6488-2019","Burakov, Dmitry/0000-0003-3019-5200",,,,,20,2,2,0,0,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,4,,,,,441,458,,10.2298/PAN160105003B,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GV3EI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445976700005,0

First, we expand the results on the R&D-export and R&D-investment relationships to a wide sample of cross-European firms. This differentiates from previous works based on single-country samples. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in years which assess empirically the relationship between R&D and tangible investment at the micro level. Third, we control for endogeneity of R&D and simultaneity in firms' decision whether to export and carry out tangible investment. The results of the analysis suggest that R&D positively affects export propensity and tangible investment. The results also reveal that neglecting endogeneity and simultaneity issues leads to underestimate the effect of R&D to both export and investment propensities.","[Carboni, Oliviero A.; Medda, Giuseppe] Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSEA, Sassari, Italy; [Carboni, Oliviero A.] CRENoS, Sassari, Italy",University of Sassari,"Medda, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sassari, Dept Econ DiSEA, Sassari, Italy.",gimedda@uniss.it,"Medda, Giuseppe/AAG-4393-2019",,,,,,47,21,22,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This diversification leads to negative assortative matching when teams consist of pairs of experts. And when experts' signals are conditionally independent, all teams have similar precision. We also show that if we allow experts to join multiple teams, then it is optimal to allocate them equally across all teams.

While PHPs are likely to reduce prenatal (except for heavy smokers) and postnatal smoking propensity, we still observe considerable postnatal relapse in the sample, which can be attributed to smoking addiction, as well as information asymmetries and maternal stress associated with PHPs. Thus, we advocate for smoking cessation policies and programmes throughout and beyond pregnancy to avoid potential intertemporal substitution between prenatal and postnatal cigarette consumption.","[Chen, Jihui; Nikolaou, Dimitrios] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA",Illinois State University,"Nikolaou, D (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA.",dnikola@ilstu.edu,"Chen, Jihui/D-6545-2017; Nikolaou, Dimitrios/AFU-3720-2022","Nikolaou, Dimitrios/0000-0002-9400-375X",,,,,30,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using data from Renrendai, one of the largest P2P lending platforms in China, we investigate how the amount of punctuation used in loan descriptions influences the funding probability, borrowing rate, and default. The empirical evidence shows that the amount of punctuation is negatively associated with the funding probability and borrowing rate. We propose that the usage of punctuation affects the readability of a loan description and reflects borrowers' self-control and cognitive ability. Within a given number of words, excessive usage of punctuation makes loan description informal and reduces the readability of the text, thereby impairing investors' trust in borrowers. Moreover, borrowers that overuse punctuation may have lower ability of self-control, and tend to underestimate the risk of borrowing and offer lower borrowing rate due to overconfidence.","[Chen, Xiao] Jinan Univ, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Bihong] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Kasumigaseki Bldg 8F,3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan; [Ye, Dezhu] Jinan Univ, Res Inst Finance, Dept Finance, Guangzhou 510630, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Jinan University,"Ye, DZ (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Res Inst Finance, Dept Finance, 601 Huangpu Ave West, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",chenxiao427@163.com; bihuang@adbi.org; gzydz@126.com,,"chen, xiao/0000-0001-8308-8973; Huang, Bihong/0000-0001-6492-9845; Ye, Dezhu/0009-0007-3128-149X",,,,,45,57,59,7,68,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Choosing the right moment for it is usually a differentiating factor in terms of competition, since it is a source of competitive advantage. There are several mechanisms and strategies to address this problem from the market perspective. However, the criteria of the different actors involved managers, sales representatives, experts, etc. - coexist in the corporate sphere and they often differ, causing difficulties in priority setting processes in the launch of a product or service. The assessment of the prioritization of these criteria is usually expressed in natural language, thus adding a great deal of uncertainty. Fuzzy linguistic models have proved to be an efficient tool for managing the intrinsic uncertainty of this type of information. This paper presents a linguistic multi-criteria decision-making model, able to reconcile the different requirements and viewpoints existing in the corporate sector when planning the launch of new products and services. The proposed model is based on the fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic model, aimed at managing linguistic data expressing different corporate criteria, without compromising accuracy in the calculation of said data. In order to illustrate this, a practical case study is presented, in which the model is applied for scheduling the launch prioritization of several new products and services by a telecommunications company, within the deadlines set in its strategic planning.","[Cid-Lopez, Andres; Hornos, Miguel J.] Univ Granada, Dept Software Engn, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Carrasco-Gonzalez, Ramon A.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Mkt & Market Res, Madrid 28015, Spain; [Herrera-Viedma, Enrique, I] Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Herrera-Viedma, Enrique, I] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia",University of Granada; Complutense University of Madrid; University of Granada; King Abdulaziz University,"Herrera-Viedma, EI (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, E-18071 Granada, Spain.;Herrera-Viedma, EI (通讯作者)，King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.",viedma@decsai.ugr.es,"HERRERA-VIEDMA, ENRIQUE/C-2704-2008; López, Andrés Cid/AAB-6454-2019; Hornos, Miguel J./D-5559-2012; CARRASCO, RAMON ALBERTO/D-9973-2012","HERRERA-VIEDMA, ENRIQUE/0000-0002-7922-4984; López, Andrés Cid/0000-0001-5470-8213; Hornos, Miguel J./0000-0001-5722-9816; CARRASCO, RAMON ALBERTO/0000-0001-7365-349X","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [TIN2016-75850-R, TIN2016-79484-R, TIN2013-40658-P]",European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support received from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the Research Projects TIN2016-75850-R, TIN2016-79484-R and TIN2013-40658-P.",,84,5,5,2,5,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The goal of this paper is to disentangle the supply- and demand-driven sources of this home market advantage. While trade costs, foreign production costs, and taste heterogeneity all matter for market outcomes, we find that a preference for home brands is the single most important driver of home market advantage even after controlling for brand histories and dealer networks. Furthermore, we also find that consumers favor domestically producing brands even if these brands originated from a foreign country. Therefore, our results suggest a novel demand effect of FDI: Establishing local production increases demand for the brand even in the absence of any cost savings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We extend a model from Buffa, Vayanos and Woolley (2014) by allowing general contracts, and by allowing the portfolio manager to invest privately in individual risky assets or the index. To alleviate the effect of moral hazard, Agent is optimally compensated by benchmarking to the index, which, however, may incentivize him to be too much of a closet indexer. To counter those incentives, the optimal contract rewards Agent for taking specific risk of individual assets in excess of the systematic risk of the index, by rewarding the deviation between the portfolio return and the return of an index portfolio, and the deviation's quadratic variation.

We develop a model that endogenizes these differences and examines their economic consequences. A crucial determinant of differences in overconfidence is the degree of expected stability of the environment, with greater changefulness giving rise to more overconfident beliefs. When stability is endogenized, multiple equilibria can emerge, dynamism and overconfidence reinforcing each other in one case, stability and realistic self-assessment in another.

However firms in emerging economies not only have to produce high quality, cost-competitive goods, but also win the resistance of consumers in the world market, who are often adverse to purchasing products from countries that yet have to build a reputation. We argue that this country-of-origin bias significantly influences the chances of leadership change. A model that aims at capturing the endogenous dynamics of demand building and leapfrogging is proposed. We show that in sectors with high monopoly power acquiring a superior technology is not sufficient for a latecomer country to become leader, unless a significant share of consumers is aware of the quality of its products. An extension of the model to multiple sectors shows that a latecomer country remains specialized into low-value undifferentiated goods, even after overtaking the technology of the leading country.

Using autoregressive distributed lag for linear and threshold cointegration, the results suggest that China's government finance and food security have reinforced each other throughout the reform era when a structural break was allowed in the model. However, the strength of cointegration and Granger causality in the government-led food security link is stronger, hence supporting the state interventionist view that a strong state has played a dominant role in fulfilling national food security in China. China's government finance and food security changes indicate food sector reform probabilities under fiscal constraint, as regime-switching indicators have delineated the Chinese government's difficult fiscal periods and the main reforms in the food sector. In practice, this result implies that further policy reforms can be effective for China's future food security.","[Du, Jane; King, Cheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Du, Jane] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [King, Cheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; Sun Yat Sen University,"Du, J (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.;Du, J (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",eaidj@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,32,0,0,4,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It formulates a growth model with directed technological change and focuses on the case with low elasticity of substitution between clean and dirty inputs in production. New technology is substituted for the polluting input, which results in a gradual decline in pollution along the optimal long-run growth path. In contrast to some recent work, the era of pollution and environmental policy is here not just a transitory phase in economic development. This result means that the government's continuous efforts to reconcile economic growth and the environment will always be needed. The socially optimal policy includes a perpetual subsidy to 'green' research. The tax rate of pollution is monotonously increasing, while the pollution tax payments constitute a constant share of income. These policies result in a quite modest growth drag.","[Eriksson, Clas] Malardalen Univ Coll, EST, POB 883,S-721, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden",Malardalen University,"Eriksson, C (通讯作者)，Malardalen Univ Coll, EST, POB 883,S-721, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden.",clas.eriksson@mdh.se,,,,,,,42,11,11,3,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

To answer this question, we propose a methodology to identify historical fiscal adjustment episodes for countries that both needed and wanted to adjust in order to stabilize debt to GDP. We identify 91 adjustment episodes in 49 countries during 1945-2014. We find that countries typically improved their cyclically adjusted primary balances by close to 5 percent of GDP. We also observe that countries make substantial efforts to stabilize debt, but ease their primary balances once this objective is achieved, without getting back to their initial lower debt-to-GDP ratio. Consolidations were larger when sustained over time and the initial deficit was high. Fiscal adjustments were also larger when accompanied by monetary easing and, to a lesser extent, by an improvement in credit conditions.","[Escolano, Julio] Int Monetary Fund, African Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Jaramillo, Laura] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Mulas-Granados, Carlos] Int Monetary Fund, European Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Mulas-Granados, C (通讯作者)，1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",CMulasGranados@imf.org,,,,,,,53,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

The data analysed are drawn from 42 wineries from the wine cluster of Muntenia-Oltenia, one of the most appreciated wine regions in Romania. The results show that embeddedness is positively related to innovation in cluster firms, confirming previous studies in clusters. However, the most remarkable result is that network competence will moderate the nature of the relationship, highlighting the individual ability of firms to exploit the resources offered by the cluster. These results support the conclusion that firms must be aware that being properly embedded in clusters will allow them to obtain resources not available outside the cluster. Nevertheless, this is not only a question of ubiquity, but also of management skills. This represents a challenge, since the whole firm has to be managed towards a network-oriented culture change.","[Exposito-Langa, Manuel; Tomas-Miquel, Jose-Vicente] Univ Politecn Valencia, Business Adm Dept, Valencia, Spain; [Bratucu, Gabriel; Barbulescu, Oana] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Transylvania University of Brasov,"Barbulescu, O (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Fac Econ Sci & Business Adm, Brasov, Romania.",maexlan@doe.upv.es; jotomi@doe.upv.es; gabriel.bratucu@unitbv.ro; oana.barbulescu@unitbv.ro,"Tomás-Miquel, José-Vicente/H-5127-2015; Expósito-Langa, Manuel/H-5142-2015","Tomás-Miquel, José-Vicente/0000-0002-5053-935X;",,,,,35,2,2,1,8,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

There is evidence of both horizontal and vertical inequity across the entire sample. Low-income households do benefit from California's assessment cap as they are typically infrequent movers but their effective tax rates decrease over time. However, the most affluent households by market value do not gain the most and there is no evidence of horizontal inequity for these homeowners. There is also no evidence of horizontal inequity for middle-income households.

Monetary policy is modelled using both a standard and a modified Taylor rule and fiscal policy is modelled as either expansionary or austere. In addition, we differentiate between open economies and monetary union members. We find evidence that the modified Taylor rule notably reduces the likelihood that the financial market crisis affects the real economy. However, if we assume that households are averse to outstanding government debt, we find that a combination of expansionary monetary policy and austerity-oriented fiscal policy does a better job of stabilising both domestic and foreign economies in regard to both output and inflation. In the case of a monetary union, we find that stabilization of output in the country where the financial shock originated is no longer as easy and, in terms of prices, there is now deflation in that country and a positive inflation rate in the other member country of the monetary union.","[Foerster, Britta] Univ Marburg, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Marburg, Germany; [Hayo, Bernd] Univ Marburg, Marburg, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Philipps University Marburg,"Förster, B (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Inst Verkehrsforsch, Marburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,76,1,1,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We depart from the previous literature by assuming that the individual demand is price-sensitive and depends on the copayment rate (i.e., the part paid by each consumer). We obtain two novel results under reference pricing: first, as the copayment rate increases, so do pharmaceutical prices; second, this increase in pharmaceutical prices reduces social welfare. Whilst reference pricing does emerge as a preferable reimbursement scheme, demand elasticities and the copayment rate interact in complex ways. This leads (unexpectedly) to the possibility that a higher copayment rate (lower reimbursement rate) results in higher government expenditure.","[Goncalves, Ricardo; Rodrigues, Vasco] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Gonçalves, R (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",rgoncalves@porto.ucp.pt; rgoncalves@porto.ucp.pt,"Goncalves, Ricardo/B-6098-2009","Goncalves, Ricardo/0000-0002-8457-4479; Rodrigues, Vasco/0000-0001-6991-2129","Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-ECO/100296/2008, PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011, PTDC/EGE-ECO/100296/2008] Funding Source: FCT",Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"Financial support from Fundacao Ciencia e Tecnologia (projects PTDC/EGE-ECO/100296/2008 and PEst-OE/EGE/UI0731/2011) is gratefully acknowledged.

We study the aggregated donations in the US from 1973 to 2013 using ARIMA and ARMAX models.

It introduces seven articles written by leading business anthropologists. Anthropology is the study of humans, past and present. The central concern of anthropologists is the application of anthropological knowledge to the solution of human problems. This introductory article briefly summarizes the history of anthropology and business studies in Japan, Korea, and China, and examines the intertwined relationship of this branch of anthropology with the history of East Asian colonialism. The author then introduces anthropology's methodology and perspective that emphasize holistic, comparative, empirical, inductive, and ethno-historically oriented mode of inquiry. Anthropology regards the economic organization not only as an entity dealing with financial issues, but also as a cultural-emitter that operates in a nexus of multiple stakeholder-agencies. To study companies and economic activities in Asia anthropologically is to explore organizationally mediated, symbol-producing practices, schemes, actions, and consequences, that interact with politico-economic forces and institutional assemblage, both locally and globally. The author argues for combining the critical ethnography of Asian business on the ground, with the macro-level analyses of economic conditions and socio-political movements.","[Hamada, Tomoko] Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Hamada, T (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Anthropol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",thamad@wm.edu,,,,,,,66,1,1,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In this article, we use the EC value to analyse the influence of coalition statements on the bargaining strength of the parties after the 2013 German federal election.

Particularly unique in this region, is the shared history between Malaysia and Singapore, which was once ruled-under the British empire, has since become economic rivals for the Far East - Europe trade route. This provides a suitable context to investigate whether competition or a strategic alliance should be adopted for ports in terms of its benefit to the industry in the region as a whole. Specifically, this paper analyses the ocean freight traffic demand for the Far East-Europe route among three main transshipment ports located in Malaysia and Singapore: Port of Singapore (PSA), Port Klang (PKL), and Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP). The paper provides a scenario analysis of the 3-way interaction through a game theoretic model. The results suggest that a strategic alliance between PSA and PTP generates greater profitability to the current hub and spoke network, while PKL should not commit to any cooperative strategy with either PSA or PTP.","[Ignatius, Joshua; Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Ignatius, Joshua; Tan, Tian Siang] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Dhamotharan, Lalitha] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Management, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, 15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore, Singapore; [Goh, Mark] Natl Univ Singapore, Logist Inst Asia Pacific, 15 Kent Ridge Dr, Singapore, Singapore",University of Warwick; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.;Ignatius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Math Sci, Minden 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",j.ignatius@warwick.ac.uk,"goh, mark/GQO-8860-2022; goh, mark/AAC-4268-2022; Tan, Tian Siang/AAR-1442-2020","goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; goh, mark/0000-0002-3620-7658; Tan, Tian Siang/0000-0003-3995-1519; Dhamotharan, Lalitha/0000-0001-6367-0819",,,,,47,7,9,13,41,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Using an ARDL model, we propose an intertemporal dynamic analysis of uncertainty for Islamic and socially responsible stock markets. Our findings show that, first, conventional and ethical investments present high comparable levels of uncertainty for which the dynamics is time-varying. Second, uncertainty in the conventional US stock market has a significant and positive effect on the uncertainty in alternative stock markets. Thus, uncertainty characterizes conventional and ethical stock markets both in the short and long terms. In particular, while the short-term uncertainty of ethical markets might be associated with their characteristics, the long-term aspect of uncertainty for ethical funds is rather associated with the effect of the conventional stock market environment. Although these findings show mean-reversion and uncertainty spillovers from the alternative stock markets to the conventional US one, they suggest lack of safety and certainty for investments in ethic markets, which remain fragile and closely dependent on the conventional market.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91000 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Nabila] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Cheffou, Abdoukarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; IPAG Business School,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91000 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,16,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Specifically, the effects of numbers of regional bank branches on their credit businesses and profits are empirically examined. The results indicated that regional banks with more branches can increase their loans and bills discounted as well as their small and mid-sized enterprises loans and bills discounted. Thus, establishing more branches is effective in increasing the total sum of loans and bills discounted by each bank because regional banks with many branches can make contact with more customers. On the other hand, return on assets and return on equity of regional banks with more branches were found to be lower. Therefore, regarding the cost performance of regional banks, establishing too many branches and maintaining branch networks that are too large can have negative effects on regional banks.","[Kondo, Kazumine] Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan",Aichi Gakuin University,"Kondo, K (通讯作者)，Aichi Gakuin Univ, Fac Econ, Kita Ku, 3-1-1 Meijo, Nagoya, Aichi 4628739, Japan.",kondo@dpc.agu.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [JP15H03366],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work is supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP15H03366.,,27,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Within EU member countries it is commonly accepted that the design of energy and mitigation policies either at national or at European level require a detailed and integrated investigation of convergence-divergence pattern among the participating countries. In this paper, we examine the distribution dynamics of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, their intensities as well as the carbonization index in 23 European countries over a forty one year period, in particular from 1970 to 2010. For this purpose we used Quah's methodology which is based on the dynamics of cross-section distributions. The main conclusion is that for all the examined variables the hypothesis of convergence patterns for the EU sample is not valid. Moreover, regarding each examined variable different groups of polarization established. Important differences occur across EU countries according to the climate type with respect to the examined variables. Our analysis provides strong evidence supporting the fact that national and European energy and mitigation policies should be implemented according to the non-convergence paradigm. The body of evidence provided by our analysis is of great importance to energy policy makers and for issues related to climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Further, the study examines the contagion caused by recent global financial crisis and its impact on the market liquidity. The direction and intensity of spillovers has been measured using forecast error variance decomposition method as suggested by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). Among the developed markets, the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom significantly affect liquidity changes in Asian countries like India, China, Singapore and Japan. The results revels that on average, each Asian market receives 7% spillover from the global markets and 16% from regional markets. During the financial crisis, the average regional spillover increased to 20% and the global spillover increased to 11%. Thus, in Asia, the regional spillover is higher than the global spillover. Our results support the demand side hypothesis and suggest that it is the trade and portfolio investments that drive the liquidity spillovers.

Although confidence 'is one of the major determinants' of investment decisions in John Maynard Keynes's theory, the fluctuations of which account for the 'essential character of the Trade Cycle,' it has been relatively little studied in economics. The purpose of this article is to draw on the headway of modern psychology, entrepreneurship, and neuroscience in order to propose an explanation of business cycles based on the cycles of confidence. Economists call this explanation a 'paradox' since the very conditions of the economic boom may set the stage for a downturn. Conversely, the fact that confidence is low may gradually induce an improvement of entrepreneurs' decisions and thus of the economic context. The basic mechanism pertains to a possible discrepancy between the two dimensions of investment: demand (short-term effects) and supply (long-term effects). Confidence seems to have a major impact on cognitive effort, on the number of data sought, the way they are analyzed, on creativity and alertness, on the type of reasoning, and the causal ascription of events.","[Laine, Michael] EDC Business Sch, OCRE Res lab, Paris, France",,"Lainé, M (通讯作者)，EDC Business Sch, OCRE Res lab, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,88,2,2,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Instead of requiring buyers to reveal their entire valuation functions directly, the auctioneer gradually gathers information by offering price vectors and requiring demand responses to each buyer. The auctioneer continues to calculate the 'provisional' profile of valuation functions in a history-dependent manner and check whether the efficient allocations with and without any single buyer for this profile are revealed in the resultant history. Once these are revealed, the auctioneer ends the procedure and determines the VCG outcome associated with the provisional profile at the ending time. With the assumptions of revealed preference activity rule and connectedness, this paper shows that the VCG outcome associated with the provisional profile at the ending time is always the same as that associated with the true profile, even though the provisional profile is generally different from the true one. Only our procedures can achieve the correct VCG outcome.

Capital structure is an indicator that corroborates the level of financial risk. Non-profit organisations are an essential part of the general social policy. When considering the efficiency of non-profit entities from a donor perspective, it is important to take into account the way management uses the resources of a non-profit organisation as well as efficiency of that management activity. Non-profit organisation efficiency should be considered in the context of risk. One of the most important ways to increase probability to face financial distress is too high debt to equity relation. The paper illustrates the relationship between debt and equity in 1,560 Polish non-profit entities. The model which can fix optimal capital structure for a non-profit organisation in its current environment was delivered. The proposal of the paper includes a model which helps to find the optimal level of debt for non-profit organisation environmental conditions. The novelty of the model is based on the full costs of debt financing non-profit entities in the context of donor expectations, which in the Polish social and economic environment means that costs indirectly linked with the realisation of the main aim of the social entity cannot be higher than 10% of the collected money sources. An additional point of our findings is that in comparison with the current state, Polish non-profit organisations need to improve their way of fixing capital structure.","[Michalski, Grzegorz; Cierniak-Emerych, Anna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Blendinger, Guenter; Buleca, Jan] TUKE Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice, Slovakia; [Rozsa, Zoltan] Sch Econ Publ Adm Management Bratislava, Furdekova 16, Bratislava 85104, Slovakia; [Svidronova, Maria] Univ Mateja Bela, Tajovskeho 10, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Bulsara, Hemantkumar] SV Natl Inst Technol, Surat 395007, Gujarat, India",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Technical University Kosice; Matej Bel University; National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology,"Michalski, G (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",grzegorz.michalski@ue.wroc.pl; guenter.blendinger@hs-heilbronn.de; zoltan.rozsa@vsemvs.sk; anna.cierniak@ue.wroc.pl; maria.murraysvidronova@umb.sk; jan.buleca@tuke.sk; hbulsara@ashd.svnit.ac.in,"Rózsa, Zoltán/GZK-6056-2022; Bulsara, Hemantkumar P/B-9166-2014; Michalski, Grzegorz/A-4771-2010; Bulsara, Hemantkumar/AAG-2958-2020; Rozsa, Zoltan/E-1043-2013; Buleca, Jan/D-8777-2016","Michalski, Grzegorz/0000-0002-8211-4057; Rozsa, Zoltan/0000-0002-5748-5702; Buleca, Jan/0000-0002-6613-2167",National Science Centre; [UMO-2015/19/B/HS4/01686]; [DEC-2015/19/B/HS4/01686],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland); ;",The presented work and results are part of a monothematic cycle realised as part of the grant titled: Determinants of capital structure in non-profit organisations.

He emphasized that real (market) analysis and financial (market) analysis should be analyzed together, not separately; and that the macro economy is inherently unstable (his financial instability hypothesis). He melded financial analysis and the real market economy to interpret cycles in economic activity. An economy in boom (euphoria, animal spirits) eventually runs out of steam, reaches a peak, and descends into recession. The recession after the Minsky-moment peak segues through several financial stages based on the financial conditions of individual firms; he termed these stages as hedge, speculative, and Ponzi finance. The fragility of the economy depends on the relative weights or importance of the economy's firms in each of the three stages.","[Miller, Richard A.] Wesleyan Univ, Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",Wesleyan University,"Miller, RA (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Econ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Drawing upon French economic sectors for empirical evidence, we break down the analysis of the relationship between weather and monthly sales by season. Our methodology provides the cumulative annual contribution of weather to sales and allows deriving the maximum potential annual impact of adverse weather.

The results have showed that environmental regulations do matter for agricultural trade between both regions because in the presence of excessive zero trade observations, they act as significant fixed export costs that affect the probability of trade. More stringent environmental regulations stimulate innovative efforts in cost-saving green technologies, which increase productivity and positively affect agricultural exports. The results have favoured the revisionist Porter hypothesis (PH), according to which environmental regulations may stimulate innovative efforts, which mitigate the negative effects of higher fixed abatement costs and enhance trade competitiveness.","[Ramzy, Myriam; Zaki, Chahir] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Zaki, C (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt.",chahir.zaki@feps.edu.eg,"Zaki, Chahir/AFQ-2972-2022",,,,,,58,10,10,9,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Today it is regarded as the dominant form of macroeconomic analysis despite the fact that it proved incapable of anticipating or understanding the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009 and that it was based on well-known conceptual errors. The new macroeconomics is based on Walrasian/Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium microeconomic foundations that preclude any role for money, banks, finance or governments. Attempts to integrate these institutions into microfounded general equilibrium models where no such functions are required represents a misapplication of the Walrasian/Arrow-Debreu model and leads only to confusion. The conceptual errors that existed before the GFC continue to go unrecognised or unacknowledged and undermine the post-GFC attempts to correct what were perceived to be limitations of the theory.

Neither do military technologies assigned to government agencies diffuse at different rates than those assigned to firms. The overall technological experience of the patent assignee is found to be a positive predictor of the diffusion of military technologies. The effect of the prevailing intellectual property rights regime is ambivalent: when US patents are included in the sample, the effect of patent protection is positive, when the US is excluded, the effect is either non-significant or negative depending on the model specification that is utilized.","[Schmid, Jon] Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Schmid, J (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sam Nunn Sch Int Affairs, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jschmid11@gmail.com,,"Schmid, Jon/0000-0002-2317-8966",,,,,73,16,20,3,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The estimation results of the differential input demand show that the expansion of crop production leads to an increase in acreage (i.e. extensive margin) and a proportional rise in input usage improving yield per acre (i.e. intensive margin). The substitutable relationship between fertilizer and land supports that crop producers have an option to choose either intensive or extensive margin in response to changes in their relative prices. In addition, the estimation results of the differential output supply highlight that the composition of crop supply can be altered by changes in ex-ante crop prices. The estimation results suggest that crop producers substitute corn supply for the supply of cotton, wheat and soybeans or vice versa. Based on the estimated elasticities, the decompositions of profit-maximizing input demand are conducted, which reveals that a change in ex-ante crop prices is associated closely with resource reallocation.","[Suh, Dong Hee] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Moss, Charles B.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL USA",Korea University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Suh, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",dhsuh@korea.ac.kr,"Moss, Charles B/U-5254-2017","Suh, Dong Hee/0000-0002-6154-3864",,,,,44,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We first derive two different metrics for team quality, and then use those metrics to see how they impact attendance. We find that there is a positive interaction between the quality of the teams. Then various simulations are run to see how attendance would change under different scheduling scenarios. If teams are put into conferences based on the team quality measures, the average per game attendance only rises 1-2%. This is true if 1-year or 10-year quality measures are used. However, our simulation suggests that this effect would be more than offset, mainly because schools with larger capacity would play fewer home games and so aggregate attendance would fall. We discuss whether this effect would be mitigated by capacity adjustments in the longer term.","[Szymanski, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Winfree, Jason] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Moscow, ID 83844 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Idaho; University of Idaho,"Szymanski, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Kinesiol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",stefansz@umich.edu; jwinfree@uidaho.edu,"Winfree, Jason/ABI-6664-2020",,,,,,31,8,9,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Therefore, we employ wavelet analysis to detect the bilateral co-movements in both time and frequency domains based on Friedman and Ball's (1992) hypothesis. The empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between inflation and inflation uncertainty, thus highlighting that inflation precedes uncertainty in the short term and has the opposite causality in the long term. This conclusion is in accordance with the previous hypotheses of Friedman and Ball (1992) and Cukierman and Meltzer (1986), which means that higher inflation will increase the inflation uncertainty and vice versa.

The focus of this article, Portfolio Management, is on one of these omitted topics. Starting from the fundamental recognition of uncertainty, we examine the whole range of characteristics of the Keynesian Approach, demonstrating the coherence and applicability of its multidimensional nature, in the process pointing, by contrast, to the one-dimensional sterility of the conventional approach. Our general conclusion is that there is a rightful place in the Keynesian canon for Portfolio Management, by which we mean not only Investment Management but also Speculative Management, where these two qualifiers are used in the Keynes-Graham sense.","[Woods, J.

Other articles address the question of why governments find it so difficult to reduce levels of sovereign debt.

The main objective of this study is to examine how drinking behavior developed over an economic boom, subsequent crisis, and an eventual recovery. We use individual longitudinal data collected through a postal survey by The Directorate of Health in Iceland in 2007, 2009, and 2012. Pooled OLS and linear probability models are used to study four outcomes: Alcohol-consumption frequency, frequency of binge drinking, binge-drinking participation and alcohol dependence. Alcohol-consumption frequency declined during the crisis, with a further decline during the recovery period. This change is driven by female behavior between 2007 and 2009, but a combined gender effect between 2009 and 2012. This effect is suppressed by male labor-market-changes, but partly mediated by labor marked changes in the case of females. Alcohol dependence declined during the crisis, with suggestive evidence of partially reverting back to previous levels during the recovery. There is some indication that during the crisis real price changes of alcohol played a role in the decline in alcohol consumption but that is not a likely determinant of changes in alcohol consumption for the 3 year period post-crisis that we explore. Men's consumption can partly be explained through income changes while women's consumption changes are rather driven by changes in work hours or other factors.","[Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey; Bjornsdottir, Asgerdur Th; Olafsdottir, Thorhildur] Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Bjornsdottir, Asgerdur Th] SAA Natl Ctr Addict Med, IS-103 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Olafsdottir, Thorhildur] Univ Iceland, Fac Business Adm, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland; University of Iceland,"Asgeirsdottir, TL (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Econ, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",ta@hi.is,"Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023","Olafsdottir, Thorhildur/0000-0003-2003-9984",University of Iceland Research Fund; Icelandic Research Fund (IRF) [130611-052],University of Iceland Research Fund; Icelandic Research Fund (IRF),We are grateful for funding from the University of Iceland Research Fund and the Icelandic Research Fund (IRF grant number 130611-052).

I show that, if the economy is only buffeted by purely temporary shocks to inflation, nominal GDP level targeting may be preferable because it requires the burden of the shocks to be shared by prices and output. However, in the presence of persistent supply and demand shocks, strict price level targeting may be superior because it induces greater policy inertia and improves the tradeoffs faced by the central bank. During lower bound episodes, somewhat paradoxically, nominal GDP level targeting leads to larger falls in nominal GDP.","[Billi, Roberto M.] Sveriges Riksbank, Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank,"Billi, RM (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Res Div, SE-10337 Stockholm, Sweden.",Roberto.Billi@riksbank.se,,"Billi, Roberto/0000-0002-3949-8948",,,,,30,16,18,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The probabilistic loss parameter entails losing 10, 50 or 90% of the value of the public good that is maintained through cooperation, where the likelihood of the loss decreases in total group cooperation. By design, the expected marginal net benefits to an individual and the expected harm to others depends endogenously on the individuals' expectations of group cooperation and exogenously on the magnitude of the loss parameter. We find that individual cooperation is greater when forecasts of total group cooperation are greater and where the magnitude of the probabilistic loss is larger. There is, however, an interesting asymmetry in responses by two subgroups. Subjects who are pessimistic regarding total group cooperation decrease cooperation the higher the magnitude of the probabilistic loss and their decisions are tied systematically to changes in their expectations of other's cooperation. On the other hand, subjects who are optimistic regarding total group cooperation are found to be more cooperative, but their decisions are not systematically tied to changes in expectations of others' cooperation.","[Blanco, Esther; Haller, Tobias] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Wylie Hall 105, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Blanco, Esther; Walker, James M.] Indiana Univ, Ostrom Workshop, Bloomington, IN USA",University of Innsbruck; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Haller, T (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",tobias.haller@uibk.ac.at,"Blanco, Esther/K-9124-2014","Blanco, Esther/0000-0002-4887-5717",Austrian Science Fund (FWF); Austrian Science Fund [P 25973-G11]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P25973] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"Open access funding provided by Austrian Science Fund (FWF).

The study finds that real currency depreciation leads to improvement of trade balance in most of the examined developed countries. But the trade balances after real depreciation of currency do not follow J-curve patterns. With regard to the real exchange rate variability, the evidence is mixed.

In the classical mode, participants are given the choice between receiving a certain amount of money, smaller and sooner, today and a higher amount, larger and later, delayed (e.g., (sic)55 today vs. (sic)75 in 61 days). This is referred to as the standard mode. In the penalty mode, the participant must give up an explicit amount of money in order to choose the smaller and sooner option (e.g., (sic)75 in 61 days vs. (sic)55 today with a penalty of (sic)20). This is the explicit mode. We find that estimates of individual discount rates are lower in the explicit mode than in the standard mode. This result suggests that even very simple information about the amount of money one must surrender for choosing the earlier option increases delayed consumption. The finding has relevant implications for self-control and long-term planning in intertemporal choice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We construct a stylized theoretical gravity model of migration that includes hazards as random shocks. To estimate this model, we deploy exogenous data on geological anzd meteorological hazards from 1980 to 2010. We combine these data with the World Bank's Global Bilateral Migration Database. Overall, our results suggest little evidence that natural hazards affect medium- to long-run international migration. However, considering heterogeneity across income groups, we find that particularly middle-income countries experience significant push and pull effects on migration from natural hazards.

Economic incidence is identified by exploiting an increase of a regional earnings cap of health and long-term care insurance as a natural experiment. Based on administrative data, difference-in-differences models are estimated. I find the burden of SSC is shared equally between employers and employees. An auxiliary analysis studies employment responses to SSC at the intensive margin by a modified bunching approach that is applied to the earnings caps of health and long-term care insurance. Finding employment responses to be negligible supports crucial identifying assumptions of the main analysis. Both results are robust and consistent with a standard partial-equilibrium labour market model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Which rule should it adopt? We propose three criteria. First, the rule should be consistent with good economic performance over a long historical period. Second, the rule should be consistent with recent Fed policy following the Great Recession. Third, the rule should be consistent with projected Fed policy. The first criterion is normative, while the second and third criteria are pragmatic. We consider three rules that have been the focus of extensive policy discussion. The Taylor (1993) and Yellen (2015) rules are balanced in the sense that the coefficients on the inflation and output gaps are equal, while the Yellen (2012) rule is an example of an output gap tilting rule because the coefficient on the output gap is larger than the coefficient on the inflation gap. We also consider inflation gap tilting rules where the coefficient on the inflation gap is larger than the coefficient on the output gap. An inflation gap tilting version of the Yellen (2015a) rule with a time-varying equilibrium real interest rate provides the most consistency with the three criteria.

I review these episodes from a neoclassical approach, which provides a very different perspective on why recoveries from these episodes were so slow and incomplete.

Second, among cap-and-trade mechanisms, we examine only those that target pollution abatement, and so we do not include applications to natural resource management, such as individual transferable quota systems used to regulate fisheries.

We formalize this mechanism in a collective decision making model in the presence of heterogeneous beliefs in which any decision other than the default option requires unanimity. We show that this consideration of political payoffs can eliminate the inefficiency caused by a unanimous consent requirement when beliefs are polarized, but could also create under experimentation when two actors hold beliefs that differ only slightly from one another. We further show that this under-experimentation can be reduced when the political payoffs become endogenous. We illustrate the empirical relevance of the mechanism in two examples with historical narratives: we focus on the decision making process of the Chinese leadership during the country's transition starting in the late 1970s, and we further apply the model to the disagreement within the leadership of the Allied Forces on the Western Front of World War II in the autumn of 1944.

However, entrepreneurship is distributed unevenly in China. Using micro data from 2008 economic census and 2005 population census, this paper explains spatial clusters of entrepreneurship for both manufacturing and services. For both sectors, entrepreneurship (measured by new private firms) tends to emerge in places with more relevant upstream and downstream firms. Moreover, Chinitz's (1961) theories are also supported for manufacturing: small upstream and downstream firms seem to be more important for manufacturing entrepreneurship. For both sectors, entrepreneurship is positively related to city size, the share of young adults and the elderly population, and foreign direct investment. More migrants are also found to promote service entrepreneurship. Our paper is the first to consider both manufacturing and service entrepreneurship in China and should be of interest to both local and national policymakers who plan to encourage entrepreneurship.","[Zheng, Liang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Labor & Human Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhong] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Central University of Finance & Economics; Renmin University of China; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Zheng, L (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lzheng@cufe.edu.cn; mr.zhong.zhao@googlemail.com,"Rodrìguez, Antonio/C-5413-2018","Zhao, Zhong/0000-0003-3587-400X",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Special Fund for Building World-Class Universities and Disciplines through the Renmin University of China [16XNL005],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Special Fund for Building World-Class Universities and Disciplines through the Renmin University of China,"This paper has benefited from comments by the editor, two anonymous referees, Janet E.

Their application allows fair reporting, which is extremely important for countries in transition, as well as for those countries that have not applied IAS. The authors carried a study related to full application of IAS 16 to 114 companies, of which 10 are public and 104 other companies are from the wider area of Novi Sad, in the period 2010-2015. In addition, the study of the case of public companies is done in order to demonstrate the situation before and after the valuation of assets and equipment as at 30 June 2012. The state after 3 years is fairly shown on 30 June 2015, all in order to make valid conclusions regarding fair reporting of the public enterprises. It can be concluded that the application of IAS 16 has multiple benefits by companies that fully apply fair reporting in its operations.","[Popovic, Slobodan] KP Gradsko Zelenilo Novi Sad, Dept Finance, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Novakovic, Srecko; Duranovic, Dragan] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Dept Management, Subotica, Serbia; [Mijic, Ranko] Coll Econ & Stat Prijedor, Dept Management, Prijedor, Bosnia & Herceg; [Grubljesic, Zeljko] Fund Republ Serbian, Dept Management, Prijedor, Bosnia & Herceg; [Anicic, Jugoslav; Majstorovic, Aleksandar] Univ Union Nikola Tesla, Dept Management, Beograd, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Popovic, S (通讯作者)，KP Gradsko Zelenilo Novi Sad, Dept Finance, Novi Sad, Serbia.",slobodan.popovic49@gmail.com,,"Majstorovic, Aleksandar/0000-0002-6884-9209; Anicic, Jugoslav/0000-0003-3467-7071",,,,,31,12,12,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using panel cointegration and causality analyses, we find that urbanization, environmental degradation (CO2 emissions) and political economy variables (democracy and bureaucratic quality) are cointegrated. Second, democracy and bureaucratic quality are effective in reducing environmental degradation in the long-run. Third, there are positive bi-directional relationships between CO2 emissions and affluence and population as shown by panel vector autoregressive and impulse response functions. However, a negative uni-directional relationship runs from CO2 emissions to bureaucratic quality.

Rehypothecation improves resource allocation because it permits liquidity to flow where it is most needed. The liquidity benefits associated with rehypothecation are shown to be more important in high-inflation (high-interest rate) regimes. Regulations restricting the practice are shown to have very different consequences depending on how they are designed. Assigning collateral to segregated accounts, as prescribed in the Dodd-Frank Act, is generally welfare-reducing. In contrast, an SEC15c3-3 type regulation can improve welfare through the regulatory premium it confers on cash holdings, which are inefficiently low when interest rates and inflation are high.

Economicmodels suggest that free-riding incentives and lower opportunity costs give the less competent a comparative advantage at entering political life. Moreover, if elites have more human capital, selecting on competence may lead to uneven representation. This article examines patterns of political selection among the universe of municipal politicians and national legislators in Sweden, using extraordinarily rich data on competence traits and social background for the entire population. We document four new facts that together characterize an inclusive meritocracy. First, politicians are on average significantly smarter and better leaders than the population they represent. Second, this positive selection is present even when conditioning on family (and hence social) background, suggesting that individual competence is key for selection. Third, the representation of social background, whether measured by parental earnings or occupational social class, is remarkably even. Fourth, there is at best a weak trade-off in selection between competence and social representation, mainly due to strong positive selection of politicians of low (parental) socioeconomic status. A broad implication of these facts is that it is possible for democracy to generate competent and socially representative leadership.","[Dal B'o, Ernesto] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Uppsala Univ, Dept Govt, Uppsala, Sweden; UCLS, Chicago, IL USA; Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, SOFI, Stockholm, Sweden; IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Uppsala University; Stockholm University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Dal B'o, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,"Rickne, Johanna/AEY-8084-2022","Rickne, Johanna/0000-0002-3733-7606",Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council,Torsten Soderberg Foundation; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"We thank the editors, Andrei Shleifer and Larry Katz, three anonymous referees, and participants in numerous seminars and conferences for their helpful comments.

In this model, newly unemployed individuals search hard since consumption is below their reference point. Over time, though, they get used to lower income and thus reduce their search effort. In anticipation of a benefit cut, their search effort rises again, then declines once they get accustomed to the lower postcut benefit level. The model fits the typical pattern of exit from unemployment, even with no unobserved heterogeneity. To distinguish between this and other models, we use a unique reform in the unemployment insurance (UI) benefit path. In 2005, Hungary switched from a single-step UI system to a two-step system, with overall generosity unchanged. The system generated increased hazard rates in anticipation of, and especially following, benefit cuts in ways the standard model has a hard time explaining. We estimate a model with optimal consumption, endogenous search effort, and unobserved heterogeneity. The reference-dependent model fits the hazard rates substantially better than plausible versions of the standard model, including habit formation. Our estimates indicate a slow-adjusting reference point and substantial impatience, likely reflecting present-bias.","[DellaVigna, Stefano] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; UCL, London, England; CERS HAS, Budapest, Hungary; IFS, Linkoping, Sweden; IZA, Bonn, Germany; Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; CESIfo, Munich, Germany",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; University College London; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; IFS; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Central European University; Boston University; Ifo Institut,"DellaVigna, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,"Reizer, Balazs/0000-0002-1567-6877","Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley; Alfred P.

However, inertial decision making can diminish consumer benefits of retail competition. Using household-level data from the Texas residential electricity market, we document evidence of consumer inertia. We estimate an econometric model of retail choice to measure two sources of inertia: search frictions/inattention and a brand advantage that consumers afford the incumbent. We find that households rarely search for alternative retailers, and when they do search, households attach a brand advantage to the incumbent. Counterfactual experiments show that low-cost information interventions can notably increase consumer surplus.","[Hortacsu, Ali] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Madanizadeh, Seyed Ali] Sharif Univ Technol, Azadi St,Azadi Sq, Tehran, Iran; [Puller, Steven L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, TAMU 4228, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Chicago; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Hortacsu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",hortacsu@uchicago.edu; madanizadeh@gsme.sharif.edu; puller@econmail.tamu.edu,,,"University of Chicago Energy Initiative; EI@Haas; NSF PSERC; NSF-SES [1426823]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1426823] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","University of Chicago Energy Initiative; EI@Haas; NSF PSERC; NSF-SES; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank the University of Chicago Energy Initiative, EI@Haas, NSF PSERC and NSF-SES 1426823 for generous financial support.

This ability is intrinsic to game theory, and is a central component of Theory of Mind, perhaps the capstone of social cognition. This component of theory of mind allows individuals to learn more rapidly in strategic environments with an element of novelty. We show that the capacity to attribute preferences yields an advantage over less sophisticated approaches to strategic interaction (e.g. reinforcement learning) because it allows agents to extrapolate to novel circumstances information about counterparts' preferences that was learned previously. We report experiments investigating this capacity in extensive form games. We find significant learning of others' preferences, providing evidence for the presence and effectiveness of this aspect of theory of mind. Moreover, scores on survey measures of autism-spectrum tendencies are significant determinants of individual learning, so our notion of theory of mind is related to the notion as understood in psychology.

In the basic model, we show that strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) protection induces a large technology transfer and narrows the North-South wage gap. However, we obtain an ambiguous result regarding the effect on economic growth, which depends crucially on the size of the transfer cost. Although strengthening IPR protection induces a high growth rate when the transfer cost is small, it can induce a low growth rate when the transfer cost is large. In the extended model, in order to examine what factors determine the transfer cost, we consider the situation where the Southern firms may misbehave and the Northern firms incur a cost to monitor them. We show that the degree of investor protection and the degree of morality in developing countries influence the size of the transfer cost, which affects economic growth.","[Ohki, Kazuyoshi] Kanazawa Univ, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan",Kanazawa University,"Ohki, K (通讯作者)，Kanazawa Univ, Inst Human & Social Sci, Fac Econ & Management, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.",kazuyoshi.ohki@gmail.com,,"Ohki, Kazuyoshi/0000-0002-1294-0468",,,,,27,2,2,0,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Our contribution is twofold. First, we argue that the crucial measure that immediately ended deflationary expectations and enabled a swift recovery was a strong and involuntary devaluation of the currency, not the adoption of a new monetary policy framework. Second, starting from the recent literature on monetary policy at the zero-lower bound, we conclude that Sweden's exchange rate policy is more relevant for the current discussion than its tentative experience with price-level targeting.","[Rathke, Alexander] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; CESifo, Munich, Germany; Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Ifo Institut; University of Zurich,"Rathke, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",rathke@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,55,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.

Therefore the paper focuses on a new budget design as well as alternative revenue sources. One of the possible candidates is a financial transaction tax (FTT). To research FTT revenue potential, a model based on a remittance system was designed. We analyse full or partial replacement of VAT- and GNI-based own resources by the transfer of tax revenues from a FTT raised on the national level to the EU budget. The research reveals that FTT-based own resource would be able to fully replace GNI-based own resource only for some EU member states; however, VAT-based own resource can be fully replaced by a FTT-based own resource for the entire EU. Further, results also show that from the EU11 (28) perspective, the tax is sufficient to fully replace VAT- or GNI-contributions if levied on the EU11 (28) level (not on the national level) as a direct payment to the EU budget without tracking the source member State.","[Solilova, Veronika; Nerudova, Danuse; Dobranschi, Marian] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Solilová, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ritve@email.cz,"Dobranschi, Marian/V-6136-2018; Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012; Solilova, Veronika/U-1720-2017","Dobranschi, Marian/0000-0002-5642-0341; Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107; Solilova, Veronika/0000-0002-9122-539X",,,,,49,2,2,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2017,44.0,4,,,,,687,731,,10.1007/s10663-017-9391-5,0.0,,,45,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,FL4DG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414176600005,0

Two stages are considered: flight and network efficiency. Efficiency estimates are computed using multivariate copulas to control for time (trend) and individual (DMU) effects. A robust regression approach is subsequently developed to address the impact of contextual variables on efficiency levels. Results suggest that more progress has been made over the course of the years in terms of controlling flight delays that in terms of reducing CO2 emissions. These results call for specific policies that can target the latter issue more properly: authorities should pay a closer look on airlines listed in the stock market and that operate international flights to apprehend best practices and design regulatory marks to the sector.

However, critical theoretical assumptions rest on latent respondent beliefs, such as the belief that respondents view surveys as potentially influencing policy (i.e., policy consequentiality), which gives rise to pressing empirical challenges. In this study, we develop a Hybrid Mixed Logit model capable of integrating multiple latent beliefs, and subjective measures of these beliefs, into a discrete choice model of stated preferences. Planned use of a resource, which can also be considered a latent variable, is frequently an important consideration when modelling stated preferences for a change in a good, and we demonstrate how our framework can be used to incorporate this information simultaneously. We further explore whether simple information treatments, which vary the degree to which the potential role of surveys in informing policy is emphasized, can influence respondent beliefs. Our results suggest that latent beliefs over consequentiality, resource use and, to a much lesser extent, the information treatments significantly influence elicited willingness to pay.

These objectives are difficult to achieve in practice when household consumption (income) data are neither frequently collected, nor collected using consistent criteria. This paper develops and applies a simple framework for survey-to-survey poverty imputation in an attempt to overcome these obstacles. The framework introduced here imposes few restrictive assumptions, works with simple variance formulas, provides general guidance on the selection of control variables for model building, and can be applied to imputation involving surveys with either the same, or differing, sampling designs. Results from combining Jordan's Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS) with its Unemployment and Employment Survey (LFS) are quite encouraging, with imputation-based poverty estimates closely tracking direct estimates of poverty.","[Dang, Hai-Anh H.] World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Survey Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Dang, Hai-Anh H.] Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Ctr Anal & Forecasting, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Lanjouw, Peter F.] VU, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Serajuddin, Umar] World Bank, Dev Data Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; The World Bank,"Dang, HAH (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Data Grp, Survey Unit, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.;Dang, HAH (通讯作者)，Vietnam Acad Social Sci, Ctr Anal & Forecasting, Hanoi, Vietnam.",hdang@worldbank.org,"Dang, Hai-Anh/AAW-5169-2021","Lanjouw, Peter/0000-0002-4150-7890; Dang, Hai-Anh/0000-0003-4913-5291",World Bank's Strategic Research Program - UK Department of International Development [TF017880]; Knowledge for Change Program - UK Department of International Development [TF0A2733],World Bank's Strategic Research Program - UK Department of International Development; Knowledge for Change Program - UK Department of International Development,"This work was supported by the World Bank's Strategic Research Program [TF017880]; and Knowledge for Change Program [TF0A2733], which received financial support from the UK Department of International Development.",,38,14,16,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We then expand the WAR model by including a window-based approach to take into account the patterns of efficiency over time. The results indicate a low level of efficiency over the entire period of analysis, especially for Eastern European and Balkan countries rather than Central European countries.

The annual reductions in pharmaceutical purchases, a key defensive investment, and mortality are valued at about $800 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, suggesting that defenses are over one-third of willingness-to-pay for reductions in NOx emissions.

Recently, however, this long-held belief'has been challenged. This paper investigates the relationship between CBI and inflation for a large sample (91 countries) covering the period from 1990 to 2014. We follow the previous literature by considering differences across national monetary regimes in explaining this relationship. Our approach also traces the sources of the inflationary phenomenon. Using panel data and the turnover indicator as a proxy for CBI, we offer two main findings. First, we identify the role of exchange rate regimes in the dynamic between inflation and CBI. Second, our results show that only intermediate and flexible exchange rate regimes are appropriate in this relationship. This finding is explained by the level of CBI, which is very low for countries with a fixed exchange rate policy and low income levels. For policymakers, our results highlight the importance of the choice of monetary regime in controlling inflation in the presence of CBI. For public agents, our results provide guidelines for formulating expectations.","[Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, OCRE Lab, Paris, France; [Aguir, Abdelkader; Smida, Mounir] Univ Sousse, Fac Econ & Business Sousse, MOFID UR13 ES60, Sousse, Tunisia; [Aguir, Abdelkader] Univ Lorraine, CNRS UMR 7522, BETA Lab, Nancy, France",Universite de Sousse; Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Ftiti, Z (通讯作者)，EDC Paris Business Sch, 70 Galeries Damiers,Def 1, F-92415 Courbevoie, France.",Zied.Ftiti@edcparis.edu; abdelkader.aguir@univ-lorraine.fr,"Ftiti, Zied/J-6533-2019","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104",,,,,60,6,6,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, the amplification effect of the credit constraint triggered by the housing demand shock on key macroeconomic variables is greatly muted.

Relative to male earnings inequality, the inequality of couples' earnings is both lower in levels and rises by a smaller amount. We also find that couples' earnings instability is lower in levels compared to male earnings instability and actually declines in these data. While wives' earnings played an important role in dampening the rise in inequality and year-to-year variation in resources at the family level, we find that marital sorting and coordination of labor supply decisions at the family level played a minor role.

While the previous literature on this matter proposes that regime changes in the term structure are due to persistent changes in the conditional mean and volatility of interest rates we find that changes in a single parameter that determines the factor loadings of the model better captures regime changes. We show that this model gives superior in-sample forecasting performance as compared to a baseline model and a volatility switching model. In general, we find compelling evidence that the extracted factors from our term structure models are closely related with various economic variables. Furthermore, we investigate and find evidence that the effects of macroeconomic phenomena such as monetary policy, inflation expectations, and real economic activity differ according to the particular regime realized for the term structure. In particular, we identify the periods where monetary policy appears to have a greater effect on the yield curve, and the periods where inflation expectations seem to have a greater effect in yield determination. We also find convincing evidence of a relationship between the regimes estimated by the various switching models with economic activity and monetary policy.","[Levant, Jared] Reg Bank, Birmingham, AL 35242 USA; [Ma, Jun] Univ Alabama, Culverhouse Coll Commerce & Business Adm, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Levant, J (通讯作者)，Reg Bank, Birmingham, AL 35242 USA.",jaredmslevant@gamil.com; jma@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,39,9,10,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

However, in fact, the series of financial crises since 2008 may have interrupted the process of EMU enlargement, which in turn triggered a continuing crisis of confidence in the euro. In this paper we extend the sigma-convergence test to provide a more precise understanding of real interest rate parity (RIP) convergence. On the basis of this, we predict the timing for eliminating the cost of economic asymmetric shocks. Our estimation indicates the RIP among EMU members and accessions were still valid after the disruptions of the 2008 financial crisis. However, the situation has been even worse since the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis, and ceteris paribus, symmetry cannot be achieved without further policy actions. This implies that the EMU authority must do its best to strengthen symmetry and thereby solidify the EMU, at which point it will be better able to re-start the process of enlargement.","[Lin, Ya-Chi] Taiwan Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yeh, Kuo-Chun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lin, YC (通讯作者)，Taiwan Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan.;Yeh, KC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, Taipei, Taiwan.",kuochunyeh@ntu.edu.tw,"Yeh, Kuo-chun/L-8588-2018; Lin, Ya-chi/ACA-8474-2022","Yeh, Kuo-chun/0000-0002-2430-3802; Lin, Ya-chi/0000-0003-3085-7614",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 105-2410-H-002-005],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We thank the editor, three anonymous referees, and Eiji Ogawa for helpful comments and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 105-2410-H-002-005) for financial support.",,27,1,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Using data on managers' pitcher substitution decisions in Major League Baseball, I find that managers remove starting pitchers more often when the next pitch will result in a pitch count ending in zero. Unlike counts ending in nine, pitch counts ending in eight do not exhibit higher substitution rates despite the fact that pitchers usually throw multiple pitches before the manager's next decision opportunity. Managers apparently use rules-of-thumb that emphasize leftmost digits and ignore at least some future consequences of present actions. However, these significant biases disappear when the stakes are high. I find no evidence of disproportionate substitutions on the nine's in close games, and the final digit of the pitch count does not discontinuously affect the probability of winning. Managers act in a manner consistent with rational inattention, using heuristics only when the stakes are low.","[Phillips, David C.] Univ Notre Dame, Wilson Sheehan Lab Econ Opportun, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Phillips, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Wilson Sheehan Lab Econ Opportun, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",David.Phillips.184@nd.edu,,,,,,,25,2,2,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Yet the factors that determine business tax evasion have not been sufficiently examined in the literature in general, and in transition contexts in particular. To address this gap, this study uses the WB/EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) database with a sample of over 12,692 firms from 26 transition economies. Applying various modelling strategies, we argue that tax evasion is a function of firm-level and institutional-level variables. We contribute to the literature by providing robust evidence showing that the perceived tax burden has a positive impact on tax evasion. We also find that the tax evasive behaviour of firms is positively influenced by low trust in government and in the judicial system as well as by higher perceptions of corruption and higher compliance costs. We find that smaller firms, individual businesses and firms in sectors that are less visible to the tax administration are more likely to get involved in evasive behaviour. Overall, institutional factors play an important role in determining firms' tax evasion behaviour in transition economies. This finding has important policy implications.","[Abdixhiku, Lumir] Riinvest Inst, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo; [Krasniqi, Besnik] Univ Prishtina, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo; [Pugh, Geoff; Hashi, Iraj] Staffordshire Univ, Leek Rd, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DF, Staffs, England",Staffordshire University,"Abdixhiku, L (通讯作者)，Riinvest Inst, Prishtina 10000, Kosovo.",hunir.abdixhiltu@riinvestinstitute.org; b.krasniqi@staffs.ac.uk; g.t.pugh@staffs.ac.uk; i.hashi@staffs.ac.uk,"Krasniqi, Besnik A./F-4077-2011; Pugh, Geoffrey/AAG-5009-2019","Krasniqi, Besnik A./0000-0003-2440-3974; Pugh, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9596-1757",,,,,51,28,29,2,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

However, critics have pointed out that a potential constraint in this agenda is that results from small proof-of-concept studies run by nongovernment organizations may not apply to policies that can be implemented by governments on a large scale. After discussing the potential issues, this paper describes the journey from the original concept to the design and evaluation of scalable policy. We do so by evaluating a series of strategies that aim to integrate the nongovernment organization Pratham's Teaching at the Right Level methodology into elementary schools in India. The methodology consists of reorganizing instruction based on children's actual learning levels, rather than on a prescribed syllabus, and has previously been shown to be very effective when properly implemented. We present evidence from randomized controlled trials involving some designs that failed to produce impacts within the regular schooling system but still helped shape subsequent versions of the program. As a result of this process, two versions of the programs were developed that successfully raised children's learning levels using scalable models in government schools. We use this example to draw general lessons about using randomized control trials to design scalable policies.","[Banerjee, Abhijit] MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] MIT, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Banerji, Rukmini] Pratham Educ Fdn, New Delhi, India; [Banerji, Rukmini] ASER Ctr, New Delhi, India; [Berry, James] Univ Delaware, Econ, Newark, DE USA; [Duflo, Esther] MIT, Poverty Alleviat & Dev Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Kannan, Harini] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA USA; [Mukerji, Shobhini] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, South Asia Reg Ctr, Cambridge, MA USA; [Shotland, Marc] Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Training Res Grp, Cambridge, MA USA; [Walton, Michael] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Publ Policy, Cambridge, MA USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Banerjee, Abhijit; Duflo, Esther] Bur Res & Econ Anal Dev BREAD, Board Directors, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Delaware; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Banerjee, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Banerjee, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",banerjee@mit.edu; rukmini.banerji@pratham.org; jimberry@udel.edu; eduflo@mit.edu; harini.kannan@ifmr.ac.in; shobhini.mukerji@ifmr.ac.in; shotland@mit.edu; michael_walton@hks.harvard.edu,"Kannan, Harini/JXL-8100-2024","Kannan, Harini/0000-0002-7792-2922",William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation; Government of Haryana; Regional Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results,William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation; Government of Haryana; Regional Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results,"Thanks to Richard McDowell, Harris Eppsteiner, and Madeline Duhon for research assistance; to Tamayata Bansal, Sugat Bajracharya, Anupama Deshpande, Blaise Gonda, John Firth, Christian Larroulet, Adrien Lorenceau, Jonathan Mazumdar, Manaswini Rao, Paribhasha Sharma, Joseph Shields, Zakaria Siddiqui, Yashas Vaidya, and Melanie Wasserman for field management; to Diva Dhar for supervision; and to Shaher Bhanu Vagh for the educational test design and analysis.

In addition to standard country fixed-effects regressions as well as estimations in first differences, we apply the system Generalised Method of Moments estimator. We, therefore, control for the potential endogeneity of foreign aid. We find that highly targeted aid can be a driver of change: Sectorspecific Aid for Business has a significantly positive impact on regulations across developing countries, but we do not find any effects for overall aid or aid directed at broad governance areas. The result that Aid for Business drives improvements in regulatory quality is robust using different model specifications and country samples. The strongest results are found for low-income countries and for subsamples that exclude outliers. This outcome could partly explain the inconclusive evidence from the previous literature and it confirms our hypothesis that targeted, sector-specific aid matters.","[Busse, Matthias] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Econ & Management, Chair Int Econ, GC 3-145, D-44780 Bochum, Germany; [Hoekstra, Ruth] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Osei, Robert Darko] ISSER, Legon, Ghana",Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum,"Busse, M (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Fac Econ & Management, Chair Int Econ, GC 3-145, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",matthias.busse@rub.de,"Osei, Robert Darko/K-3822-2019","Busse, Matthias/0000-0002-0471-9472",,,,,35,2,3,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Moreover, such a learning process in a large developing country can upset the savings behavior of a fully rational expectations advanced country.

Finally, they have larger consumption responses to income fluctuations than non-hand-to-mouth households, after controlling for endogeneity, income, hand-to-mouth status and other household characteristics.","[Cui, Zhen] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ & Stat, 5151 State Univ Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Feng, Yalan] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Finance & Law, 5151 State Univ Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA",California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles,"Cui, Z (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Econ & Stat, 5151 State Univ Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",zcui@calstatela.edu,,"Feng, Yalan/0000-0003-0261-1828",,,,,20,3,6,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The initiative, propelled in its beginnings by intellectual elites in the United States, Sweden, and some developing countries, mobilized resources to enact policies aimed at reducing fertility by widening contraception provision and changing family-size norms. In the following five decades, fertility rates fell dramatically, with a majority of countries converging to a fertility rate just above two children per woman, despite large cross-country differences in economic variables such as GDP per capita, education levels, urbanization, and female labor force participation. The fast decline in fertility rates in developing economies stands in sharp contrast with the gradual decline experienced earlier by more mature economies. In this paper, we argue that population-control policies likely played a central role in the global decline in fertility rates in recent decades and can explain some patterns of that fertility decline that are not well accounted for by other socioeconomic factors.","[de Silva, Tiloka; Tenreyro, Silvana] London Sch Econ, Econ, London, England; [Tenreyro, Silvana] LSE, Ctr Macroecon, London, England; [Tenreyro, Silvana] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"de Silva, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Econ, London, England.",t.s.de-silva@lse.ac.uk; s.tenreyro@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,28,32,13,51,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using a small-scale New Keynesian monetary framework as laboratory and structural parameters calibrated to the estimates obtained on U.S. data from different macroeconomics regimes, we exploit reduced-form econometric models - such as Vector Autoregressions - to assess their regime-specific forecastability. We show that conducting (pseudo) out-of-sample forecast comparisons in the presence of indeterminacy is a non-trivial exercise, even when sunspot shocks play no role in generating the data. Overall, our simulation experiment suggests that equilibrium indeterminacy need not lead to superior (absolute or relative) forecast accuracy. This finding challenges the view that the deteriorating performance of forecast models over the Great Moderation relative to the Great Inflation was entirely due to changes in the U.S. monetary policy.

With rationed labor markets, raising taxes on the employed and transfers to the unemployed might improve both equity and efficiency. It improves equity by redistributing income from the employed to the unemployed; it improves efficiency as it encourages people with a small utility surplus of employment to exit the labor market, leaving their jobs for people with a higher utility surplus. I derive conditions under which this result continues to hold when only part of the labor market is rationed, when there is both frictional and rationing unemployment, and when rationing endogenously follows from trade unions' monopoly power.

A previous theory concludes that misintermediation can be responsible for business cycles and yields procyclical behavior of surprises in real interest rates. This paper proposes a finite horizon structural model with the introduction of heterogeneous capital to formalize and develop that theory. An extended model with labor as well as a harvesting technology further investigates the impact of misintermediation on real factor prices. The model implied relationship between unanticipated changes in real interest rates and real outputs over time is examined in a subsequent empirical study, which provides preliminary evidence consistent with the hypothesis of misintermediation.

This paper investigates donations made by private enterprises in 2011 using a survey of data covering all 31 provincial-level units of China. The data show that philanthropy practised by Chinese private enterprises is widespread, but the amounts of donations are unequally distributed. Furthermore, donations are positively related to a company's profit and in most cases also to the owner's political participation as expressed in membership in the People's Congress (PC) as well as the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at different levels. Donating is also positively related to the presence of a branch of the Communist Party of China and a trade union within the firm. In contrast, there is little support for donations being related to the characteristics of the major owner of the business, such as their gender, age, previous employment experience, party membership or to the governance structure or location of the private firms.","[Gustafsson, Bjoern] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, POB 720, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Gustafsson, Bjoern] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Yang, Xiuna] China Dev Res Fdn, Imperial Int Ctr, Floor 15,Tower A,136 Andingmen Wai Ave, Beijing 100011, Peoples R China; [Gang Shuge; Dai Jianzhong] Beijing Acad Social Sci, Inst Sociol, 33 Beisihuan Zhonglu, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",University of Gothenburg; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Beijing Academy of Social Sciences,"Gustafsson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Social Work, POB 720, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Bjorn.Gustafsson@socwork.gu.se; yangxiuna2005@163.com; gangshuge@hotmail.com; daijianzhong49@163.com,,"Gustafsson, Bjorn/0000-0001-7177-9099",Swedish Research Council - the Swedish Research Links Program; China Scholarship Council (CSC),Swedish Research Council - the Swedish Research Links Program; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),This work was supported by a grant from the Swedish Research Council - the Swedish Research Links Program.

In our model individual households make their store choices based on their expected basket costs, which are determined by their shopping plans and price beliefs. Previous studies use realized purchases as a proxy for unobserved shopping lists and also assume homogenous price expectation across all households over the entire sample period. Our approach improves the measures of expected basket costs by estimating intended shopping lists of households using a duration model and also by constructing household-, time-, store-, and goods-specific price expectations. In our empirical application using a scanner data set, we find that the store choices become significantly more elastic to prices when the correction is applied. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A rebound effect can arise at both the microeconomic level and the macroeconomic level. The macroeconomic rebound effect measures the effect of an increase in energy efficiency on overall energy demand after markets adjust and re-equilibrate. At the macroeconomic level, energy efficiency gains can increase energy consumption through two channels: the macroeconomic price effect and the macroeconomic growth effect. In this paper, we econometrically estimate the macroeconomic energy rebound effect in China. Our results show that there is a statistically significant macroeconomic price rebound effect for China, for each province, and for the short run, intermediate run, and the long run. We also find some evidence of a macroeconomic,growth rebound in the short run and the intermediate run for some years either nation-wide or for some provinces in China; moreover, for some years and some provinces, we cannot reject backfire. The rebound effect is an important phenomenon that the government of China should not neglect when making energy policy, as it affects how improvements in energy efficiency translate into changes in energy consumption.

We think of a SX as a local public good that allows its traders to diversify risk by trading their securities with other SX members. In our two-stage equilibrium setting, traders evaluate SXs depending on their risk-sharing possibilities and, given these evaluations, choose the SX they want to join. Security prices can differ among SXs and traders may value SX memberships differently. We establish continuity properties in both stages and show that equilibrium exists for a generic set of economies.","[Faias, Marta] Univ Nova Lisboa, FCT, Lisbon, Portugal; [Faias, Marta] Univ Nova Lisboa, CMA, Lisbon, Portugal; [Luque, Jaime] Univ Wisconsin, 5259 Grainger Hall,975 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Luque, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, 5259 Grainger Hall,975 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",mcm@fct.unl.pt; jluque@wisc.edu,"Faias, Marta/AAD-6703-2020","Faias, Marta/0000-0001-9837-1755; Luque, Jaime/0000-0001-5510-2432",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [SEJ2008-03516]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology) [UID/MAT/00297/2013],Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank comments and suggestions from Nizar Allouch, Antonio Cabrales, Jean-Eduard Colliard, Gionvani Nicolo, Mario Pascoa, Erwan Quintin, Mark Ready, Tim Riddiough, Marzena Rostek, Myrna Wooders, Randy Wright, and participants at the annual meetings of the APET 2010, EWGE 2011, SAET 2011, SEA 2011, and PEA 2012, and seminars at Indiana University, University of Miami, Purdue University, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The model features two agents, one of which becomes the incumbent in each of the two periods and unilaterally decides on investment in a common-interest public good, targeted pork spending and the future executive constraint. While a weak constraint permits an incumbent to enact his desired policies in case of re-election, the same applies to his opponent in the opposite scenario. However, this trade-off changes with the level of the public good, because the agents' shared investment interest dominates their conflict over pork spending to a lesser extent as the efficiency gains from investing get exhausted. In equilibrium, more efficient states of the public good are associated with tighter executive constraints. Despite the fact that agents share the same preferences over public good consumption, equilibrium public good provision is inefficient. Moreover, this inefficiency worsens as the incumbent's re-election chances deteriorate. These findings shed light on why incumbents facing similar electoral environments make different institutional choices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of financial incentives on partially disabled workers,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Disability insurance; Financial incentives,INSURANCE RECEIPT; UNEMPLOYMENT; EARNINGS; ROLLS; RISE,"This study uses longitudinal administrative data from the Netherlands to explore the responsiveness of disabled workers to financial incentives. We focus on workers with partial Disability Insurance (DI) benefits that have substantial residual work capacities. When the first phase of benefit entitlement to DI has expired, these workers experience a dramatic drop in income if they do not employ their residual income capacity. Entitlement, periods to the first phase of DI benefits vary across individuals. This enables us to estimate the impact effect of this change in work incentives on the incidence of work, on wage earnings and on full work resumption. Based on the estimation results, the implied labor force non-participation elasticity rate equals 0.12. Response estimates are highest among young DI recipients, who typically have shorter entitlement periods to the more generous first phase of DI benefits. The incentive change has a limited impact on wage earnings of partially disabled workers and no significant impact on full work resumption.","[Koning, Pierre; van Sonbeek, Jan-Maarten] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Boelelaan 1105,POB 80510, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Sonbeek, Jan-Maarten] Minist Social Affairs & Employment, The Hague, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Koning, Pierre] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Tinbergen Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Koning, P (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Boelelaan 1105,POB 80510, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.w.c.koning@vu.nl; j.m.van.sonsbeek@vu.nl,,"Koning, Pierre/0000-0002-8808-9497",,,,,24,8,8,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,AUG,2017,47.0,,,,SI,,202,215,,10.1016/j.labeco.2017.05.008,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FI3HU,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411849400014,0

Controlling for the location and the year of a child's birth and utilising the timing of the child's death, I find that the experience of a child's death induces a mother's behavioral changes. Mothers, who experienced the death of their first child before the second child was born, were 3.0 percentage points more likely to deliver their second child with professional assistance and 3.9 percentage points more likely to deliver their second child at health facilities than mothers who did not experience the first child's death by the time of the second child's birth. On the other hand, the first child's death after the birth of the second child is not correlated with mother's health service utilisation for the birth of their second child. A set of robustness checks further confirm the effect of a child's death on the subsequent health behavior among mothers.

I design a variant of a small open economy model with volatility shocks and firm dynamics that gives rise to endogenous markups. I calibrate this model to match the business cycle facts in emerging economies and show that the impact of volatility shocks is substantially amplified if markups are endogenously time varying. Volatility shocks increase savings, due to precautionary motives, and markups, which act as a wedge that endogenously decreases real wages and labor supply with further negative aggregate dynamics that are absent in the models with constant markups.","[Seoane, Hernan D.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Seoane, HD (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, Calle Madrid 126, Madrid 28903, Spain.",hseoane@eco.uc3m.es,,"SEOANE, HERNAN DANIEL/0000-0001-9672-2179","Fundacion Ramon Areces; Ministerio Economia y Competitividad (Spain) [2014-ECO2014-56676-C2-1-P, MDM2014-0431]; Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM [S2015/HUM-3444]","Fundacion Ramon Areces; Ministerio Economia y Competitividad (Spain); Comunidad de Madrid, MadEco-CM(Comunidad de Madrid)","This article was previously circulated as Understanding Volatility Shocks in Real Models.

However, the preferences among the trilemma can change from country to country, which always is an undetermined issue and full of controversy. This paper comprehensively considers all possible preferences, and formulates interval evaluation results under certain preference. Such formulations are motivated by the observations that it is difficult to reach a consensus about the weights associated with the trilemma, since different weight elicitation methods inevitably produce different weighting schemes. Therefore, we propose an interval decision making problem and apply a Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis to present a holistic measurements of the country-specific energy performance. This differs from the conventional wisdom that assigns exact values to corresponding weights, but explores the weight space to make each country the most preferred one. Our analysis is demonstrated by measuring the energy performance of top 10 countries based on 2015 Energy Trilemma Index. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Following the literature of threshold regressions, we propose an estimator based on the within-group transformation. Under fixed threshold effect assumption, we establish that the slope and threshold estimators are jointly normally distributed with the same convergence rate Op (N-1/2) and a non-zero asymptotic covariance. We also suggest a sup-Wald test for the presence of kink effect, and derive its limiting distribution. A bootstrap procedure is proposed to obtain the bootstrap p-values to improve the finite sample performance of the test. Monte Carlo simulations show that the FE estimator and the sup-Wald test perform quite well in estimating the unknown parameters and testing for kink effect, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Different studies in the business process field have shown that an organisation can benefit from B.P.M. through better financial and nonfinancial performance, which can drive it to competitive advantage. B.P.M. is also a concept which leads to better organised systems and can help companies in transition economies to perform better. The purpose of this paper is to compare B.P.M. practice in Slovenia and Serbia in order to formulate recommendations for companies in transition economies. The survey was carried out in 115 representatives of Slovene companies and 91 Serbian companies in the year 2014. The conclusions and recommendation for B.P.M. implementation in transition economies were drawn upon similarities in B.P.M. practice between Serbian and Slovenian companies. In addition, the differences in B.P.M. practice were analysed in order to identify the ways one country can learn from the experience of the other. The results from Slovenia and Serbia from 2014 are interesting for both countries from the perspective of how B.P.M. practice could be further developed in Slovenia and Serbia. The findings have significant managerial implications, as they will help managers to better understand the key factors for successful B.P.M. implementation transitional countries companies.","[Stojanovic, Dragana; Tomasevic, Ivan; Slovic, Dragoslav] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia; [Gosnik, Dusan; Kavcic, Klemen] Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia; [Suklan, Jana] Sch Adv Social Studies, Nova Gorica, Slovenia",University of Belgrade; University of Primorska,"Kavcic, K (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia.",klemen.kavcic@fm-kp.si,"Stojanović, Dragana Dušanka/ABF-3841-2021; Slovic, Dragoslav/A-4765-2016; Tomašević, Ivan/ABF-3849-2021; Suklan, Jana/AAJ-7025-2020; Suklan, Jana/AAB-1004-2020; Gosnik, Dusan/JVZ-4872-2024","Suklan, Jana/0000-0001-8665-6593; Gosnik, Dusan/0000-0001-5576-8760",,,,,52,7,8,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using 2000 through 2013 data from the Current Population Survey, we gauge the impact that intensified interior immigration enforcement in the United States is having on the schooling progression of Hispanic youth with likely unauthorized parents. Intensified enforcement raises the probability of repeating a grade for children ages 6-13 by 14%, and the likelihood of dropping out of school for youth ages 14-17 by 18%. Furthermore, younger children are more responsive to police-based enforcement, whereas older youth are more responsive to employment-based enforcement.

We argue that countries with longer statehood experience around the time of colonization were better equipped to implement the legal philosophies transplanted by their colonial powers. Therefore, the implications of receiving British common law versus French civil law should be particularly important in countries with a greater accumulated history of statehood. Using a cross-section of up to 78 former colonies, our results provide support for this hypothesis. In particular, our estimates demonstrate that common law countries have weaker modern climate change policies than civil law countries and the difference is inflated by a longer statehood experience, measured by the length of state history from 1 to 1800 AD. Legal origin has no effect in areas which, by the time of colonization, had no statehood experience. Finally, we report similar results for the pattern of labor market regulations.

The key feature of our framework is that cross-sectional heterogeneity remains finite dimensional. The solution to the model thus admits a statespace representation that can be used to recover the distribution of the model's parameters. Household heterogeneity expands the set of observables to crosssectional moments available at the business-cycle frequency (in addition to the usual macro and monetary time series). Incomplete insurance gives rise to a precautionary motive for holding wealth that propagates aggregate shocks via (i) a stabilizing aggregate supply effect, working through the supply of capital, and (ii) a destabilizing aggregate demand effect coming from the feedback loop between unemployment risk and precautionary saving. Using the estimated model to measure the contribution of precautionary savings to the propagation of recent recessions, we find strong aggregate demand effects during the Great Recession and, to a lesser extent, during the 1990-1991 recession. In contrast, the supply effect at least offsets the demand effect during the 2001 recession.","[Challe, Edouard] Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France; [Challe, Edouard] CNRS, CREST, F-75700 Paris, France; [Matheron, Julien] Banque France, Div Res, Paris, France; [Ragot, Xavier] Paris Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA USA",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France; Paris School of Economics; Emory University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Challe, E (通讯作者)，Ecole Polytech, Dept Econ, Palaiseau, France.;Challe, E (通讯作者)，CNRS, CREST, F-75700 Paris, France.",edouard.challe@gmail.com; julien.matheron@banque-france.fr; xavier.ragot@gmail.com; juan.rubio-ramirez@emory.edu,,,Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; Chaire FDIR; European Commission [FP7-612796 MACFINROBODS]; National Science Foundation [SES-1227397]; Fondation Banque de France pour la Recherche; Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE); Programa de Excelencia en Educacion e Investigacion of the Bank of Spain; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2011-30323-c03-01],Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Chaire FDIR; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fondation Banque de France pour la Recherche; Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE); Programa de Excelencia en Educacion e Investigacion of the Bank of Spain; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Susanto Basu, Morten Ravn, and Jose-Victor Rios Rull for their feedback on an earlier version of this paper.

Senders then convey verifiable messages about their signal realizations to a receiver who takes a non-contractible action that affects the welfare of all players. The space of available signals includes all conditional distributions of signal realizations and allows any sender to choose a signal that is arbitrarily correlated with signals of others.

When IPRs are strong and global, IEA signatories anticipate rent extraction by innovators. This hold-up effect reduces abatement, potentially to levels below those of non-signatories, and it reduces the number of signatories to self-enforcing IEAs.

While these changes have coincided with benefits like reduced transaction costs, advancements in trading technology, and access to a diverse array of execution venues, regulators and market participants have also raised concerns about the welfare implications of innovations like dark pools as well as the resulting increase in execution complexity. Exchanges are often viewed as natural monopolies due to the presence of network externalities and economies of scale. However, heterogeneity in traders' preferences means that no single venue can serve the interests of all investors. Fragmentation of the marketplace can be seen as a direct outcome of this heterogeneity. In this paper, we review the theoretical and empirical literature examining the economic arguments and motivations underlying market fragmentation, the resulting implications for liquidity and price efficiency, and the role for public policy. Beyond the concerns for equity markets, the lessons from this literature are relevant for other asset classes experiencing an increase in competition between trading venues.","[Gomber, Peter; Sagade, Satchit; Weber, Moritz Christian] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Sagade, Satchit; Westheide, Christian] Res Ctr SAFE, Frankfurt, Germany; [Theissen, Erik; Westheide, Christian] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Mannheim,"Sagade, S (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany.;Sagade, S (通讯作者)，Res Ctr SAFE, Frankfurt, Germany.",sagade@safe.uni-frankfurt.de,"Theissen, Erik/AAN-4732-2020; Villen Retamero, Andrea Maria/IAR-1667-2023","Theissen, Erik/0000-0003-4460-8168",Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE,Research Center SAFE; State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE,"We would like to gratefully acknowledge research support from the Research Center SAFE, funded by the State of Hessen initiative for research LOEWE.",,97,19,20,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Unfortunately, they did not come to a consistent conclusion. Besides, while these studies show whether a specific market is efficient or not, little has been done to explore the issues regarding the degree of market inefficiency. This paper attempts to resolve the puzzle of the inconsistent conclusions in the empirical literature by adopting a bottom-up approach which takes market participants' interactions and coordination into consideration. By simulating an agent-based artificial stock market, this paper concludes with three main findings. First, agents' survivability is mainly decided by risk preference, and not forecasting accuracy. Survivors may have diverse forecasting accuracy. Second, because market prices are not decided by agents based on accurate predictions, markets can not be efficient. What may exist is only the difference of the degree of inefficiency between markets. Third, the more relevant to survivability the forecasting accuracy in a market is, the less inefficient the market will be. Therefore, this paper suggests that it may be better to view the divergent empirical results regarding market efficiency as a fact that markets are inefficient to a variety of degrees.","[Huang, Ya-Chi] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan",,"Huang, YC (通讯作者)，Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan.",estherhyc12@yahoo.com.tw,,,National Science Council [NSC-97-2410-H-262-001],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The author gratefully acknowledges the very helpful suggestions of several anonymous referees and the support provided by the National Science Council in the form of Grant no.

Revenue-sharing is extremely attractive to firms that are able to set the revenue shares but often makes the firms that set retail prices worse off. This is so whether revenue-sharing lowers or raises industry profits. These results are strengthened when a market moves from the wholesale model of sales to the agency model of sales, which results in retailers setting revenue shares and suppliers setting retail prices. I also show that retail price-parity restrictions raise industry prices. These results provide a potential explanation for why many online retailers have adopted the agency model and retail price-parity clauses.","[Johnson, Justin P.] Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Johnson, JP (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Johnson Grad Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,,,,,,32,81,89,4,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

In such cases, high-skill women candidates run for office in sufficiently high numbers, driving off low-skill male and female candidates.

In particular, we find that under egalitarian bargaining, the Friedman rule cannot achieve socially efficient allocation due to asymmetric information.

The treatment variation is the number of payers. We observe that subjects provide the good even if there are many payers so that the costs of provision exceed the benefits by far. This result holds regardless of whether the provision increases the decider's payoff or not. Intriguingly, it is not only selfish or maximin types who provide the good. Rather, we show that a substantial fraction of subjects are insensitive to group size: they reveal to care about the payoff of all parties, but attach the same weight to small and large groups so that they ignore large provision costs that are dispersed among many payers.

In particular, when option-implied volatility is highas measured, for instance, by the VIX indexthe distribution of consumption growth is more negatively skewed.","[Bekaert, Geert] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Bekaert, Geert] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Engstrom, Eric] Fed Reserve Board Governors, Washington, DC USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Bekaert, G (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Bekaert, G (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,31,67,70,2,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-3808,1537-534X,,J POLIT ECON,J.

Using extensive information from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, we estimate how paid parental leave entitlements influence children's health up to age 7. Exploiting detailed information on children's health, family background, mothers' pre-birth work histories and mothers' health behaviours during pregnancy, we show that paid parental leave entitlements go together with a reduced probability of a child having multiple ongoing health conditions, but show no significant correlation with any single condition. We find that the reduction in multiple conditions is strongest for children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Our study implies that the provision of paid parental leave for short periods is unlikely to substantially improve child health on average, but may potentially benefit the health of more disadvantaged children.","[Broadway, Barbara; Kalb, Guyonne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kuehnle, Daniel; Maeder, Miriam] FAU Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany",University of Melbourne; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Broadway, B (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, 111 Barry St, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",b.broadway@unimelb.edu.au,"Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015","Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608; Kuehnle, Daniel/0000-0002-2476-6655",Group of Eight - DAAD Australian-German Research Cooperation Scheme,Group of Eight - DAAD Australian-German Research Cooperation Scheme,"We thank the Group of Eight - DAAD Australian-German Research Cooperation Scheme for funding received for this project.

This paper aims at integrating Kaldor's monetary theory and his view of the relevance of increasing returns. It will be shown that, in Kaldor's view, economic growth is driven by increasing effective demand which, in turn, positively affects the path of labour productivity, and that this mechanism is fully in operation on the condition that the banking sector does not restrict credit supply.

Even though the initial codes were designed against the backdrop of a particular jurisdiction, best practice standards have become remarkably similar across legal traditions. This raises the question whether the codes are sufficiently responsive to local conditions, or standard setters are mainly motivated by the concern not to fall behind internationally accepted benchmark standards. The article quantifies central corporate governance provisions and maps their international diffusion. Controlling for differences in legal families and ownership structure, the article shows that the diffusion of best practice standards leads to a statistically significant increase in the likelihood that a foreign standard setter will adopt a broadly similar provision. The findings indicate that codes are often seen as signaling devices, irrespective of whether or not the adopted standards are well aligned with the domestic economic and legal environment.","[Gerner-Beuerle, Carsten] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Law Dept, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gerner-Beuerle, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Law Dept, London, England.",c.gerner-beuerle@lse.ac.uk,,,"Law and Financial Markets Project, LSE","Law and Financial Markets Project, LSE","I am grateful to John Armour, Dan Awrey, Andre Betzer, Michael Blackwell, Brian Cheffins, Paul Davies, Daniel Ferreira, Lars Hornuf, David Kershaw, Tom Kirchmaier, Edmund-Philipp Schuster, Mathias Siems, Hanne Sondergaard Birkmose, Moqi Xu, Stefan Zeume, the two anonymous reviewers of the JOIE, and the participants of conferences and seminars at Aix-Marseille Universite, Duke University, London School of Economics, National University of Singapore, University of Oxford, Department of Financial & Management Studies, SOAS, and the University of St. Gallen for valuable comments on previous versions of this article.

We argue that the recent business of the global banking industry is not sustainable and we believe that ethical banking may represent one of the alternative models. In the empirical section, we investigate how ethics in the banking business models affects their financial performance. We identified 69 ethical banks and compared them with conventional banks using Bankscope data of more than 80,000 bank-year observations for the 2003-2013 period. We apply the Within-Between estimation method to bank financial indicators of Return on Assets, Return on Equity and their respective volatilities. We conclude that ethical banks report significantly lower volatility in Return on Equity than their conventional counterparts. In addition, the hypothesis that ethical banks would have higher profitability than their peers is not rejected.","[Halamka, Radek] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Halamka, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",radek.halamka@gmail.com; petr.teply@vse.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,"Czech Science Foundation [GA 14-02108S, GA 15-00036S]; University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE) [IP 100040]",Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE),This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Projects No. GA 14-02108S and No. GA 15-00036S) and University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE No. IP 100040).,,24,9,10,1,22,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In the meantime, the industry has experienced heavy merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, especially in the upstream sectors. While these MBA activities may be related to the aggregate M&A waves in the country, they are unique in their own respect. We recognize that the MBA activities in the energy industry in general, and the O&G sectors in particular, can be different from the traditional sense of MM activities. In this paper, we provide some stylized facts on the M&A patterns in the upstream O&G sectors, focusing on the factors that influenced these patterns. Our empirical evidence suggests that among the variables we studied, oil price and O&G production are the most important factors that influence M&A activities, while other variables do not show consistent effect across regions and definitions of M&A. In addition, the MM activities had momentum-building periods and had patterns consistent with a wave hypothesis. Our findings support the notion that industry-specific factors are more important than general economic conditions in determining MM in the O&G industry. We find evidence supporting both the behavioral and neoclassical theories on M&A. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that comprehensive financial reform could increase GDP growth per capita by up to 1.4% points and raise the real bank lending rate by up to 5.1% points. Perhaps the most unexpected result is a massive increase in net capital inflows by up to 20.1% of GDP, which could plant seeds for financial risks later. The probability of a currency crisis could increase by up to 21.7% points, but the probability of a banking crisis may rise or fall, depending on the quality of bank supervision. We also find different policy impacts of different financial reform measures. Bank ownership reform and regulatory reform are critical in supporting economic growth and financial stability. These findings offer important policy implications on how to derive maximum benefit from financial reforms while effectively mitigating potential risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Econometric evidence suggests that (i) trade flows and inward FDI mutually reinforce each other, i.e., an increase in trade flows stimulates inward FDI and vice versa; (ii) a larger market tends to attract more inward FDI; (iii) FTAs tend to help stimulate inward FDI; and (iv) strong institutions, good physical infrastructure, and low costs of doing business are critical in boosting inward FDI. The paper suggests that in the long run it is ASEAN's interest to further integrate itself with the rest of Asia and the world (through a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific and an Asia-Europe FTA), while substantially deepening its internal integration (by moving from the AEC to a customs and economic union) and thereby maintaining ASEAN centrality.","[Kawai, Masahiro] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Naknoi, Kanda] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Tokyo; University of Connecticut,"Naknoi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,U-1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",mkawai@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp; kanda.naknoi@uconn.edu,,,S.

It proposes a political economy theory where autocratic regimes deliberately oppose the development of a well-functioning financial cooperative sector to maintain their political influence, and prevent the formation of strong pressure groups that can threaten the current political status quo and reduce the governing elites' economic benefits from underdeveloped and exclusive financial sector. Using panel data from 65 developing countries from 1995-2014, the results show that democracy, political rights and civil liberties promote financial cooperative development.

Based on the case of cooperative finance, this paper's outcomes are twofold. First, it shows that while the boundaries between the nature and property regime of goods may be relatively clear for natural common goods, they appear much more interlinked for human-made goods, where commons are embedded in intergenerational reciprocity. Second, it demonstrates that financial cooperatives can be understood as human-made commons and proposes a new way of thinking about public policies to design adequate legislation to protect these commons from isomorphism, privatization and destruction.","[PERILLEUX, Anais; Nyssens, Marthe] Univ Catholic Louvain, Louvain, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Périlleux, A (通讯作者)，Univ Catholic Louvain, Louvain, Belgium.",Anais.Perilleux@uclouvain.be,,"PERILLEUX, ANAIS/0000-0001-8586-8906",Belgian Science Policy Office; AXA Research Fund,Belgian Science Policy Office(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); AXA Research Fund(AXA Research Fund),The authors thank the participants to the fifth EMES Conference in Helsinki and the participants to the 32nd EGOS Colloquium in Naples for their helpful comments and suggestions.

This study uses a dictator game experiment with undergraduate students to test how a positive charitable appeal video that highlights similarities between donors and recipients affects donor behavior relative to a traditional guilt appeal video that highlights differences. We find that both feelings of guilt and similarity are positively associated with donation behavior; however, only the guilt-appeal treatment has a statistically significant positive effect on donations relative to the control. Yet, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal donations between similarity- and guilt-based treatments. We also find major gender differences in pro-social behavior: average male donations in the control were 40% higher than female donations; whereas, this outcome is almost completely reversed in the guilt appeal treatment, where females donated over twice as much as males. In other words, guilt appeals appear to induce women's pro-social behavior but have the opposite effect on men. This difference may be partially explained by males' aversion to feelings of manipulation, which seemed to discourage their donations but had no impact on female donations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis employs a global economy wide model and simulates alternative oil prices out to 2050 with and without a price on GHG emissions. In one case considered, based on estimates of available resources, technological progress and energy demand, the reference oil price rises to $124 by 2050. Other cases separately consider constant reference oil prices of $50, $75 and $100, which are targeted by adjusting the quantity of oil resources. In our simulations, higher oil prices lead to more biofuel production, more land being used for bioenergy crops, and fewer GHG emissions. Reducing oil resources to simulate higher oil prices has a strong income effect, so decreased food demand under higher oil prices results in an increase in land allocated to natural forests. We also find that introducing a carbon price reduces the differences in oil use and GHG emissions across oil price cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Where preferences are identical, we show that if the frequency with which potential helpers appear is above some threshold, then as frequency of appearance increases, the probability that any individual stops diminishes, but the expected waiting time for help to appear is constant. Where costs of stopping differ among individuals, as the frequency of appearance increases, the expected waiting time for help to appear decreases, even though the probability that any individual stops diminishes. A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.","[Bergstrom, Ted] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Econ Dept, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Bergstrom, T (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Econ Dept, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",tedb@econ.ucsb.edu,"Bergstrom, Ted/AAG-3109-2019",,,,,,35,5,5,0,6,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

Previous studies suggest that emission pricing combined with border carbon adjustment is a second-best instrument, and more cost-effective than output-based rebating. We show that the combination of output-based rebating and a consumption tax for emission-intensive and trade-exposed goods can be equivalent with border carbon adjustment Moreover, it is welfare improving for a region that implements emission pricing along with output-based rebating to introduce such a consumption tax. The welfare gain is particularly large if output-based rebating is already implemented for a sector that is not much exposed to leakage, e.g., due to uncertainty about exposure or due to lobbying activities. Thus, supplementing output-based rebating with a consumption tax constitutes robust policies to mitigate carbon leakage. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, we first generate an appropriate database that identifies each industrial production sector with its corresponding price of consumer goods for the euro area. We next estimate a constrained vector autoregressive model. Our findings show a statistically significant increase in producer prices after an oil price shock for branches with high oil consumption, although this statistical pass-through is only partial. However, there is no evidence of a significant oil price pass-through to consumer prices for most branches, which suggests the adaptability of European producers from the most branches to higher oil price pressures without transmitting them to consumers (exceptions: chemical and metal).

We specify the conditions under which higher risk reduces incentives of all firms. We also examine the conditions under which an increase in risk may trigger opposite responses of rivals in the same industry: some firms will strengthen while other firms will weaken the incentives provided to their agents. This result holds regardless of the mode of competition in the product market, Cournot or Bertrand, as long as the rivals' R&D decisions are strategic substitutes. It can generate new empirical implications and can provide an explanation for the lack of strong empirical support in the literature for a negative relationship between risk and incentives.

We show that high mobility or lower control by others result in lower private control. But when the marginal dynamic cost of the bad is sufficiently large, we find that global eradication may be privately optimal in these cases, eradication arises in the non-cooperative game and is also socially optimal so there is, in effect, no externality.

We examine the design of these policies to minimize the total (public and private) costs for meeting a one-billion-gallon biofuel mandate by using miscanthus as feedstock. We find that a high degree of risk aversion, high discount rate, credit constraint, and availability of crop insurance for conventional crops can increase the cost of producing enough biomass for a one-billion-gallon biofuel mandate by up to 43% and increase the land required by 16% as compared to otherwise; removal of subsidized crop insurance and credit constraints could lower these costs by 50%. We find that in most cases the cost-effective energy crop insurance subsidy rate is 0% whereas the cost-effective establishment cost subsidy rate is 100%. Relative to the case with no policy intervention for energy crops, energy crop insurance can reduce the total costs (net of government expenditures on subsidies) of meeting the 1 billion gallon mandate by 1.3% whereas establishment cost subsidy can reduce these costs by 34%.

We study the short run effects of the arrival of democracy on different measures of women's empowerment by exploiting exogenous variation in the government through abolition of the monarchy. This paper employs a propensity score matching estimator to evaluate the linkage between change in political regime and opinions related to women's empowerment from 2006 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). Results show that women's say in decision making increased significantly, and opinions on violence against women strengthened. We further scrutinize the treatment effect estimates with Rosenbaum bounds and observe if they are sensitive to possible hidden selection bias. We also test for heterogeneity of the treatment effect across gender and find that males report higher probability of mutual household decision-making among couples than females.

In this paper we show that in many dynamic games of interest, this correct beliefs assumption may be incompatible with a very basic form of forward induction reasoning: the first two layers of extensive-form rationalizability (Pearce, 1984; Battigalli, 1997, epistemically characterized by Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002). Hence, forward induction reasoning naturally leads us away from equilibrium reasoning. In the second part we classify the games for which equilibrium reasoning is consistent with this type of forward induction reasoning, and find that this class is very small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We show that first and second price auctions are payoff equivalent when some bidders are financially constrained, so sellers are indifferent to adopt either format. We characterize possible equilibria and show that if the budget is high, then sellers compete via fixed pricing, if it is low then they compete via auctions, and if it is moderate then they mix, so both mechanisms coexist. The budget constraint becomes less binding if sellers use entry fees. Interestingly an improvement of the budget-e.g. letting customers pay in installments-may lead to fewer trades and a loss of efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This effect of fiscal policy is as large as the effect of trade linkages on comovement and stronger than the effects of several other common financial and investment linkages. We also show that bilateral tax treaties increase comovement in shocks to nations' GDP trends, demonstrating the permanent effects of coordination on fiscal policy rules. We estimate trend and business cycle components of nations' output series using an unobserved-components model in order to measure comovement between countries and then estimate the impact of tax treaties using generalized estimating equations.","[Sly, Nicholas] Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA; [Sly, Nicholas] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Weber, Caroline] 1285 Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Kansas City; University of Oregon; University of Oregon,"Sly, N (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Kansas City, 1 Mem Dr, Kansas City, MO 64198 USA.;Sly, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",nick.sly@kc.frb.org,"Weber, Caroline E/L-2767-2013","Weber, Caroline/0000-0001-7751-3523",University of Oregon Foundation,University of Oregon Foundation,They are grateful to the University of Oregon Foundation for providing funds to purchase data on bilateral tax treaties from Thomas Reuters.

We explore how the crisis and changes in the labor, housing, and financial markets might have impacted retirement patterns of Spanish men and women nearing retirement age. We find that the recession primarily reduced women's retirement likelihood by 27%. The effect, which was associated with the labor market deterioration, as captured by higher unemployment rates, was circumscribed to women already at work, who chose to stay at work longer. In contrast, for the most part, men's retirement likelihood did not change with the labor, housing, and financial market fluctuations. Overall, the findings suggest that working women might have prolonged their working lives to make up for lost household income.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Borra, Cristina] Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Econ Hist, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain",California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Sevilla,"Amuedo-Dorantes, C (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu,"Borra, Cristina/E-6281-2010; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020; Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018","Borra, Cristina/0000-0003-2277-8342; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X;",,,,,30,2,2,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The program offers yearly cash bonuses to teachers in a sample of 600 public primary schools with the lowest mean student exam scores in the province. The bonus is linked to the change in the school's average student exam scores, the change in the school's enrollment, and the level of student exam participation in the school. Bonus receipt and size are randomly assigned across schools according to whether or not the teacher is the school's head. The program increases student exam participation rates in the second and third year and increases enrollment in grade 1 in the third year. We do not find that the program increases student exam scores in any year. Mean impacts are similar across program variants. The absence of positive impacts on test scores may be due to weaknesses in the program's incentive structure and/ or limitations in the program's administrative data.

In this paper we test several important aspects of market behavior. Specifically we examine the extent to which large changes in risk premia amongst the countries that encountered crises were related to news. We also investigate whether the impact of good and bad news was symmetrical. Finally we explore whether changes in risk premia in Greece affected risk premia in other countries in an asymmetrical and biased way. We discover that while there is considerable evidence that financial markets often performed in an efficient way during the crisis, there are also important departures from this pattern that are consistent with the behavioral approach. Our findings imply that both the efficient and behavioral approaches are helpful when trying to understand how markets perform.","[Bird, Graham; Willett, Thomas] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Bird, Graham; Du, Wenti; Willett, Thomas] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Du, Wenti] Akita Int Univ, Akita, Japan",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Akita International University,"Bird, G (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.;Bird, G (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",graham.bird@claremontmckenna.edu,,,,,,,40,12,16,2,56,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We find that envy can induce a violation of the univariate first-degree stochastic dominance (FSD), and thus a violation of the classic expected utility monotonicity axiom. Surprisingly, altruism can also violate FSD preferences. The intuitive explanation of the result in the case of altruism hinges on the sign of the mixed derivative of the bivariate preference: the individual might prefer a certain correlation between her wealth and her peer group's wealth, and is therefore willing to violate FSD as long as the outcomes of the two parties are ordered according to her preferences. When investments are considered, envy and altruism can distort not only preferences but also actual choices.","[Kaplanski, Guy] Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Levy, Haim] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel",Bar Ilan University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Kaplanski, G (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel.",guykap@biu.ac.il; mshlevy@mscc.huji.ac.il,"Kaplanski, Guy/J-2890-2013","Kaplanski, Guy/0000-0002-2391-912X",Kruger Center for the Finance of the Hebrew University,Kruger Center for the Finance of the Hebrew University,We thank the Kruger Center for the Finance of the Hebrew University for its financial support.,,60,0,0,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

Some recent research contends that only full-scale war, and not force short of war, has a discernable impact on human welfare or physical quality of life (PQOL). We develop theory on one type of force short of war, large-scale foreign military intervention (FMI), and its potential effects on PQOL. Using interrupted time series and panel corrected standard error methodologies, we find that from 1960 to 2005 large-scale FMI had a statistically and substantively significant impact on the PQOL of populations in 106 developing countries.

The intervention consists of home visits and targets socially disadvantaged first-time mothers to improve child development. The effects on child development were assessed via developmental tests in a randomized controlled trial. Home visits significantly improved girls' cognitive development during the first 24 months after birth. In contrast, the intervention had no effect on boys. These gender-specific outcomes can be explained by greater increases in parental investment (e.g. reading to the child) for girls than for boys. Our results demonstrate that early childhood interventions have an effect on early cognitive child development, although concentrated on girls, in a country where a wide range of additional support services are available for disadvantaged mothers with young children.","[Sandner, Malte; Jungmann, Tanja] Univ Rostock, Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigswortherpl 1,August Bebel Str 28, D-18051 Rostock, Germany",University of Rostock; Leibniz University Hannover,"Sandner, M (通讯作者)，Univ Rostock, Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigswortherpl 1,August Bebel Str 28, D-18051 Rostock, Germany.",,"Jungmann, Tanja/AGJ-3407-2022","Jungmann, Tanja/0000-0001-8530-2857; Sandner, Malte/0000-0001-8579-4775","German Federal Ministry for Family, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) [IIA6-25080820V6]; State Ministry of Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, Saxony; TUI Foundation; Durr and Reimann-Dubbers Foundations","German Federal Ministry for Family, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ); State Ministry of Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, Saxony; TUI Foundation; Durr and Reimann-Dubbers Foundations","Financial support by the German Federal Ministry for Family, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) (Grant no.

Ordered logit results point to positive and significant relationships between life satisfaction and both perceived high incomes and the human capital variable, good health, for the pre- and post-Arab Spring periods in Egypt, thus confirming prior studies of transition economies. For a second human capital variable - secondary education - the results indicate a positive and significant relationship with happiness in pre-Arab Spring Egypt, while that relationship for post-Arab Spring Egypt is negative and significant. This particular finding is probably the result of the failure of educated Egyptians to achieve a better life despite their investments in human capital - due to the lack of opportunity that accompanied the failure of the country's Arab Spring to change the political and social environment.","[Silver, Hannah C.] Waddell & Reed Financial Advisors, Tallahassee, FL 32312 USA; [Caudill, Steven B.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Mixon, Franklin G., Jr.] Columbus State Univ, Ctr Econ Educ, Columbus, GA USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University System of Georgia; Columbus State University,"Silver, HC (通讯作者)，Waddell & Reed Financial Advisors, Tallahassee, FL 32312 USA.",silver.hannah@gmail.com; scaudill@fau.edu; mixon_franklin@columbusstate.edu,,,,,,,41,7,7,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

To this end, Grossman's (2000) partial-equilibrium framework with endogenous health is incorporated in an otherwise standard Real-Business-Cycle (RBC) model. Health status in this setup is modelled as a utility-enhancing, intangible, and non-transferrable capital stock, which depreciates over time. The household can improve their health (produce health') through investment using a health-recovery technology. The main results are: (i) overall, the model compares well vis-a-vis data; (ii) the behaviour of the price of healthcare is adequately approximated by the shadow price of health in the model; (iii) the model-generated health variable exhibits moderate- to high correlation with a large number of empirical health indicators.","[Vasilev, Aleksandar] Amer Univ Bulgaria, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria",American University Bulgaria,"Vasilev, A (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Bulgaria, Dept Econ, 1 Georgi Izmirliev Sq, Blagoevgrad 2700, Bulgaria.",avasilev@aubg.bg,"Vasilev, Aleksandar/ADZ-7753-2022","Vasilev, Aleksandar/0000-0002-3956-6314",,,,,19,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Unlike previous studies that focus solely on income, this paper pays more heed to job satisfaction. Based on data drawn from China General Social Survey, we find that disadvantaged job seekers rely primarily on informal channels; whereas experienced and better-educated job seekers tend to search for jobs through formal channels. However, those reaping the largest benefit from using networks are the job seekers who are able to use formal and informal channels jointly. By disaggregating the whole sample, we further find that the promoting effect of network use is contingent on factors such as gender and types of jobs. Network use brings about larger benefits to female and job seekers target to prestigious occupations. Finally, it appears that whether a job seeker can receive influential help depends primarily on the social status of the contacts rather than their tie strength. The results of our paper thus urge us to examine the combination of different searching strategies rather than studying them separately. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This technique allows us to incorporate the characteristic features of electricity prices (such as seasonal volatility, time varying mean reversion and seasonally occurring price spikes) into the model in an elegant and economically justifiable way. The stochastic time change introduces stochastic as well as deterministic (e.g., seasonal) features in the price process' volatility and in the jump component. We specify the base process as a mean reverting jump diffusion and the time change as an absolutely continuous stochastic process with seasonal component. The activity rate of the stochastic time change can be related to the factors that influence supply and demand. Here we use the temperature as a proxy for the demand and hence, as the driving factor of the stochastic time change, and show that this choice leads to realistic price paths. We derive properties of the resulting price process and develop the model calibration procedure. We calibrate the model to the historical EEX power prices and apply it to generating realistic price paths by Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the simulated price process matches the distributional characteristics of the observed electricity prices in periods of both high and low demand. (C) 2017 The Authors.

If players are to coordinate on an efficient equilibrium, they must believe that others will coordinate with them. In many settings there is uncertainty about beliefs as well as strategies. Do people consider these higher-order beliefs (beliefs about beliefs) when making coordination decisions? I design a modified stag hunt experiment that allows me to identify how these higher-order beliefs and uncertainty about higher-order beliefs matter for coordination. Players prefer to invest especially when they believe that others are optimistic that they will invest; but knowledge that others think them unlikely to invest does not cause players to behave differently than when they do not know what their partners think about them. Thus resolving uncertainty about beliefs can result in marked efficiency gains.","[Bosworth, Steven J.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Bosworth, SJ (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",steven.bosworth@ifw-kiel.de,,,Kiel Institute for the World Economy,Kiel Institute for the World Economy,"The author wishes to thank professor Lise Vesterlund for advice and support, professor Stephanie Wang for help in experimental design, seminar participants at the University of Pittsburgh, attendees at the 2012 Economic Science Association World and North American meetings, and participants at the 2015 Thurgau Experimental Economics Meeting.

Our findings reveal that the great majority of diesel price ratios maintain stable long run relationships.

We show that, larger affiliates of large investors compete better and survive longer. Being part of a network of affiliates in the same country and/or sector improves firm survival probability. When investors have a higher (lower) technological level than their affiliates, the affiliates' failure probability increases (decreases). An investor more technologically advanced than its affiliates, it is likely to consider them a cost-saving investment.

Two recent books marshal detailed quantitative and subjective data on individual student outcomes to document the effects of two institutions and how these outcomes might be improved. Paying for the Party concludes that a Midwestern state university reinforces existing economic inequalities rather than fostering upward mobility. How College Works finds that a northeastern liberal-arts college generally serves its students well and suggests low-cost improvements. These claims are evaluated.,"[Johnson, William R.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Johnson, WR (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

We make two significant contributions. First, we develop a small open economy model where the presence of financial frictions permits the replication of business cycle co-movements in response to news shocks. Second, we use VAR analysis to identify news shocks using data on four advanced small open economies. We find that expected shocks about the future Total Factor Productivity generate business cycle co-movements in output, hours, consumption and investment. We also find that news shocks are associated with countercyclical current account dynamics. Our findings are robust across a number of alternative identification schemes. (C) 2017 The Authors.

We find that antidumping actions cause a reduction in the volume and value of imports from China as well as an increase in the price of those goods in the US market. Critically, however, we find that these effects are short-lived and dissipate approximately 2years after the antidumping decision. Furthermore, antidumping actions against China prompt a substitution effect as they increase US imports from other countries.

Proposals for switching to a saving-for-retirement system that does not rely on high payroll taxes have been challenged on the grounds that welfare would fall for some groups such as retirees or the working poor. We show how to devise a transition path from the current U.S. system to a saving-for-retirement system that increases the welfare of all current and future generations, with estimates of future gains higher than those found in typically used macroeconomic models. The gains are large because there is more productive capital than commonly assumed. Our quantitative results depend importantly on accounting for differences between actual government tax revenues and what revenues would be if all income were taxed at the income-weighted average marginal tax rates used in our analysis.","[McGrattan, Ellen R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [McGrattan, Ellen R.; Prescott, Edward C.] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA; [Prescott, Edward C.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Federal Reserve System - USA; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"McGrattan, ER (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;McGrattan, ER (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Minneapolis, MN 55480 USA.",erm@umn.edu; Edward.Prescott@asu.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,41,30,37,3,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

It argues that the institutional matrix of the United States, in particular private ownership of minerals, encouraged experimentation on the barren Texas oil and gas fields, where fracking technology emerged and the rapid transfer of mineral rights to gas companies. Institutional entrepreneurs, namely landmen and lawyers, facilitated contracting between owners of mineral rights and drillers. Private ownership of minerals and an ideology supportive of drilling provide insight into the adoption of regulations that encourage hydraulic fracturing.","[Murtazashvili, Ilia] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Murtazashvili, I (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",ilia.murtazashvili@pitt.edu,,"Murtazashvili, Ilia/0000-0001-9096-9488",,,,,128,9,10,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

I use the placement of foreign direct investment during the Celtic Tiger, the large economic expansion in Ireland during the 1990s, to estimate the impact of local job growth on the likelihood that young adults leave home. This paper contributes to the literature by exploiting an exogenous shock to the local labor market to identify the main effect of employment growth on home leaving behavior. The results show that local economic growth increases the probability that young adults leave home particularly for the well-educated young adults most likely to be employed in the factories that opened during the period.","[Wiemers, Emily E.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Wiemers, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",emily.wiemers@umb.edu,,,,,,,45,3,3,2,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

(2014). Participants select from among sets of standard playing cards valued by a simple formula. In some sessions, participants are given a prepayment associated with some of the cards, which need not be the earnings-maximizing ones. Hochman et al. (2014) find that participants choose an earnings-maximizing card less frequently when another card is prepaid. We replicate this result under the original instructions, but not with instructions which explain the payment process more explicitly. Participants who state they do not consider themselves good at mathematics make earnings-maximizing choices much less frequently overall, but those who express self-confidence in mathematics drive the treatment effect. The results suggest that even when comparisons among choices require only simple quantitative reasoning steps, market designers and regulators may need to pay close attention to how the terms of offers are expressed, explained, and implemented.

Ahead of the crisis, banks did not significantly respond to the discipline exerted by depositors, however, banks begin offering higher rates to curb deposit withdrawals afterwards.

This paper proposes a standard for classifying one study as a replication of some other study. It is a standard that places the burden of proof on a study to demonstrate that it should have obtained identical results to the original, a conservative standard that is already used implicitly by many researchers. It contrasts this standard with decades of unsuccessful attempts to harmonize terminology, and argues that many prominent results described as replication tests should not be described as such. Adopting a conservative standard like this one can improve incentives for researchers, encouraging more and better replication tests.","[Clemens, Michael A.] Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA",,"Clemens, MA (通讯作者)，Ctr Global Dev, Washington, DC USA.",mclemens@cgdev.org,,,,,,,159,98,98,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To handle endogeneity issues arising from the unobservable time variant features of electoral races, we build on the literature which shows that politicians' educational level is positively affected by their wage and apply a Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design on the basis of the fact that the wages of mayors in Italy increase non-monotonically at different thresholds. Results show that an exogenous increase in the median educational level of candidates, induced by a higher wage, leads to an increase in turnout of about 1 percentage point.","[De Benedetto, Marco Alberto] Birkbeck Coll, London, England; [De Paola, Maria] Univ Calabria, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy; [De Paola, Maria] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of London; Birkbeck University London; University of Calabria; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"De Paola, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ & Stat, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",m.depaola@unical.it,,,,,,,65,5,5,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

We find that, unlike what is found in the literature, optimal nominal exchange rate is flexible under local-currency pricing. The key element in deriving our conclusion is the difference in expenditure shares between home and foreign households. The conclusion holds even if the degrees of home bias in production are identical between home and foreign final-goods producers, which contrasts with the findings in the literature.","[Gong, Liutang; Wang, Chan] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Gong, Liutang; Wang, Chan] Peking Univ, LMEQF, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Wuhan Univ, Inst Adv Study, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Zou, Heng-fu] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Adv Study, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Wuhan University; Shenzhen University,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Wang, C (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, LMEQF, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",ltgong@gsm.pku.edu.cn; wangchanist@126.com; Hzoucema@gmail.com,"Wang, Chan/AAB-9870-2019","Wang, Chan/0000-0001-6371-7197",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M560832],China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"We thank the editor, George S.

Will stricter pollution controls drive away the foreign firms that have helped spur growth in China? This paper studies the effects of the Two-Control-Zone (TCZ) pollution control policy on foreign firms' exit behavior in China. Based on firm-level data from 1998 to 2009, we find that foreign firms' responses are not significantly different from domestic firms on average once environmental regulations impose an added cost of business. However, foreign firms' responses to stricter pollution controls tend to differ based on various firm characteristics. Our estimation indicates that larger size, higher productivity and exporting all make foreign firms less likely to exit than similar domestic firms in regions with stricter pollution control.

Dietrich and List (2008) have generalised this result to the setting of binary judgement aggregation. This paper proves that the paradox of a Paretian liberal holds even in the framework of probabilistic opinion pooling and discusses options to circumvent this impossibility result: (i) restricting the aggregator domain to profiles with no potential for conflicting rights; (ii) avoiding agendas where all issues are pairwise entangled (interdependent).

Motivated by evidence from psychology, unemployment is modeled as a social norm. The norm is defined here as the belief that individuals in society prioritize, or should prioritize the search for gainful employment, whereas those who do not are perceived as outside the norm and, consequently, stigmatized. Households pressure the unemployed to find jobs: the fewer unemployed workers there are, the more supporters the norm has and therefore the greater the pressure and psychological cost experienced by each jobseeker. As this psychological cost is procyclical, it hinders the wage from absorbing most of the effect of the shock. Thus, the model is able to capture the high volatility of vacancies and unemployment observed in the data, accounting for the Shimer puzzle. The paper also departs from the literature by introducing price rigidity in the labor market, inducing additional inertia and persistence in inflation and the real wage after a monetary shock. The model's responses after a monetary shock are in line with the responses obtained from a VAR on US data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, we empirically study the relationship between luminosity data and regional incomes for those countries for which regional income data are available. Second, we use our estimation results for an out-of-sample prediction of regional incomes based on the luminosity data. These results enable us to investigate regional income differentials in developing countries that lack official income data. Third, we calculate commonly used measures of regional inequality within countries based on predicted incomes. An investigation of changes in the dispersion of regional incomes over time reveals that approximately 67-70% of all countries experience sigma-convergence. Forth, we study different major determinants of within-country changes in inequality, i.e., the determinants of the convergence process. We find evidence for an N-shaped relationship between development and regional inequality.

This paper examines how financial constraints determine whether firms export directly or indirectly, and how this choice affects firm performance. For this investigation, we use the most recent Chinese private firm-level data, collected in 2011 by the World Bank. We establish two main results. First, indirect exporters face higher financial constraints than direct exporters. Second, indirect exporters are less productive and profitable than direct exporters. In addition, we rationalize these patterns with a simple model that incorporates credit constraints and imperfect contractibility in companies' export decisions. Our results imply that although globalization allows more firms in developing countries to enter the global market through indirect exporting, limited access to capital restricts firms to exporting directly and precludes them from pursuing more profitable opportunities.","[Lin, Faqin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Lin, FQ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",linfaqin@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503281]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Young Elite Teacher Project of Central University of Finance and Economics,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Young Elite Teacher Project of Central University of Finance and Economics,"I am grateful to the Editor, Professor Raouf Boucekkine, and two anonymous referees for their invaluable comments that helped to improve this paper.

The platform provider is uncertain about the strength of the externality each side is exerting on the other. Setting participation fees on both sides, it gradually learns about these externalities by observing actual participation levels. This provides an informational rationale for introductory pricing, with the platform provider charging a fee below the myopically optimal level on at least one side of the market. If the externality that the other side exerts is sufficiently well known and weaker than the externality it experiences, the platform provider extracts surplus from that side by charging it a fee above the myopically optimal level.

Policy functions approximated around the steady state will be inaccurate away from the steady state. In some cases the model may not have a well-defined steady state, or the nature of the steady state may be at odds with its off-steady-state dynamics. We show how to simulate a DSGE model with no well-defined steady state by approximating about the current state. Our method minimizes the error associated with a finite-order Taylor-series expansion of the model's characterizing equations. This method is easily implemented and has the advantage of mimicking highly non-linear behavior. It also requires choosing N out of 2N possible roots from a matrix quadratic equations and the choice of this root not obvious away from the steady state. HoweVer, simulations show that using the same criteria as when linearizing about the steady state yield reasonable, well-fitting results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals differ in policy preferences and decide either to take part in lobbying activities or not. They are assumed to be group rule-utilitarian such that they follow the rule that, if followed by everyone else in their special interest group, would maximize their group's aggregate welfare. Once formed, lobbies make contributions to the incumbent government in exchange for a policy favor as in a common-agency model. I show the existence of equilibrium with two organized lobbies. Individuals with more extreme preferences are more likely to join lobbying activities. Therefore, the lobbyists are rather extremists than moderates. However, the competition between those extreme lobbies results in a more moderate policy outcome relative to that initially preferred by the biased government. Lobbies therefore guard against extremism, while acting as moderators of the government's preferences.","[Zudenkova, Galina] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim,"Zudenkova, G (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",galina.zudenkova@gmail.com,"Zudenkova, Galina/KCJ-5560-2024","Zudenkova, Galina/0000-0002-0008-2427",Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation,Karin-Islinger-Stiftung foundation,"The author is grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Antonio Cabrales, Filipe Campante, Luis Corchon, Jacques Cremer, M.

Using VVIX as a proxy for aggregate uncertainty, and controlling for market risk, volatility risk, correlation risk and the variance risk premium, we document significant portfolio return exposures to aggregate uncertainty. In particular, portfolios that contain small and value stocks have significant and negative uncertainty betas, whereas portfolios of large and growth stocks exhibit positive and significant uncertainty betas. Using a quasi-natural experimental setting around the financial crisis, we confirm the differential sensitivity of small versus big and value versus growth portfolios to aggregate uncertainty. We posit that due to their negative uncertainty betas, uncertainty-averse investors demand extra compensation to hold small and value stocks. Our results offer an uncertainty-based explanation to size and value anomalies.","[Aboura, Sofiane] Univ Paris XIII, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CEPN, CNRS,UMR 7234, Villetaneuse, France; [Arisoy, Y.

Considering a small open economy with domestic production risk and noncontingent government debt, we show that it is ex ante optimal to occasionally deviate from the legal repayment obligation and to repay debt only partially. This holds true even if default generates significant deadweight costs ex post. A quantitative analysis reveals that default is optimal only in response to persistent disaster-like shocks to domestic output.

Some recent empirical work has shown that this relationship has broken down when using data after the mid-1980s. We empirically investigate this issue using several threshold error correction models. We find, in the long run, a 1% increase in the rate of inflation leads to approximately a 0.0046% increase in capacity utilization. The asymmetric error correction structure shows that changes in capacity utilization show significant corrective measures only during booms while changes in inflation correct during both phases of the business cycle with the corrections being stronger during recessions. We also find that, in the short run, changes in the inflation rate do Granger cause capacity utilization while changes in capacity utilization do not Granger cause inflation. The Granger causality from inflation to capacity utilization can be interpreted as supporting recent calls made in the popular press by some economists that it may be desirable for the Federal Reserve Bank to try to induce some inflation. However, it is also possible to interpret these Granger causality results as arising because both variables respond to some more fundamental set of variables with the inflation rate simply responding sooner. The lack of Granger causality from capacity utilization to inflation casts doubt on the older view that capacity utilization could be a leading indicator for future inflation.","[Ahmed, M.
