The invariance properties considered include invariance to (possibly nonlinear) hypothesis reformulations and reparameterizations. The test statistics examined include Wald-type, LR-type, LM-type, score-type, and C()-type criteria. Extending the approach used in Dagenais and Dufour (1991), we show first that all these test statistics except the Wald-type ones are invariant to equivalent hypothesis reformulations (under usual regularity conditions), but all five of them are not generally invariant to model reparameterizations, including measurement unit changes in nonlinear models. In other words, testing two equivalent hypotheses in the context of equivalent models may lead to completely different inferences. For example, this may occur after an apparently innocuous rescaling of some model variables. Then, in view of avoiding such undesirable properties, we study restrictions that can be imposed on the objective functions used for pseudo-likelihood (or M-estimation) as well as the structure of the test criteria used with estimating functions and generalized method of moments (GMM) procedures to obtain invariant tests. In particular, we show that using linear exponential pseudo-likelihood functions allows one to obtain invariant score-type and C()-type test criteria, while in the context of estimating function (or GMM) procedures it is possible to modify a LR-type statistic proposed by Newey and West (1987) to obtain a test statistic that is invariant to general reparameterizations. The invariance associated with linear exponential pseudo-likelihood functions is interpreted as a strong argument for using such pseudo-likelihood functions in empirical work.","[Dufour, Jean-Marie] McGill Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Trognon, Alain] CREST ENSAE, Paris, France; [Tuvaandorj, Purevdorj] CREST ENSAI, Rennes, France",McGill University; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information (ENSAI),"Dufour, JM (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Leacock Bldg,Room 519,855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",jean-marie.dufour@mcgill.ca,,,"William Dow Chair in Political Economy (McGill University); Bank of Canada (Research Fellowship); Toulouse School of Economics (Pierre-de-Fermat Chair of excellence); Universitad Carlos III de Madrid (Banco Santander de Madrid Chair of excellence); Guggenheim Fellowship; Konrad-Adenauer Fellowship (Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation, Germany); Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence [program on Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS)]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec)","William Dow Chair in Political Economy (McGill University); Bank of Canada (Research Fellowship); Toulouse School of Economics (Pierre-de-Fermat Chair of excellence); Universitad Carlos III de Madrid (Banco Santander de Madrid Chair of excellence); Guggenheim Fellowship; Konrad-Adenauer Fellowship (Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation, Germany); Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence [program on Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS)]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec)","This work was supported by the William Dow Chair in Political Economy (McGill University), the Bank of Canada (Research Fellowship), the Toulouse School of Economics (Pierre-de-Fermat Chair of excellence), the Universitad Carlos III de Madrid (Banco Santander de Madrid Chair of excellence), a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Konrad-Adenauer Fellowship (Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation, Germany), the Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence [program on Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS)], the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and the Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec).",,80,3,3,0,22,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

We evaluate the LMOF model using the volatility timing framework of Fleming et al. [J.

We show that investors should be willing to pay to switch from the static strategy to a dynamic volatility timing strategy and that, among the dynamic strategies, the LMOF model consistently produces forecasts of the covariance matrix that are economically more useful than those produced by the other multivariate conditional volatility models, both short memory and long memory. Moreover, we show that combining long memory volatility with the factor structure yields better results than employing either long memory volatility or the factor structure alone. The factor structure also significantly reduces transaction costs, thus increasing the feasibility of dynamic volatility timing strategies in practice. Our results are robust to estimation error in expected returns, the choice of risk aversion coefficient, the estimation window length and sub-period analysis.","[Harris, Richard D.

Each outgoing product is inspected and classified as high quality, medium quality, or nonconforming. The customer who purchases an item joins the regular or the occasional class, with corresponding probabilities which depend on the quality level and on past customer state. The higher the quality level, the higher the probability for a customer to remain or become a regular customer. Our goal is to investigate the structure of the optimal production, order satisfaction and quality control policy in order to maximize the average profit rate of the system.

The method of simulated moments is applied to calibrate both initial and modified ABMs with CSI 300 and S&P 500 respectively, and the goodness-of-fit of each ABMs is tested. The calibration results indicate that the modified model performs better than initial one. Then, we utilize the GSL-div, proposed by Lamperti [Econometrics Stat, 2018, 5, 83-106.], to verify the explanatory power of ABMs. In this procedure, 13 ARCH family models are introduced as benchmarks. The result shows that the explanatory power of modified ABM exceeds ARCH models in both markets, while initial ABM may be defeated by some of the ARCH family models in explaining the microstructure of CSI 300. Finally, a heuristic algorithm is designed to disentangle the insights of Chinese and US stock markets to the observed time horizon through calibrating the initial fundamental value, and Kupiec test is used to check the robustness of the calibration. The result indicates that the explanation of modified model is robust in both markets, while initial model lost its robustness when explaining S&P 500.","[Ji, JingRu; Tu, JingQing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Donghua] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Financial Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology; East China University of Science & Technology,"Wang, DH (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Financial Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",dhwang@ecust.edu.cn,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71171083, 71771087]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [14ZS058]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [15PJC021]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program),"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 71171083, 71771087]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [grant number 14ZS058]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [grant number 15PJC021].

Quantifying the economic impact of CDIs can guide treatment strategies. However, previous studies have generally focused on acute care hospitals, and few have included cost estimates from non-acute care hospitals such as long-term care facilities. Aim This study aimed to quantify the hospital-onset CDI-attributable inpatient expenditures and length-of-stay durations in all healthcare institutions that provide inpatient care (including acute and non-acute care) in Japan. Methods Using national-level insurance claims data, we analyzed patients who had been hospitalized between April 2010 and December 2016. CDI cases were identified and matched with non-CDI controls using hospitalization year, treating hospital, age, sex, surgical procedure, comorbidities, and main diagnoses. Through multivariable regression analyses, we estimated the CDI-attributable inpatient expenditures (2016 US dollars) and length-of-stay durations (days) while adjusting for variations in factors such as patient characteristics, comorbidities, surgery, prescribed antibiotic, geographic region, and hospitalization year. We also analyzed the CDI-attributable inpatient expenditures and length-of-stay durations according to hospital type (acute care and rehabilitation/long-term care). Results The analysis was conducted using 3768 matched pairs. Overall, CDI-attributable inpatient expenditures and length-of-stay durations were US$3213 and 11.96 days, respectively. Rehabilitation/long-term care hospitals had substantially higher inpatient expenditures and longer hospitalizations than acute care hospitals. Conclusion This study quantified the hospital-onset CDI-attributable inpatient expenditures and hospitalizations in both acute and non-acute care hospitals. The inclusion of non-acute care hospitals provides a more accurate representation of the economic burden of CDIs.","[Fukuda, Haruhisa] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Hlth Care Adm & Management, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yano, Takahisa; Shimono, Nobuyuki] Kyushu Univ Hosp, Ctr Study Global Infect, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan",Kyushu University; Kyushu University,"Fukuda, H (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Hlth Care Adm & Management, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.",h_fukuda@hcam.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan [H29-Seisaku-Shitei-010]; KAKENHI by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP17H04144]","Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan(Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan); KAKENHI by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Health Sciences Research by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan (Grant Number: H29-Seisaku-Shitei-010) and a KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant Number: JP17H04144).",,22,7,8,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2018,36.0,11,,,,,1367,1376,,10.1007/s40273-018-0692-8,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GW4SE,30022364.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446909400007,0

The company that is considered is allowed to distribute excess profits (traditionally referred to as dividends in the literature), but is regulated and is subject to particular regulatory (solvency) constraints. Because of the bivariate nature of the surplus formulation, such distributions of excess profits can take two alternative forms. These can originate from a reduction of assets (and hence a payment to owners), but also from an increase of liabilities (when these represent the wealth of owners, such as in pension funds). The latter is particularly relevant if distributions of assets do not make sense because of the context, such as in regulated pension funds where assets are locked until retirement. In this paper, we extend the model of Gerber and Shiu (2003) and consider recovery requirements for the distribution of excess funds. Such recovery requirements are an extension of the plain vanilla solvency constraints considered in Paulsen (2003), and require funds to reach a higher level of funding than the solvency level (if and after it is triggered) before excess funds can be distributed again. We obtain closed-form expressions for the expected present value of distributions (asset decrements or liability increments) when a distribution barrier is used.","[Avanzi, Benjamin; Wong, Bernard] UNSW Sydney, UNSW Sydney Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Avanzi, Benjamin] Univ Montreal, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Henriksen, Lars Frederik Brandt] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark",University of New South Wales Sydney; Universite de Montreal; University of Copenhagen,"Henriksen, LFB (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.",b.avanzi@unsw.edu.au; lars.brandt.henriksen@gmail.com; bernard.wong@unsw.edu.au,"Avanzi, Benjamin/C-3888-2008","Avanzi, Benjamin/0000-0002-5424-4292",Australian Research Council [LP130100723]; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2015-04975],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This research was partially supported under Australian Research Council's Linkage Projects funding scheme (project number LP130100723).

In this study of emergency department physicians in shift work, schedules induce two distortions: First, physicians slack off by accepting fewer patients near end of shift (EOS). Second, physicians distort patient care, incurring higher costs as they spend less time on patients assigned near EOS. Examining how these effects change with shift overlap reveals a tradeoff between the two. Within an hour after the normal time of work completion, physicians are willing to spend hospital resources more than six times their market wage to preserve their leisure. Accounting for overall costs, I find that physicians slack off at approximately second-best optimal levels.","[Chan, David C.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Chan, DC (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",david.c.chan@stanford.edu,,,"NBER Health and Aging Fellowship, under the National Institute of Aging [T32-AG000186]; Charles A.

The dynamics of the unobservable market state process are formulated by a discrete-time finite-state hidden Markov chain with time varying transition probability matrices. Due to the long investment horizon of a defined contribution pension fund, our paper considers only risky assets whose returns depend on both the observable and unobservable market states. Meanwhile, the stochastic salary process is also modulated by the observable and unobservable market states. By adopting sufficient statistics, the portfolio optimization problem for the defined contribution pension fund with imperfect information is transformed into one with complete information. Then, the optimal investment strategy and the efficient frontier are explicitly derived using the dynamic programming approach and the Lagrange dual method. Finally, numerical results show that the imperfection of market state information may cause a loss of investment return. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is also able to exploit bid and ask price data. In this approach in order to model spreads between curves for different tenors, credit as well as liquidity risk is taken into account. Deterministic conditions are derived to ensure the positivity of spreads and thus the monotonicity of the curves for the various tenors. Valuation formulas for standard interest rate derivatives such as caps, floors, swaptions and digital options are established. These formulas can be evaluated numerically very fast using Fourier-based valuation methods. In order to exploit bid and ask prices we develop this approach in the context of a two-price economy. Explicit formulas for bid as well as ask prices of the derivatives are stated. A specific model framework based on normal inverse Gaussian and Gamma processes is proposed which allows for calibration to market data. Calibration results are presented based on multiple-curve bootstrapping and cap market quotes. We use data from September 2013 as well as September 2016. The latter is of particular interest since rates were deep in negative territory at that time.","[Eberlein, Ernst; Gerhart, Christoph] Univ Freiburg, Dept Math Stochast, Eckerstr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Eberlein, E (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Dept Math Stochast, Eckerstr 1, D-79104 Freiburg, Germany.",eberlein@stochastik.uni-freiburg.de,,,DFG [EB 66/17-1],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the DFG [grant number EB 66/17-1].,,37,4,4,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

It can be efficiently calculated since it requires to compute only Fourier integrals and the solution of simple ODE systems.

In the current paper, we explore (1) the relationship between the symmetry assumption of Klibanoff et al. (KMS) (Econometrica 82:1945-1978, 2014) and alternative symmetry assumptions in the literature, and (2) assuming symmetry, the relationship between the set of relevant measures, shown by KMS (2014) to reflect only perceived ambiguity, and the set of measures (which we will refer to as the Bewley set) developed by Ghirardato et al.

This Bewley set is the main alternative offered in the literature as possibly representing perceived ambiguity. Regarding symmetry assumptions, we show that, under relatively mild conditions, a variety of preference symmetry conditions from the literature [including that in KMS (2014)] are equivalent. In KMS (2014), we showed that, under symmetry, the Bewley set and the set of relevant measures are not always the same. Here, we establish a preference condition, No Half Measures, that is necessary and sufficient for the two to be the same under symmetry. This condition is rather stringent. Only when it is satisfied may the Bewley set be interpreted as reflecting only perceived ambiguity and not also taste aspects such as ambiguity aversion.","[Klibanoff, Peter] Northwestern Univ, Managerial Econ & Decis Sci, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL USA; [Mukerji, Sujoy] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England; [Seo, Kyoungwon] Seoul Natl Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",Northwestern University; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Seoul National University (SNU),"Mukerji, S (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London, England.",peterk@kellogg.northwestern.edu; s.mukerji@qmul.ac.uk; seo8240@snu.ac.kr,"Seo, Kyoungwon/K-8214-2012","Klibanoff, Peter/0000-0001-6948-5649",National Science Foundation [SES-0918248]; KAIST,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); KAIST,We thank the referees and the Editor for helpful comments.

The ability to absorb financial and actuarial shocks through the funding ratio allows for the smoothing of returns over generations. Nevertheless, it implicitly means that generations subsidize each other, which has its disadvantages, especially in the light of incomplete contracts and situations of hard regulation constraints. This paper highlights the advantages of intergenerational risk sharing as a main characteristic in certain collective pension plans, investigating if and how much of this can be replicated by individual participation in the market. Using a stylized model based on different pension plans such as hard/soft defined benefit, collective/pure defined contribution, this paper identifies the effects of an increase in life-expectancy as one of the most important actual demographic shocks. The existence of regulatory constraints modifies agents' behavior so that they tend to choose individual investment to ensure their retirement savings. In the absence of regulatory constraints, individual investment under-performs and highly replicates pension fund performance. Thus, choosing collective participation is more rational. Moreover, as the effect of the shock is decomposed, a discussion of the absorption heterogeneity by different plans is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We compare the systematic distinctions and analyze the risk and profitability of reverse mortgages in two prominent types of market arrangements: (1) A market where a public external insurer exists (i.e., the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program in the U.S. market). (2) A market where an external insurer is absent (i.e., the Australian market). Two typical payment plans, the lump-sum and annuity payment, are examined and compared using stochastic dominance criteria. This paper provides a complete framework to analyze the profitability and risk profile of reverse mortgage products, particularly the stochastic dominance criteria. This study argues that the modern solvency capital requirement such as Solvency II may depress the loan-to-value ratio and the intervention of government may be necessary. We also demonstrate that the lender prefers the lump-sum products and this may explain why the lump-sum products dominate the market in practice. Our work can help financial institutions and governments understand the properties of reverse mortgages, and provides a necessary incentive for these organizations to develop a reverse mortgage market.

We employ a dense class of distributions that we denominate Erlangized scale mixtures (ESM) that correspond to nonnegative and absolutely continuous distributions which can be written as a Mellin-Stieltjes convolution Pi * G of a nonnegative distribution 17 with an Erlang distribution G. A distinctive feature of such a class is that it contains heavy-tailed distributions. We suggest a simple methodology for constructing a sequence of distributions having the form Pi * G with the purpose of approximating the integrated tail distribution of the claim sizes. Then we adapt a recent result which delivers an explicit expression for the probability of ruin in the case that the claim size distribution is modeled as an Erlangized scale mixture. We provide simplified expressions for the approximation of the probability of ruin and construct explicit bounds for the error of approximation. We complement our results with a classical example where the claim sizes are heavy-tailed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The established statistical arbitrage strategy enables us to perform intraday and overnight trading. Essentially, we conduct a three-step calibration procedure to the spreads of all pair combinations in a formation period. Top pairs are selected based on their spreads' mean-reversion speed and jump behaviour. Afterwards, we trade the top pairs in an out-of-sample trading period with individualized entry and exit thresholds. In the back-testing study, the strategy produces statistically and economically significant returns of 60.61% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 5.30, after transaction costs. We benchmark our pairs trading strategy against variants based on traditional distance and time-series approaches and find its performance to be superior relating to risk-return characteristics.

The extension of the COS method to price under the regime-switching model is not straightforward because it requires the evaluation of the characteristic function which is based on a matrix exponentiation which is not an easy task. For a two-state economy, we give an analytical expression for computing this matrix exponential, and for more than two states, we use the Caratheodory-Fejer approximation to find the option prices efficiently. In the new framework developed here, it is possible to allow switches not only in the model parameters as is commonly done in literature, but we can also completely switch among various popular financial models undernt regimes without any additional computational cost. Calibration of the different regime-switching models with real market data shows that the best models are the regime-switching time-changed Levy models. As expected by the error analysis, the COS method converges exponentially and thus outperforms all other numerical methods that have been proposed so far.","[Tour, G.; Thakoor, N.; Tangman, D.

IDgenetix(A (R)), a novel pharmacogenomic test, has been shown to improve outcomes by predicting the likelihood of response to different psychotherapeutic medications. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of implementing a novel pharmacogenomic test (IDgenetix(A (R))) to guide treatment choices in patients with depression and/or anxiety compared with treatment as usual from the US societal perspective. We developed a discrete event simulation to compare clinical events, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs of the two treatment strategies. Target patients had a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score ae 20 and/or a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score ae 18 at baseline. Remission, response, and no response were simulated based on the observed rates in the IDgenetix(A (R)) randomized controlled trial. Quality-adjusted life-years and direct and indirect costs attributable to depression and anxiety were estimated and compared over a 3-year time horizon. We conducted extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. The model predicted cumulative remission rates of 78 and 66% in IDgenetix(A (R)) and treatment as usual groups, respectively. Estimated discounted quality-adjusted life-years were 2.09 and 1.94 per patient for IDgenetix(A (R)) and treatment as usual, respectively, which resulted in 0.15 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (95% credible interval 0.04-0.28). The total costs after accounting for a US$2000 test cost were US$14,124 for IDgenetix(A (R)) compared with US$14,659 for treatment as usual, suggesting a US$535 (95% credible interval - 2902 to 1692) cost saving per patient in the IDgenetix(A (R)) group. Incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain (0.49) and cost savings (US$6800) were substantially larger in patients with severe depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score aeA 25).

We use detailed administrative data on fund manager choices and worker characteristics at the inception of Mexico's privatized social security system, where fund managers had to set prices (management fees) at the national level, but could select sales force levels by local geographic areas. We develop and estimate a model of fund manager choice where sales force can increase or decrease customer price sensitivity. We find exposure to sales force lowered price sensitivity, leading to inelastic demand and high equilibrium fees. We simulate oft proposed policy solutions: a supply-side policy with a competitive government player and a demand-side policy that increases price elasticity. We find that demand-side policies are necessary to foster competition in social safety net markets with large segments of inelastic consumers.","[Hastings, Justine] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Hastings, Justine; Hortacsu, Ali; Syverson, Chad] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hortacsu, Ali] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Syverson, Chad] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Hastings, J (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Hastings, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Justine_hastings@brown.edu; hortacsu@uchicago.edu; chad.syverson@chicagobooth.edu,,,National Institute on Aging [R01AG032411-01A2]; U.S. Social Security Administration; Chicago Initiative on Global Markets,National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); U.S. Social Security Administration; Chicago Initiative on Global Markets,"This paper was formerly titled Advertising and Competition in Privatized Social Security: The Case of Mexico.

We tackle the optimal dividend problem when the claim sizes belong to a certain class of distributions and the optimal dividend strategies are of the lump sum type. Our results indicate that a time-inconsistent manager tends to pay out dividends earlier and more frequently than a time-consistent manager, but with smaller dividend amounts.

The timeline is cut into bins andfor each component processthe number of points in each bin is counted. As a consequence of earlier results in Kirchner [Stoch. Process. Appl., 2016, 162, 2494-2525], the distribution of the resulting bin-count sequences' can be approximated by an integer-valued autoregressive model known as the (multivariate) INAR(p) model. We represent the INAR(p) model as a standard vector-valued linear autoregressive time series with white-noise innovations (VAR(p)). We establish consistency and asymptotic normality for conditional least-squares estimation of the VAR(p), respectively, the INAR(p) model. After appropriate scaling, these time-series estimates yield estimates for the underlying multivariate Hawkes process as well as corresponding variance estimates. The estimates depend on a bin-size and a support s. We discuss the impact and the choice of these parameters. All results are presented in such a way that computer implementation, e.g. in R, is straightforward. Simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of our estimation procedure. In the second part of the paper, we present a data example where the method is applied to bivariate event-streams in financial limit-order-book data. We fit a bivariate Hawkes model on the joint process of limit and market order arrivals. The analysis exhibits a remarkably asymmetric relation between the two component processes: incoming market orders excite the limit-order flow heavily whereas the market-order flow is hardly affected by incoming limit orders. For the estimated excitement functions, we observe power-law shapes, inhibitory effects for lags under 0.003s, second periodicities and local maxima at 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5s.","[Kirchner, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, RiskLab, Ramistr 101, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Kirchner, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, RiskLab, Ramistr 101, Zurich, Switzerland.",matthias.kirchner@math.ethz.ch,"Kirchner, Matthias/AAJ-5469-2020",,ETH RiskLab; Swiss Finance Institute,ETH RiskLab; Swiss Finance Institute,"M.K. is indebted to Paul Embrechts for guidance and support during the preparation of the paper.

The same MSE-optimal h also minimizes the higher-order type I error of a SEE-based chi(2) test and increases size-adjusted power in large samples. Computation of the SEE estimator also becomes simpler and more reliable, especially with (more) endogenous regressors. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate all of these superior properties in finite samples, and we apply our estimator to JTPA data.

In many jurisdictions, decisions regarding pricing and reimbursement of these health technologies comprise evidence of value for money. Objective The objective of this study was to develop a cost-effectiveness model based on the Duchenne muscular dystrophy Functional Ability Self-Assessment Tool (DMDSAT), a new rating scale created specifically to measure disease progression in clinical practice and trials and model DMD in economic evaluations, and compare it with two alternative model structures. Methods We constructed three Markov cohort state-transition models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention for DMD versus standard of care in a UK setting. Model I was based on the DMDSAT, model II on stages of disease as defined in the DMD clinical care guidelines and model III on patients' ventilation status. The conceptual model structures were formulated in collaboration with three DMD experts. Results All three models were judged to have good validity with regards to the appropriateness of the choice of modelling technique, conceptual representation of the disease, model input data and model outcomes. Across frameworks, lifetime direct medical costs with standard of care ranged between A 217,510 pound and A 284,640 pound, total costs between A 624,240 pound and A 713,840 pound, and total number of quality-adjusted life-years between 5.96 and 7.17. Conclusions We present a first version of a model for the economic evaluation of treatments for DMD based on the DMDSAT, as well as two alternative frameworks encompassing conventional staging of disease progression. Our findings should be helpful to inform health technology assessments and health economic programmes of future treatments for DMD.","[Landfeldt, Erik; Alfredsson, Lars] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Nobels Vag 13, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Straub, Volker; Lochmuller, Hanns; Bushby, Katharine] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Univ John Walton Muscular Dystrophy Res, Inst Med Genet, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Straub, Volker; Lochmuller, Hanns; Bushby, Katharine] Newcastle Univ, MRC Ctr Neuromuscular Dis, Inst Med Genet, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Lindgren, Peter] Karolinska Inst, Dept Learning Informat Management & Eth, Med Management Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindgren, Peter] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK; Karolinska Institutet,"Landfeldt, E (通讯作者)，Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Nobels Vag 13, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",erik.landfeldt@ki.se,"Straub, Volko/M-9994-2015; Lindgren, Peter/AID-5379-2022; Alfredsson, Lars/AAC-9007-2019","Straub, Volko/0000-0003-0437-7449; Lindgren, Peter/0000-0002-8238-8189; Alfredsson, Lars/0000-0003-1688-6697; Straub, Volker/0000-0001-9046-3540",Medical Research Council [MR/N027302/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0512-10036] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),,,24,20,20,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2017,35.0,2,,,,,249,258,,10.1007/s40273-016-0461-5,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EJ3LU,27798808.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393114500010,0

Pharmacoeconomic analyses offer one method of demonstrating a product's value, yet there is a lack of resources specific to US drug costs relevant to each stakeholder. The aim of this study was to review current US drug costs (post-ACA). A literature review aimed at finding evidence on outpatient prescription drug costs was performed using the following sources: PubMed, governmental agencies, news websites, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) website, and Google Scholar. Articles were limited to those published in the years 2010-2016 and the English language, and those that described drug acquisition costs, reimbursement costs, and rebates or discounting for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payors. The Drug Cost Focus Group (DCFG) was convened to supplement the literature review; the DCFG provided their expertise on US drug costs and emerging issues affecting drug costs. ACA legislation increased drug rebates for manufacturers participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Acquisition costs commonly referred to in the literature include the wholesale acquisition cost and average manufacture price. Drugs reimbursed by Medicaid are currently based on the actual acquisition cost and ACA-Federal Upper Limit. Evidence suggests that reimbursement methods in the public market are varied. Current gaps in the literature regarding commercial insurers' drug costs (post-ACA) present barriers to the application of relevant drug costs to pharmacoeconomic analyses.","[McRae, Jacquelyn; Varga, Stefan; Pizzi, Laura] Thomas Jefferson Univ, 901 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Vogenberg, F.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Center, was commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper presents a summary of the company submission (CS), the ERG report, subsequent addenda, and the development of the NICE guidance for the use of this drug in England and Wales by the Appraisal Committee (AC). The ERG produced a critical review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of AAP based on the CS. An important question in this appraisal was, according to the ERG, whether AAP followed by docetaxel is more effective than BSC followed by docetaxel. In the COU-AA-302 trial, 239 of 546 (43.8 %) AAP patients and 304 of 542 (56.1 %) BSC patients received docetaxel as subsequent therapy, following AA or placebo. The results for this specific group of patients were not presented in the CS; therefore, the ERG asked the company to provide these data in the clarification letter; however, these data were presented as commercial-in-confidence and cannot therefore be reported here. The ERG's critical assessment of the company's economic evaluation highlighted a number of concerns, including (a) not using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population; (b) inconsistencies in estimating prediction equations; (c) not fully incorporating the impact of adverse events; (d) incorrectly incorporating the new patient access scheme (PAS); and (e) the assumption that AA non-compliance leads to recoverable drug costs. Although some of these issues were adjusted in the ERG base case, the ERG could not estimate the impact of all of these issues, and thus acknowledges that there are still uncertainties concerning the cost-effectiveness evidence. With the exception of the ERG's preference for using the ITT population, the AC agreed with the approach taken in the ERG base case. The original company and ERG base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were A 46,722 pound and A 57,688 pound per QALY gained, respectively; these changed to A 28,563 pound and A 38,061 pound per QALY gained, respectively, in the revised base cases applying a new PAS. Regarding the end-of-life criteria, after 24 months approximately 63 % of patients in the control group of the COU-AA-302 trial were still alive, and the median survival was 30.1 months (95 % CI 27.3-34.1). Therefore, it is unlikely that life expectancy would be less than 24 months. The AC stated that the most plausible ICER is likely between A 28,600 pound and A 32,800 pound per QALY gained, and concluded that AAP at this stage in the treatment pathway did not meet the end-of-life criterion for short life expectancy. Moreover, in March 2016, the AC produced the final guidance, stating that AAP is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for treating mCRPC.","[Ramaekers, Bram L.

With actinic keratosis and skin cancer prevalence increasing as the aged population expands in the US, optimizing treatment strategies may produce cost savings for the healthcare system. Since the time of our last review in 2008, investigation of the economic considerations in treating actinic keratosis has advanced. To provide an update of treatment cost effectiveness and to review factors relating to the costs of care, we conducted a systematic review of pharmacoeconomic publications since December 2008. We identified 11 pharmacoeconomic studies, with one cost-of-treatment, five cost-effectiveness, and five cost-utility analyses. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was well tolerated and produced a favorable cosmetic outcome in most studies. Ingenol mebutate, the newest but most expensive topical field therapy, 5-fluorouracil, and PDT were the most cost-effective treatments in our review. Patient adherence to therapy and the management of adverse effects were significant contributors to treatment costs. In the US, treatment guidelines and formalized cost-effectiveness analyses for actinic keratosis are absent from the recent literature. Future pharmacoeconomic investigation will depend on up-to-date comparative efficacy data, as well as clarification of rates of, and management strategies for, adverse effects, therapeutic non-adherence, and lesion recurrence.","[Vale, Spencer M.; Hill, Dane; Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Ctr Dermatol Res, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA; [Feldman, Steven R.] Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA",Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest University,"Feldman, SR (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, Ctr Dermatol Res, Med Ctr Blvd, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.;Feldman, SR (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.;Feldman, SR (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Winston Salem, NC 27157 USA.",sfeldman@wakehealth.edu,"Feldman, Steven R./AAH-6971-2021","Feldman, Steven R./0000-0002-0090-6289",,,,,56,12,12,0,3,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2017,35.0,2,,,,,177,190,,10.1007/s40273-016-0462-4,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EJ3LU,27785771.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393114500004,0

We critically review economic evaluations of first-line chemotherapy regimens for pancreatic cancer since the 1997 introduction of gemcitabine. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE (1997-2015), and the websites of health technology assessment agencies. Two authors independently reviewed economic studies for eligibility in this review; evaluated peer-reviewed, journal-published studies in terms of the Drummond Checklist; and critiqued the technical and scientific merit of all studies. Sixteen pharmacoeconomic evaluations were included: ten published in nine peer-reviewed journals and six on three websites. Six were on single-agent therapies and ten on combination therapies. Analyses conducted included cost-effectiveness (three studies), cost-utility (one study), or combined cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (12 studies). Studies diverged in results, mainly because of different assumptions, methods, inputs, and country-specific guidelines. The two most recent regimens, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (NAB-P + GEM) and the combination of fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX), were evaluated in an indirect comparison, yielding a statistically similar benefit in overall survival but superior progression-free survival for FOLFIRINOX. NAB-P + GEM showed greater economic benefit over FOLFIRINOX. In conclusion, the divergence in results observed across studies is attributable to economic drivers that are specific to countries and their healthcare (financing) systems. No recommendations regarding the relative economic benefit of treatment regimens, general or country-specific, are made as the purpose of pharmacoeconomic analysis is to inform policy decision-making and clinical practice, not set policy or define clinical practice.","[Gharaibeh, Mahdi; Bootman, J.

Strategic Analysis is the process of conducting research on the business environment within which an organisation operates and on the organisation itself, in order to formulate strategy. Definitions of strategic analysis often differ, but the following attributes are commonly associated with it, like (a) the identification and evaluation of data relevant to strategy formulation, (b) the definition and analysis of the external and internal environment and (c) a range of analytical methods that can be employed in the analysis. Commonly used analytical methods in strategic analysis are SWOT, PEST, Porter's five forces, four corner's analysis, value chain, early warning scans, war gaming, etc. The subsequent sections of this chapter focus on strategic analysis for farms, as the business context. The PerfEA and the Risk Wheel are presented, as two useful tools for a strategic adviser. The tools are proposed in the European-level Leonardo da Vinci project (STRAT-Training), and are adapted for the farm sector. The tools support the adviser for (a) exploring farm environment, (b) managing risks and (c) setting up an integrated strategy. In addition, some aspects in the context of decision aiding process are discussed. Thus, as a twofold effort herein, we discuss issues related with complex situation in agro-businesses, like risks handling, and via presenting farm strategy tools we make links with decision science and multi-criteria decision making.","[Krassadaki, Evangelia; Matsatsinis, Nikolaos F.] Tech Univ Crete, Decis Support Syst Lab, Khania, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Krassadaki, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Crete, Decis Support Syst Lab, Khania, Greece.",lia@ergasya.tuc.gr; nikos@ergasya.tuc.gr,"Matsatsinis, Nikolaos F/Q-8291-2016; Krassadaki, Evangelia/AAJ-4189-2020",,"European Union, Leonardo da Vinci Programme, Transfer of Innovation [2013-2-FR1-LEO05-48380]","European Union, Leonardo da Vinci Programme, Transfer of Innovation","This research, training and test-site applications have been co-financed by the European Union, Leonardo da Vinci Programme, Transfer of Innovation, no. 2013-2-FR1-LEO05-48380.

Then, we use the multiple linear regression method to study the impact of gender on income, at the same time examine the gap between gender and income by controlling of a number of important variables. We find that there is a significant difference in income between men and women, and the men's average income is significantly higher than women's.

This framework builds upon the mixture model of combining density forecasts through a systematic application of the information theory. The framework encompasses the measures used in the literature and leads to their generalizations. The focal measure is the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the mixture which admits Kullback-Leibler and mutual information representations. Illustrations include exploring the dynamics of the individual and aggregate uncertainty about the US inflation rate using the survey of professional forecasters (SPF). We show that the normalized entropy index corrects some of the distortions caused by changes of the design of the SPF over time. Bayesian hierarchical models are used to examine the association of the inflation uncertainty with the anticipated inflation and the dispersion of point forecasts. Implementation of the information framework based on the variance and Dirichlet model for capturing uncertainty about the probability distribution of the economic variable are briefly discussed.,"[Shoja, Mehdi] MUFG Union Bank, Risk Capital & Stress Testing, San Francisco, CA USA; [Soofi, Ehsan S.] Univ Wisconsin, Sheldon B Lubar Sch Business, POB 742, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Soofi, Ehsan S.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Soofi, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Sheldon B Lubar Sch Business, POB 742, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",esoofi@uwm.edu,,,Info-Metrics Institute's Summer Fellowship; Roger L.

While the impact of making inappropriate structural choices/assumptions on model predictions is well noted, there is a lack of clarity about the definition of key structural aspects, the process of developing model structure (including the development of conceptual models) and uncertainty associated with the structuring process (structural uncertainty) in guidelines developed by national funding bodies. This forms the focus of this article. Building on the reports of good modelling practice, and recognising the fundamental role of model structuring within the model development process, we specified key structural choices and provided ideas about model structuring for the future direction. This will help to further standardise guidelines developed by national funding bodies, with potential impact on transparency, comprehensiveness and consistency of model structuring. We argue that the process of model structuring and structural sensitivity analysis should be documented in a more systematic and transparent way in submissions to national funding bodies. Within the decision-making process, the development of conceptual models and presentation of all key structural choices would mean that national funding bodies could be more confident of maximising value for money when making public funding decisions.","[Afzali, Hossein Haji Ali; Karnon, Jonathan] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ & Policy Unit, Level 9,Adelaide Hlth & Med Sci Bldg, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Bojke, Laura] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of Adelaide; University of York - UK,"Afzali, HHA (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ & Policy Unit, Level 9,Adelaide Hlth & Med Sci Bldg, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",hossein.hajialiafzali@adelaide.edu.au,,"Karnon, Jonathan/0000-0003-3220-2099",,,,,54,13,13,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2018,36.0,11,,,,,1309,1319,,10.1007/s40273-018-0693-7,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GW4SE,30030816.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446909400002,0

This addresses a concern that has often been raised in connection with the practical relevance of optimal classical dividend payment strategies of barrier and threshold type. We study the case where once during the lifetime of the risk process the dividend rate can be increased and derive corresponding formulas for the resulting expected discounted dividend payments until ruin. We first consider a general spectrally-negative Levy risk model, and then refine the analysis for a diffusion approximation and a compound Poisson risk model. It is shown that for the diffusion approximation the optimal barrier for the ratcheting strategy is characterized by an unexpected relation to the case of refracted dividend payments. Finally, numerical illustrations for the diffusion case indicate that with such a simple ratcheting dividend strategy the expected value of discounted dividends can already get quite close to the respective value of the refracted dividend strategy, the latter being known to be optimal among all admissible dividend strategies.

We test a necessary and sufficient condition for this that does not restrict unobserved heterogeneity or the number of goods. We also propose and implement a control function approach to account for endogenous expenditure.

Even though the claims development of the lines are very different, the GP method is very flexible and can be applied to each without much customization.

Bubble expansion may be modeled using a mildly explosive process. Bubble implosion may take several different forms depending on the nature of the collapse and therefore requires some flexibility in modeling. This paper first strengthens the theoretical foundation of the real time bubble monitoring strategy proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a, b, PSY) by developing analytics and studying the performance characteristics of the testing algorithm under alternative forms of bubble implosion which capture various return paths to market normalcy. Second, we propose a new reverse sample use of the PSY procedure for detecting crises and estimating the date of market recovery. Consistency of the dating estimators is established and the limit theory addresses new complications arising from the alternative forms of bubble implosion and the endogeneity effects present in the reverse regression. A real-time version of the strategy is provided that is suited for practical implementation. Simulations explore the finite sample performance of the strategy for dating market recovery. The use of the PSY strategy for bubble monitoring and the new procedure for crisis detection are illustrated with an application to the Nasdaq stock market.","[Phillips, Peter C.

This is a noticeable change since usually mathematical frameworks focus on one large trader facing a background noise (or mean field). In standard frameworks, the interactions between the large trader and the price are a temporary and a permanent market impact terms, the latter influencing the public price. In this paper the trader faces the uncertainty of fair price changes too but not only. He also has to deal with price changes generated by other similar market participants, impacting the prices permanently too, and acting strategically. Our MFG formulation of this problem belongs to the class of extended MFG, we hence provide generic results to address these MFG of controls, before solving the one generated by the cost function of optimal trading. We provide a closed form formula of its solution, and address the case of heterogenous preferences (when each participant has a different risk aversion). Last but not least we give conditions under which participants do not need to instantaneously know the state of the whole system, but can learn it day after day, observing others' behaviors.","[Cardaliaguet, Pierre] PSL Univ, Univ Paris Dauphine, CEREMADE, Pl Marchal de Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Lehalle, Charles-Albert] CFM, Paris, France; [Lehalle, Charles-Albert] Imperial Coll, London, England",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Imperial College London,"Lehalle, CA (通讯作者)，CFM, Paris, France.;Lehalle, CA (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll, London, England.",c.lehalle@imperial.ac.uk,,"LEHALLE, Charles-Albert/0000-0002-9978-9501","ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) [ANR-14-ACHN-0030-01, ANR-16-CE40-0015-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-14-ACHN-0030] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),Authors thank Marc Abeille for his careful reading of Sect. 3.2.1.

The model includes the interactions between a market maker, three types of fund, and cash investors. In general, the sensitivity of the market maker to demand and the degree to which momentum traders are active strongly influence the over- and under-shooting of yields in response to shocks, while investor behaviour plays a comparatively smaller role. Using the model, we simulate experiments of relevance to two topical issues in this market. Firstly, we show that measures to reduce the speed with which investors can redeem investments can reduce the extent of yield dislocation. Secondly, we find the unexpected result that a larger fraction of funds using passive investment strategies increases the tail risk of large yield dislocations after shocks.","[Braun-Munzinger, K.] European Cent Bank, D-60640 Frankfurt, Germany; [Liu, Z.] Hong Kong Monetary Author, 8 Finance St, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Turrell, A.

The volume of internet searches helps gauge the degree of investors' time-varying interest in specific assets. We use a wide range of state-of-the-art models, both of linear and nonlinear type (regime-switching predictive regressions, threshold autoregressive, smooth transition autoregressive), extended to capture conditional heteroskedasticity through GARCH models. The predictor variables investigated are those typical of the literature featuring a range of macroeconomic and market leading indicators. Our out-of-sample forecasting exercises are conducted with reference to US, UK, French and German data, both stocks and bonds, and for 1- and 12-months-ahead horizons. We employ several forecast performance metrics and predictive accuracy tests. Internet-search-based models are found to perform better than the average of all of the alternative models. For several country-asset-horizon combinations, particularly for UK bond returns, our heuristic models compare favourably with sophisticated econometric methods. The heuristic models are also shown to perform well in forecasting realized volatility. The baseline results are supported by several extensions and robustness checks, such as using alternative search keywords, controlling for Fama-French and Cochrane-Piazzesi factors, and implementing heuristic-based trading strategies.","[Guidolin, Massimo; Pedio, Manuela] Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Orlov, Alexei G.] US Secur & Exchange Commiss, 100 F St NE, Washington, DC 20549 USA",Bocconi University; U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC),"Orlov, AG (通讯作者)，US Secur & Exchange Commiss, 100 F St NE, Washington, DC 20549 USA.",orlova@sec.gov,"PEDIO, MANUELA/AAF-2978-2021","PEDIO, MANUELA/0000-0001-9521-0016",,,,,49,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In the Black-Scholes model, it has been recognized that computing a hedging position from the sensitivity of the calibrated model option value function is inadequate in minimizing variance of the option hedge risk, as it fails to capture the model parameter dependence on the underlying price (see e.g. Coleman et al., J. Risk, 2001, 5(6), 63-89; Hull and White, J. Bank. Finance, 2017, 82, 180-190). In this paper, we demonstrate that this issue can exist generally when determining hedging position from the sensitivity of the option function, either calibrated from a parametric model from current option prices or estimated nonparametricaly from historical option prices. Consequently, the sensitivity of the estimated model option function typically does not minimize variance of the hedge risk, even instantaneously. We propose a data-driven approach to directly learn a hedging function from the market data by minimizing variance of the local hedge risk. Using the S&P 500 index daily option data for more than a decade ending in August 2015, we show that the proposed method outperforms the parametric minimum variance hedging method proposed in Hull and White [J. Bank. Finance, 2017, 82, 180-190], as well as minimum variance hedging corrective techniques based on stochastic volatility or local volatility models. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach achieves significant gain over the implied BS delta hedging for weekly and monthly hedging.","[Nian, Ke; Li, Yuying] Univ Waterloo, Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Coleman, Thomas F.] Univ Waterloo, Combinator & Optimizat, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Li, YY (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",yuying@uwaterloo.ca,,,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [111525]; Ophelia Lazaridis University Research Chair,National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Ophelia Lazaridis University Research Chair,This work was supported by National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [111525]; Ophelia Lazaridis University Research Chair.,,49,8,9,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Fidaxomicin treatment results in lower recurrence rates than vancomycin and metronidazole, but has higher acquisition costs in Europe and the USA. This systematic literature review summarises economic evaluations (EEs) of fidaxomicin, vancomycin and metronidazole for treatment of CDI. Electronic databases (MEDLINEA (R), Embase, Cochrane Library) and conference proceedings (ISPOR, ECCMID, ICAAC and IDWeek) were searched for publications reporting EEs of fidaxomicin, vancomycin and/or metronidazole in the treatment of CDI. Reference bibliographies of identified manuscripts were also reviewed. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated according to the overall population of patients with CDI, as well as in subgroups with severe CDI or recurrent CDI, or those at higher risk of recurrence or mortality. Overall, 27 relevant EEs, conducted from the perspective of 12 different countries, were identified. Fidaxomicin was cost-effective versus vancomycin and/or metronidazole in 14 of 24 EEs (58.3%), vancomycin was cost-effective versus fidaxomicin and/or metronidazole in five of 27 EEs (18.5%) and metronidazole was cost-effective versus fidaxomicin and/or vancomycin in two of 13 EEs (15.4%). Fidaxomicin was cost-effective versus vancomycin in most of the EEs evaluating specific patient subgroups. Key cost-effectiveness drivers were cure rate, recurrence rate, time horizon, drug costs and length and cost of hospitalisation. In most EEs, fidaxomicin was demonstrated to be cost-effective versus metronidazole and vancomycin in patients with CDI. These results have relevance to clinical practice, given the high budgetary impact of managing CDI and increasing restrictions on healthcare budgets.

While a large literature argues that elite capture is rooted in a country's history, our understanding of the determinants of elite persistence is limited. In this paper, we show that allowing old-regime agents to remain in office during democratic transitions is a key determinant of the extent of elite capture. We exploit quasi-random from Indonesia: Soeharto-regime mayors were allowed to finish their terms before being replaced by new leaders. Since mayors' political cycles were not synchronized, this event generated exogenous variation in how long old-regime mayors remained in their position during the democratic transition. Districts with longer exposure to old-regime mayors experience worse governance outcomes, higher elite persistence, and lower political competition in the medium run. The results suggest that slower transitions towards democracy allow the old-regime elites to capture democracy.","[Martinez-Bravo, Monica; Stegmann, Andreas] CEMFI, Madrid, Spain; [Mukherjee, Priya] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Martinez-Bravo, M (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Madrid, Spain.",mmb@cemfi.es; pmukherjee@wm.edu; stegmann@cemfi.edu.es,,"Martinez-Bravo, Monica/0000-0002-1783-5704",Fundacion Ramon Areces; L.R.

Resources are misallocated. Welfare is lowered. In contrast to some other areas of public healthcare, patients exercise 'voice' rather than 'exit' concerning the public provision of high-cost new medicines. Setting publicly agreed cost-effectiveness thresholds, with clear predictable criteria for when the cost-effectiveness thresholds can be exceeded, would contribute to the creation of a more appropriate new medicine decision-making framework. It would incentivise suppliers to set prices consistent with the decision-making framework. Guidance and clarity raises the possibility of shielding the Health Service Executive, the decision maker, at least partially, from the pressure to fund expensive new medicines that lack cost-effectiveness, while at the same time increasing transparency and predictability.","[Gorecki, Paul K.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Gorecki, Paul K.] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin 2, Ireland.;Gorecki, PK (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland.",pkgorecki@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2017,35.0,10,,,,,981,987,,10.1007/s40273-017-0536-y,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FH7AR,28681277.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411333800002,0

In making social policies and pricing annuity at national and subnational levels, it is important not only to forecast mortality accurately, but also to ensure that forecasts at the subnational level add up to the forecasts at the national level. This motivates recent developments in grouped functional time series methods (Shang and Hyndman, in press) to reconcile age-specific mortality forecasts. We extend these grouped functional time series forecasting methods to multivariate time series, and apply them to produce point forecasts of mortality rates at older ages, from which fixed-term annuities for different ages and maturities can be priced. Using the regional age-specific mortality rates in Japan obtained from the Japanese Mortality Database, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 15-step ahead point-forecast accuracy between the independent and grouped forecasting methods. The grouped forecasting methods are shown not only to be useful for reconciling forecasts of age -specific mortality rates at national and subnational levels, but they are also shown to allow improved forecast accuracy. The improved forecast accuracy of mortality rates is of great interest to the insurance and pension industries for estimating annuity prices, in particular at the level of population subgroups, defined by key factors such as sex, region, and socioeconomic grouping.","[Shang, Han Lin] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Stat, Level 4,Bldg 26C, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Haberman, Steven] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London, England",Australian National University; City University London,"Shang, HL (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Finance Actuarial Studies & Stat, Level 4,Bldg 26C, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",hanlin.shang@anu.edu.au,"Shang, Han Lin/J-6155-2019","Shang, Han Lin/0000-0003-1769-6430",Australian National University [R628601703],Australian National University(Australian National University),"The authors are grateful for the insightful comments and suggestions of the two reviewers, as well as the seminar participants at the Cass Business School at the City University of London, the Economic and Social Research Council Centre for Population Change at the University of Southampton, the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Adelaide, and the Department of Applied Finance and Actuarial Studies at Macquarie University.

However, in terms of theoretical aspects, only the consistency of the bootstrap has been established, while the higher order asymptotic refinement remains unproven. For example, Corradi and Iglesias (2008) demonstrate the asymptotic refinement of the block bootstrap for GARCH models but leave the results of the residual-based bootstrap as a conjecture. To derive the second order asymptotic refinement of the residual-based GARCH bootstrap, we utilize the analysis in Andrews (2001, 2002) and establish the Edgeworth expansions of the t-statistics, as well as the convergence of their moments. As expected, we show that the bootstrap error in the coverage probabilities of the equal-tailed t-statistic and the corresponding test-inversion confidence intervals are at most of the order of O (n(-1)), where the exact order depends on the moment condition of the process. This convergence rate is faster than that of the block bootstrap, as well as that of the first order asymptotic test.","[Jeong, Minsoo] Yonsei Univ, Wonju Campus, Wonju, Gangwon, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Jeong, M (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Econ, Wonju Campus, Wonju 26493, Gangwon, South Korea.",mssjong@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,34,11,12,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

A Comparison of Mappings Between the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and the EQ-5D-3L Based on Raw and Differenced Score Data,PHARMACOECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UTILITY VALUES; BACK-PAIN; OUTCOMES,"Mapping algorithms are increasingly being used to predict health-utility values based on responses or scores from non-preference-based measures, thereby informing economic evaluations. We explored whether predictions in the EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level instrument (EQ-5D-3L) health-utility gains from mapping algorithms might differ if estimated using differenced versus raw scores, using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ), a widely used health status measure for low back pain, as an example. We estimated algorithms mapping within-person changes in RMQ scores to changes in EQ-5D-3L health utilities using data from two clinical trials with repeated observations. We also used logistic regression models to estimate response mapping algorithms from these data to predict within-person changes in responses to each EQ-5D-3L dimension from changes in RMQ scores. Predicted health-utility gains from these mappings were compared with predictions based on raw RMQ data. Using differenced scores reduced the predicted health-utility gain from a unit decrease in RMQ score from 0.037 (standard error [SE] 0.001) to 0.020 (SE 0.002). Analysis of response mapping data suggests that the use of differenced data reduces the predicted impact of reducing RMQ scores across EQ-5D-3L dimensions and that patients can experience health-utility gains on the EQ-5D-3L 'usual activity' dimension independent from improvements captured by the RMQ. Mappings based on raw RMQ data overestimate the EQ-5D-3L health utility gains from interventions that reduce RMQ scores. Where possible, mapping algorithms should reflect within-person changes in health outcome and be estimated from datasets containing repeated observations if they are to be used to estimate incremental health-utility gains.","[Madan, Jason; Khan, Kamran A.; Petrou, Stavros] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Hlth Sci, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Lamb, Sarah E.] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Med Sci Div, Oxford OX3 7HE, England",University of Warwick; University of Oxford,"Madan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Div Hlth Sci, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",j.j.madan@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Khan, Kamran/JFJ-9362-2023","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Khan, Kamran/0000-0002-4322-9695; Lamb, Sarah/0000-0003-4349-7195; Madan, Jason/0000-0003-4316-1480","Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform; Advantage West Midlands (AWM); Wolfson Foundation; MRC [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish",Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform; Advantage West Midlands (AWM); Wolfson Foundation; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Although no funding directly supported this study, the authors benefitted from facilities funded through the Birmingham Science City Translational Medicine Clinical Research and Infrastructure Trials Platform, with support from Advantage West Midlands (AWM) and the Wolfson Foundation.",,14,5,5,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2017,35.0,5,,,,,549,559,,10.1007/s40273-016-0483-z,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,ER9SS,28063083.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399167600005,0

As a criterion for riskiness, we consider the evolution of the value-at-risk spread from a GARCH model with normal innovations relative to a GARCH model with generalized innovations. These generalized innovations may for example follow a Student t, a generalized hyperbolic, an alpha-stable or a Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Our results indicate that the GPD distribution provides the strongest signals for avoiding tail risks. This is not surprising as the GPD distribution arises as a limit of tail behaviour in extreme value theory and therefore is especially suited to deal with tail risks. Out-of-sample backtests on 11 years of DAX futures data, indicate that the dynamic tail-risk protection strategy effectively reduces the tail risk while outperforming traditional portfolio protection strategies. The results are further validated by calculating the statistical significance of the results obtained using bootstrap methods. A number of robustness tests including application to other assets further underline the effectiveness of the strategy. Finally, by empirically testing for second-order stochastic dominance, we find that risk averse investors would be willing to pay a positive premium to move from a static buy-and-hold investment in the DAX future to the tail-risk protection strategy.","[Packham, N.] Berlin Sch Econ & Law, D-10825 Berlin, Germany; [Papenbrock, J.] Firamis & PPI AG, D-61440 Oberursel, Germany; [Schwendner, P.] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Inst Wealth & Asset Management, CH-8401 Winterthur, Switzerland; [Woebbeking, F.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Finance, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Packham, N (通讯作者)，Berlin Sch Econ & Law, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.",natalie.packham@hwr-berlin.de,"Schwendner, Peter/AAM-5471-2020","Schwendner, Peter/0000-0001-9366-3564; Wobbeking, Fabian/0000-0003-0287-6092; Packham, Natalie/0000-0002-8065-747X",,,,,59,3,5,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The valuation of GMWB has been extensively covered in the previous literature, but a more challenging problem is the computation of the risk based capital for risk management and regulatory reasons. One needs to find the tail distribution of the profit-loss function, which differs from its expected payoff required for pricing the GMWB contract. GMWB has embedded two option-like features: Management fees are proportional to the current value of the policyholder's account which results in an average price of the account. Thus the contract resembles an Asian option. However, the fees are charged only up to the time of the account hitting zero which resembles a barrier option payoff. Thus the GMWB is mathematically more complicated than Asian or barrier options traded on the financial markets. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature to formulate and analyse profit-loss distribution using PDE methods of such a product with intricate option-like features. Our approach is much more efficient than the current market practice of rather intensive and expensive Monte Carlo simulations due to the lack of samples for extreme cases.","[Feng, Runhuan] Univ Illinois, Dept Math, 1409 W Green St,MC-382, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Vecer, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic; [Vecer, Jan] Vysoka Skola Aplikovaneho Prava, Chomutovicka 1443, Prague 14900 4, Czech Republic",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Charles University Prague,"Vecer, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.;Vecer, J (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Aplikovaneho Prava, Chomutovicka 1443, Prague 14900 4, Czech Republic.",vecer@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Vecer, Jan/H-9917-2012","Vecer, Jan/0000-0002-1501-4646; Feng, Runhuan/0000-0002-9957-1019",GACR [16-21216S],GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The work of JanVecer was supported in part by GACR [grant number 16-21216S].,,17,13,15,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

However, drug approval and health technology assessment agencies have stressed that surrogates should only be used in the absence of clinical endpoints. Objective The aim of this systematic review was to identify and summarise the methodologies, weaknesses and strengths of economic models based on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event rates. Methods Cost-effectiveness evaluations of lipid-lowering therapies using cardiovascular event rates in adults with hyperlipidaemia were sought in Medline, Embase, Medline In-Process, PubMed and NHS EED and conference proceedings. Search results were independently screened, extracted and quality checked by two reviewers. Results Searches until February 2016 retrieved 3443 records, from which 26 studies (29 publications) were selected. Twenty-two studies evaluated secondary prevention (four also assessed primary prevention), two considered only primary prevention and two included mixed primary and secondary prevention populations. Most studies (18) based treatment-effect estimates on single trials, although more recent evaluations deployed meta-analyses (5/10 over the last 10 years). Markov models (14 studies) were most commonly used and only one study employed discrete event simulation. Models varied particularly in terms of health states and treatment-effect duration. No studies used a systematic review to obtain utilities. Most studies took a healthcare perspective (21/26) and sourced resource use from key trials instead of local data. Overall, reporting quality was suboptimal. Conclusions This review reveals methodological changes over time, but reporting weaknesses remain, particularly with respect to transparency of model reporting.","[Wei, Ching-Yun; Forbes, Carol A.; Ryder, Steve; Armstrong, Nigel; Deshpande, Sohan; Duffy, Steven] Kleijnen Systemat Reviews Ltd, Unit 6, Escrick Business Pk,Riccall Rd, York YO19 6FD, N Yorkshire, England; [Quek, Ruben G.

Since the capacity of the Owned Warehouse (OW) is usually limited and, under some special circumstances, the procurement of a large amount of items can be decided, a Rented Warehouse (RW) can be used to store the excess quantity. In addition, we assume, that the supplier offers the retailer a credit scheme, which provides a fixed delay period for settling his account. Sales revenue generated during this credit period is deposited to an interest bearing account. At the end of this period the retailer settles the account. Thereafter, capital opportunity cost for the value of items still in stock is charged. The study of the inventory system requires exploring the feasible ordering relations between the time parameters. Consequently the following cases, which lead to two inventory models, must be examined: (1) the offered credit period is less than the time point when the demand rate is stabilized, (2) the offered credit period is longer than the time point when the demand rate is stabilized and less than the planning horizon.

The company has no obligation to inject capitals and therefore, the bankruptcy risk is present. Capital injections, if any, will incur both fixed and proportional transaction costs and dividend payments incur proportional transaction costs. The aim is to find the optimal strategy to maximize the expected present value of dividend payments minus the total cost of capital injections up to the time of bankruptcy. The problem is formulated as a mixed impulse-regular control problem. We address the problem via studying three cases of two auxiliary functions. We derive important analytical properties of the auxiliary functions and use them to study the value function and then identify the optimal control strategy. We show that the optimal dividend control is of threshold type and the optimal financing strategy prescribes to either never inject capitals or inject capitals only when the surplus reaches 0 with a fixed lump sum amount.","[Zhu, Jinxia] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Zhu, JX (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2031, Australia.",jinxia.zhu@unsw.edu.au,,"Zhu, Jinxia/0000-0003-2987-533X",,,,,18,7,8,3,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2017,47.0,1,,,,,239,268,,10.1017/asb.2016.29,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EH1ZM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391566900007,0

Although the MSMD process is exponential -mixing as we show in the article, it is capable of generating highly persistent autocorrelation. We study, analytically and by simulation, how this feature of durations generated by the MSMD process propagates to counts and realized volatility. We employ a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator of the MSMD parameters based on the Whittle approximation and establish its strong consistency and asymptotic normality for general MSMD specifications. We show that the Whittle estimation is a computationally simple and fast alternative to maximum likelihood. Finally, we compare the performance of the MSMD model with competing short- and long-memory duration models in an out-of-sample forecasting exercise based on price durations of three major foreign exchange futures contracts. The results of the comparison show that the MSMD and the Long Memory Stochastic Duration model perform similarly and are superior to the short-memory Autoregressive Conditional Duration models.","[Zikes, Filip] Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England; [Barunik, Jozef] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Barunik, Jozef] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Shenai, Nikhil] Imperial Coll London, Sch Business, London, England",Bank of England; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Imperial College London,"Zikes, F (通讯作者)，Bank England, Threadneedle St, London EC2R 8AH, England.",filip.zikes@bankofengland.co.uk,"Barunik, Jozef/G-7617-2014","Barunik, Jozef/0000-0001-5097-2607",Czech Science Foundation [13-32263S]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7-SSH-612955],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),Jozef Barunik gratefully acknowledges financial suppport from the Czech Science Foundation under project No. 13-32263S and funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement No. FP7-SSH-612955 (FinMaP).,,45,6,7,1,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) are expected to address the potential problem of influenza B-lineage mismatch for TIVs.ObjectiveThe objective of this analysis was to compare the cost effectiveness of QIV versus TIV in children aged 6-59months and older adults65years of age in South Korea.MethodsA 1-year static population model was employed to compare the costs and outcomes of a QIV vaccination program compared with TIV in children aged 6-59months and older adults65years of age in South Korea. Influenza-related parameters (probabilities, health resource use, and costs) were derived from an analysis of the National Health Insurance System claims database between 2010 and 2013 under a broad and narrow set of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes used to identify influenza. Other inputs were extracted from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2016 South Korean Won [KRW] per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) were estimated using a limited' societal perspective as per the Korean pharmacoeconomic guidelines. QALYs lost due to premature mortality were discounted at 5% annually.ResultsFor both age groups combined, under the narrow definition of influenza, QIV is expected to prevent nearly 16,000 (2923 in children and 13,011 in older adults) medically attended influenza cases, nearly 8000 (672 in children, 7048 in older adults) cases of complications, and over 230 (0 in children, 238 in older adults) deaths annually compared with TIV. The impact of using QIV versus TIV in this setting translates into savings of KRW 24 billion (KRW 0.6 billion in children, KRW 23.4 billion in older adults) in annual medical costs, and over 2100 (18 in children, 2084 in older adults) QALYs. Under the broad definition, the corresponding results are over 190,000 (50,697 in children, 140,644 in older adults) influenza cases, over 37,000 (12,623 in children, 24,526 in older adults) complications, 270 deaths (0 in children, 270 in older adults), KRW 94.22 billion (KRW 16 billion in children, KRW 78.2 billion in older adults), and over 3500 QALYs saved (316 in children, 3260 in older adults).ConclusionThe use of QIV over TIV was estimated to not be cost effective in children 6-59months of age, but cost saving in older adults, using the narrow definition of influenza; however, QIV use was cost saving in both age groups using the broad definition. QIV is expected to yield more benefits in older adults65years of age than in children aged 6-59months due to higher influenza-related mortality and costs among the older adults. Further analyses considering the indirect effects of influenza vaccination in children are required.","[Kim, Yun-Kyung] Korea Univ, Ansan Hosp, Ansan, South Korea; [Song, Joon Young] Korea Univ, Coll Med, Guro Hosp, Div Infect Dis, Seoul, South Korea; [Jang, Hyeongap] GSK, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Tae Hyun] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Koo, Heejo; Han, Euna] Yonsei Univ, Yonsei Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Coll Pharm, 162-1 Songdo Dong, Incheon, South Korea; [Varghese, Lijoy] GSK, Singapore, Singapore",Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); Korea University; Korea University Medicine (KU Medicine); GlaxoSmithKline; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; Yonsei University; GlaxoSmithKline,"Han, E (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Yonsei Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Coll Pharm, 162-1 Songdo Dong, Incheon, South Korea.",THKIM@yuhs.ac; eunahan@yonsei.ac.kr,"Kim, Tae Hyun/P-1470-2019","Kim, Tae Hyun/0000-0001-8413-3385; Song, Joon Young/0000-0002-0148-7194; Kim, Tae Hyun/0000-0003-1053-8958; Varghese, Lijoy/0000-0002-6036-424X; Han, Euna/0000-0003-2656-7059",GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA [HO-15-16168],GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA(GlaxoSmithKline),"GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA was the funding source, was involved in all stages of the study conduct and analysis, and funded all costs associated with the development and publishing of the present article (GSK study identifier: HO-15-16168).

This general class of premium principles encompasses many widely used premium principles such as expected value, variance related, modified variance and mean value principles. We show that any admissible insurance contract, in which the marginal indemnity above a deductible minimum is decreasing in the loss and has a value greater than zero and less than one, is suboptimal to a dual change-loss insurance policy or a change-loss insurance policy, depending upon the coefficient of variation of the ceded loss. Especially for variance related premium principles, it is shown that the change-loss insurance is optimal. In addition to change-loss insurance, a numerical example illustrates that the dual change-loss insurance may also be an optimal choice when the insurance premium is calculated by mean value principle.

The interaction of input-output networks with industry-level market structure affects the amplification of shocks and the pattern of diffusion in the model, generating cascades of firm entry and exit across the economy. In this model, sales provide a poor measure of the systemic importance of industries. Unlike the relevant notions of centrality in competitive constant-returns-to-scale models, systemic importance depends on the industry's role as both a supplier and a consumer of inputs, as well as the market structure of industries. A basic calibration of the model suggests that aggregate output is three times more volatile in response to labor productivity shocks when compared to a perfectly competitive model.","[Baqaee, David Rezza] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Baqaee, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",baqaee@econ.ucla.edu,,,,,,,33,40,56,12,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2018,86.0,5,,,,,1819,1838,,10.3982/ECTA15280,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HB2AT,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450837000009,0

Inmany situations this is an unrealistic assumption. We develop a framework for reasoning about games where the players may be translucent to one another; in particular, a player may believe that if she were to change strategies, then the other player would also change strategies. Translucent playersmay achieve significantly more efficient outcomes than opaque ones. Our main result is a characterization of strategies consistent with appropriate analogues of common belief of rationality. CommonCounterfactual Belief of Rationality (CCBR) holds if (1) everyone is rational, (2) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational (i.e., all players i believe that everyone else would still be rational even if i were to switch strategies), (3) everyone counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and counterfactually believes that everyone else is rational, and so on. CCBR characterizes the set of strategies surviving iterated removal of minimax-dominated strategies, where a strategy s for player i is minimax dominated by sigma' if theworst-case payoff for i using sigma' is better than the best possible payoff using sigma.","[Halpern, Joseph Y.; Pass, Rafael] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Halpern, JY (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",halpern@cs.cornell.edu; rafael@cs.cornell.edu,,,,,,,33,5,7,1,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Relative to securitization, reinsurance features lower adverse selection costs because reinsurers possess superior underwriting resources than ordinary capital market investors. Reinsurance premia, however, reflect markups over actuarially fair premia due to the additional costs of underwriting. Insurers' risk transfer choices trade off the costs and benefits of reinsurance relative to securitization. In equilibrium, low risks are transferred via reinsurance, while intermediate and high risks are transferred via partial and full securitization, respectively. An increase in the loss size increases the trigger risk level above which securitization is chosen. Hence, catastrophe exposures, which are characterized by lower probabilities and higher severities, are more likely to be retained or reinsured rather than securitized. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In response, weather risk hedging may be valuable, however, due to basis risk it has been largely unsuccessful to date. This research proposes the Levy subordinated hierarchical Archimedean copula model in modelling the spatial dependence of weather risk to reduce basis risk. The analysis shows that the Levy subordinated hierarchical Archimedean copula model can improve the hedging performance through more accurate modelling of the dependence structure of weather risks and is more efficient in hedging extreme downside weather risk, compared to the benchmark copula models. Further, the results reveal that more effective hedging may be achieved as the spatial aggregation level increases. This research demonstrates that hedging weather risk is an important risk management method, and the approach outlined in this paper may be useful to insurers and reinsurers in the case of agriculture, as well as for other related risks in the property and casualty sector.","[Zhu, Wenjun] Nanyang Business Sch, Div Banking & Finance, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Tan, Ken Seng] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Porth, Lysa] Univ Manitoba, Asper Sch Business, Warren Ctr Actuarial Studies & Res, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Wang, Chou-Wen] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Nanyang Technological University; University of Waterloo; University of Manitoba; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Zhu, WJ (通讯作者)，Nanyang Business Sch, Div Banking & Finance, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",wjzhu@ntu.edu.sg; kstan@uwaterloo.ca; lysa.porth@umanitoba.ca; chouwenwang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,"Zhu, Wenjun/ABC-4088-2021","Zhu, Wenjun/0000-0002-7251-9579",Nanyang Technological University Start Up Grant [M4082106.010]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); Ministry of Science and Technology [105-2410-H-110 -089 -MY2],Nanyang Technological University Start Up Grant(Nanyang Technological University); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),Zhu acknowledges the research funding support from the Nanyang Technological University Start Up Grant (M4082106.010).

However, the long-term clinical and economic impact of using alectinib vs. crizotinib has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine the potential cost utility of alectinib vs. crizotinib from a US payer perspective. Methods A cost-utility model was developed using partition survival methods and three health states: progression-free, post-progression, and death. ALEX trial data informed the progression-free and overall survival estimates. Costs included drug treatments and supportive care (central nervous system and non-central nervous system). Utility values were obtained from trial data and literature. Sensitivity analyses included one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results Treatment with alectinib vs. crizotinib resulted in a gain of 0.91 life-years, 0.87 quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental costs of US$34,151, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$39,312/quality-adjusted life-year. Drug costs and utilities in the progression-free health state were the main drivers of the model in the one-way sensitivity analysis. From the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, alectinib had a 64% probability of being cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$100,000/quality adjusted life-year. Conclusion Alectinib increased time in the progression-free state and quality-adjusted life-years vs. crizotinib. The marginal cost increase was reflective of longer treatment durations in the progression-free state. Central nervous system-related costs were considerably lower with alectinib. Our results suggest that compared with crizotinib, alectinib may be a cost-effective therapy for treatment-na < ve patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.","[Carlson, Josh J.; Suh, Kangho] Univ Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St,H-375I,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Orfanos, Panos] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland; [Wong, William] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Roche Holding; Roche Holding; Genentech,"Carlson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St,H-375I,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",Carlsojj@u.washington.edu,"Suh, Kangho/IWD-5849-2023","Carlson, Josh J/0000-0001-7664-8370; Suh, Kangho/0000-0002-7906-9398; Wong, William/0000-0002-6054-278X","Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","This work was funded by Genentech, Inc.",,51,26,28,1,20,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2018,36.0,4,,,,,495,504,,10.1007/s40273-018-0625-6,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY5UL,29488070.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426901000010,0

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) and Centre for Health Economics (CHE) Technology Appraisal Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the Company's submission, the ERG's critical review of submitted evidence, and the resulting NICE guidance. The main supporting clinical evidence was derived from four well conducted, randomised controlled trials, comparing ustekinumab with placebo in two sub-populations (conventional care failure and anti-TNF alpha failure patients) of adults with moderate-to-severe CD. Three trials assessed treatment induction over 8 weeks, while the fourth recruited successfully induced patients into a maintenance trial for 1 year. These trials showed ustekinumab to be more effective than placebo in terms of its ability to induce and maintain clinical response and remission. In the absence of any direct head-to-head data, the Company conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA), which synthesised induction trial data on ustekinumab and relevant comparators (vedolizumab, adalimumab and infliximab) using placebo data as a common comparator. This analysis found ustekinumab to be of comparable efficacy to previously approved biologics in treatment induction. A 'treatment sequence analysis' compared long-term treatment efficacy, finding ustekinumab to be comparable in maintaining treatment response and remission to the three other biologic therapies. However, the ERG had identified many limitations and potential bias in this analysis, and urged caution when interpreting the results. The Company's economic model estimated ustekinumab to be dominant in both sub-populations compared with conventional care; however, the ERG's preferred base-case estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 109,279 pound in the conventional care failure sub-population, and A 110,967 pound in the anti-TNF alpha failure sub-population when compared with conventional care. However, the ERG identified significant failings in both the model structure and data inputs, which could not be addressed without complete restructuring. The ERG considered that the economic analysis presented by the Company failed to adequately address the decision problem specified in NICE's scope. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended ustekinumab within its market authorisation, on the grounds of sufficiently similar efficacy and costs to previously recommended biologic therapies. However, the ERG's analyses demonstrated that all currently recommended biologics are unlikely to be cost effective relative to conventional care, raising broader questions regarding the appropriateness of cost-comparison exercises for decision making.","[Hodgson, Robert; Walton, Matthew; Biswas, Mousumi; Mebrahtu, Teumzghi; Woolacott, Nerys] Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Walton, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, CRD, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",matthew.walton@york.ac.uk,"Biswas, Dr. Mousumi/IUM-9021-2023; Walton, Matthew/AAB-4192-2019","Walton, Matthew/0000-0003-1932-3689; Biswas, Mousumi/0000-0001-6781-7400; Mebrahtu, Teumzghi Fisseha/0000-0003-4821-2304; Hodgson, Robert/0000-0001-6962-2893",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [16/10/12],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 16/10/12).

The stock prices follow stochastic covariance processes and the investor can have different levels of uncertainty about the diffusion parts of the stocks and the covariance structure. We find strong evidence that the optimal exposures to stock and covariance risks are significantly affected by ambiguity aversion. Welfare analyses show that investors who ignore model uncertainty incur large losses, larger than those suffered under the embedded one-dimensional cases.

But at the difference of the classical approach of Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath and the subsequent extensions of this model, our risk measures are built to reflect the risk perception of shareholders rather than regulators. Instead of an axiomatic approach, we derive risk measures from the optimal policies of a shareholder value-maximizing company. We study these optimal policies and the related risk measures that we call shareholder risk measures. We emphasize the fact that due to the specific corporate environment, in particular the limited shareholders' liability and the possibility to pay out dividends from cash reserves, these risk measures are not convex. Also, they depend on the specific economic situation of the firm, in particular its current cash level, and thus they are not translation invariant.

We empirically evaluate the proposed framework using four commonly used data-sets. Although these data-sets do not consider delisted firms and are thus subject to survival bias, empirical evaluations show that the proposed TCO framework may effectively handle reasonable transaction costs and improve existing strategies in the case of non-zero transaction costs.","[Li, Bin] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jialei] Univ Chicago, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Huang, Dingjiang] East China Normal Univ, Sch Data Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

Motivated by the work of Litterman and Scheinkman (1991), which verifies that interest rate risks could be properly modeled with multiple factors, our proposed model extends the Jarrow and Yildirim (JY, 2003) model to a multi-factor framework, and simultaneously incorporates a stock asset to develop what is called the extended JY model in this study. The extended JY model can specify an economic environment with the consideration of risks arising from nominal and real interest rates, the CPI index (inflation rates), and the value of a stock portfolio, which facilitates to complete the closed-form solutions for the stochastic dynamic programming problem of a DC pension plan. The subsequent numerical experiment examines the allocative behaviors in an inflationary economy. In addition, the term effects among interest rates show to have a substantial impact on allocative decisions, and thus can be properly exploited to improve the final wealth of the pension fund.

Some nonparametric inferences have been proposed in the literature. When the loss variable does not have enough moments, which depends on the involved Young function, the nonparametric estimator in Ahn and Shyamalkumar (2014) has a nonnormal limit, which challenges interval estimation. Motivated by the fact that many loss variables in insurance and finance could have a heavier tail such as an infinite variance, this paper proposes a new estimator which estimates the tail by extreme value theory and the middle part nonparametrically. It turns out that the proposed new estimator always has a normal limit regardless of the tail heaviness of the loss variable. Hence an interval with asymptotically correct confidence level can be obtained easily either by the normal approximation method via estimating the asymptotic variance or by a bootstrap method. A simulation study and real data analysis confirm the effectiveness of the proposed new inference procedure for estimating the H-G risk measure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, with some few exceptions, all of the transactions to date have been bespoke longevity swaps based upon the mortality experience of a portfolio of named lives. In order for this market to start to meet its true potential, solutions will ultimately be needed that provide protection for all types of members, are cost effective for large and smaller schemes, are tradable, and enable access to the wider capital markets. Index-based solutions have the potential to meet this need; however, concerns remain with these solutions. In particular, the basis risk emerging from the potential mismatch between the underlying forces of mortality for the index reference portfolio and the pension fund/annuity book being hedged is the principal issue that has, to date, prevented many schemes progressing their consideration of index-based solutions. Two-population stochastic mortality models offer an alternative to overcome this obstacle as they allow market participants to compare and project the mortality experience for the reference and target populations and thus assess the amount of demographic basis risk involved in an index-based longevity hedge. In this paper, we systematically assess the suitability of several multi-population stochastic mortality models for assessing basis risks and provide guidelines on how to use these models in practical situations paying particular attention to the data requirements for the appropriate calibration and forecasting of such models.","[Villegas, Andres M.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Villegas, Andres M.] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res CEPAR, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Haberman, Steven; Kaishev, Vladimir K.; Millossovich, Pietro] City Univ London, Fac Actuarial Sci & Insurance, Cass Business Sch, London, England; [Millossovich, Pietro] Univ Trieste, Dept Econ Business Math & Stat B de Finetti, Trieste, Italy",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; City University London; University of Trieste,"Millossovich, P (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Fac Actuarial Sci & Insurance, Cass Business Sch, London, England.;Millossovich, P (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dept Econ Business Math & Stat B de Finetti, Trieste, Italy.",a.villegas@unsw.edu.au; s.haberman@city.ac.uk; v.kaishev@city.ac.uk; Pietro.Millossovich.1@city.ac.uk,"MILLOSSOVICH, PIETRO/AFT-2740-2022","MILLOSSOVICH, PIETRO/0000-0001-8269-7507; Villegas, Andres/0000-0001-5967-5764; Kaishev, Vladimir K./0000-0002-4713-7907",,,,,59,49,51,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,SEP,2017,47.0,3,,,,,631,679,,10.1017/asb.2017.18,0.0,,,49,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FE9ZW,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408563000001,0

Methods We conducted a partitioned-survival model with a cycle length of 1 week and a base-case time horizon of 20 years. Parametric models were fitted to Kaplan-Meier estimates of time on treatment, progression-free survival and overall survival from the KEYNOTE-024 randomized clinical trial (patients aged >= 18 years with stage IV NSCLC, TPS >= 50%, without epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations who received no prior systemic chemotherapy) and validated with long-term registry data. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated based on EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) utility data collected in the trial. Costs ($US, year 2016 values) for drug acquisition/administration, adverse events and clinical management were included. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. A series of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results In the base-case scenario, pembrolizumab resulted in an expected gain of 1.31 life-years (LYs) and 1.05 QALYs and an incremental cost of $US102,439 compared with SoC. The incremental cost per QALY gain was $US97,621/QALY and the incremental cost per LY gain was $US78,344/LY. Conclusions Pembrolizumab is projected to be a cost-effective option compared with SoC platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in adults with metastatic NSCLC expressing high levels of PD-L1.","[Huang, Min; Pellissier, James; Burke, Thomas; Liu, Frank Xiaoqing; Xu, Ruifeng] Merck & Co Inc, Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence, 2000 Galloping Hill Rd, Kenilworth, NJ 07033 USA; [Lou, Yanyan] Mayo Clin, Dept Hematol & Oncol, 4500 San Pablo Rd, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Velcheti, Vamsidhar] Cleveland Clin, Solid Tumor Oncol, 9500 Euclid Ave,Mail Code R35, Cleveland, OH 44195 USA",Merck & Company; Mayo Clinic; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Huang, M (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence, 2000 Galloping Hill Rd, Kenilworth, NJ 07033 USA.",Min_Huang@merck.com; Lou.Yanyan@mayo.edu; James_Pellissier@merck.com; Thomas_Burke2@merck.com; Xiaoqing.Liu@merck.com; Ruifeng_Xu@merck.com; velchev@ccf.org,"xu, rui/GRX-5734-2022",,Merck Co.

This is a problem of great practical importance in developing countries. Several sellers, each with one unit of land, are located at the nodes of a graph. Two sellers are contiguous if they are connected by an edge in the graph. The buyer realizes a positive value only if he can purchase plots that constitute a path of given length. Our main result is that there is a robust set of priors for which successful mechanisms exist when there are at least two distinct feasible sets of contiguous sellers. The analysis also identifies the role of critical sellers who lie on all such feasible sets.","[Sarkar, Soumendu] TERI Univ, New Delhi, India",TERI University,"Sarkar, S (通讯作者)，TERI Univ, New Delhi, India.",sarkarsoumendu@gmail.com,"sarkar, soumendu/Q-3131-2019","sarkar, soumendu/0000-0002-4315-1824",,,,,29,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

We account for mortality risk and risky investment assets, and we introduce a health proxy to capture the decreasing level of consumption for older retirees. Then, we find the optimal housing at retirement, the optimal consumption and optimal risky asset allocation depending on age and wealth. The model is solved numerically as a stochastic control problem, and it is calibrated using the maximum likelihood method with empirical data of consumption and housing from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2009-2010 Survey. The model fits the characteristics of the data well to explain the behaviour of Australian retirees. The key findings are as follows. First, the optimal policy is highly sensitive to means-tested Age Pension early in retirement, but this sensitivity fades with age. Second, the allocation to risky assets shows a complex relationship with the means-tested Age Pension. As a general rule, when wealth decreases, the proportion allocated to risky assets increases, because the Age Pension works as a buffer against investment losses. Third, couples can be more aggressive with risky allocations owing to their longer life expectancy compared with singles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The models employed are the square root process and an OU equation driven by centred variance gamma shocks. VIX options are calibrated using the square root process. The OU equation driven by centred variance gamma shocks is applied in pricing options on the ratio of the stock price for J. P. Morgan Chase (JPM) to the Exchange Traded Fund for the financial sector with ticker XLF. For the purposes of calibrating the ratio option pricing model to market data, we indirectly infer the prices for stock options on JPM from the prices for options on the ratio, by hedging the conditional value of JPM options given XLF, using options on XLF. The implied volatilities for the options on the ratio are then indirectly observed to be fairly flat. This suggests that for JPM, the use XLF as a benchmark is a possibly good choice. It is shown to perform better than the use of the S&P 500 index. Furthermore, though the use of an unrelated stock price like Johnson and Johnson as a benchmark for JPM provides as a good fit as does the use of XLF, this comes at the cost of requiring a considerable smile for the implied volatilities on the ratio options and hence a more complex model for the implied distribution on the ratio.","[Madan, Dilip B.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Madan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dbm@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,,,,,20,3,4,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Accordingly, generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators are proposed that are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed at the root-N rate.

We apply the general approach to the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model of financial bubbles. This model is particularly relevant because one of its parameters, the critical time t(c) signalling the burst of the bubble, is arguably the target of choice for dynamical risk management. However, previous calibrations of the LPPLS model have shown that the estimation of t(c) is in general quite unstable. Here, we provide a rigorous likelihood inference approach to determine t(c), which takes into account the impact of the other nonlinear (so-called 'nuisance') parameters for the correct adjustment of the uncertainty on t(c). This provides a rigorous interval estimation for the critical time, rather than the point estimation in previous approaches. As a bonus, the interval estimates can also be obtained for the nuisance parameters (m, omega, damping), which can be used to improve filtering of the calibration results. We show that the use of the modified profile likelihood method dramatically reduces the number of local extrema by constructing much simpler smoother log-likelihood landscapes. The remaining distinct solutions can be interpreted as genuine scenarios that unfold as the time of the analysis flows, which can be compared directly via their likelihood ratio. Finally, we develop a multi-scale profile likelihood analysis to visualize the structure of the financial data at different scales (typically from 100 to 750 days). We test the methodology successfully on synthetic price time series and on three well-known historical financial bubbles.","[Filimonov, V.; Demos, G.; Sornette, D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Filimonov, V.] Perm State Univ, Dept Econ, Perm, Russia; [Sornette, D.] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, Geneva, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Perm State University; University of Geneva,"Demos, G (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",gdemos@ethz.ch,,,,,,,61,13,16,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This paper proposes two efficient willow tree methods for pricing European-style and American-style moving average barrier options (MABOs). We first solve the finite-dimensional partial differential equation model for discretely monitored MABOs by willow tree methods, and then compute the value of continuously monitored MABOs by Richardson's two-point extrapolation. Our new willow tree method employs the interpolation error minimization technique to reduce complexity. The corresponding convergence rate and error bounds are also analyzed. It shows that our proposed methods can provide the same accuracy as the binomial tree approach and Monte Carlo simulation, but require much less computing time.

This novel version of the previously introduced thermal optimal path (TOP) method alleviates some inconsistencies by imposing that the lead-lag relationship should be invariant with respect to a time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. This means that, if X comes before Y', this transforms into Y comes before X' under a time reversal. We show that a previously proposed bootstrap test lacks power and leads too often to a lack of rejection of the null that there is no lead-lag correlation when it is present. We introduce instead two novel tests. The first criterion, based on the free energy p-value rho, quantifies the probability that a given lead-lag structure could be obtained from random time series with similar characteristics except for the lead-lag information. The second self-consistent test embodies the idea that, for the lead-lag path to be significant, synchronizing the two time series using the time varying lead-lag path should lead to a statistically significant correlation. We perform intensive synthetic tests to demonstrate their performance and limitations. Finally, we apply the TOPS method with the two new tests to the time-dependent lead-lag structures of house price and monetary policy of the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) from 1991 to 2011. We find that, for both countries, the TOPS paths indicate that interest rate changes were lagging behind house price index changes until the crisis in 2006-2007. The TOPS paths also suggest a catch up of the UK central bank and of the Federal Reserve still not being on top of the game during the crisis itself, as diagnosed by again the significant negative values of TOPS paths until 2008. Only later did the central banks interest rates as well as longer maturity rates lead the house price indices, confirming the occurrence of the transition to an era where the central bank is causally' influencing the housing markets more than the reverse. The TOPS approach stresses the importance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces of information or policies may have drastically different impacts and developments, conditional on the economic, financial and geopolitical conditions. This study reinforces the view that the hypothesis of statistical stationarity in economics is highly questionable.","[Meng, Hao; Xu, Hai-Chuan; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Meng, Hao; Xu, Hai-Chuan; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Meng, Hao; Xu, Hai-Chuan; Zhou, Wei-Xing] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci, Dept Math, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China; [Sornette, Didier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Sornette, Didier] Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, 40 Blvd Du Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland",East China University of Science & Technology; East China University of Science & Technology; East China University of Science & Technology; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Geneva,"Zhou, WX (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Zhou, WX (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Econophys, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Zhou, WX (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Sci, Dept Math, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.;Sornette, D (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Scheuchzerstr 7, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Sornette, D (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Swiss Finance Inst, 40 Blvd Du Pont dArve, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.",wxzhou@ecust.edu.cn; dsornette@ethz.ch,"meng, hao/JHT-3327-2023; Zhou, Wei-Xing/B-1250-2008","Zhou, Wei-Xing/0000-0002-8952-8228; Xu, Hai-Chuan/0000-0002-4035-0318","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71131007, 71501072, 71532009]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71131007], [grant number 71501072], [grant number 71532009].",,33,29,29,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We also prove an important practical result of invariance of the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the choice of equation eliminated from a singular demand system.

We improve the upper bound considerably by showing that the price of stability is at most and prove a matching upper bound for the price of stability. Therefore, we answer an open question posed by Fanelli et al. (Theor Comput Sci 562:90-100, 2015). We prove an upper bound of 2 for the ratio of the costs of a potential optimizer and of an optimum, provide a construction of a lower bound, and give a computer-assisted argument that it reaches 2 for any precision. We then turn our attention to players arriving one by one and playing myopically their best response. We provide matching lower and upper bounds of 2 for the myopic sequential price of anarchy (achieved for a worst-case order of the arrival of the players). We then initiate the study of myopic sequential price of stability and for the multicast game on the ring we construct a lower bound of 4/3 and provide an upper bound To the end, we conjecture and argue that the right answer is 4/3.","[Mamageishvili, Akaki] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Mihalak, Matus] Maastricht Univ, Dept Data Sci & Knowledge Engn, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Montemezzani, Simone] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Maastricht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Mamageishvili, A (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.",akaki@inf.ethz.ch,,,Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [200021_143323/1]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [200021_143323] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We are grateful to anonymous reviewers for their excellent comments that improved the write-up of this paper.

To allow the insurance company's survival after ruin, the reinsurer injects capital only at ruin times caused by jumps larger than a chosen retention level. Otherwise capital must be raised from the shareholders for small deficits. The problem here is to determine adequate reinsurance premiums. It seems fair to base the net reinsurance premium on the discounted expected value of any future capital injections. Inspired by the results of Huzak et al. (2004) and Ben Salah (2014) on successive ruin events, we show that an explicit formula for these reinsurance premiums exists in a setting where aggregate claims are modeled by a subordinator and a Brownian perturbation.

The question then arises: Do there exist linear, symmetric values other than the Shapley value that satisfy associated consistency?. In this Note we give an affirmative answer to this question by showing that a linear, symmetric value satisfies associated consistency if and only if it is a linear combination of the Shapley value and the equal-division solution. In addition, we offer an explicit formula for generating all such solutions and show how the structure of the null space of the Shapley value contributes to its unique position in Hamiache's result.","[Kleinberg, Norman L.] CUNY, Baruch Coll, 17 Lexington Ave,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Kleinberg, Norman L.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, 17 Lexington Ave,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA",,"Kleinberg, NL (通讯作者)，CUNY, Baruch Coll, 17 Lexington Ave,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.;Kleinberg, NL (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, 17 Lexington Ave,Box B10-225, New York, NY 10010 USA.",norman.kleinberg@baruch.cuny.edu,,,Baruch College Wasserman Fellowship Grant,Baruch College Wasserman Fellowship Grant,This work was supported by funds from a Baruch College Wasserman Fellowship Grant.

Rightfully so, as discounting can be quite influential on the outcomes of economic evaluations. The most prominent controversies regarding discounting involve the basis for and height of the discount rate, whether costs and effects should be discounted at the same rate, and whether discount rates should decline or stay constant over time. Moreover, the choice for discount rules depends on the decision context one adopts as the most relevant. In this article, we review these issues and debates, and describe and discuss the current discounting recommendations of the countries publishing their national guidelines.

We show that when the distributional weights on current and future utility in the Epstein-Zin time aggregator do not sum to 1, there is an asymptote in the responses to such a shock with unit intertemporal elasticity of substitution. In the Basu-Bundick model, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is set near unity and the preference shock only hits current utility, so the sum of the weights differs from 1. We show that when we restrict the weights to sum to 1, the asymptote disappears and preference volatility shocks no longer have large effects.

Population-based observational data demonstrate statin treatment after diagnosis of EAC is associated with significant reductions in all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. A feasibility study of adjuvant statin therapy following potentially curative resection for EAC has been completed, with planned progression to a full phase III, randomized controlled trial. The aim was to estimate the cost-utility of statin therapy following surgical resection for EAC from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] for hypothetical cohorts of patients with EAC exposed or not exposed to statins following potentially curative surgical resection. Model parameters were based on estimates from published observational and trial data. Costs, utilities and transition probabilities were modeled to reflect clinical practice from a payer's perspective. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in key parameters. Overall, a cost saving of A 6781 pound per patient was realized with statin treatment compared to no statins. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99% of all iterations were cost saving and 99% of all iterations were less than A 20,000 pound per QALY gained. These results were robust to changes in the price and effectiveness of statins. The cohort exposed to statins had lower costs and better QALY outcomes than the no statin cohort. Assuming a causal improvement in disease outcomes following resection for EAC, statin therapy is very likely to be a cost-saving treatment.","[Khioe, Rebekah Fong Soe; Skedgel, Chris; Hart, Andrew; Alexandre, Leo] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Bob Champion Res & Educ Bldg,James Watson Rd, Norwich NR4 7UQ, Norfolk, England; [Hart, Andrew; Lewis, Michael Philip Nelson; Alexandre, Leo] Norfolk & Norwich Univ Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Colney Lane, Norwich NR4 7UY, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia; Norfolk & Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital,"Khioe, RFS (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Bob Champion Res & Educ Bldg,James Watson Rd, Norwich NR4 7UQ, Norfolk, England.",R.Fong-Soe-Khioe@uea.ac.uk; C.Skedgel@uea.ac.uk; A.Hart@uea.ac.uk; michael.lewis@nnuh.nhs.uk; Leo.Alexandre@uea.ac.uk,,"Lewis, Michael Philip N/0000-0002-6913-6454",National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2013-06-115] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2013-06-115] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),,,49,4,4,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36.0,3,,,,,349,358,,10.1007/s40273-017-0594-1,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29210031.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426705800008,0

The main result provides necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of the joint distribution of the factors.

(2006), or Plat (2009) typically include one or more time dependent parameters. Often, a random walk with drift is used to project these parameters into the future. However, longer time series of historical mortality data often show patterns which a random walk with drift is highly unlikely to generate. In fact, historical mortality trends often appear to be trend stationary around piecewise linear trends with changing slopes over time (see, e.g., Sweeting (2011) or Li et al. (2011)). Periods of lower (but rather constant) mortality improvements are followed by periods of higher improvements and vice versa. In this paper, we propose an alternative trend process which builds on the patterns observed in the historical data. Future trend changes occur randomly over time, and also the trend change magnitude is stochastic. Furthermore, we show how the parameters of this trend process, in particular the probability of observing a trend change in a certain year and the distribution for the trend change magnitude, can be estimated from historical data. We also outline how uncertainty in the parameter estimates can be accounted for. Finally, we compare the trend process to other trend processes which have been proposed in the literature.

From the issuer's perspective it is important to adequately assess the risks associated with the CPPI, both for correct 'gap' fee charging and for risk management. The literature on CPPI modelling typically assumes diffusive or Levy-driven dynamics for the risky asset underlying the strategy. In either case the self-contagious nature of asset prices is not taken into account. In order to account for contagion while preserving analytical tractability, we introduce self-exciting jumps in the underlying dynamics via Hawkes processes. Within this framework we derive the loss probability when trading is performed continuously. Moreover, we estimate measures of the risk involved in the practical implementation of discrete-time rebalancing rules governing the CPPI product. When rebalancing is performed on a frequency less than weekly, failing to take contagion into account will significantly underestimate the risks of the CPPI. Finally, in order to mimic a situation with low liquidity, we impose a daily trading cap on the risky asset and find that the Hawkes process driven models give rise to the highest risk measures even under daily rebalancing.","[Buccioli, Alice; Kokholm, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Kokholm, T (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",thko@econ.au.dk,"Kokholm, Thomas/JVN-9541-2024","Kokholm, Thomas/0000-0002-1402-4295; Buccioli, Alice/0000-0001-7039-0399",,,,,46,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We say that a pair of risk measures is asymptotically equivalent if the ratio of the worst-case values of the two risk measures is almost one for the sum of a large number of risks with unknown dependence structure. The study of asymptotic equivalence is particularly important for a pair of a noncoherent risk measure and a coherent risk measure, as the worst-case value of a noncoherent risk measure under dependence uncertainty is typically difficult to obtain. The main contribution of this paper is to establish general asymptotic equivalence results for the classes of distortion risk measures and convex risk measures under different mild conditions. The results implicitly suggest that it is only reasonable to implement a coherent risk measure for the aggregation of a large number of risks with uncertainty in the dependence structure, a relevant situation for risk management practice.","[Cai, Jun; Liu, Haiyan; Wang, Ruodu] Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Liu, HY (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",h262liu@uwaterloo.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-250031-2011, RGPIN-435844-2013]; University of Waterloo; China Scholarship Council",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); University of Waterloo; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"The authors thank two anonymous referees, an Associate Editor, a Co-Editor, and the Editor for comments and suggestions that improved the presentation of the paper.

The proposed approach captures changes in various aspects of the asset return relationships such as cross-market mean and skewness (co-kurtosis) as well as cross-market volatilities (co-volatility). Monte Carlo experiments show that the tests perform well except for when crisis periods are short in duration. Small crisis sample critical values are calculated for use in this case. In an empirical application involving the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, the results show that significant contagion effects are widespread from the US banking sector to global equity markets and banking sectors through either the co-kurtosis or the co-volatility channels, reinforcing that higher order moments matter during crises.","[Fry-McKibbin, Renee; Hsiao, Cody Yu-Ling] CAMA, Macau, Peoples R China; [Fry-McKibbin, Renee] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Hsiao, Cody Yu-Ling] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China",Australian National University; Macau University of Science & Technology,"Hsiao, CYL (通讯作者)，CAMA, Macau, Peoples R China.;Hsiao, CYL (通讯作者)，Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Macau, Peoples R China.",ylhsiao@must.edu.mo,,"Fry-McKibbin, Renee/0000-0003-2396-7540; Hsiao, Cody Yu Ling/0000-0003-3754-0505",ARC [DP120103443],ARC(Australian Research Council),We grate fully acknowledge funding from ARC grant DP120103443.,,39,32,32,2,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Existing index-based longevity hedging strategies mitigate the risk associated with period effects, but often overlook cohort effects. The negligence of cohort effects may lead to sub-optimal hedge effectiveness, if the liability being hedged is a deferred pension or annuity which involves cohorts that are not covered by the data sample. In this paper, we propose a new hedging strategy that incorporates both period and cohort effects. The resulting longevity hedge is a value hedge, reducing the uncertainty surrounding the tau-year ahead value of the liability being hedged. The proposed method is illustrated with data from the male population of England and Wales. It is found that the benefit of incorporating cohort effects into a longevity hedging strategy depends heavily on the persistence of cohort effects and the choice of q-forwards.

Parents maximize an objective function that combines Beckerian altruism and paternalism towards children. They can affect their children's choices via two channels: either by influencing children's preferences or by imposing direct restrictions on their choice sets. Different parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) emerge as equilibrium outcomes and are affected both by parental preferences and by the socioeconomic environment. Parenting style, in turn, feeds back into the children's welfare and economic success. The theory is consistent with the decline of authoritarian parenting observed in industrialized countries and with the greater prevalence of more permissive parenting in countries characterized by low inequality.","[Doepke, Matthias] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Zilibotti, Fabrizio] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Northwestern University; Yale University,"Doepke, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",doepke@northwestern.edu; fabrizio.zilibotti@yale.edu,,"Doepke, Matthias/0000-0001-8073-6138",National Science Foundation [SES-1260961]; Swiss National Science Foundation [100018_165616]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100018_165616] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This article is based on the Walras-Bowley Lecture delivered by Zilibotti at the 2016 North American Summer Meeting of the Econometric Society.

The overlapping nature of the pre-averaged returns implies that the leading martingale part in the pre-averaged returns are kn-dependent with k(n) growing slowly with the sample size n. This motivates the application of a blockwise bootstrap method. We show that the blocks of blocks bootstrap method is not valid when volatility is time-varying. The failure of the blocks of blocks bootstrap is due to the heterogeneity of the squared pre-averaged returns when volatility is stochastic. To preserve both the dependence and the heterogeneity of squared pre-averaged returns, we propose a novel procedure that combines the wild bootstrap with the blocks of blocks bootstrap. We provide a proof of the first order asymptotic validity of this method for percentile and percentile-t intervals. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the wild blocks of blocks bootstrap improves the finite sample properties of the existing first order asymptotic theory. We use empirical work to illustrate its use in practice.","[Hounyo, Ulrich] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Goncalves, Silvia] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; [Meddahi, Nour] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France",Aarhus University; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Hounyo, U (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",uhounyo@econ.au.dk,,,FQRSC-ANR; SSHRC; CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series [DNRF78]; Danish National Research Foundation; Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; chair Marche des risques et creation de valeur Fondation du risque/SCOR,FQRSC-ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance; chair Marche des risques et creation de valeur Fondation du risque/SCOR,"We would like to thank Ilze Kalnina, Kevin Sheppard and Neil Shephard for many useful comments and discussions.

This paper argues that this is because the coverage error of traditional confidence intervals is driven by the number of observations in the areas of limited overlap. Some of these local sample sizes can be very small in applications, up to the point that distributional approximations derived from classical asymptotic theory become unreliable. Building on this observation, this paper constructs confidence intervals based on classical approaches to small sample inference. The approach is easy to implement, and has superior theoretical and practical properties relative to standard methods in empirically relevant settings.","[Rothe, Christoph] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Rothe, C (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",cr2690@columbia.edu,,,,,,,29,13,14,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2017,85.0,2,,,,,645,660,,10.3982/ECTA13141,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EX3EM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403114800010,0

Third, we allow for multiple locally ordered breaks, each occurring in a different equation within a subset of equations in the system. Via some simulation experiments, we show first that the limit distributions derived provide good approximations to the finite sample distributions. Second, we show that forming confidence intervals in such a joint fashion allows more precision (tighter intervals) compared to the standard approach of forming confidence intervals using the method of Bai and Perron (1998) applied to a single equation. Simulations also indicate that using the locally ordered break confidence intervals yields better coverage rates than using the framework for globally distinct breaks when the break dates are separated by roughly 10% of the total sample size.","[Li, Ye] Moodys Analyt, Westcheter, PA USA; [Perron, Pierre] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Perron, P (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",perron@bu.edu,,,,,,,20,3,4,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0747-4938,1532-4168,,ECONOMET REV,Econom.

Since the pay-off of such agreements is non-linear, a hedging portfolio would ideally consist of not only forwards, but also a basket of e.g. call and put options. Illiquidity and an almost non-existent market for options challenge however the optimal hedging of joint price and volumetric risk in many market places. Here, we consider the case of the Danish power market, and exploit its strong positive correlation with the much more liquid German market to construct a proxy hedge. We propose a three-dimensional mixed vine copula to model the evolution of the Danish and German spot electricity prices and the Danish wind power production. We construct a realistic hedging portfolio by identifying various instruments available in the market, such as real options in the form of the right to transfer electricity across the border and the right to convert electricity to heat. Using the proposed vine copula to determine optimal hedging decisions, we show that significant benefits are to be drawn by extending the hedging portfolio with the proposed instruments.","[Pircalabu, Anca] Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark; [Pircalabu, Anca; Jung, Jesper] Neas Energy AS, Dept Quantitat Analyt, Skelagervej 1, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Pircalabu, A (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Math Sci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7G, DK-9220 Aalborg, Denmark.;Pircalabu, A (通讯作者)，Neas Energy AS, Dept Quantitat Analyt, Skelagervej 1, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark.",anca@math.aau.dk,,,Innovation Fund Denmark,Innovation Fund Denmark,Anca Pircalabu acknowledges support from Innovation Fund Denmark.,,32,12,13,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We consider both intertemporal and intratemporal choices, and identify intensive and extensive responses in a consistent life-cycle framework, using US CEX data. Heterogeneity is due to observables, such as age, wealth, hours worked, and the wage level, as well as to unobservable tastes for leisure: the median Marshallian elasticity for hours worked is 0.18, with corresponding Hicksian elasticity of 0.54 and Frisch elasticity of 0.87. At the 90th percentile, these values are 0.79, 1.16, and 1.92. Responses at the extensive margin explain about 54% of the total labor supply response for women under 30, although this declines with age. Aggregate elasticities are higher in recessions, and increase with the length of the recession. The heterogeneity at the micro level means that the aggregate labor supply elasticity is not a structural parameter: any aggregate elasticity will depend on the demographic structure of the economy as well as the distribution of wealth and the particular point in the business cycle.","[Attanasio, Orazio; Levell, Peter] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Attanasio, Orazio; Levell, Peter; Low, Hamish] IFS, London, England; [Attanasio, Orazio] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Low, Hamish] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford, England; [Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Santander, Spain",University of London; University College London; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Oxford; Universidad de Cantabria,"Attanasio, O (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.;Attanasio, O (通讯作者)，IFS, London, England.;Attanasio, O (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",o.attanasio@ucl.ac.uk; peter_l@ifs.org.uk; hamish.low@economics.ox.ac.uk; virginia.sanchez@unican.es,"Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/H-2543-2015","Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/0000-0001-9260-4327",ESRC Professorial Fellowship; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Spanish MCYT [ECO2009-09614],ESRC Professorial Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal Studies(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Spanish MCYT(Spanish Government),"We are grateful for a number of useful conversations with Joe Altonji, Richard Blundell, Guy Laroque, Costas Meghir, Richard Rogerson, and Tom Sargent.

Many tests of this type can be interpreted as C(a) tests, as in Neyman (1959), and shown to be locally asymptotically optimal. These C(a) tests will be contrasted with a new approach to likelihood ratio testing for general mixture models. The latter tests are based on estimation of general nonparametric mixing distribution with the Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956) maximum likelihood estimator. Recent developments in convex optimization have dramatically improved upon earlier EM methods for computation of these estimators, and recent results on the large sample behavior of likelihood ratios involving such estimators yield a tractable form of asymptotic inference. Improvement in computation efficiency also facilitates the use of a bootstrap method to determine critical values that are shown to work better than the asymptotic critical values in finite samples. Consistency of the bootstrap procedure is also formally established.

This breaks their tractability, and modeling and simulating become an arduous task. We introduce a new class of Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) models that both fit the dynamics of real market data and remain tractable. We call these models consistent recalibration (CRC) models. CRC models appear as limits of concatenations of forward rate increments, each belonging to a Hull-White extended affine factor model with possibly different parameters. That is, we construct HJM models from tangent affine models.

This bias is nonnegligible in general, and therefore poses a challenge for inference. Our second main result shows that some (but not all) nonparametric bootstrap distributional approximations provide an automatic method of correcting for the bias. Our general theory is illustrated by means of examples and its main finite sample implications are corroborated in a simulation study.","[Cattaneo, Matias D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cattaneo, Matias D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jansson, Michael] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA USA; [Jansson, Michael] CREATES, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; CREATES,"Cattaneo, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Cattaneo, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Stat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",cattaneo@umich.edu; mjansson@econ.berkeley.edu,"Cattaneo, Matias/JOZ-2333-2023","Cattaneo, Matias/0000-0003-0493-7506; Jansson, Michael/0000-0003-4678-7518","National Science Foundation [SES 1122994, SES 1459931, SES 1124174, SES 1459967]; CREATES (Danish National Research Foundation) [DNRF78]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1459931] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1459967] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1459931] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CREATES (Danish National Research Foundation)(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank the handling coeditor, four referees, Stephane Bonhomme, Lutz Kilian, XinweiMa, Whitney Newey, Jamie Robins, Adam Rosen, Andres Santos, Azeem Shaikh, Xiaoxia Shi, and seminar participants at Cambridge University, Georgetown University, London School of Economics, Oxford University, Rice University, University of Chicago, University College London, University of Michigan, the 2013 Latin American Meetings of the Econometric Society, and 2014 CEME/NSF Conference on Inference in Nonstandard Problems for comments.

The clinical efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide (in addition to phosphate binders and vitamin D and/or analogues [PB/VD]) was evaluated in three phase III studies, including two placebo-controlled trials and a head-to-head study versus the oral calcimimetic cinacalcet. Objective The objective of this study was to develop a decision-analytic model for economic evaluation of etelcalcetide compared with cinacalcet. Methods We developed a life-time Markov model including potential treatment effects on mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, and subjects' persistence. Long-term efficacy of etelcalcetide was extrapolated from the reduction in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the phase III trials and the available data from the outcomes study in cinacalcet (EVOLVE trial). Etelcalcetide was compared with cinacalcet, both in addition to PB/VD. We applied unit costs averaged from five European countries and a range of potential etelcalcetide pricing options assuming parity price to weekly use of cinacalcet and varying it by a 15 or 30% increase. Results Compared with cinacalcet, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of etelcalcetide was (sic)1,355 per QALY, (sic)24,521 per QALY, and (sic)47,687 per QALY for the three prices explored. The results were robust across the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Our modelling approach enabled cost-utility assessment of the novel therapy for SHPT based on the observed and extrapolated data. This model can be used for local adaptations in the context of reimbursement assessment.","[Stollenwerk, Bjorn; Parfrey, Patrick] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland; [Stollenwerk, Bjorn] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany; [Iannazzo, Sergio] SIHS Hlth Econ Consulting, Via Sebastiano Caboto 45, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Akehurst, Ron] BresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Akehurst, Ron] Univ Sheffield, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Adena, Michael] Datalyt Pty Ltd, 19-12 Trevillian Quay, Kingston, ACT 2603, Australia; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Hlth Econ & Hlth Technol Assessment, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Dehmel, Bastian; Belozeroff, Vasily] Amgen Inc, One Amgen Ctr Dr, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Parfrey, Patrick] Mem Univ, POB 4200, St John, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow; Amgen; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Stollenwerk, B (通讯作者)，Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23,POB 1557, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland.;Stollenwerk, B (通讯作者)，Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Ingolstadter Landstr 1, D-85764 Neuherberg, Germany.",bjoerns@amgen.com,"Stollenwerk, Björn/G-5408-2013; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Stollenwerk, Bjorn/0000-0002-3189-409X",Amgen,Amgen(Amgen),"Financial support for this study was provided by Amgen.

Such events occur very frequently, several hundred times a day for actively traded stocks. We find significant price impact associated with these market maker initiated events, about five times higher than during non-burst periods. Bursts in quotes are concurrent with short-lived structural breaks in the informational relationship between market makers and market takers. During bursts, market makers no longer passively impound information from order flow into quotesa departure from the traditional market microstructure paradigm. Rather, market makers significantly impact prices during bursts in quotes. Further analysis shows that there is asymmetry in adverse selection between the bid and ask sides of the limit order book and only a sub-population of market makers enjoys an informational advantage during bursts. Market makers on the side opposite the burst suffer elevated adverse selection costs, while market makers on the side of the burst realize positive spread, irrespective of the order flow direction. Our results call attention to the need for a new microstructure perspective in understanding modern high-frequency limit order book markets and the quote manipulation strategies at the disposal of the fast market makers.","[Gencay, R.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Econ, Burnaby, BC V51S6, Canada; [Mahmoodzadeh, S.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England; [Rojcek, J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Plattenstr 22, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rojcek, J.] Swiss Finance Inst, Plattenstr 22, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tseng, M.

Building on the theoretical suggestions from various disciplines, we empirically compare widely used discrete-time hazard models (with logit and clog-log links) and the continuous-time Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model in predicting bankruptcy and financial distress of the United States Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Consistent with the theoretical arguments, we report that discrete-time hazard models are superior to the continuous-time CPH model in making binary predictions using interval censored data. Moreover, hazard models developed using a failure definition based jointly on bankruptcy laws and firms' financial health exhibit superior goodness of fit and classification measures, in comparison to models that employ a failure definition based either on bankruptcy laws or firms' financial health alone.","[Gupta, Jairaj] Univ Birmingham, Dept Finance, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England; [Gregoriou, Andros] Univ Brighton, Dept Finance & Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Ebrahimi, Tahera] Birmingham City Univ, Dept Finance, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; University of Brighton; Birmingham City University,"Gupta, J (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Finance, Birmingham B15 2TY, W Midlands, England.",J.Gupta@outlook.com,,"Gregoriou, Andros/0000-0002-7221-0598; EBRAHIMI, TAHERA/0000-0003-3130-9759",,,,,59,30,34,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

I extend the literature on partial identification via shape restrictions by exploiting cross-dimensional restrictions on treatment response when treatments are multidimensional; the assumption of supermodularity can strengthen bounds on average treatment effects in studies of policy complementarity. This restriction can be combined with a statistical independence assumption to derive improved bounds on treatment effect distributions, aiding in the evaluation of complex randomized controlled trials. Complementarities arising from treatment effect heterogeneity can be incorporated through supermodular instrumental variables to strengthen identification in studies with one or multiple treatments.

In Norway, a comprehensive framework for priority setting was recently proposed to specify the worse off in terms of lifetime loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). However, few studies have shown how to calculate such health losses, how to integrate health loss into cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and how such integration impacts the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The aim of this study was to do so. Methods The proposed framework was applied to data from 15 recent economic evaluations of drugs. Available data were used to calculate the lifetime health loss of the target groups, and the proposed marginal weighting function was employed to adjust standard ICERs according to the size of this loss. Standard and weighted ICERs were compared to a threshold of US$35,000 per QALY gained. Results Lifetime health loss can be calculated with the use of available data and integrated by a marginal weighting function with CEAs. Such integration affected standard ICERs to a varying degree and changed the number of interventions considered cost effective from three to eight. Conclusion Calculation of lifetime health loss and its integration with CEA is feasible and can influence the reimbursement and ranking of interventions. To facilitate regular integration, guidelines for economic evaluations could require (i) adjustment according to distributional concerns and (ii) that data on health loss are extracted directly from the models and reported. Generic databases on health loss could be developed alongside such efforts.","[Hernaes, Ulrikke J.

During its implementation, one constructs hierarchies, then makes judgments or performs measurements on pairs of elements with respect to a criterion to derive preference scales, which are then synthesized throughout the structure to select the preferred alternative. One of the areas where the AHP finds application is in the subjective phases of risk assessment (RA), where it is used to structure and prioritize diverse risk factors, including the judgments of experts. Since fuzzy logic (FL) has been shown to be an effective tool for accommodating human experts and their communication of linguistic variables, there has been research aimed at modeling the fuzziness in the AHP (FAHP), and recently the focus of some of that modeling has been with respect to RA. The literature discusses more than one FAHP model, which raises the question as to which are the prominent models and what are their characteristics. In response to this question, we examine three of the most influential FAHP models. The article proceeds as follows. It begins with a brief overview of the AHP and its limitations when confronted with a fuzzy environment. This is followed by a discussion of FL modifications of the AHP. A RA-based likelihood score example is used throughout.

The risk-sharing securities and their prices are endogenously determined as the outcome of a strategic game played among all the participating agents. In the complete-market setting, each agent's set of strategic choices consists of the security payoffs and the pricing kernel that are consistent with the optimal-sharing rules; while in the incomplete setting, agents respond via demand functions on a vector of given tradeable securities. It is shown that at the (Nash) risk-sharing equilibrium, the sharing securities are suboptimal, since agents submit for sharing different risk exposures than their true endowments. On the other hand, the Nash equilibrium prices stay unaffected by the game only in the special case of agents with the same risk aversion. In addition, agents with sufficiently lower risk aversion act as predatory traders, since they absorb utility surplus from the high risk averse agents and reduce the efficiency of sharing. The main results of the paper also hold under the generalized models that allow the presence of noise traders and heterogeneity in agents' beliefs.","[Anthropelos, Michail] Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Karaoli & Dimitriou Str 80, Piraeus 18534, Greece",University of Piraeus,"Anthropelos, M (通讯作者)，Univ Piraeus, Dept Banking & Financial Management, Karaoli & Dimitriou Str 80, Piraeus 18534, Greece.",anthropel@unipi.gr,,,,,,,53,4,5,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-9679,1862-9660,,MATH FINANC ECON,Math.

Some suggest that quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) alone are adequate while others argue that this approach is too narrow and that direct measures of capability wellbeing provide a more extensive application of Sen's paradigm. Objective This paper empirically explores whether QALYs provide a good proxy for individual capabilities. Methods Data is taken from a multinational cross-sectional survey of individuals with seven health conditions (asthma, arthritis, cancer, depression, diabetes, hearing loss, heart disease) and a healthy population. Each individual completed the ICECAP-A measure of capability wellbeing for adults and six health utility instruments that are used to generate QALYs, including EQ-5D and SF-6D. Primary analysis examines how well health utility instruments can explain variation in the ICECAP-A using ordinary least squares regression. Results The findings show that all seven health conditions have a negative association on overall capability as measured by the ICECAP-A index. Inclusion of health utility instruments into separate regressions improves the predictive power of capability but on average, explains less than half of the variation in capability wellbeing. Individuals with arthritis appear to be less inhibited in terms of capability losses when accounting for health utility, yet those who have depression record significant reductions in capability relative to the healthy population even after accounting for the most commonly used health utility instruments. Conclusion The study therefore casts doubt on the ability of QALYs to act as a reliable proxy measure of individuals' capability.","[Mitchell, Paul Mark; Coast, Joanna] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, HEB, Bristol, Avon, England; [Mitchell, Paul Mark; Coast, Joanna] Univ Hosp Bristol NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR CLAHRC West, Bristol, Avon, England; [Mitchell, Paul Mark] Southmead Hosp, UK Renal Registry, Bristol, Avon, England; [Venkatapuram, Sridhar] Kings Coll London, Dept Global Hlth & Social Med, London, England; [Richardson, Jeff; Iezzi, Angelo] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Bristol; University of Bristol; Southmead Hospital; University of London; King's College London; Monash University,"Mitchell, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, HEB, Bristol, Avon, England.;Mitchell, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Bristol NHS Fdn Trust, NIHR CLAHRC West, Bristol, Avon, England.;Mitchell, PM (通讯作者)，Southmead Hosp, UK Renal Registry, Bristol, Avon, England.",paul.mitchell@bristol.ac.uk,"Venkatapuram, Sridhar/AAH-2587-2020; Venkatapuram, Sridhar/AAE-6904-2020","Venkatapuram, Sridhar/0000-0003-3076-0783; Richardson, Jeff/0000-0002-4248-4280; Coast, Joanna/0000-0002-3537-5166; Mitchell, Paul/0000-0002-7593-4460",Wellcome Trust [094245/Z/10Z]; Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee [CF11/3192-2011001748]; National Health and Medical Research Council [1006334]; NIHR CLAHRC West,Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee; National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); NIHR CLAHRC West,"Funding for the analysis conducted in this study was supported by the Wellcome Trust [094245/Z/10Z].

We use a model of multilateral bargaining to demonstrate that this intuition may be flawed. Increasing the number of veto players or raising the supermajority requirement for redistribution may reduce protection on the equilibrium path. The reason is the existence of two distinct mechanisms of property protection. One is formal constraints that allow individuals or groups to block any redistribution that is not in their favor. The other occurs in equilibrium where players without such powers protect each other from redistribution. Players without formal veto power anticipate that the expropriation of other similar players will ultimately hurt them and thus combine their influence to prevent redistributions. In a stable allocation, the society exhibits a class structure with class members having equal wealth and strategically protecting each other from redistribution.","[Diermeier, Daniel] Univ Chicago, Edward H Levi Hall,5801 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Egorov, Georgy] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Managerial Econ Decis Sci & Operat, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Sonin, Konstantin] Univ Chicago, Irving B Harris Sch Publ Policy Studies, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sonin, Konstantin] Higher Sch Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya Ul, Moscow 101000, Russia",University of Chicago; Northwestern University; University of Chicago; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Diermeier, D (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Edward H Levi Hall,5801 South Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",ddiermeier@uchicago.edu; g-egorov@kellogg.northwestern.edu; ksonin@uchicago.edu,"Sonin, Konstantin/Q-5660-2019; Sonin, Konstantin/C-1146-2014","Sonin, Konstantin/0000-0003-1581-9951;",,,,,56,8,11,0,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAY,2017,85.0,3,,,,,851,870,,10.3982/ECTA12132,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EX3ER,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403115300005,0

In the context of a distortion-risk-measure-based optimal reinsurance model without moral hazard, this article introduces and employs a variation of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma in statistical hypothesis testing theory to solve a wide class of constrained optimal reinsurance problems analytically and expeditiously. Such a Neyman-Pearson approach identifies the unit-valued derivative of each ceded loss function as the test function of an appropriate hypothesis test and transforms the problem of designing optimal reinsurance contracts to one that resembles the search of optimal test functions achieved by the classical Neyman-Pearson Lemma. As an illustration of the versatility and superiority of the proposed Neyman-Pearson formulation, we provide complete and transparent solutions of several specific constrained optimal reinsurance problems, many of which were only partially solved in the literature by substantially more difficult means and under extraneous technical assumptions. Examples of such problems include the construction of the optimal reinsurance treaties in the presence of premium budget constraints, counterparty risk constraints and the optimal insurer-reinsurer symbiotic reinsurance treaty considered recently in Cai et al.

It is assumed that they are equipped with a risk aversion coefficient and construct their discounted payoff with the help of the exponential premium principle. This leads to a risk adjusted discounted cash flow of dividends. Within such a framework not only the expected value of the dividends is taken into account but also their variability. Our approach is motivated by a remark in Gerber and Shiu (2004). We deal with the finite and infinite time horizon problems and prove that, even in this general setting, the optimal dividend policy is a band policy. We also show that the policy improvement algorithm can be used to obtain the optimal policy and the corresponding value function. Next, an explicit example is provided, in which the optimal policy is shown to be of a barrier type.

The wage earner's preferences are represented by the stochastic differential utility, which separates the coefficient of relative risk aversion from the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS). The wage earner's life insurance demand is affected by the volatile interest rates and inflation. The optimal life insurance demand decreases with the level of nominal interest rates. Under an assumption of deterministic nominal income, the demand for life insurance would not be affected by the level of inflation. However, if the wage earner's income is indexed to inflation, the life insurance demand would increase with the level of inflation. Furthermore, under investment opportunities with greater volatilities, wage earners who optimally allocate their wealth to the financial market benefit more from financial investments and cut their demand for life insurance. An analysis of EIS and risk aversion on life insurance demand shows that the demand for life insurance over the planning horizon increases with the measure of relative risk aversion but decreases with EIS. Optimal consumption is affected by the insurance premium load and the direction depends on the size of EIS relative to unity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating timing flexibility, competition, and changes in the economic environment in the form of a cash flow process with regime switching, the problem is formulated as a stopping-time game under Stackelberg leader-follower competition, in which both players determine their respective optimal market entry time. By extending the variational inequality approach, we solve for the free boundaries and obtain optimal investment strategies for each player. Despite the lack of regularity in the leader's obstacle and the cash flow regime uncertainty, the regime-dependent optimal policies for both the leader and the follower are obtained. In addition, we perform comprehensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the properties of solutions and to gain insights into the implications of regime switching.","[Bensoussan, Alain] Univ Texas Dallas, Int Ctr Decis & Risk Anal, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Bensoussan, Alain] City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hoe, SingRu] Texas A&M Univ Commerce, Commerce, TX USA; [Yan, ZhongFeng] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yan, ZhongFeng] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yin, George] Wayne State Univ, Detroit, MI 48202 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; City University of Hong Kong; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Commerce; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Jinan University; Wayne State University,"Yan, ZF (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Dept Math, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zfyan0310@gmail.com,,,"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [U 500111]; Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities [21614329]; Innovation Fund of SHUFE [CXJJ-2011-386]; NSFC [71271127, 10971127]; National Science Foundation [DMS-1207667]",Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities; Innovation Fund of SHUFE; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The first author acknowledges support from the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, grant City U 500111.

The objective of the individuals is to seek an optimal consumption-investment strategy to maximize the expected discount utility of intermediate consumption and terminal wealth in the finite horizon. In the utility theory, Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (HARA) utility consists of CRRA utility, CARA utility and Logarithmic utility as special cases. In addition, HARA utility is seldom studied in continuous-time portfolio selection theory due to its sophisticated expression. In this paper, we choose HARA utility as the risky preference of the individuals. Due to the complexity of the structure of the solution to the original Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we use Legendre transform to change the original non-linear HJB equation into its linear dual one, whose solution is easy to conjecture in the case of HARA utility. By calculations and deductions, we obtain the closed-form solution to the optimal consumption-investment strategy in a complete market. Moreover, some special cases are also discussed in detail. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate our results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Business process models are used to analyze processes, to reduce their complexity, to evaluate their performance and finally to assist business process improvement. In this light, a number of modeling architectures, methods and tools have been developed in order to assist scientists and practitioners to model and manage business processes. In addition, supply chain management importance is increasingly being recognized as it integrates and synchronizes business processes across the extended supply chains. This paper deals with the application of a specific business process modeling architecture in order to design supply chain processes in the case of a SME manufacturing company. The modeling architecture has been developed in the context of the Odysseus research project, which deals with the management of demand variability in modern supply chains. The architecture covers different supply chain views such as processes and activities, organization, information systems, risk management and decision making. These views are covered by the modeling architecture using nine selected and interconnected ARIS methods. The architecture is applied in a Greek SME company producing electrical equipment. The production process of the equipment consists of in-house as well as sub-contracted phases performed by Greek and European manufacturers. The coordination of the related supply chain processes is performed by the company under discussion. Due to the extended degree of collaboration, the need for accurate planning, coordination and controlling in the supply chain is highly increased, making business process modeling an ideal enabling approach.","[Panayiotou, Nikolaos A.; Stavrou, Vasileios P.; Gayialis, Sotiris P.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Sect Ind Management & Operat Res, Athens, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Stavrou, VP (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Mech Engn, Sect Ind Management & Operat Res, Athens, Greece.",vstavru@yahoo.gr,"Gayialis, Sotiris P/AAE-2814-2019; Panayiotou, Nikolaos A./A-1886-2008","Gayialis, Sotiris P/0000-0002-7524-0215;",European Union (European Social Fund); Greek Government,European Union (European Social Fund)(European Union (EU)European Social Fund (ESF)); Greek Government(Greek Ministry of Development-GSRT),"The research efforts described in this paper are part of the research project A Holistic Approach for Managing Variability in Contemporary Global Supply Chain Networks in research action: Thales-Support of the interdisciplinary and/or inter-institutional research and innovation which is implemented under the Operational Programme: Education and Lifelong Learning, NSRF 2007-2013 and is co-funded by European Union (European Social Fund) and Greek Government.",,35,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-33003-7; 978-3-319-33001-3,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,1,16,,10.1007/978-3-319-33003-7_1,0.0,,,16,"Business; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BI0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405341000001,0

Weak instrument asymptotic theory is developed directly from finite sample results, unifying earlier findings and showing the usefulness of structural information in making predictions from reduced form systems in applications. Asymptotic results are reported for predictions from models with many weak instruments. Of particular interest is the finding that, in unidentified and weakly identified structural models, partially restricted reduced form predictors have considerably smaller forecast mean square errors than unrestricted reduced forms. These results are related to the use of shrinkage methods in system-wide reduced form estimation.","[Phillips, Peter C. B.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Phillips, Peter C.

We address the problem of how the parametric pair-copulas in a vine copula should be chosen by proposing to use nonparametric Bernstein copulas as bivariate pair-copulas. An extensive simulation study illustrates that our smooth nonparametric vine copula model is able to match the results of a competing parametric vine model calibrated via Akaike's Information Criterion while at the same time significantly reducing model risk.

Relying on balance sheet data, complemented with information on interbank exposures, this paper analyses interconnectedness in an advanced emerging market economy, using two complementary approaches. The first approach focuses on the financial network topology, and finds that the financial system resembles a highly clustered small world network, with in and out-degrees, connectivity and exposures exhibiting a (double) heavy tail behaviour, which favours the formation of strong community structure and preferential attachment in the network. Bank size is Pareto distributed, and highly correlated with centrality. The second approach focuses on how the network topology contributes to the transmission of shocks by modelling default contagion, using balance sheet network analysis.

Due to the long duration nature of equity-linked insurance products, a stock return model must be able to deal simultaneously with the preceding stylized facts and the impact of market structure changes. In response, this article proposes stock return dynamics that combine Levy processes in a regime-switching framework. We focus on a non-Gaussian, generalized hyperbolic distribution. We use the most popular linked equity of ELIs, the S&P 500 index, as an example. The empirical study verifies that the proposed regime-switching generalized hyperbolic (RSGH) model gives the best fit to data. In investigating the effects of stock return modeling on pricing and risk management for financial contracts, we derive the characteristic function, embedded option price, and risk measure of equity-linked insurance analytically. More importantly, we demonstrate that the regime-switching generalized hyperbolic (RSGH) model is realistic and can meet the stylistic facts of stock returns, which in turn can be employed in option pricing and risk management decisions.","[Wang, Chou-Wen] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, 70 Lienhai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Wang, Chou-Wen] Natl Chengchi Univ, Coll Commerce, Fellow Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, 64,Sect 2,ZhiNan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Yang, Sharon S.] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Finance, 300 Jhongda Rd, Jhongli 32001, Taoyuan County, Taiwan; [Yang, Sharon S.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Coll Commerce, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, 64,Sect 2,ZhiNan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan; [Huang, Jr-Wei] Hubei Univ Econ, Dept Insurance, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jr-Wei] Hubei Univ Econ, Risk Management Res Ctr, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China",National Sun Yat Sen University; National Chengchi University; National Central University; National Chengchi University; Hubei University of Economics; Hubei University of Economics,"Huang, JW (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ Econ, Dept Insurance, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Huang, JW (通讯作者)，Hubei Univ Econ, Risk Management Res Ctr, Wuhan 430205, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jrwei.huang@icloud.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC [NSC 99-2410-H-327-004-]; MOST [102-2628-H-008-001-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); MOST","Chou-Wen Wang is supported by the NSC 99-2410-H-327-004- from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC; Sharon S.

Thus, in the present paper, by considering the competition between each pair of insurers, an N-player game is formulated to investigate the optimal pricing strategy by calculating the Nash equilibrium in an insurance market. Under that framework, each insurer is assumed to maximise its utility of wealth over the unit time interval. With the purpose of solving a game of N-players, the best-response potential game with non-linear aggregation is implemented. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is proved by finding a potential function of all insurers' payoff functions. A 12-player insurance game illustrates the theoretical findings under the framework in which the best-response selection premium strategies always provide the global maximum value of the corresponding payoff function.","[Wu, Renchao; Pantelous, Athanasios A.] Univ Liverpool, Dept Math Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Pantelous, Athanasios A.] Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool,"Pantelous, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Inst Risk & Uncertainty, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",R.Wu1@liverpool.ac.uk; A.Pantelous@liverpool.ac.uk,"Pantelous, Athanasios/B-3721-2014","Pantelous, Athanasios/0000-0001-5738-1471",EPSRC; ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training on Quantification and Management of Risk & Uncertainty in Complex Systems Environments [EP/L015927/1],EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC Centre for Doctoral Training on Quantification and Management of Risk & Uncertainty in Complex Systems Environments,"The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments that significantly improved the quality of this paper.

For one-shot negotiations, a cornerstone result of Roth (Axiomatic models of bargaining. Springer, Berlin, 1979) establishes that the more risk averse player will obtain less than half the total amount. In the present paper, we assume that the bargaining procedure occurs over several rounds. In each round, an increasing share of the total amount is negotiated over in accordance with the NBS, the disagreement point being determined by the outcome of the previous round. In line with Roth's result, the final amount received by the more risk averse player is still bounded by half the total amount. As a new feature, however, this player does not lose from bargaining for more rounds if his opponent exhibits non-increasing absolute risk aversion. What is more, both players' risk profiles become essentially irrelevant if successive bargaining takes place over sufficiently small commodity increments. Each player then gets approximately half of the commodity.","[Grech, Philip] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Negotiat & Conflict Management, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tejada, Oriol] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Grech, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Negotiat & Conflict Management, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",pgrech@ethz.ch; toriol@ethz.ch,,"Tejada, Oriol/0000-0002-4819-0259",,,,,32,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

However, the values derived from initial DCE studies vary widely. We hypothesize that these findings indicate the presence of unknown sources of bias that must be recognized and minimized. Against this background, we studied whether values derived from a DCE are sensitive to how well the DCE design spans the severity range. Methods We constructed an experiment involving three variants of DCE tasks for health state valuation: standard DCE, DCE-death, and DCE-duration. For each type of DCE, an experimental design was generated under two different conditions, enabling a comparison of health state values derived from current best practice Bayesian efficient DCE designs with values derived from 'severity-stratified' designs that control for coverage of the severity range in health state selection. About 3000 respondents participated in the study and were randomly assigned to one of the six study arms. Results Imposing the severity-stratified restriction had a large effect on health states sampled for the DCE-duration approach. The unstratified efficient design returned a skewed distribution of selected health states, and this introduced bias. The choice probability of bad health states was underestimated, and time trade-offs to avoid bad states were overestimated, resulting in too low values. Imposing the same restriction had limited effect in the DCE-death approach and standard DCE. Conclusion Variation in DCE-derived values can be partially explained by differences in how well selected health states spanned the severity range. Imposing a 'severity stratification' on DCE-duration designs is a validity requirement.","[Lim, Sesil; Jonker, Marcel F.; Oppe, Mark; Donkers, Bas; Stolk, Elly] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Choice Modelling Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Lim, Sesil; Donkers, Bas] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jonker, Marcel F.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Jonker, Marcel F.] Duke Univ, Duke Clin Res Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Oppe, Mark; Stolk, Elly] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Duke University,"Lim, S (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Choice Modelling Ctr, Rotterdam, Netherlands.;Lim, S (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",lim@ese.eur.nl,"Donkers, Bas/B-6082-2008","Donkers, Bas/0000-0002-0412-4276; Lim, Sesil/0000-0002-2227-8906",EuroQol Research Foundation [2015300],EuroQol Research Foundation,This work has received financial support from the EuroQol Research Foundation grant number 2015300.,,28,8,9,1,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2018,36.0,11,,,,,1377,1389,,10.1007/s40273-018-0694-6,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GW4SE,30030818.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446909400008,0

With the development of insurance claim models that can accommodate dependence between claim frequency and severity, a series of recent studies has revealed that the aforementioned dependence between frequency and severity exists for auto insurance claims, demonstrating the validity of such models. However, the underlying process that creates this dependence has received little attention in the literature. Thus, we show that a rational decision-making process of drivers known as bonus hunger can systemically induce dependence between the claim frequency and severity even when the ground-up loss frequency and severity are, in fact, independent. Our model, based on the random effect model coupled with the standard bonus-malus system, successfully explains the seemingly contradictory results from the existing literature of weak positive dependence, between the claim frequency and severity for liability claims, and moderately negative dependence for collision claims. Our findings show that the seemingly contradicting dependence structures reported in the literature may be neither accidental nor sample specific.

We develop an efficient numerical partial differential equation method for determining the optimal control for this problem. Central to our method is a combination of (i) an impulse control formulation of the MV investment problem, and (ii) a discretized version of the dynamic programming principle enforcing a time-consistency constraint. We impose realistic investment constraints, such as no trading if insolvent, leverage restrictions and different interest rates for borrowing/lending. Our method requires solution of linear partial integro-differential equations between intervention times, which is numerically simple and computationally effective. The proposed method can handle both continuous and discrete rebalancings. We study the substantial effect and economic implications of realistic investment constraints and modelling assumptions on the MV efficient frontier and the resulting investment strategies. This includes (i) a comprehensive comparison study of the pre-commitment and time-consistent optimal strategies, and (ii) an investigation on the significant impact of a wealth-dependent risk aversion parameter on the optimal controls.

Our framework includes many nonparametric testing problems in a unified framework, with a number of possible applications in auction models, game theoretic models, wage inequality, and revealed preferences. Our test involves a one-sided version of L-p functionals of kernel-type estimators (1 <= p < infinity) and is easy to implement in general, mainly due to its recourse to the bootstrap method. The bootstrap procedure is based on the nonparametric bootstrap applied to kernel-based test statistics, with an option of estimating contact sets. We provide regularity conditions under which the bootstrap test is asymptotically valid uniformly over a large class of distributions, including cases where the limiting distribution of the test statistic is degenerate. Our bootstrap test is shown to exhibit good power properties in Monte Carlo experiments, and we provide a general form of the local power function. As an illustration, we consider testing implications from auction theory, provide primitive conditions for our test, and demonstrate its usefulness by applying our test to real data. We supplement this example with the second empirical illustration in the context of wage inequality.","[Lee, Sokbae] Columbia Univ, Inst Fiscal Studies, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Song, Kyungchul] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Whang, Yoon-Jae] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Columbia University; University of British Columbia; Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 1022 Int Affairs Bldg 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sl3841@columbia.edu,"Lee, Sokbae/F-7514-2011","Lee, Sokbae/0000-0003-4080-7733","European Research Council [ERC-2014-CoG-646917-ROMIA]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2011-342-B00004]; SNU Creative Leading Researcher Grant; ESRC [ES/M010147/1, ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); SNU Creative Leading Researcher Grant; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Editor, Peter C.B.

For natural events as relevant in applications, such a symmetry and corresponding control are usually absent, precluding traditional measurement methods. This paper introduces two indexes of ambiguity attitudes, one for aversion and the other for insensitivity/perception, for which we can control for likelihood beliefs even if these are unknown. Hence, we can now measure ambiguity attitudes for natural events. Our indexes are valid under many ambiguity theories, do not require expected utility for risk, and are easy to elicit in practice. We use our indexes to investigate time pressure under ambiguity. People do not become more ambiguity averse under time pressure but become more insensitive (perceive more ambiguity). These findings are plausible and, hence, support the validity of our indexes.","[Baillon, Aurelien; Selim, Asli; Wakker, Peter P.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Huang, Zhenxing] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zhenxing] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Baillon, A (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Baillon@ese.eur.nl; ybhzxadam@gmail.com; asliselim@gmail.com; Wakker@ese.eur.nl,"Baillon, Aurélien/E-6961-2012","Baillon, Aurélien/0000-0002-0169-9760",China National Science Foundation [71703091]; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [452-13-013],China National Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Roy Kouwenberg, Chen Li, Thorsten Pachur, Martijn van den Assem, and four anonymous referees made helpful comments.

By comparing the degree value with the position value and the Myerson value, it is verified that the degree value is a new allocation rule that differs from both the Myerson value and the position value, and the degree value highlights the important role of the degree of a player in hypergraph communication situations. Particularly, in a uniform hypergraph communication situation, where every conference contains the same number of players, we show that the degree value coincides with the position value.","[Shan, Erfang; Zhang, Guang] Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guang] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Shan, Xiaokang] Washington Univ, Olin Business Sch, St Louis, MO USA",Shanghai University; Tilburg University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Zhang, G (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Management, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.;Zhang, G (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, CentER, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",efshan@i.shu.edu.cn; guangzhang@shu.edu.cn,,,"National Nature Science Foundation of China [11571222, 11471210]; China Scholarship Council (CSC)",National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),"We thank an associate editor and two referees for valuable suggestions and comments.

We characterize the optimal outcome-based reimbursement policy a health authority should follow to encourage the pharmaceutical firm to undertake research and development activities to generate the information needed to effectively stratify patients. Consistent with the literature, we find that for a pharmaceutical firm that does not undertake research and development activities, when the treatment fails, the total price of the drug must be returned to the healthcare system (full penalization). By contrast, if the firm undertakes research and development activities that make the implementation of personalized medicine possible, treatment failure should not be fully penalized. Surprisingly, in some cases, particularly for high-efficacy drugs and small target populations, the optimal policy may not require any penalty for treatment failure. To illustrate the main results of the analysis, we provide a numerical simulation and a graphical analysis.","[Antonanzas, Fernando; Rodriguez-Ibeas, Roberto; Juarez-Castello, Carmelo A.] Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, La Ciguena 60, Logrono 26006, Spain",Universidad de La Rioja,"Antoñanzas, F (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, La Ciguena 60, Logrono 26006, Spain.",fernando.antonanzas@unirioja.es,"Rodriguez-Ibeas, Roberto/F-3109-2016; Juárez-Castelló, Carmelo A./C-7369-2013","Juárez-Castelló, Carmelo A./0000-0002-0816-032X","Spanish Ministry of Economics, MINECO [ECO2016-78685-R]","Spanish Ministry of Economics, MINECO","This study was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economics, MINECO (Project ECO2016-78685-R).",,27,16,17,2,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUL,2018,36.0,7,,,,,733,743,,10.1007/s40273-018-0619-4,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GJ5BX,29450830.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435397300002,0

Policyholders face not only mortality risks but also heterogeneous liquidity risks which lead the policyholders to surrender or settle the policies. It is assumed that the insurer cannot discriminate policyholders based on liquidity risks, and that no cost is incurred in surrender and settlement. We characterize the conditions for the endogenous existence of a settlement market, and find that the settlement market, if it exists, raises insurance premium. The effects of settlement on profit and welfare depend on the market structure. In the monopolistic insurance market, the settlement market lowers the insurer's profit, and consumer welfare increases whenever demand increases and possibly increases even when demand decreases. This finding is in contrast with most of the existing studies reporting that settlement never has a positive effect on welfare. In the competitive insurance market, welfare always decreases.

It has been shown that the identification of the regression function from the conditional expectation of the dependent variable on the instrument relies on the completeness of the distribution of the endogenous regressor conditional on the instrument, i.e., f (x vertical bar z). We show that (1) if the deviation of the conditional density f (x vertical bar z(k)) from a known complete sequence of functions is less than a sequence of values determined by the complete sequence in some distinct sequence {z(k) : k = 1,2,3,...} converging to z(0), then f (x vertical bar z) itself is complete, and (2) if the conditional density f (x vertical bar z) can form a linearly independent sequence {f (. vertical bar z(k)) : k = 1,2,...} in some distinct sequence {z(k) : k = 1,2,3,...} converging to z(0) and its relative deviation from a known complete sequence of functions under some norm is finite then f (x vertical bar z) itself is complete.

We show the existence of Stackelberg equilibria in which the firm holds cash reserves in order to provide incentives for pessimistic creditors to invest in the firm. We find interest rates and cash holdings to be complementary tools for increasing debt capacity. In markets with a high concentration of capital across a small interval of pessimistic creditors or by a few large creditors, cash holdings is the preferred tool to increase the debt capacity of the firm.","[Jarrow, Robert] Cornell Univ, Samuel Curtis Johnson Sch Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Jarrow, Robert] Kamakura Corp, Honolulu, HI USA; [Krishenik, Andrey; Minca, Andreea] Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"Minca, A (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",acm299@cornell.edu,,"MINCA, Andreea/0000-0002-2216-9793",,,,,35,5,6,2,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Under such a framework, the optimal dividend strategies are often of barrier or threshold type, which can lead to very irregular dividend payments over time. In practice however companies distribute dividends on a periodic basis. In that spirit, Erlangisation techniques have been used to approximate problems with fixed inter-dividend decision times. When studying the optimality of such strategies, the existing literature focuses exclusively on the special case of exponential - that is, Erlang(1) - inter-dividend decision times. Higher dimensional models are surprisingly difficult to study due to the implicit nature of some of the equations. While some of this difficulty continues to exist in high dimensions, in this paper we provide a stepping stone to the general Erlang(n) problem by providing a detailed analysis of the optimality of periodic barrier strategies when inter-dividend-decision times are Erlang(2) distributed.

We study the properties and implementation of the Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) method, which estimates a treatment assignment policy by maximizing the sample analog of average social welfare over a class of candidate treatment policies. The EWM approach is attractive in terms of both statistical performance and practical implementation in realistic settings of policy design. Common features of these settings include: (i) feasible treatment assignment rules are constrained exogenously for ethical, legislative, or political reasons, (ii) a policy maker wants a simple treatment assignment rule based on one or more eligibility scores in order to reduce the dimensionality of individual observable characteristics, and/or (iii) the proportion of individuals who can receive the treatment is a priori limited due to a budget or a capacity constraint. We show that when the propensity score is known, the average social welfare attained by EWM rules converges at least at n(-1/2) rate to the maximum obtainable welfare uniformly over a minimally constrained class of data distributions, and this uniform convergence rate is minimax optimal. We examine how the uniform convergence rate depends on the richness of the class of candidate decision rules, the distribution of conditional treatment effects, and the lack of knowledge of the propensity score. We offer easily implementable algorithms for computing the EWM rule and an application using experimental data from the National JTPA Study.","[Kitagawa, Toru] Cemmap, London, England; [Kitagawa, Toru] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Tetenov, Aleksey] Univ Bristol, Dept Econ, Bristol, Avon, England",University of London; University College London; University of Bristol,"Kitagawa, T (通讯作者)，Cemmap, London, England.;Kitagawa, T (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Econ, London, England.",t.kitagawa@ucl.ac.uk; a.tetenov@bristol.ac.uk,"Kitagawa, Toru/N-6589-2015","Kitagawa, Toru/0000-0001-5550-1281; Tetenov, Aleksey/0000-0003-2764-5952",ESRC through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (CeMMAP) [RES-589-28-0001]; European Research Council [715940]; ESRC [ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice (CeMMAP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Susan Athey, Kei Hirano, Guido Imbens, Shin Kanaya, Charles Manski, Joerg Stoye, and seminar participants at Academia Sinica, Bern, Brown, BC, BU, Cambridge, CEMFI, CORE, Duke, GRIPS, JHU, NYU, UPenn, UPF, UVA, and Warwick for beneficial comments.

Based on an American population, the Framingham Risk Score has been criticised for potential overestimation of risk in European populations. Objective We investigated whether the use of the Framingham Risk Score actually was validated in health economic studies that modelled the effects of lipid-lowering treatment with statins on coronary heart disease events in European populations. Methods In this systematic literature review of all relevant published studies in English (literature searched September 2016 in PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS), 99 studies were identified and 22 were screened in full text, 18 of which were included. Key data were extracted and synthesised narratively. Results The only type of validation identified was a comparison against coronary heart disease risk data from one primary preventive and one secondary preventive clinical investigation, and from observational population data in one study. Taken together, those three studies reported an overall satisfactory accuracy in the results obtained by Framingham Risk Score predictions, but the Framingham Risk Score tended to underestimate non-fatal myocardial infarctions. In five studies, potential issues in applying the Framingham Risk Score on a European population were not addressed. Conclusion Further studies are needed to ascertain that the Framingham Risk Score can accurately predict cardiovascular outcome in health economic modelling studies on lipid-lowering therapy in European populations. Future modelling studies using the Framingham Risk Score would benefit from validating the results against other data.","[Hermansson, Jonas] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Sci & Educ, Sodersjukhuset, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kahan, Thomas] Karolinska Inst, Div Cardiovasc Med, Dept Clin Sci, Danderyd Hosp, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kahan, Thomas] Danderyd Univ Hosp Corp, Dept Cardiol, S-18288 Stockholm, Sweden",Sodersjukhuset Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Danderyds Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Danderyds Hospital,"Kahan, T (通讯作者)，Karolinska Inst, Div Cardiovasc Med, Dept Clin Sci, Danderyd Hosp, Stockholm, Sweden.;Kahan, T (通讯作者)，Danderyd Univ Hosp Corp, Dept Cardiol, S-18288 Stockholm, Sweden.",thomas.kahan@sll.se,"Kahan, Thomas/CAE-8515-2022; Hermansson, Jonas/AAO-4165-2021","Hermansson, Jonas/0000-0002-1091-5576; Kahan, Thomas/0000-0001-9909-4956",,,,,46,14,22,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2018,36.0,2,,,,,205,213,,10.1007/s40273-017-0578-1,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FV6LA,29079929.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000424691300007,0

Our model automatically guarantees positive definiteness of the forecast through the use of a Cholesky decomposition of the realized covariance matrix. We explicitly account for long-memory behavior by using fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (ARFIMA) and heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models for the individual elements of the decomposition. Furthermore, our model incorporates non-Gaussian innovations and GARCH effects, accounting for volatility clustering and unconditional kurtosis. The dependence structure between assets is studied using vine copula constructions, which allow for nonlinearity and asymmetry without suffering from an inflexible tail behavior or symmetry restrictions as in conventional multivariate models. Further, the copulas have a direct impact on the point forecasts of the realized covariances matrices, due to being computed as a nonlinear transformation of the forecasts for the Cholesky matrix. Beside studying in-sample properties, we assess the usefulness of our method in a one-day-ahead forecasting framework, comparing recent types of models for the realized covariance matrix based on a model confidence set approach. Additionally, we find that in Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting, vine models require less capital requirements due to smoother and more accurate forecasts.","[Brechmann, E.

The DEV model is an extension of the constant elasticity of variance model, in which the volatility term is a power function of stock prices with the power being a nonparametric time function. It is not possible to find the explicit solution to the utility maximization problem under the DEV model. In this paper, a dual-control Monte-Carlo method is developed to compute the optimal investment strategies for a variety of utility functions, including power, non-hyperbolic absolute risk aversion and symmetric asymptotic hyperbolic absolute risk aversion utilities.

The FEF-IV allows for endogenous time-invariant regressors but assumes that there exists a sufficient number of instruments for such regressors. It is shown that the FEF and FEF-IV estimators are root N-consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The FEF estimator is compared with the Fixed Effects Vector Decomposition (FEVD) estimator proposed by Plumper and Troeger (2007) and conditions under which the two estimators are equivalent are established. It is also shown that the variance estimator proposed for FEVD estimator is inconsistent and its use could lead to misleading inference. Alternative variance estimators are proposed for both FEF and FEF-IV estimators which are shown to be consistent under fairly general conditions. The small sample properties of the FEF and FEF-IV estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, and it is shown that FEF has smaller bias and RMSE, unless an intercept is included in the second stage of the FEVD procedure which renders the FEF and FEVD estimators identical. The FEVD procedure, however, results in substantial size distortions since it uses incorrect standard errors. In the case where some of the time-invariant regressors are endogenous, the FEF-IV procedure is compared with a modified version of Hausman and Taylor (1981) (HT) estimator. It is shown that both estimators perform well and have similar small sample properties. But the application of standard HT procedure, that incorrectly assumes a subset of time-varying regressors are uncorrelated with the individual effects, will yield biased estimates and significant size distortions.","[Pesaran, M.

We make connections with the theory of large deviations. We concentrate on sequences of semicomplete markets where in the nth market, the claim Bn admits the decomposition Bn=Dn+Yn. Here, Dn is replicable by trading in the underlying assets Sn, but Yn is independent of Sn. Under broad conditions, we may assume that Yn vanishes in accordance with a large deviations principle (LDP) as n grows. In this setting, for an exponential investor, we identify the limit of the average indifference price pn(qn), for qn units of Bn, as n. We show that if |qn|, the limiting price typically differs from the price obtained by assuming bounded positions supn|qn|<, and the difference is explicitly identifiable using large deviations theory. Furthermore, we show that optimal purchase quantities occur at the large deviations scaling, and hence large positions arise endogenously in this setting.","[Robertson, Scott] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Spiliopoulos, Konstantinos] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Boston University,"Robertson, S (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, 595 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",scottrob@bu.edu,"Robertson, Scott/L-3926-2016","Robertson, Scott/0000-0003-4258-6508","National Science Foundation [DMS-1312491/1651180, GS100000001, GS100000001 DMS-1312124]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1613159] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"S.

I build a tractable directed search model with firm dynamics and time-varying idiosyncratic volatility. The model allows for endogenous separations, entry and exit, and job-to-job transitions. I show that the model can replicate salient features of the microeconomic behavior of firms and that the introduction of volatility improves the fit of the model for standard business cycle moments. In a series of counterfactual experiments, I show that time-varying risk is important to account for the magnitude of fluctuations in aggregate unemployment for past U.S. recessions. Though the model can account for about 40% of the total increase in unemployment for the 2007-2009 recession, uncertainty alone is not sufficient to explain the magnitude and persistence of unemployment during that episode.","[Schaal, Edouard] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI),"Schaal, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain.",eschaal@crei.cat,"Schaal, Edouard/Q-8025-2016","Schaal, Edouard/0000-0003-4191-6528","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563]","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD","I am greatly indebted to Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Esteban Rossi-Hansberg, and Oleg Itskhoki for their invaluable advice and support.

We introduce the class of hedge-based valuations, where in a first step of the valuation process, a 'best hedge' for the liability is set up, based on the traded assets in the market, while in a second step, the remaining part of the claim is valuated via an actuarial valuation. We also introduce the class of two-step valuations, the elements of which are very closely related to the two-step valuations which were introduced in Pelsser and Stadje (2014).

The Kuba Kingdom, established in Central Africa in the early 17th century by King Shyaam, had more developed state institutions than the other independent villages and chieftaincies in the region. It had an unwritten constitution, separation of political powers, a judicial system with courts and juries, a police force, a military, taxation, and significant public goods provision. Comparing individuals from the Kuba Kingdom to those from just outside the Kingdom, we find that centralized formal institutions are associated with weaker norms of rule following and a greater propensity to cheat for material gain. This finding is consistent with recent models where endogenous investments to inculcate values in children decline when there is an increase in the effectiveness of formal institutions that enforce socially desirable behavior. Consistent with such a mechanism, we find that Kuba parents believe it is less important to teach children values related to rule-following behaviors.","[Lowes, Sara] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, MI, Italy; [Nunn, Nathan] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Weigel, Jonathan L.] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Bocconi University; Harvard University; University of Chicago; Harvard University,"Lowes, S (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, MI, Italy.",sara.lowes@unibocconi.it; nnunn@fas.harvard.edu; jamesrobinson@uchicago.edu; jweigel@fas.harvard.edu,,"Nunn, Nathan/0000-0002-5101-9866","Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior; National Science Foundation (NSF); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities [1416885] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Pershing Square Venture Fund for Research on the Foundations of Human Behavior(Pershing Square Foundation); National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We would like to thank four anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that substantially improved the paper.

Under broad conditions, it is shown that indirect inference (II) based on OLS produces consistent and asymptotically normal estimates in pure SAR regression. The II estimator used here is robust to departures from normal disturbances and is computationally straightforward compared with quasi-maximum likelihood (QML). Monte Carlo experiments based on various specifications of the weight matrix show that: (a) the II estimator displays little bias even in very small samples and gives overall performance that is comparable to the QML while raising variance in some cases; (b) II applied to QML also enjoys good finite sample properties; and (c) II shows robust performance in the presence of heavy-tailed error distributions.","[Kyriacou, Maria; Phillips, Peter C.

Moreover, the co-movement of commodities is demonstrated by variance decomposition and explained as commodity index investment, which provides evidence of financialization.

Although the PedsQL is widely used among paediatric patient populations, presently it is not possible to directly use the scores from the instrument to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for application in economic evaluation because it produces summary scores which are not preference-based. Objective This paper examines different econometric mapping techniques for estimating CHU9D utility scores from the PedsQL for the purpose of calculating QALYs for cost-utility analysis. Methods The PedsQL and the CHU9D were completed by a community sample of 755 Australian adolescents aged 15-17 years. Seven regression models were estimated: ordinary least squares estimator, generalised linear model, robust MM estimator, multivariate factorial polynomial estimator, beta-binomial estimator, finite mixture model and multinomial logistic model. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean squared error (MSE) were used to assess predictive ability of the models. Results The MM estimator with stepwise-selected PedsQL dimension scores as explanatory variables had the best predictive accuracy using MAE and the equivalent beta-binomial model had the best predictive accuracy using MSE. Conclusions Our mapping algorithm facilitates the estimation of health-state utilities for use within economic evaluations where only PedsQL data is available and is suitable for use in community-based adolescents aged 15-17 years. Applicability of the algorithm in younger populations should be assessed in further research.","[Mpundu-Kaambwa, Christine] Univ South Australia, Inst Choice, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Chen, Gang] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Russo, Remo] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Russo, Remo] Womens & Childrens Hosp, Dept Paediat Rehabil, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Stevens, Katherine] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Petersen, Karin Dam] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Fac Social Sci, Aalborg, Denmark; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of South Australia; Monash University; Flinders University South Australia; University of Sheffield; Aalborg University; Flinders University South Australia,"Mpundu-Kaambwa, C (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Inst Choice, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",mpucc001@mymail.unisa.edu.au,"Mpundu-Kaambwa, Christine/ABB-9145-2020; Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Mpundu-Kaambwa, Christine/0000-0002-8152-6068; Chen, Gang/0000-0002-8385-5965; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Petersen, Karin Dam/0000-0002-6491-1757",Australian NHMRC Project Grant [1021899],Australian NHMRC Project Grant(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),This study was funded by an Australian NHMRC Project Grant (Grant Number 1021899) entitled 'Adolescent values for the economic evaluation of adolescent health care treatment and preventive programs'.,,61,28,29,0,11,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2017,35.0,4,,,,,453,467,,10.1007/s40273-016-0476-y,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,ER0FC,27928758.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398461700005,0

Following the approach of Rogers and Singh (Math Financ 20:597-615, 2010) and Naujokat and Westray (Math Financ Econ 4(4):299-335, 2011), the hedging problem can be regarded as a cost optimal tracking problem of the frictionless hedging strategy. We solve this problem explicitly for general predictable target hedging strategies. It turns out that, rather than towards the current target position, the optimal policy trades towards a weighted average of expected future target positions. This generalizes an observation of Garleanu and Pedersen (Dynamic portfolio choice with frictions. Preprint, 2013b) from their homogenous Markovian optimal investment problem to a general hedging problem. Our findings complement a number of previous studies in the literature on optimal strategies in illiquid markets as, e.g., Garleanu and Pedersen (Dynamic portfolio choice with frictions. Preprint, 2013b), Naujokat and Westray (Math Financ Econ 4(4):299-335, 2011), Rogers and Singh (Math Financ 20:597-615, 2010), Almgren and Li (Option hedging with smooth market impact.

The consideration of general predictable reference strategies is made possible by the use of a convex analysis approach instead of the more common dynamic programming methods.","[Bank, Peter; Voss, Moritz] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Math, Str 17 Juni 136, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Soner, H.

The only novelty is that firms may go bankrupt and permanently exit: the probability that a firm survives a price war depends on its financial strength, which varies stochastically over time. Under some conditions including no entry, an anti-folk theorem holds: when firms are patient, so that strength levels change relatively quickly, every Nash equilibrium involves an immediate price war that lasts until at most one firm remains. Surprisingly, the possibility of entry may facilitate collusion, as may impatience.

Attributed to Gaige Kaifang, or Chinese Economic Reform by Mr. Deng in 1978, the Chinese economy started growing drastically: the GDP, 11 trillion USD in 2015, was 30 times what it was in 1978. Undoubtedly, from rags to riches is the best way to express China's situation. From this reform, the city of Shenzhen proved to be one of the most successful and outstanding cities in China. Moreover, the outcome of the new SEZ was that Shenzhen soon became the fourth super city (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) in China, achieved the highest GDP per capita of the whole country and grew the economically fastest over other Chinese cities since 1979. This paper will examine the two eras of Shenzhen's development, from a port county to a special economic zone, and how the city functions as an important global city for China today.","[Chen, Jiahui] Sch Lawrence Univ, Appleton, WI 54911 USA",,"Chen, JH (通讯作者)，Sch Lawrence Univ, Appleton, WI 54911 USA.",jiahui.chen@lawrence.edu,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-15-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,325,329,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ8CU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427983100067,0

The classic approach of Glosten-Milgrom is followed. Bid and ask prices are defined as conditional expectations of a true value of the asset given the market makers' partial information that includes the customers' trading decisions. The true value is modeled as a Markov process that can be observed by the customers with some noise at Poisson times. A mathematically rigorous analysis of the price-setting problem is carried out, solving a filtering problem with endogenous filtration that depends on the bid and ask price processes quoted by the market maker. The existence and uniqueness of the bid and ask price processes is shown under some conditions.","[Kuehn, Christoph; Riedel, Matthias] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt MathFinance Inst, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Kühn, C (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ, Frankfurt MathFinance Inst, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany.",ckuehn@math.uni-frankfurt.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG),Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We would like to thank the editor, an anonymous associate editor, and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

However, inherent noise and uncertainties in the data are hardly considered for robust efficiency scores. The disadvantage is that a small perturbation in the uncertain parameters can lead to high infeasibility of the efficient solutions. This paper introduces a robust DEA into the measurement of banks efficiency. The proposed robust approach is based on the robust counterpart optimization of Ben-Tal & Nemirovski (2000), and it is implemented in the traditional DEA models germane to the performance measurement of banks. A preliminary result from data on banks in the Czech Republic indicates that efficiency scores measured with the robust DEA model provides a true and stable performance measure than the normal DEA model.","[Mensah, Emmanuel Kwasi] Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Varese, Italy; [Toloo, Mehdi] Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Syst Engn, Ostrava, Czech Republic",University of Insubria; Technical University of Ostrava,"Mensah, EK (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Varese, Italy.",ekmensah@uninsubria.it; mehdi.toloo@vsb.cz,"Mensah, Emmanuel Kwasi/AAE-3521-2019; Toloo, Mehdi/F-7575-2019; Toloo, Mehdi/C-2679-2014","Toloo, Mehdi/0000-0002-6977-4608; Mensah, Emmanuel Kwasi/0000-0003-3337-0553",Czech Science Foundation [16-17810S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation through project No. 16-17810S.,,18,0,0,0,3,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

In the two decades since, the methods used for economic evaluations have advanced substantially. Recently, a second panel (hereafter the panel) was convened to update the text and its recommendations were published in November 2016. The purpose of this paper is to critique the panel's updated guidance regarding the discounting of costs and health effects. The advances in discounting methodology since the first panel include greater theoretical clarity regarding the specification of discount rates, how these rates vary with the analytical perspective chosen, and whether the healthcare budget is constrained. More specifically, there has been an important resolution of the debate regarding the conditions under which differential discounting of costs and health effects is appropriate. We show that the panel's recommendations are inconsistent with this recent literature. Importantly, the panel's departures from previously published findings do not arise from an alternative interpretation of theory; rather, we demonstrate that this is due to fundamental errors in methodology and logic. The panel also failed to conduct a formal review of relevant empirical evidence. We provide a number of suggestions for how the panel's recommendations could be improved in future.","[Paulden, Mike] Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [O'Mahony, James F.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin, Ireland; [McCabe, Christopher] Univ Alberta, Dept Emergency Med, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta; Trinity College Dublin; University of Alberta,"Paulden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Sch Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",paulden@ualberta.ca; jfomahon@tcd.ie; mccabe1@ualberta.ca,"Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","O'Mahony, James/0000-0003-3414-7388; Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980",,,,,13,22,22,0,1,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2017,35.0,1,,,,,5,13,,10.1007/s40273-016-0482-0,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EI1JA,27943173.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392231900002,0

This paper formulates an interconnected multiplex structure, and a contagion mechanism among financial institutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions' activity within different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial market. We design minimum-cost stabilisation strategies that act simultaneously on different markets and their interconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion progressing through the overall structure. The empirical simulations confirm their capability for containing contagion. The potential for multichannel contagion through the multiplex contributes more to systemic fragility than single-channel contagion, however, multichannel stabilisation also contributes more to systemic resilience than single-channel stabilisation.","[Sergueiva, Antoaneta] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London, England; [Chinthalapati, V.

The objective of this work was to review approaches used to model treatment sequences and provide practical guidance on conceptualizing whether and how to model sequences in health economic models. Economic models including treatment sequencing assessed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence were reviewed, as these assessments generally provide both policy relevance and comprehensive model detail. We identified 40 treatment-sequence models in the following disease areas: oncology (13), autoimmune (7), cardiovascular (6), neurology/mental health (4), infectious disease (2), diabetes (2), and other (6). Modeling techniques included discrete event simulation (6), individual state-transition (3), decision tree (3) and, most commonly, cohort state-transition with tracking states (28). In most cases, treatment sequencing had been incorporated to reflect either clinical practice or clinical trial design. In other cases, it was used to assess where in a treatment sequence a new treatment should be placed, or to evaluate the addition of more efficacious treatment options to a current treatment sequence. Important considerations for determining how to best model sequences include the number of treatment options, patient heterogeneity, key outcomes, and event risk (time-varying or constant). The biggest challenge is the scarcity of clinical data, as clinical trials do not commonly evaluate different treatment sequences.","[Zheng, Ying; Sorensen, Sonja] Evidera, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Pan, Feng] Janssen Global Serv LLC, Raritan, NJ USA",Evidera; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Sorensen, S (通讯作者)，Evidera, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",sonja.sorensen@evidera.com,,,,,,,49,15,15,0,6,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JAN,2017,35.0,1,,,,,15,24,,10.1007/s40273-016-0455-3,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EI1JA,27722894.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392231900003,0

In this paper, we investigate the dynamic mean-VaR portfolio selection formulation in continuous time, while the majority of the current literature on mean-VaR portfolio selection mainly focuses on its static versions. Our contributions are twofold, in both building up a tractable formulation and deriving the corresponding optimal portfolio policy. By imposing a limit funding level on the terminal wealth, we conquer the ill-posedness exhibited in the original dynamic mean-VaR portfolio formulation. To overcome the difficulties arising from the VaR constraint and no bankruptcy constraint, we have combined the martingale approach with the quantile optimization technique in our solution framework to derive the optimal portfolio policy. In particular, we have characterized the condition for the existence of the Lagrange multiplier. When the opportunity set of the market setting is deterministic, the portfolio policy becomes analytical. Furthermore, the limit funding level not only enables us to solve the dynamic mean-VaR portfolio selection problem, but also offers a flexibility to tame the aggressiveness of the portfolio policy.","[Zhou, Ke] Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jiangjun] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Management & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Duan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xiangyu] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Gao, JJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Management & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",gao.jianjun@shufe.edu.cn,"Cui, Xiangyu/J-4419-2016; Li, Duan/E-7985-2011","Li, Duan/0000-0001-9786-6238","Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [71431008]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61573244, 71201102, 71671106, 71201094]; State Key Program in the Major Research Plan of National Natural Science Foundation of China [91546202]; Program for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and Hong Kong Research Grants Council [CUHK 414513, 14204514]",Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Program in the Major Research Plan of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and Hong Kong Research Grants Council,"This research work was partially supported by the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71431008]; Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 61573244], [grant number 71201102], [grant number 71671106], [grant number 71201094]; the State Key Program in the Major Research Plan of National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 91546202]; Program for Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and Hong Kong Research Grants Council [grant number CUHK 414513], [grant number 14204514].",,28,6,7,5,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

The objective of this tutorial is to describe possible outcomes from PSA, discuss appropriate levels of accuracy, and present guidance by which an analyst can determine if a sufficient number of simulations have been conducted, such that results are considered to have converged. The proposed approach considers the variance of the outcomes of interest in cost-effectiveness analysis as a function of the number of simulations. A worked example of the technique is presented using results from a published model, with recommendations made on best practice. While the technique presented remains essentially arbitrary, it does give a mechanism for assessing the level of simulation error, and thus represents an advance over current practice of a round number of simulations with no assessment of model convergence.","[Hatswell, Anthony J.] UCL, London, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.; Bullement, Ash] Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England; [Bullement, Ash] BresMed Hlth Solut, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Briggs, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Briggs, Andrew] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Paulden, Mike] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Stevenson, Matthew D.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of London; University College London; University of Glasgow; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; University of Alberta; University of Sheffield,"Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.;Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England.",ahatswell@deltahat.co.uk,"Bullement, Ash/IVV-3411-2023; Briggs, Andrew/ABA-9009-2020; Bullement, Ash/AEO-3423-2022; Paulden, Michael/E-2061-2016","Briggs, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-1997; Bullement, Ash/0000-0001-7091-0972; Paulden, Mike/0000-0002-0381-5980; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",,,,,23,54,58,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12,,,,,1421,1426,,10.1007/s40273-018-0697-3,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30051268.0,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451183300003,0

In this article, we assess how multi-indication pricing could help achieve overall strategic objectives of pricing controls, summarise its advantages and disadvantages (vs. uniform pricing) and estimate the hypothetical impact on prices of moving towards multi-indication pricing for specific oncologic medicines in Spain. International experience shows that multi-indication pricing can be implemented in real practice, and indeed a few initiatives are currently in use, albeit mostly applied indirectly through confidential pricing agreements that offer a way to discriminate prices across countries without altering list prices. However, some more sophisticated systems are in place in Italy, and more recently in Spain, where the objective is to monitor usage per patient/indication, and ultimately pay for outcomes. Based on the existing experience, we also outline six conditions required for multi-indication pricing. Multi-indication pricing is a useful tool to determine the relative prices of a drug for multiple (different-valued) indications, but by itself will not offer the solution' to what the absolute price should be. That will be driven, among other things, by cost-effectiveness thresholds, if they exist. Overall, we argue multi-indication pricing is nice in theory and it could work in practice, although changes in the manner in which medicines are priced, procured and monitored in clinical practice need to be applied.","[Zozaya, Neboa; Alcala, Bleric] Weber Econ & Salud, Madrid, Spain; [Hidalgo-Vega, Alvaro] Fdn Weber, Madrid, Spain; [Hidalgo-Vega, Alvaro] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Campus Toledo, Toledo, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,,,"Hidalgo, Alvaro/B-6768-2009","Hidalgo, Alvaro/0000-0003-1031-2051; Zozaya, Neboa/0000-0003-4618-6894; Alcala Revilla, Bleric/0000-0001-8086-1692; Mestre-Ferrandiz, Jorge/0000-0003-0529-1321",,,,,71,14,15,3,16,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2018,36.0,12,,,,,1407,1420,,10.1007/s40273-018-0716-4,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,HB6ME,30198061.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000451183300002,0

We apply a subordinator being able to incorporate any joint or idiosyncratic information arrivals. We emphasize multivariate variance gamma and normal inverse Gaussian processes and state explicit formulae for the Levy characteristics. Using maximum likelihood, we estimate multivariate variance gamma models on various market data and show that these models are highly preferable to traditional approaches.

The CSs are based on level sets of optimal criterion functions (such as likelihoods, optimally-weighted or continuously-updated GMM criterions). The level sets are constructed using cutoffs that are computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the quasi-posterior distribution of the criterion. We establish new Bernstein-von Mises (or Bayesian Wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributions of the quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) and profile QLR in partially-identified models. These results imply that our MC CSs have exact asymptotic frequentist coverage for identified sets of full parameters and of subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and have valid but potentially conservative coverage in models whose local tangent spaces are convex cones. Further, our MC CSs for identified sets of subvectors are shown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with singularities.

Discrete event simulations (DESs) have been proposed as a superior approach. Objective We developed a state-transition model and a DES using the discretely integrated condition event (DICE) framework and compared the cost-effectiveness results. We performed scenario analysis using the DES to explore the impact of alternative assumptions. Methods The models estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the intervention and comparator from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. The models considered five comorbidities: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. The state-transition model used prevalence data, and the DES used incidence. The costs and utility inputs were the same between two models and consistent with those used in previous analyses for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Results In the state-transition model, the intervention produced an additional 0.16 QALYs at a cost of 540 pound, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3438 pound. The comparable DES scenario produced an ICER of 5577 pound. The ICER for the DES increased to 18,354 pound when long-term relapse was included. Conclusions The model structures themselves did not influence smoking cessation cost-effectiveness results, but long-term assumptions did. When there is variation in long-term predictions between interventions, economic models need a structure that can reflect this.","[Pennington, Becky] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Pennington, Becky; Owen, Lesley] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, 10 Spring Gardens, London SW1A 2BU, England; [Filby, Alex; Taylor, Matthew] Univ York, York Hlth Econ Consortium, Enterprise House, York YO10 5NQ, N Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence; University of York - UK,"Pennington, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.;Pennington, B (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, 10 Spring Gardens, London SW1A 2BU, England.",b.pennington@sheffield.ac.uk,"Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023","Pennington, Becky/0000-0002-1002-022X",NICE,NICE,"When this work was undertaken, Becky Pennington and Lesley Owen were employed by the NICE.

It disproportionately harms the candidate ideologically closest to the third and causes her defeat in one fifth of the races. Additional evidence suggests that these results are driven by voters who value voting expressively over voting strategically for the top-two candidate they dislike the least to ensure her victory; and by third candidates who, absent party-level agreements leading to their dropping out, value the benefits associated with competing in the second round more than influencing its outcome.","[Pons, Vincent] Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Pons, Vincent] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Tricaud, Clemence] Ecole Polytech, CREST, Palaiseau, France",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Pons, V (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Boston, MA 02163 USA.;Pons, V (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",vpons@hbs.edu; clemence.tricaud@polytechnique.edu,,,,,,,61,38,42,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2018,86.0,5,,,,,1621,1649,,10.3982/ECTA15373,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HB2AT,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450837000004,0

This work reviews recently published economic models to evaluate how health states are defined, what cost components are considered, and what utility values are used to estimate the cost effectiveness of OAB pharmacotherapies, botulinum toxin, or sacral neuromodulation. It was found that no clear standard exists for determining OAB health states, although most were defined by some measure of incontinence frequency. Costs of physician visits and incontinence pads were included in nearly all models; however, OAB-associated depression and nursing home costs were rarely included, despite being large cost drivers of global economic burden studies. Utility values used in the models ranged from 0.544 to 0.933, highlighting the uncertainty associated with how OAB patients value health-related quality of life. More research is warranted so that health states providing delineations among OAB symptom severity and quality of life are clinically and economically meaningful as well as meaningful to affected patients.","[Snedecor, Sonya J.] Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Hwy,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",Pharmerit North America LLC,"Snedecor, SJ (通讯作者)，Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Hwy,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",ssnedecor@pharmerit.com,,,,,,,40,8,8,0,0,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2018,36.0,9,,,,,1083,1092,,10.1007/s40273-018-0663-0,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO4QV,29725872.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439998500005,0

As the first country to do so, the study design used the improved EQ-5D-5L valuation protocol 2.0 developed by the EuroQol Group, including a feedback module as internal validation and a quality control process that was missing in the first wave of EQ-5D-5L valuation studies. A representative sample of the general German population (n = 1158) was interviewed using a composite time trade-off and a discrete choice experiment under close quality control. Econometric modeling was used to estimate values for all 3125 possible health states described by EQ-5D-5L. The value set was based on a hybrid model including all available information from the composite time trade-off and discrete choice experiment valuations without any exclusions due to data issues. The final German value set was constructed from a combination of a conditional logit model for the discrete choice experiment data and a censored at -1 Tobit model for the composite time trade-off data, correcting for heteroskedasticity. The value set had logically consistent parameter estimates (p < 0.001 for all coefficients). The predicted EQ-5D-5L index values ranged from -0.661 to 1. This study provided values for the health states of the German version of EQ-5D-5L representing the preferences of the German population. The study successfully employed for the first time worldwide the improved protocol 2.0.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Maastricht University Medical Centre+, was commissioned as the evidence review group (ERG). This paper summarises the company submission (CS), the ERG report and the NICE guidance produced by the appraisal committee (AC) for the use of ticagrelor in England and Wales. The ERG critically reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS. The systematic review conducted as part of the CS identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT), PEGASUS-TIMI 54. This trial reported the time to first occurrence of any event from the composite of cardiovascular death, MI and stroke as the primary outcome (hazard ratio 0.84 ticagrelor 60 mg BID vs. placebo, 95% confidence interval 0.74-0.95). The population addressed in the CS was a subgroup of the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial population, i.e. the 'base-case' population, which comprised patients who had experienced an MI between 1 and 2 years ago, whereas the full trial population included patients who had experienced an MI between 1 and 3 years ago. While the ERG believed the findings of this RCT to be robust, doubts concerning the applicability of the trial to UK patients were raised. The company submitted an individual patient simulation model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg BID + ASA versus ASA only. Parametric time-to-event models were used to estimate the time to first and subsequent (cardiovascular) events, time to treatment discontinuation and time to adverse events. The company's base-case analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of A 20,098 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The main issues surrounding the cost effectiveness of ticagrelor 60 mg BID + ASA were the use of parametric time-to-event models estimated based on the full trial population instead of being fitted to the 'label' population (the 'label' population comprised the 'base-case' population and patients who started ticagrelor 60 mg BID within 1 year of previous adenosine diphosphate inhibitor treatment), the incorrect implementation of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) of the individual patient simulation, and simplifications of the model structure that may have biased the health benefits and costs estimations of the intervention and comparator. The ERG believed the use of the full trial population to inform the parametric time-to-event models was not appropriate because the 'label' population was the main focus of the scope and CS. The ERG could not investigate the magnitude of the bias introduced by this assumption. The PSA of the individual patient simulation provided unreliable probabilistic results and underestimated the uncertainty surrounding the results because it was based on a single patient. The ERG used the cohort simulation presented in the cost-effectiveness model to perform its base-case and additional analyses and to obtain probabilistic results. The ERG amended the company cost-effectiveness model, which resulted in an ERG base-case ICER of A 24,711 pound per QALY gained. In its final guidance, the AC recommended treatment with ticagrelor 60 mg BID + low-dose ASA for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in adults who have had an MI and are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events.","[Pouwels, Xavier G.

We allow for both conditional and unconditional heteroskedasticity of a very general form. We establish the conditions required on the penalty functions such that standard information criterion-based methods, such as the Bayesian information criterion [BIC], when employed either sequentially or jointly, can be used to consistently estimate both the cointegration rank and the autoregressive lag order. In doing so we also correct errors which appear in the proofs provided for the consistency of information-based estimators in the homoskedastic case by Aznar and Salvador (2002, Econometric Theory 18, 926-947). We also extend the corpus of available large sample theory for the conventional sequential approach of Johansen (1995, Likelihood-Based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models. Oxford University Press) and the associated wild bootstrap implementation thereof of Cavaliere, Rahbek, and Taylor (2014, Econometric Reviews 33, 606-650) to the case where the lag order is unknown. In particular, we show that these methods remain valid under heteroskedasticity and an unknown lag length provided the lag length is first chosen by a consistent method, again such as the BIC. The relative finite sample properties of the different methods discussed are investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation study. The two best performing methods in this study are a wild bootstrap implementation of the Johansen (1995, Likelihood-Based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Autoregressive Models. Oxford University Press) procedure implemented with BIC selection of the lag length and joint IC approach (cf. Phillips, 1996, Econometrica 64, 763-812) which uses the BIC to jointly select the lag order and the cointegration rank.","[Cavaliere, Giuseppe; De Angelis, Luca] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Rahbek, Anders] Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Taylor, A.

As part of the Single Technology Appraisal (STA) ID944, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited AbbVie, the manufacturer, to submit evidence on the use of venetoclax, within its licensed indication. The Evidence Review Group (ERG), Warwick Evidence, was asked to provide an independent and critical review of the submitted evidence. Evidence came from three single-arm trials in CLL patients with or without 17p deletion [del(17p])/TP53 chromosomal abnormalities. The anticipated licensed indication specified that venetoclax-eligible del(17p)/TP53 patients should have not responded to, or be deemed unsuitable for, B-cell receptor inhibitor (BCRi) therapy, and that non-del(17p)/TP53 patients should have not responded to both chemoimmunotherapy and BCRi therapy. The three trials were heterogeneous in terms of both del(17p)/TP53 status and previous exposure to BCRi therapy. The M13-982 study investigated 158 R/R CLL patients with the 17p deletion, but only a small number had received previous BCRi therapy; the M12-175 study investigated 67 patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, some with the 17p deletion, but very few previously treated with BCRi therapy; and the M14-032 study included 105 patients previously treated with BCRi therapy (either idelalisib or ibrutinib), some of whom had unknown mutation status. The ERG concluded that the study populations did not directly conform to those specified in the licensed indication or in the NICE scope. Outcomes reported included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); adverse events were reported for the pooled population of all three studies, as well as separately for each study. The median PFS was 41.4 and 27.2 months among patients in the M12-175 and M13-982 trials, respectively, whereas the median PFS was not reached in the M14-032 trial. Some results were designated academic in confidence and cannot be reported here. The submission provided a de novo partitioned survival cost-effectiveness model with three health states: pre-progression, post-progression and dead. Transition probabilities between health states were estimated using Weibull models for PFS and OS. The ERG judged the model structure to be appropriate. Venetoclax was compared with best supportive care (BSC) in patients with or without del(17p)/TP53 mutation status, and with palliative care (PC). To populate the del(17p)/TP53 venetoclax arm, the submission pooled del(17p)/TP53 patients from all three studies and fitted Weibull models for PFS and OS. PFS and OS models for non-del(17p)/TP53 venetoclax patients were obtained by applying hazard ratios (HRs) to the del(17p)/TP53 OS and PFS models, derived using Cox's regression analysis comparing del(17p)/TP53 and non-del(17p)/TP53 patients pooled from the M14-032 and M12-175 studies. The ERG expressed reservations about the company's pooling procedure, but acknowledged its expedience given the small evidence base. For the BSC comparator arm, the submission used the rituximab + placebo arm from a randomised controlled trial comparing idelalisib + rituximab versus placebo + rituximab ('study 116'). Weibull regression data for OS and PFS were taken from the idelalisib STA (ID764) submitted by Gilead to NICE. The ERG considered the use of the study 116 rituximab arm to be inconsistent with the licensed indication for venetoclax because these patients had neither not responded to nor were inappropriate for BCRi therapy, being eligible to be randomised to idelalisib. Another difficulty was the requirement for a technical correction in survival analysis because of considerable switching from rituximab to idelalisib. The ERG considered that post-progression survival of patients from the idelalisib arm of study 116 provided a more appropriate representation of BSC since these patients had not responded to BCRi therapy, consistent with venetoclax's licensed indication. For PC, the company submission used data from the UK CLL Forum. The company's base-case analysis indicated that venetoclax was clinically effective, but the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for del(17p)/TP53 (A 39,940 pound/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) and non-del(17p)/TP53 (A 47,370 pound/QALY gained) patients were well above the NICE threshold of A 20,000-30,000 pound/QALY. The ERG identified two errors in the implementation of the company's parametric models-one related to the implementation of HRs, and the other to the derivation of the Weibull shape parameters obtained from the Gilead idelalisib submission. The ERG made plausible adjustments to the company's base-case and corrected errors, resulting in a reduced estimate of the cost effectiveness of venetoclax in non-del(17p)/TP53 and del(17p)/TP53 indications; in the ERG's preferred base case, using post-progression survival of patients in the idelalisib arm of study 116 as the BSC comparator, deterministic ICERs were higher than the company's base-case for both indications: A 57,476 pound/QALY gained for del(17p)/TP53 and A 77,779 pound/QALY gained for non-del(17p)/TP53. The NICE Appraisal Committee's preliminary recommendation was that venetoclax used within its licensed indication should not be recommended for use in the National Health Service (NHS). In response to the preliminary recommendation, the company submitted new analyses; however, at a subsequent appraisal committee meeting, the original recommendation was upheld and the committee concluded there were large uncertainties around the clinical effectiveness of venetoclax and BSC, and that under the committee's preferred assumptions, the ICERs were higher than those generally considered cost effective, even when end-of-life criteria were taken into account. The company submitted further evidence, and the final guidance recommended venetoclax for use with the Cancer Drugs Fund for the two populations in this technology appraisal.","[Mistry, Hema; Nduka, Chidozie; Connock, Martin; Mantopoulos, Theodoros; Mason, James] Univ Warwick, Warwick Evidence, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Colquitt, Jill; Loveman, Emma] Effect Evidence LLP, 26 Curve, Waterlooville PO8 9SE, Hants, England; [Walewska, Renata] Royal Bournemouth Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Castle Lane East, Bournemouth BH7 7DW, Dorset, England",University of Warwick,"Mistry, H (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Evidence, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Hema.Mistry@warwick.ac.uk,"Mason, James M/D-9904-2011","Loveman, Emma/0000-0001-8226-2634; Mistry, Hema/0000-0002-5023-1160; Mason, James/0000-0001-9210-4082; Colquitt, Jillian Leigh/0000-0001-5962-2689",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA programme) [16/10/11],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA programme),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA programme [Project number 16/10/11].

Although there are many models for measuring composite indicators in the literature, surprisingly, there is no methodology that clearly shows how composite indicators improvement could be performed. This article proposes a slack analysis framework for improving the composite indicator of inefficient entities. For doing so, two dual problems originated from two data envelopment analysis models in the literature are proposed, which can guide decision makers on how to adjust the subindicators of inefficient entities to improve their composite indicators through identifying which subindicators must be improved and how much they should be augmented. The proposed methodology for improving composite indicators is inspired from data envelopment analysis and slack analysis approaches. Applicability of the proposed methodology is investigated for improving two well-known composite indicators, i.e., Sustainable Energy Index and Human Development Index. The results show that 12 out of 18 economies are inefficient in the context of sustainable energy index, for which the proposed slack analysis models provide the suggested adjustments in terms of their respected subindicators. Furthermore, the proposed methodology suggests how to adjust the life expectancy, the education, and the gross domestic product (GDP) as the three socioeconomic indicators to improve the human development index of 24 countries which are identified as inefficient entities among 27 countries.","[Hatefi, S.

Both the approaches are extended to the LTC insurance using a multiple state framework. In order to represent the future evolution of mortality and disability transition probabilities, we use the stochastic model of Cairns et al. (2009) with cohort effect under parameter uncertainty through a semi-parametric bootstrap procedure. We calculate the optimal level of a product mix and measure the effectiveness provided by the interaction of LTC stand alone, deferred annuity and whole-life insurance.

Mapping functions are used when evidence on the required preference-based measure (PBM) is not available, or where modelled values are required for a decision analytic model, for example to control for important sociodemographic variables (such as age or gender). This article provides an overview of the latest recommendations including pre-mapping considerations, the mapping process including data requirements for undertaking the estimation of mapping functions, regression models for estimating mapping functions, assessing performance and reporting standards for mapping studies. Examples in rheumatoid arthritis are used for illustration. When reporting the results of mapping standards the following should be reported: a description of the dataset used (including distributions of variables used) and any analysis used to inform the selection of the model type and model specification. The regression method and specification should be justified, and as summary statistics may mask systematic bias in errors, plots comparing observed and predicted HSUVs. The final model (coefficients, error term(s), variance and covariance) should be reported together with a worked example. It is important to ensure that good practice is followed as any mapping functions will only be as appropriate and accurate as the method used to obtain them; for example, mapping should not be used if there is no overlap between the explanatory and target variables.","[Ara, Roberta; Rowen, Donna; Mukuria, Clara] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Rowen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",d.rowen@sheffield.ac.uk,,,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG,This study was funded by an unrestricted Grant from Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG.,,18,20,22,1,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,DEC,2017,35.0,,,1.0,,,S57,S66,,10.1007/s40273-017-0548-7,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO0PY,29052160.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439637400008,0

The second main result provides the existence of optimal superhedging strategies for general contingent claims and a representation of the superhedging price in terms of martingale measures.","[Biagini, Sara] Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Pisa, Italy; [Bouchard, Bruno] Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, Paris, France; [Bouchard, Bruno] CREST ENSAE, Paris, France; [Kardaras, Constantinos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Stat, London, England; [Nutz, Marcel] Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Nutz, Marcel] Columbia Univ, Dept Math, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Pisa; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Nutz, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Stat, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Nutz, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Math, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mnutz@columbia.edu,,"Nutz, Marcel/0000-0003-2936-2315","ANR Liquirisk and Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047]; NSF [DMS-1208985, DMS-1512900]",ANR Liquirisk and Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by ANR Liquirisk and Investissements d'Avenir (ANR-11-IDEX-0003/Labex Ecodec/ANR-11-LABX-0047) and NSF Grants DMS-1208985 and DMS-1512900.

These studies present a bewildering array of simulation techniques and applications, making it challenging to characterise the literature. Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the level of activity of simulation modelling in healthcare and the key themes. Methods We performed an umbrella review of systematic literature reviews of simulation modelling in healthcare. Searches were conducted of academic databases (JSTOR, Scopus, PubMed, IEEE, SAGE, ACM, Wiley Online Library, ScienceDirect) and grey literature sources, enhanced by citation searches. The articles were included if they performed a systematic review of simulation modelling techniques in healthcare. After quality assessment of all included articles, data were extracted on numbers of studies included in each review, types of applications, techniques used for simulation modelling, data sources and simulation software. Results The search strategy yielded a total of 117 potential articles. Following sifting, 37 heterogeneous reviews were included. Most reviews achieved moderate quality rating on a modified AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool used to Assess systematic Reviews) checklist. All the review articles described the types of applications used for simulation modelling; 15 reviews described techniques used for simulation modelling; three reviews described data sources used for simulation modelling; and six reviews described software used for simulation modelling. The remaining reviews either did not report or did not provide enough detail for the data to be extracted. Conclusion Simulation modelling techniques have been used for a wide range of applications in healthcare, with a variety of software tools and data sources. The number of reviews published in recent years suggest an increased interest in simulation modelling in healthcare.","[Salleh, Syed; Thokala, Praveen; Brennan, Alan; Hughes, Ruby; Booth, Andrew] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Salleh, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",SSAbdulRahman1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009; Booth, Andrew/A-7872-2008","Booth, Andrew/0000-0003-4808-3880; Hughes, Ruby/0000-0001-7764-5331; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366; Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Abdul Rahman, Syed Salleh/0000-0001-9661-7125",Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA),Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA),This work was supported by the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA).,,63,49,56,4,40,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2017,35.0,9,,,,,937,949,,10.1007/s40273-017-0523-3,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FE1ZR,28560492.0,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408016600007,0

Key model outputs, such as treatment recommendations and prioritisation of future research, may be sensitive to state structure choice. For example, it may be uncertain whether to consider similar disease severities or similar clinical events as the same state or as separate states. Standard statistical methods for comparing models require a common reference dataset but merging states in a model aggregates the data, rendering these methods invalid. Methods We propose a method that involves re-expressing a model with merged states as a model on the larger state space in which particular transition probabilities, costs and utilities are constrained to be equal between states. This produces a model that gives identical estimates of cost effectiveness to the model with merged states, while leaving the data unchanged. The comparison of state structures can be achieved by comparing maximised likelihoods or information criteria between constrained and unconstrained models. We can thus test whether the costs and/or health consequences for a patient in two states are the same, and hence if the states can be merged. We note that different structures can be used for rates, costs and utilities, as appropriate. Application We illustrate our method with applications to two recent models evaluating the cost effectiveness of prescribing anti-depressant medications by depression severity and the cost effectiveness of diagnostic tests for coronary artery disease. Conclusions State structures in cost-effectiveness models can be compared using standard methods to compare constrained and unconstrained models.","[Thom, Howard; Welton, Nicky] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England; [Jackson, Chris] MRC, Biostat Unit, Cambridge, England; [Sharples, Linda] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, London, England",University of Bristol; MRC Biostatistics Unit; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Thom, H (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Bristol, Avon, England.",Howard.thom@bristol.ac.uk,,"Welton, Nicky J/0000-0003-2198-3205; Thom, Howard/0000-0001-8576-5552; Sharples, Linda/0000-0003-0894-966X","Medical Research Council (MRC) [U015232027]; MRC ConDuCT-II Hub [MR/K025643/1]; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Program [99/26/04]; NIHR Programme Grants for Applied Research Award [RP-PG-0610-10048]; MRC [MC_U105260556, MR/L004933/1, MR/L004933/2, G0802413, MR/K025643/1, MC_UU_00002/11, MC_U105232027] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MC_U105232027, MC_U105260556, MR/L004933/1, MR/K025643/1, MC_UU_00002/11, MR/L004933/2, G0802413] Funding Source: researchfish",Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC ConDuCT-II Hub(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Program(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Programme Grants for Applied Research Award; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"Chris Jackson was fully funded and Linda Sharples and Howard Thom were partly funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Programme Grant U015232027.

For stated preference data on benefit-risk assessment to be used in regulatory decision making, the methods to generate these data must be valid, reliable and capable of producing meaningful estimates understood by decision makers. Some reporting guidelines exist for discrete choice experiments, and for related methods such as conjoint analysis. However, existing guidelines focus on reporting standards, are general in focus and do not consider the requirements for using discrete choice experiments specifically for quantifying benefit-risk assessments in the context of regulatory decision making. This opinion piece outlines the current state of play in using discrete choice experiments for benefit-risk assessment and proposes key areas needing to be addressed to demonstrate that discrete choice experiments are an appropriate and valid stated preference elicitation method in this context. Methodological research is required to establish: how robust the results of discrete choice experiments are to formats and methods of risk communication; how information in the discrete choice experiment can be presented effectually to respondents; whose preferences should be elicited; the correct underlying utility function and analytical model; the impact of heterogeneity in preferences; and the generalisability of the results. We believe these methodological issues should be addressed, alongside developing a 'reference case', before agencies can safely and confidently use discrete choice experiments for quantitative benefit-risk assessment in the context of regulatory decision making for new medicines and healthcare products.","[Vass, Caroline M.; Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Payne, K (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Katherine.payne@manchester.ac.uk,"Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; Vass, Caroline/0000-0002-6385-2812",Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences,Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),"Caroline M.

First, one fixes a currency unit. Second, one describes in that unit the evolution of financial assets by a stochastic process. Third, one chooses in that unit a numeraire, usually the price process of a positive asset. Fourth, one divides the original price process by the numeraire and considers the class of admissible strategies for trading. This approach has one fundamental drawback: Almost all concepts, definitions, and results, including no-arbitrage conditions like NA, NFLVR, and NUPBR depend by their very definition, at least formally, on initial choices of a currency unit and a numeraire. In this paper, we develop a new framework for modeling financial markets, which is not based on ex-ante choices of a currency unit and a numeraire. In particular, we introduce a numeraire-independent notion of no-arbitrage and derive its dual characterization. This yields a numeraire-independent version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing (FTAP). We also explain how the classic approach and other recent approaches to modeling financial markets and studying no-arbitrage can be embedded in our framework.","[Herdegen, Martin] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Herdegen, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Math, Ramistr 101, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",martin.herdegen@math.ethz.ch,,,"National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management)","National Centre of Competence in Research Financial Valuation and Risk Management (NCCR FINRISK), Project D1 (Mathematical Methods in Financial Risk Management)","I would like to thank Martin Schweizer, my PhD advisor, for various fruitful discussions, which have considerably improved the content of this paper.

It is widely used by traders in financial markets, particularly those in the globally fragmented spot currency market. In this paper, I study the properties of execution in an aggregator where multiple liquidity providers (LPs) compete for a trader's uninformed flow. There are two main contributions. Firstly, I formulate a model for the liquidity dynamics and contract formation process, and use this to characterize key trading metrics such as the observed inside spread in the aggregator, the reject rate due to the so-called last-look' trade acceptance process, the effective spread that the trader pays, as well as the market share and gross revenues of the LPs. An important observation here is that aggregation induces adverse selection where the LP that receives the trader's deal request will suffer from the Winner's curse', and this effect grows stronger when the trader increases the number of participants in the aggregator. To defend against this, the model allows LPs to adjust the nominal spread they charge or alter the trade acceptance criteria. This interplay is a key determinant of transaction costs. Secondly, I analyse the properties of different execution styles. I show that when the trader splits her order across multiple LPs, a single provider that has quick market access and for whom it is relatively expensive to internalize risk can effectively force all other providers to join her in externalizing the trader's flow thereby maximizing the market impact and aggregate hedging costs. It is therefore not only the number, but also the type of LP and execution style adopted by the trader that determines transaction costs.","[Oomen, Roel] Deutsch Bank AG, 1 Great Winchester St, London EC2N 2DB, England; [Oomen, Roel] London Sch Econ, Dept Stat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Deutsche Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Oomen, R (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bank AG, 1 Great Winchester St, London EC2N 2DB, England.;Oomen, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Stat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",roel.oomen@db.com,,,,,,,13,7,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

For each country we consider, as a target measure, the Debt/GDP ratio. We model the time dynamics of both the Debt and the GDP by means of a linear combination of two stochastic equations: an Euro Area systematic process and a country-specific idiosyncratic process. Doing so, we provide an early warning predictive model of sovereign debt sustainability, considering both the financial and the real economy sides, and in terms of both common and country-specific factors. We provide an estimation procedure for the parameters of the processes, which allows to calculate the implied probabilities of default for each country. The empirical findings show a clear clustering effect between northern and southern countries, especially on the financial side.

Proper model selection for those ETG-based costs is essential to adequately price and manage health insurance risks. The optimal claim cost model (or model probabilities) can vary depending on the disease. We compare four potential models (lognormal, gamma, log-skew-t and Lomax) using four different model selection methods (AIC and BIC weights, Random Forest feature classification and Bayesian model averaging) on 320 ETGs. Using the data from a major health insurer, which consists of more than 33 million observations from 9 million claimants, we compare the various methods on both speed and precision, and also examine the wide range of selected models for the different ETGs. Several case studies are provided for illustration. It is found that Random Forest feature selection is computationally efficient and sufficiently accurate, hence being preferred in this large data set. When feasible (on smaller data sets), Bayesian model averaging is preferred because of the posterior model probabilities.","[Huang, Shujuan] Data Sci Profess Resource Grp Liberty Mutual, Seattle, WA 98154 USA; [Hartman, Brian] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA; [Brazauskas, Vytaras] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Brigham Young University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Hartman, B (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Stat, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",hshujuan@gmail.com; hartman@stat.byu.edu; vytaras@uwm.edu,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,JAN,2017,47.0,1,,,,,153,167,,10.1017/asb.2016.26,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EH1ZM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000391566900004,0

In this paper, we prove two theorems about risk contributions. The first theorem concerns a form of duality identified in Grinold [J. Portfolio Manage. 2011, 37(2), 15-30], which may be described as follows. When we view a portfolio decomposition as a coordinate representation of the portfolio with respect to a given vector-space basis, then there is a natural dual basis with respect to which there is an alternative decomposition, here referred to as the dual decomposition. The dual decomposition gives the same contributions to risk as the original decomposition. The first theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a change of basis to preserve risk contributions, and shows that all such changes of basis can be explained in terms of dual decompositions. The second theorem explores sensitivity of portfolio risk to a risk regime change and indicates that large risk contributions or large risks of the components P-i of a decomposition may be harbingers of high sensitivity. This provides a motivation for the practice of reporting both the risk contributions and the risks of the components in a decomposition.","[O'Cinneide, Colm A.] QS Investors, 880 Third Ave, New York, NY 10022 USA",,"O'Cinneide, CA (通讯作者)，QS Investors, 880 Third Ave, New York, NY 10022 USA.",colm.ocinneide@qsinvestors.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

In order to identify ex-post stable prices in such markets, the set of outcomes feasible in Bertrand competition are analysed as a non-transferable utility coalitional game. The market-clearing price is shown to always implement a strict-core outcome. Moreover, where at least two sellers compete, the strict-core converges to only admit market-clearing outcomes. The analysis has implications for a number of prominent models of oligopoly competition. When firms engage in capacity pre-commitment, the set of ex-post stable prices converges to the corresponding Cournot prices. This result holds for arbitrary capacity choices and a general class of rationing rules. Conversely, double-marginalisation is never ex-post stable.","[Byford, Martin C.] RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, 445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Byford, MC (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Mkt, 445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",martin.byford@rmit.edu.au,,"Byford, Martin/0000-0003-0483-155X",,,,,22,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Primary prevention of genital warts is possible through HPV vaccination, but vaccination rates remain low in the USA. When deciding to implement HPV vaccination programs, public health officials and policy makers rely on cost-effectiveness studies that accurately reflect costs associated with morbidity and mortality. However, previous information on the cost of treating genital warts was outdated. Objectives We estimated the mean direct medical care costs associated with genital warts in the USA. Methods This was a retrospective case-control study of patients diagnosed with genital warts and matched controls. We used commercial healthcare claims data from 2011 through 2014 to estimate total 1- and 2-year costs from date of diagnosis. We used a generalized linear model to identify factors associated with monthly costs. Results We identified 34,686 eligible cases of genital warts during the period 2011-2014. The first 2-year mean direct medical cost differences between cases and controls were US$6737 for the USA. Costs were significantly higher in the first 3 months following diagnosis and were higher among older individuals, women, those with co-morbidities or psychiatric illnesses, and those located in the south and southwest USA. Conclusions The mean direct cost of treating genital warts is approximately US$6700 in the first 2 years after diagnosis in the USA. These data can assist policy makers in decisions with respect to allocation of resources to implement HPV vaccine programs.","[Dahlstrom, Kristina R.; Fu, Shuangshuang] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Head & Neck Surg, Div Surg, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Fu, Shuangshuang] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, 1200 Pressler St, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chan, Wenyaw] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, 1200 Pressler St, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Shelal, Zeena; Ramondetta, Lois M.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gynecol Oncol & Reprod Med, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lairson, David R.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Management Policy & Community Hlth, 1200 Pressler St, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health,"Lairson, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Management Policy & Community Hlth, 1200 Pressler St, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",David.R.Lairson@uth.tmc.edu,"Dahlstrom, Kristina/AAM-4609-2020; Dahlstrom, Kristina R/U-1491-2019","Dahlstrom, Kristina R/0000-0002-8116-9558",Lyda Hill Foundation; Stiefel Oropharyngeal Research Fund,Lyda Hill Foundation; Stiefel Oropharyngeal Research Fund,"This study was supported by generous philanthropic contributions, including a contribution from the Lyda Hill Foundation to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center's Moon Shots Program, and was accomplished within the Oropharynx Program at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and funded in part through the Stiefel Oropharyngeal Research Fund.",,49,2,4,0,4,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,NOV,2018,36.0,11,,,,,1355,1365,,10.1007/s40273-018-0691-9,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GW4SE,30019118.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446909400006,0

New meningococcal serogroup B and combination serogroup ACWY vaccines are being considered for publicly funded immunization programs in many countries. Contemporary costing data associated with invasive meningococcal disease are required to inform cost-effectiveness analyses.ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to estimate costs and resource utilization associated with acute infection and the long-term care of invasive meningococcal disease.Data Sources and MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, health economic databases, and electronically available conference abstracts were searched. Studies reporting any costs associated with acute infection and long-term sequelae of invasive meningococcal disease in English were included. All costs were converted into purchasing power parity-adjusted estimates [international dollars (I$)] using the Campbell and Cochrane Economics Methods Group and theEvidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre cost converter.ResultsFourteen studies met our eligibility criteria and were included. The mean costs of acute admission ranged from I$1629 to I$50,796, with an incremental cost of I$16,378. The mean length of hospital stay was reported to be 6-18days in multiple studies. The average costs reported for readmissions ranged from I$7905 to I$15,908. Key variables such as the presence of sequelae were associated with higher hospitalization costs and longer inpatient stay. No studies estimated directnon-healthcare costs and productivity loss. Ten studies reported only unadjusted mean values without using appropriate statistical methods for adjustment.ConclusionsInvasive meningococcal disease can result in substantial costs to healthcare systems. However, costing data on long-term follow-up and indirect costs used to populate health economic models are lacking.","[Wang, Bing; Marshall, Helen] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Med Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Wang, Bing; Marshall, Helen] Univ Adelaide, Robinson Res Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Wang, Bing; Afzali, Hossein; Giles, Lynne; Marshall, Helen] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Wang, Bing; Marshall, Helen] Womens & Childrens Hosp, Vaccinol & Immunol Res Trials Unit, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Santoreneos, Renee] Royal Adelaide Hosp, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of Adelaide; Robinson Research Institute; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; Womens & Childrens Hospital Australia; Royal Adelaide Hospital,"Wang, B (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Med Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Wang, B (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Robinson Res Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Wang, B (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, Adelaide, SA, Australia.;Wang, B (通讯作者)，Womens & Childrens Hosp, Vaccinol & Immunol Res Trials Unit, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",bing.wang@adelaide.edu.au; renee.santoreneos@gmail.com; hossein.hajialiafzali@adelaide.edu.au; lynne.giles@adelaide.edu.au; helen.marshall@adelaide.edu.au,"Giles, Lynne C/C-8789-2009; Marshall, Helen S/G-3603-2013","Marshall, Helen/0000-0003-2521-5166; Wang, Bing/0000-0003-2445-2952; Giles, Lynne/0000-0001-9054-9088",National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia: Career Development Fellowship [1084951],National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia: Career Development Fellowship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),Helen Marshall acknowledges support from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia: Career Development Fellowship (1084951).,,77,17,17,0,7,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2018,36.0,10,,,,,1201,1222,,10.1007/s40273-018-0679-5,0.0,,,22,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GS9AR,29948965.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444007800005,0

In particular, empirical evidence (Jullien and Salanie (2000)) and experimental evidence (Kahneman and Tversky (1979)) supported the importance of risk loving, ambiguity loving, and related behavior in economics. However, these types of preferences have not been analyzed in the general equilibrium literature with a finite number of agents because non-convexity of preferences creates difficulty in proving existence of equilibrium. The main result in this paper provides a set of conditions under which equilibrium exists in such economies. We show that uncertainty of aggregate wealth, as well as some dominance of the endowment of the risk averters in the economy, play a role in the existence of Arrow-Debreu equilibria. This result can be extended to ambiguity in the sense of CEU, Smooth Ambiguity, and Variational Preference.","[Araujo, Aloisio; Gama, Juan Pablo] IMPA, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Araujo, Aloisio] FGV EPGE Brazilian Sch Econ & Finance, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Chateauneuf, Alain] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Chateauneuf, Alain] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Novinski, Rodrigo] Fac Ibmec RJ, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Instituto Nacional de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA); IPAG Business School; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Faculdade de Economia e Financas do Ibmec,"Araujo, A (通讯作者)，IMPA, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;Araujo, A (通讯作者)，FGV EPGE Brazilian Sch Econ & Finance, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",aloisio@impa.br; Alain.Chateauneuf@univ-paris1.fr; jpgamat@impa.br; rodrigo.novinski@ibmecrj.br,,,CAPES; CNPq; FAPERJ; IMPA from the Ciencias sem Fronteiras fellowship; IMPA from Brazilian-French Network in Mathematics,CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); FAPERJ(Fundacao Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio De Janeiro (FAPERJ)); IMPA from the Ciencias sem Fronteiras fellowship; IMPA from Brazilian-French Network in Mathematics,"We thank participants at the 10th Annual Cowles GE 2014 Conference, the 13th SAET 2013 Conference, EEA-ESEM 2014, IWGTS 2014, EWGET 2014, LACEA-LAMES 2014, the 15th SAET 2015 Conference, and the 11th World Congress of the Econometric Society for comments.

These drugs reduce low-density lipid cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk, but their cost effectiveness has been questioned. We searched Medline and Embase for economic evaluations in any language at any time. Studies were included if they analysed any PCSK9 inhibitor compared with either statin alone or in combination with ezetimibe or any other therapy considered standard prior to the introduction of PCSK9 inhibitors. We found ten full health economic evaluations of PCSK9 inhibitors, two from Europe and eight from the United States (US). Six of the eight from the US were from two different consortia that analysed PCSK9 inhibitors at different stages through the development of evidence. All studies generally reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios above suggested thresholds for cost effectiveness, except one study from Spain. The results of this review indicate that PCSK9 inhibitors in general are not cost effective at the current prices, but lower prices may change the results.","[Korman, Max J.] Minist Local Govt & Modernisat, Oslo, Norway; [Retterstol, Kjetil] Univ Oslo, Dept Nutr, Oslo, Norway; [Retterstol, Kjetil] Oslo Univ Hosp, Lipid Clin, Oslo, Norway; [Kristiansen, Ivar Sonbo; Wisloff, Torbjorn] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Wisloff, Torbjorn] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol & Modelling, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Wisloff, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Management & Hlth Econ, Oslo, Norway.;Wisloff, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol & Modelling, Oslo, Norway.",twisloff@gmail.com,"Kristiansen, Ivar Sonbo/JXN-7976-2024; Wisløff, Torbjørn/AFM-8289-2022","Wisløff, Torbjørn/0000-0002-7539-082X",,,,,29,18,18,1,9,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,SEP,2018,36.0,9,,,,,1031,1041,,10.1007/s40273-018-0671-0,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GO4QV,29777433.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439998500001,0

Our findings show the importance of treating the evaluation of alternative DS as a comprehensive and integrated problem by including all sources of income - including pensions, taxes and government transfers.

The first test is proposed for the case where the regression function is integrable, which fills a gap in the literature, and the second test, which nests the first one, deals with regression functions in a quite large function space that is sufficient for both theoretical and practical use. As a starting point of our asymptotic theory, the first test is studied initially and then the theory is extended to the second test. Endogeneity in two general forms is allowed in the models to be tested. The finite sample performance of the tests is examined through several simulated examples. Our experience generally shows that the proposed tests are easily implementable and also have stable sizes and good power properties even when the 'distance' between the null hypothesis and a sequence of local alternatives is asymptotically negligible.","[Dong, Chaohua] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jiti] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Monash University,"Gao, JT (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",jiti.gao@monash.edu,,"Gao, Jiti/0000-0002-4261-0021","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71671143]; Australian Research Council [DP150101012, DP170104421]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors acknowledge the constructive comments from Professor Peter Phillips, the Co-Editor and three referees on the earlier versions.

In the last years regulators introduced, with the Solvency II directive, a market consistent valuation framework for determining the fair value of asset and liabilities of insurance funds. A relevant aspect is how to deal with the estimation of sovereign credit and liquidity risk, that are important components in the valuation of the majority of insurance funds, which are usually heavily invested in treasury bonds. The common practice is the adoption of the certainty equivalent approach (CEQ) for the risk neutral evaluation of insurance liabilities, which results in a deterministic risk adjustment of the securities cash flows. In this paper, we propose an arbitrage free stochastic model for interest rate, credit and liquidity risks, that takes into account the dependences between different government bond issuers. We test the impact of the common practice against our proposed model, via Monte Carlo simulations. We conclude that in the estimation of options whose pay-off is determined by statutory accounting rules, which is often the case for European traditional with-profit insurance products, the deterministic adjustment for risk of the securities cash flows is not appropriate, and that a more complete model such as the one described in this article is a viable and sensible alternative in the context of market consistent evaluations.

The method consists in moving the parameters through change of measure, which we call a weak perturbation, decoupling the usual wealth equation from the varying parameters. By rewriting the maximization problem in terms of a convex-analytical support function of a weakly-compact set, crucially leveraging on the work (Backhoff and Fontbona in SIAM J Financ Math 7(1): 70103, 2016), the previous formulation let us prove the Hadamard directional differentiability of the value function with respect to the market price of risk, the drift and interest rate parameters, as well as for volatility matrices under a stability condition on their Kernel, and derive explicit expressions for the directional derivatives. We contrast our proposed weak perturbations against what we call strong perturbations, where the wealth equation is directly influenced by the changing parameters. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that both points of view generally yield different sensitivities unless e.g. if initial parameters and their perturbations are deterministic.","[Veraguas, Julio Backhoff] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Silva, Francisco J.] Univ Limoges, Inst Rech XLIM DMI, UMR CNRS 7252, Fac Sci & Tech, F-87060 Limoges, France",Technische Universitat Wien; Universite de Limoges; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Veraguas, JB (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Stat & Math Methods Econ, Vienna, Austria.",julio.backhoff@tuwien.ac.at; francisco.silva@unilim.fr,,"Backhoff Veraguas, Julio Daniel/0000-0002-8521-9196",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [Y782-N25]; European Research Council (ERC) [FA506041]; Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; Berlin Mathematical School; Gaspar Monge Program for Optimization and Operation Research (PGMO),Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin; Berlin Mathematical School; Gaspar Monge Program for Optimization and Operation Research (PGMO),"Julio Backhoff Veraguas is most grateful for partial support by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under grant Y782-N25 and the European Research Council (ERC) under grant FA506041, as well as to Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin and the funding by the Berlin Mathematical School.

During the first stage, a neural-network-based generalization of the principal component analysis summarizes the information carried by the surface of log-mortality rates in a small number of latent factors. In the second step, these latent factors are forecast with an econometric model. The term structure of log-forces of mortality is next reconstructed by an inverse transformation. The neural analyzer is adjusted to French, UK and US mortality rates, over the period 1946-2000 and validated with data from 2001 to 2014.

Different network meta-analysis models have been used to analyse these different data types. Objective This aim of this article was to establish the impact of using the different models on effectiveness, costs and health utility estimates. Methods We analysed a dataset used in a recent network meta-analysis of severe hypoglycaemic events conducted to inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations regarding basal insulin choice for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. We fitted a model with a binomial likelihood reporting odds ratios (using a logit link) or hazard ratios (complementary log-log link), a model with a Poisson likelihood reporting hazard ratios and a shared-parameter model combining different types of data. We compared the results in terms of relative effects and resulting cost and disutility estimates. Results Relative treatment effects are similar regardless of which model or scale is used. Differences were seen in the probability of having an event on the baseline treatment with the logit model giving a baseline probability of 0.07, the complementary log-log 0.17 and the Poisson 0.29. These translate into differences of up to A 110 pound in the yearly cost of a hypoglycaemic event and 0.004 in disutility. Conclusion While choice of network meta-analysis model does not have a meaningful impact on relative effects for this outcome, care should be taken to ensure that the baseline probabilities used in an economic model are accurate to avoid misrepresenting costs and effects.","[Keeney, Edna; Dias, Sofia] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England; [Dawoud, Dalia] Royal Coll Physicians, Natl Guideline Ctr, London, England; [Dawoud, Dalia] Cairo Univ, Fac Pharm, Cairo, Egypt",University of Bristol; Royal College of Physicians; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Keeney, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",edna.keeney@bristol.ac.uk,"Dawoud, Dalia M/N-9741-2019; Dias, Sofia/F-1922-2010","Dawoud, Dalia M/0000-0002-2105-1937; Dias, Sofia/0000-0002-2172-0221",National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; Medical Research Council [MR/M005232/1] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/M005232/1] Funding Source: UKRI,National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This work was undertaken in part by Dalia Dawoud working at the National Guideline Centre, which received funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

The quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for lambda usually cannot be written in closed form, but using an exact result obtained earlier by the authors for its distribution function, we are able to provide a complete analysis of the properties of the estimator, and exact inference that can be based on it, in models that are balanced. This is presented first for the so-called pure model, with no regression component, but is also extended to some special cases of the more general model. We then study the much more difficult case of unbalanced models, giving analogues of some, but by no means all, of the results obtained for the balanced case earlier. In both balanced and unbalanced models, results obtained for the pure model generalize immediately to the model with group-specific regression components.","[Hillier, Grant] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England; [Martellosio, Federico] Univ Surrey, Surrey, England",University of Southampton; University of Surrey,"Hillier, G (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, CeMMAP, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.;Hillier, G (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Econ, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",ghh@soton.ac.uk,,"Martellosio, Federico/0000-0002-8537-9720; Hillier, Grant/0000-0003-3261-5766",,,,,31,6,6,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

We suggest a counter-argument to this perception in circumstances where modest levels of adverse selection lead to an increase in 'loss coverage', defined as expected losses compensated by insurance for the whole population. This happens if the shift in coverage towards higher risks under adverse selection more than offsets the fall in number of individuals insured. The possibility of this outcome depends on insurance demand elasticities for higher and lower risks. We state elasticity conditions which ensure that for any downward-sloping insurance demand functions, loss coverage when all risks are pooled at a common price is higher than under fully risk-differentiated prices. Empirical evidence suggests that these conditions may be realistic for some insurance markets. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our identification results are constructive and encompass a range of special cases with varying demands on the exogenous variation provided by instruments and the shape of the joint density of the structural errors. The most important results demonstrate identification when instruments have only limited variation. Even when instruments vary only over a small open ball, relatively mild conditions on the joint density suffice.

While buyouts are attractive in terms of value creation, they are capital intensive and expensive, particularly for firms with underfunded plans. The existing literature mainly focuses on the costs and benefits of pension buyouts. Little attention has been paid to how to capture the benefits of de-risking within a plan's financial means, especially when buyout deficits are significant. To fill this gap, we propose two options, namely a pension funding option and pension buyout option, that provide financing for both underfunded and well funded plans to cover the buyout risk premium and the pension funding deficit, if a certain threshold is reached. To increase market liquidity, we create a transparent pension funding index, calculated from observed capital market indices and publicly available mortality tables as well as pension mandatory contributions, to determine option payoffs. A simulation based pricing framework is then introduced to determine the prices of the proposed pension options. Our numerical examples show that these options are effective and economically affordable. Moreover, our sensitivity analyses demonstrate the reliability of our pricing models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In order to circumvent the unidentified parameters problem, t- statistic for the predictor in the STPR model is optimized over the Cartesian product of the spaces for the transition and threshold parameters; and to address the diculties due to persistent and endogenous predictors, the instrumental variable (IVX) method originally developed in the linear cointegration testing framework is adopted within the STPR model. Limit distribution of this statistic (i.e., sup - t(IVX) test) is shown to be nuisance parameter-free and robust to the local to unit root and endogenous regressors. Simulations show that sup - t(IVX) has good size and power properties.

Even though there is already a huge array of literature on forecasting high frequency volatility, most publications only evaluate the forecast in terms of statistical errors. In practice, this kind of analysis is only a minor indication of the actual economic significance of the forecast that has been developed. For this reason, in our approach, we also include a test of our forecast through trading an appropriate volatility derivative. As a method we use parametric and artificial intelligence models. We also combine these models in order to achieve a hybrid forecast. We report that the results of all three model types are of similar quality. However, we observe that artificial intelligence models are able to achieve these results with a shorter input time frame and the errors are uniformly lower comparing with the parametric one. Similarly, the chosen models do not appear to differ much while the analysis of trading efficiency is performed.

Recursive marginal quantization (RMQ) of the Euler scheme has recently been proposed as an efficient numerical method for evaluating functionals of solutions of stochastic differential equations. This method involves recursively quantizing the conditional marginals of the discrete-time Euler approximation of the underlying process. By generalizing this approach, we show that it is possible to perform RMQ for two higher-order schemes: the Milstein scheme and a simplified weak order 2.0 scheme. We further extend the applicability of RMQ by showing how absorption and reflection at the zero boundary may be incorporated, when necessary. To illustrate the improved accuracy of the higher-order schemes, various computations are performed using geometric Brownian motion and the constant elasticity of variance model. For both models, we provide evidence of improved weak order convergence and computational efficiency. By pricing European, Bermudan and barrier options, further evidence of improved accuracy of the higher-order schemes is demonstrated.","[McWalter, T.

Recently, Nie et al. (2011) has proposed an alternative model in which capital is immediately injected to restore the surplus level to a positive level b when the surplus falls between zero and b, and the insurer is still subject to a positive ruin probability. Inspired by the idea of randomized observations in Albrecher et al. (2011b), in this paper, we further generalize Nie et al. (2011)'s model by assuming that capital injections are only allowed at a sequence of time points with inter-capital-injection times being Erlang distributed (so that deterministic time intervals can be approximated using the Erlangization technique in Asmussen et al. (2002)). When the claim amount is distributed as a combination of exponentials, explicit formulas for the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function (Gerber and Shiu, 1998) and the expected total discounted cost of capital injections before ruin are obtained. The derivations rely on a resolvent density associated with an Erlang random variable, which is shown to admit an explicit expression that is of independent interest as well.

Decision makers need to be aware of risks associated with such health technology assessment (HTA) decisions and the potential to manage this risk through managed entry agreements (MEAs). This work develops methods for quantifying risk associated with specific MEAs and for clearly communicating this to decision makers. We develop the 'HTA risk analysis chart', in which we present the payer strategy and uncertainty burden (P-SUB) as a measure of overall risk. The P-SUB consists of the payer uncertainty burden (PUB), the risk stemming from decision uncertainty as to which is the truly optimal technology from the relevant set of technologies, and the payer strategy burden (PSB), the additional risk of approving a technology that is not expected to be optimal. We demonstrate the approach using three recent technology appraisals from the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), each of which considered a price-based MEA. The HTA risk analysis chart was calculated using results from standard probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In all three HTAs, the new interventions were associated with substantial risk as measured by the P-SUB. For one of these technologies, the P-SUB was reduced to zero with the proposed price reduction, making this intervention cost effective with near complete certainty. For the other two, the risk reduced substantially with a much reduced PSB and a slightly increased PUB. The HTA risk analysis chart shows the risk that the healthcare payer incurs under unresolved decision uncertainty and when considering recommending a technology that is not expected to be optimal given current evidence. This allows the simultaneous consideration of financial and data-collection MEA schemes in an easily understood format. The use of HTA risk analysis charts will help to ensure that MEAs are considered within a standard utility-maximising health economic decision-making framework.","[Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Strong, Mark; Brennan, Alan; Wailoo, Allan J.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",Maastricht University; University of Sheffield,"Grimm, SE (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Maastricht, Netherlands.",sabine.grimm@mumc.nl,"Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009; Strong, Mark/A-4638-2010; Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/HSE-7402-2023","Strong, Mark/0000-0003-1486-8233; Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/0000-0002-2175-7999; Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Wailoo, Allan/0000-0002-9324-1617","NICE through its Decision Support Unit; National Institute for Health Research [PDF-2012-05-258]; MRC [G0601721, MR/J000434/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0601721, MR/J000434/1] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [PDF-2012-05-258] Funding Source: researchfish",NICE through its Decision Support Unit; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Financial support for this study was provided by NICE through its Decision Support Unit.

As a result, they should no longer be interpreted as probability distributions over actions, but rather be thought of as allocations of one unit of resource to actions and the payoff effect on each action is proportional to the square root of the amount of resource allocated to that action. The new definition generates a number of interesting consequences. We first characterize the sufficient and necessary condition under which a two-player unit-sphere game has a Nash equilibrium. The characterization reduces solving a unit-sphere game to finding all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the product matrix of individual payoff matrices. For any unit-sphere game with non-negative payoff matrices, there always exists a unique Nash equilibrium; furthermore, the unique equilibrium is efficiently reachable via Cournot adjustment. In addition, we show that any equilibrium in positive unit-sphere games corresponds to approximate equilibria in the corresponding normal-form games. Analogous but weaker results are obtained in n-player unit-sphere games.","[Tang, Pingzhong; Zhang, Hanrui] Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University,"Tang, PZ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, IIIS, Beijing, Peoples R China.",kenshinping@gmail.com; segtree@gmail.com,,,"National Basic Research Program of China [2011CBA00300, 2011CBA00301]; Natural Science Foundation of China [61033001, 61361136003, 61303077, 61561146398]; Tsinghua Initiative Scientific Research Grant; China Youth 1000-talent program",National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Tsinghua Initiative Scientific Research Grant; China Youth 1000-talent program,"We are grateful to Andrew Yao for helpful discussions.

It is motivated by the gravity equation used in international trade, where important papers use binary response models with fixed effects for both importing and exporting countries. Econometric theory has mostly focused on the estimation of single fixed effects models. This paper investigates whether existing methods can be modified to eliminate multiple fixed effects for two specific models in which the incidental parameter problem has already been solved in the presence of a single fixed effect. We find that it is possible to generalize the conditional maximum likelihood approach to include two fixed effects for the logit. Monte Carlo simulations show that the conditional logit estimator presented in this paper is less biased than other logit estimators without sacrificing on precision. This superiority is emphasized in small samples. An application to trade data using the logit estimator further highlights the importance of properly accounting for two fixed effects.","[Charbonneau, Karyne B.] Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Charbonneau, KB (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",kcharbonneau@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,27,26,32,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

RM is broadly defined as incorporating and measuring effects of constraints on physical resources (e.g. beds, doctors, nurses) in HTA models. Systematic literature searches were conducted in academic databases (JSTOR, SAGE, SPRINGER, SCOPUS, IEEE, Science Direct, PubMed, EMBASE) and grey literature (Google Scholar, NHS journal library), enhanced by manual searchers (i.e. reference list checking, citation searching and hand-searching techniques). The search strategy yielded 4117 potentially relevant citations. Following the screening and manual searches, ten articles were included. Reviewing these articles provided insights into the applications of RM: firstly, different types of economic analyses, model settings, RM and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) outcomes were identified. Secondly, variation in the characteristics of the constraints such as types and nature of constraints and sources of data for the constraints were identified. Thirdly, it was found that including the effects of constraints caused the CEA results to change in these articles. The review found that DES proved to be an effective technique for RM but there were only a small number of studies applied in HTA. However, these studies showed the important consequences of modelling physical constraints and point to the need for a framework to be developed to guide future applications of this approach.","[Salleh, Syed; Thokala, Praveen; Brennan, Alan; Hughes, Ruby; Dixon, Simon] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Salleh, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",SSAbdulRahman1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009","Abdul Rahman, Syed Salleh/0000-0001-9661-7125; Hughes, Ruby/0000-0001-7764-5331; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366; Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009",Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA),Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA),This work was supported by the Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA).,,47,13,13,0,30,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,OCT,2017,35.0,10,,,,,989,1006,,10.1007/s40273-017-0533-1,0.0,,,18,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FH7AR,28674845.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411333800003,0

Quantifying the cost of relapse is central to the evaluation of the cost effectiveness of treating schizophrenia. Objectives We aimed to undertake a comprehensive search of the available literature on the cost of relapse. Methods We performed a search on multiple databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Health Management Information Consortium) for any study reporting a cost of relapse or data from which such a cost could be calculated. Costs are reported in 2015 international dollars. Results We found 16 studies reporting costs associated with relapse over a defined period of time and identified a cost associated with hospitalisation for relapse in 43 studies. Eight clinical decision analyses also provided cost estimates. Studies from the US report excess costs of relapse of $6033-$32,753 (2015 Purchasing Power Parity dollars [PPP$]) over periods of 12-15 months. European studies report excess costs of $8665-$18,676 (2015 PPP$) over periods of 6-12 months. Estimates of the cost of hospitalisation for relapse are more diverse, and associated with marked differences in typical length of stay across jurisdictions. Conclusions Wide ranges in the estimated cost of relapse may reflect differences in sample section and relapse definition as well as practice styles and differences in resource costs. Selection of the most appropriate cost estimate should be guided by the definition of relapse and the analysis setting.","[Pennington, Mark; McCrone, Paul] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Kings Hlth Econ, David Goldberg Ctr PO24, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England",University of London; King's College London,"Pennington, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Kings Hlth Econ, David Goldberg Ctr PO24, De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.",mark.w.pennington@kcl.ac.uk,"Pennington, Mark/AAS-9946-2020","Pennington, Mark/0000-0002-1392-8700; McCrone, Paul/0000-0001-7001-4502",Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,Janssen-Cilag Ltd.,"This study was funded by Janssen-Cilag Ltd.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of imposing shape restrictions to improve the performance of the NPIV estimators. We assume that the function to be estimated is monotone and consider a sieve estimator that enforces this monotonicity constraint. We define a constrained measure of ill-posedness that is relevant for the constrained estimator and show that, under a monotone IV assumption and certain other mild regularity conditions, this measure is bounded uniformly over the dimension of the sieve space. This finding is in stark contrast to the well-known result that the unconstrained sieve measure of ill-posedness that is relevant for the unconstrained estimator grows to infinity with the dimension of the sieve space. Based on this result, we derive a novel non-asymptotic error bound for the constrained estimator. The bound gives a set of data-generating processes for which the monotonicity constraint has a particularly strong regularization effect and considerably improves the performance of the estimator. The form of the bound implies that the regularization effect can be strong even in large samples and even if the function to be estimated is steep, particularly so if the NPIV model is severely ill-posed. Our simulation study confirms these findings and reveals the potential for large performance gains from imposing the monotonicity constraint.","[Chetverikov, Denis] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Wilhelm, Daniel] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of London; University College London,"Chetverikov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",chetverikov@econ.ucla.edu; d.wilhelm@ucl.ac.uk,,"Wilhelm, Daniel/0000-0002-5158-4953","ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice at IFS [RES-589-28-0001]; European Research Council [ERC-2014-CoG-646917-ROMIA, ERC-2015-CoG-682349]; ESRC [ES/P008909/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I034021/1, ES/P008909/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice at IFS(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Alex Belloni, Richard Blundell, Stephane Bonhomme, Moshe Buchinsky, Matias Cattaneo, Xiaohong Chen, Victor Chernozhukov, Andrew Chesher, Joachim Freyberger, Jerry Hausman, Jinyong Hahn, Joel Horowitz, Dennis Kristensen, Simon Lee, Zhipeng Liao, Rosa Matzkin, Eric Mbakop, Matthew Kahn, Ulrich Muller, Whitney Newey, Markus Reiss, Andres Santos, Susanne Schennach, Azeem Shaikh, Vladimir Spokoiny, and three referees for useful comments and discussions.

In the area of public policy, they help policymakers and analysts assess how much various groups benefit from public programs, such as social security and health care. In financial markets and especially for actuaries, they are important for designing annuities and life insurance products. This paper presents a method for clustering information about differential mortality by country. The approach is then used to group mortality surfaces for European Union (EU) countries. The aim of this paper is to measure between -group inequality in mortality experience in EU countries through a range of mortality indicators. Additionally, the indicators permit the characterization of each group. It is important to take into account characteristics such as sex; therefore, this study differentiates between males and females in order to detect whether their patterns and characterizations are different. It is concluded that there are clear differences in mortality between the east and west of the EU that are more important than the traditional south -north division, with a significant disadvantage for Eastern Europe, and especially for males in Baltic countries. We find that the mortality indicators have evolved in all countries in such a way that the gap between groups has been maintained, both in terms of the differences in mortality levels and variability.

It was designed to overcome perceived limitations associated with existing preference-based instruments, where the explicit focus on health-related aspects of quality of life may result in the failure to capture fully the broader benefits of interventions and treatments that go beyond health. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which preference-based health-related quality of life (HRQoL) instruments are able to capture aspects of capability wellbeing, as measured by the ICECAP-A. Methods Using data from the Multi Instrument Comparison project, pairwise exploratory factor analyses were conducted to compare the ICECAP-A with five preference-based HRQoL instruments [15D, Assessment of Quality of Life 8-dimension (AQoL-8D), EQ-5D-5L, Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3), and SF-6D]. Results Data from 6756 individuals were used in the analyses. The ICECAP-A provides information above that garnered from most commonly used preference-based HRQoL instruments. The exception was the AQoL-8D; more common factors were identified between the ICECAP-A and AQoL-8D compared with the other pairwise analyses. Conclusion Further investigations are needed to explore the extent and potential implications of 'double counting' when applying the ICECAP-A alongside health-related preference-based instruments.","[Engel, Lidia; Lear, Scott A.; Whitehurst, David G.

Payoffs depend on direct links, but also link externalities. Players meet sequentially at random, myopically updating their links. Under mild assumptions, the network formation process is a potential game and converges to an exponential random graph model (ERGM), generating directed dense networks. I provide new identification results for ERGMs in large networks: if link externalities are nonnegative, the ERGM is asymptotically indistinguishable from an Erds-Renyi model with independent links. We can identify the parameters only when at least one of the externalities is negative and sufficiently large. However, the standard estimation methods for ERGMs can have exponentially slow convergence, even when the model has asymptotically independent links. I thus estimate parameters using a Bayesian MCMC method. When the parameters are identifiable, I show evidence that the estimation algorithm converges in almost quadratic time.","[Mele, Angelo] Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, 100 Int Dr, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Mele, A (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Carey Business Sch, 100 Int Dr, Baltimore, MD 21202 USA.",angelo.mele@jhu.edu,"Mele, Angelo/AAE-8207-2022; Mele, Angelo/HIK-2064-2022","Mele, Angelo/0000-0003-2890-6042;",R.

The interaction is bidirectional: economy-wide outcomes determine individual aspirations, which in turn determine investment incentives and social outcomes. Thus aspirations, income, and the distribution of income evolve jointly. When capital stocks lie in some compact set, steady state distributions must exhibit inequality and are typically clustered around local poles. When sustained growth is possible, initial histories matter. Either there is convergence to an equal distribution (with growth) or there is perennial relative divergence across clusters, with within-cluster convergence. A central feature that drives these results is that aspirations that are moderately above an individual's current standard of living tend to encourage investment, while still higher aspirations may lead to frustration.","[Genicot, Garance] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Ray, Debraj] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Ray, Debraj] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Georgetown University; New York University; University of Warwick,"Genicot, G (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",gg58@georgetown.edu; debraj.ray@nyu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1261560, SES-1629370]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1629370] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Thanks to Luis Felipe Lopez-Calva, Joan Esteban, Kalle Moene, Alois Stutzer, Jean Tirole, and four anonymous referees, as well as seminar participants at Cambridge, ColMex, EIEF, LAMES 2008, Maryland, Oxford, Washington University in St. Louis, Toulouse, Berlin, ThReD conferences at LSE and Brussels, the World Bank (DECRG and Conference on Aspirations, Poverty and Inequality), and the 2016 Laffont Lecture of the Econometric Society.

Various pharmacological treatments are effective in the management and prevention of acute episodes of BD. In an era of tighter healthcare budgets and a need for more efficient use of resources, several economic evaluations have evaluated the cost effectiveness of treatments for BD. Objective The aim of this study was to systematically review and appraise published economic evaluations of pharmacological interventions for BD. Methods A systematic search combining search terms specific to BD with a health economics search filter was conducted on six bibliographic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, HTA, NHS EED, CENTRAL) in order to identify trial- or model-based full economic evaluations of pharmacological treatments of any phase of the disorder that were published between 1 January 1990 and 18 December 2015. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) checklist, and synthesised in a narrative way. Results The review included 19 economic studies, which varied with regard to the type and number of interventions assessed, the study design, the phase of treatment (acute or maintenance), the source of efficacy data and the method for evidence synthesis, the outcome measures, the time horizon and the countries/settings in which the studies were conducted. The study quality was variable but the majority of studies were of high or fair quality. Conclusion Pharmacological interventions are cost effective, compared with no treatment, in the management of BD, both in the acute and maintenance phases. However, it is difficult to draw safe conclusions on the relative cost effectiveness between drugs due to differences across studies and limitations characterising many of them. Future economic evaluations need to consider the whole range of treatment options available for the management of BD and adopt appropriate methods for evidence synthesis and economic modelling, to explore more robustly the relative cost effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for people with BD.","[Mavranezouli, Ifigeneia] UCL, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, CORE, NGA, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England; [Lokkerbol, Joran] Trimbos Inst, Ctr Econ Evaluat, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Lokkerbol, Joran] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Rob Giel Res Ctr, Groningen, Netherlands",University of London; University College London; Trimbos Institute; University of Groningen,"Mavranezouli, I (通讯作者)，UCL, Res Dept Clin Educ & Hlth Psychol, CORE, NGA, 1-19 Torrington Pl, London WC1E 7HB, England.",i.mavranezouli@ucl.ac.uk,"MAVRANEZOULI, IFIGENEIA/C-2430-2008","MAVRANEZOULI, IFIGENEIA/0000-0001-9095-3566",,,,,75,6,8,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2017,35.0,3,,,,,271,296,,10.1007/s40273-016-0473-1,0.0,,,26,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EL0WL,28000158.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394342400002,0

Expected shortfall (ES) is a tail risk measure, now recommended by the Basel Committee, involving a conditional expectation that can be semi-parametrically estimated via an asymmetric sum of squares function. The conditional autoregressive expectile class of model, used to implicitly model ES, has been extended to allow the intra-day range, not just the daily return, as an input. This model class is here further extended to incorporate information on realized measures of volatility, including realized variance and realized range (RR), as well as scaled and smoothed versions of these. An asymmetric Gaussian density error formulation allows a likelihood that leads to direct estimation and one-step-ahead forecasts of quantiles and expectiles, and subsequently of ES. A Bayesian adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo method is developed and employed for estimation and forecasting. In an empirical study forecasting daily tail risk measures in six financial market return series, over a seven-year period, models employing the RR generate the most accurate tail risk forecasts, compared to models employing other realized measures as well as to a range of well-known competitors.","[Gerlach, Richard; Wang, Chao] Univ Sydney, Discipline Business Analyt, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Walpole, Declan] Commonwealth Bank Australia, Deposits & Transact Analyt, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Gerlach, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Discipline Business Analyt, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",richard.gerlach@sydney.edu.au,"Gerlach, Richard/C-3915-2011","Gerlach, Richard/0000-0002-5656-4556",,,,,47,5,7,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

This review assessed how context-specific challenges of implementing cervical cancer prevention strategies in LMICs were accounted for in existing cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) models of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, EconLit, Web of Science, and the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health (CEA) Registry were searched for studies published from 2006 to 2015. A descriptive, narrative, and interpretative synthesis of data was undertaken. Of the 33 studies included in the review, the majority acknowledged cost per vaccinated girl (CVG) (26 studies) and vaccine coverage rate (21 studies) as particular challenges for LMICs, while nine studies identified screening coverage rate as a challenge. Most of the studies estimated CVG as a composite of different cost items. However, the basis for the items within this composite cost was unclear. The majority used an assumption rather than an observed rate to represent screening and vaccination coverage rates. CVG, vaccine coverage and screening coverage were shown by some studies through sensitivity analyses to reverse the conclusions regarding cost-effectiveness, thereby significantly affecting policy recommendations. While many studies recognized aspects of the particular challenges of HPV vaccination in LMICs, greater efforts need to be made in adapting models to account for these challenges. These include adapting costings of HPV vaccine delivery from other countries, learning from the outcomes of cervical cancer screening programmes in the same geographical region, and taking into account the country's previous experience with other vaccination programmes.","[Ekwunife, Obinna I.; Lhachimi, Stefan K.] Univ Bremen, Leibniz Inst Prevent Res & Epidemiol, Dept Prevent & Evaluat, Collaborat Res Grp Evidence Based Publ Hlth,BIPS, Achterstr 30, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Ekwunife, Obinna I.] Nnamdi Azikiwe Univ, Dept Clin Pharm & Pharm Management, Awka, Nigeria; [O'Mahony, James F.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin, Ireland; [Grote, Andreas Gerber] Univ Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Cologne, Germany; [Mosch, Christoph] Univ Witten Herdecke, Inst Res Operat Med IFOM, Witten, Germany; [Grote, Andreas Gerber] ZHAW, Dept Hlth, Winterthur, Switzerland; [Paeck, Tatjana; Lhachimi, Stefan K.] Univ Bremen, Inst Publ Hlth & Nursing Res, IPP, Hlth Sci Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research & Epidemiology (BIPS); University of Bremen; Trinity College Dublin; University of Cologne; Witten Herdecke University; Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Max Planck Society; University of Bremen,"Ekwunife, OI (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Leibniz Inst Prevent Res & Epidemiol, Dept Prevent & Evaluat, Collaborat Res Grp Evidence Based Publ Hlth,BIPS, Achterstr 30, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.;Ekwunife, OI (通讯作者)，Nnamdi Azikiwe Univ, Dept Clin Pharm & Pharm Management, Awka, Nigeria.",ekwunife@uni-bremen.de; jfomahon@tcd.ie; mail@andreas.gerber.de; Christoph.Mosch@uni-wh.de; paeck@bips.uni-bremen.de; Stefan.Lhachimi@uni-bremen.de,"Lhachimi, Stefan K/D-9227-2014; Ekwunife, Obinna Ikechukwu/AAZ-5595-2020","Lhachimi, Stefan K/0000-0001-8597-0935; Ekwunife, Obinna/0000-0003-0879-3861; O'Mahony, James/0000-0003-3414-7388",Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"OE, JFOM, AGG, CM, TP and SKL declare no competing interests.

Suggested two-factor outranking approach decreases the compensating effect and provides clear determination of lagging regions by the hybrid MCDM methods. To define well-grounded lagging cluster of regions the combination of MCDM and PrincipalComponent Analysis is proposed. The ranks obtained by the hybrid versions of MCDM methods according to the Kendall's Tau coefficient are found to be almost identical. However the VIKOR method appeared to be more distinctive and less sensitive one, producing more incomparable alternatives sharing the same rank.

This study aims to give a general overview of COI studies for schizophrenia and to compare the societal cost of schizophrenia across countries. It also aims to identify the main cost components of schizophrenia and factors associated with higher societal cost to improve the quality and reporting of COI studies for schizophrenia. We performed an electronic search on multiple databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Health Management Information Consortium [HMIC] and the System for Information on Grey Literature [openSIGLE]) to identify COI studies of schizophrenia published between 1996 and 2016. The primary outcome of this review was societal cost per schizophrenia patient, by cost component. All costs were converted to $US, year 2015 values. We included 19 studies in this review. The annual societal cost per patient varied from $US5818 in Thailand to $US94,587 in Norway; whereas the lifetime societal cost per patient was estimated to be $US988,264 in Australia (all year 2015 values). The main cost drivers were direct healthcare costs and productivity losses. Factors associated with higher individual costs included patient demographics, severity of disease and methods used to calculate the costs of productivity losses and comorbidities. This review highlights the large economic burden of schizophrenia. The magnitude of the cost estimates differs considerably across countries, which might be caused by different economic conditions and healthcare systems and widespread methodological heterogeneity among COI studies. Proposed recommendations based on this review can be used to improve the consistency and comparability of COI studies for schizophrenia.","[Jin, Huajie; Mosweu, Iris] Kings Coll London, David Goldberg Ctr, KHE, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Box 024,De Crespigny Pk,Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, England",University of London; King's College London,"Jin, HJ (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, David Goldberg Ctr, KHE, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Box 024,De Crespigny Pk,Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AF, England.",huajie.jin@kcl.ac.uk,"Mosweu, Iris/P-4391-2016; Jin, Huajie/J-1332-2014","Mosweu, Iris/0000-0001-6797-2478; Jin, Huajie/0000-0002-3872-3998",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London; King's College London,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); King's College London,HJ receives salary support from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Mental Health Biomedical Research Centre at South London.

Under a uniform condition on their marginal utilities, convergence of value functions, optimal payoffs, and optimal investment strategies are obtained, their rate of convergence is also determined. Stability of utility-based pricing is studied as an application. Second, a sequence of utilities defined on R+ converges to the exponential utility after shifting and scaling. Their associated optimal strategies, after appropriate scaling, converge to the optimal strategy for the exponential hedging problem. This complements Theorem 3.2 in [Nutz, M.

This behavior has traditionally been modeled via unit roots or fractional Brownian motion and explained via aggregation of heterogeneous processes, nonlinearity, learning dynamics, regime switching, or structural breaks. This paper identifies a different and complementary mechanism for long-memory generation by showing that it can naturally arise when a large number of simple linear homogeneous economic subsystems with short memory are interconnected to form a network such that the outputs of the subsystems are fed into the inputs of others. This networking picture yields a type of aggregation that is not merely additive, resulting in a collective behavior that is richer than that of individual subsystems. Interestingly, the long-memory behavior is found to be almost entirely determined by the geometry of the network, while being relatively insensitive to the specific behavior of individual agents.","[Schennach, Susanne M.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Schennach, SM (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",smschenn@brown.edu,,,"NSF [SES-1061263/1156347, SES-1357401, SES-1659334]",NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"The author would like to thank Eric Renault, Adam McCloskey, Florian Gunsilius, seminar participants at Cemmap/UCL, at the University of Cambridge, and at the Harvard/MIT Econometrics seminar, and anonymous referees for useful comments, and acknowledges support from NSF Grants SES-1061263/1156347, SES-1357401, and SES-1659334.",,54,5,5,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,NOV,2018,86.0,6,,,,,2221,2248,,10.3982/ECTA11930,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,HD9DA,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000452859800010,0

This study aimed to quantify and compare the conditional relative importance of the attributes of RCC treatments to patients and physicians in the United States. Methods Patients with RCC and physicians who treat RCC completed an online discrete-choice experiment survey with a fractional factorial D-optimal experimental design. In a series of 12 questions, respondents chose between two hypothetical treatments defined in terms of six attributes: progression-free survival (PFS), probability of living >= 3 years (PL3Y), skin reactions, severity of fatigue, mode of administration, and monthly co-payment. Treatment choices were analyzed using a random-parameters logit model to estimate relative preference weights for the attribute levels and conditional relative attribute importance (i.e. the importance of an attribute relative to all other attributes conditional on the range of levels of that attribute). Results Overall, 201 patients and 142 physicians completed the survey. For both patients and physicians, PL3Y was the attribute with the greatest and statistically significant conditional relative importance. Estimates of the conditional relative importance of PFS, skin reactions, and mode of administration for patients, and for PFS and mode of administration for physicians, were not statistically significant. The preferences for improvements in PFS were independent of the level of PL3Y for both patients and physicians. Conditional relative attribute importance varied by patient disease stage. Conclusions Patients and physicians indicated that PL3Y was the most important treatment attribute and was significantly more important than PFS. Importance rankings differed between physicians and patients and between all patients and those with advanced/metastatic disease.","[Gonzalez, Juan Marcos] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Doan, Justin] Bristol Myers Squibb, 3551 Lawrence Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Gebben, David J.; Boeri, Marco] RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Fishman, Mayer] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA",Duke University; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Research Triangle Institute; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute,"Boeri, M (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",mboeri@rti.org,"Fishman, Mayer/AAG-6640-2021; Boeri, Marco/D-9656-2011","Gonzalez, Juan Marcos/0000-0002-5386-0907; Boeri, Marco/0000-0001-7346-2132",Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),"Kimberly Moon of RTI Health Solutions was responsible for overall project management for this study.

NETs can arise in various parts of the body and have distinct pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and survival compared to other neoplasms. The magnitude of the economic burden of NETs is largely unknown. This study aimed to estimate the cost of illness for NETs among elderly patients based on a large amount of observational data. Methods We estimated the direct medical costs by phase of care using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data, including claims from January 1, 2002 through to December 31, 2012. Patients' care was categorized into three phases: initial phase (first year after diagnosis), terminal phase (last year of life), and continuing phase (the period between). We estimated the cost of illness by calculating the difference in medical costs between NET patients and a matched sample from a non-cancer control group. Results Our study sample included 8409 elderly NET patients in the initial phase, 9218 patients in the continuing phase, and 7897 in the terminal phase. The mean cost of care for the initial phase was $46,462 in 2016 US dollars; mean cost of care for the terminal phase with a cancer-related death was $122,702; while the mean cost of care for the continuing phase was $10,457. The mean 5-year cost was $87,079. Conclusions This population-based study showed that NET patients had substantial continuing phase costs and 5-year costs. Among elderly NET patients, those with pancreas as the primary cancer site had the highest costs.","[Shen, Chan; Gu, Dian; Chu, Yiyi; Xu, Ying; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Serv Res, 1400 Pressler St,Unit 1444, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Shen, Chan; Zhou, Shouhao] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Dasari, Arvind; Halperin, Daniel; Yao, James C.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Gastrointestinal Med Oncol, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Fu, Shuangshuang] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Dept Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston,"Shen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Hlth Serv Res, 1400 Pressler St,Unit 1444, Houston, TX 77030 USA.;Shen, C (通讯作者)，Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",cshen@mdanderson.org,"Halperin, Daniel M/I-1944-2013","Halperin, Daniel M/0000-0002-3113-930X; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina/0000-0001-7290-3864",Ipsen,Ipsen(Ipsen),This work was supported in part by Ipsen.

We consider the statistical significance of individual covariates one at a time, while taking full account of the multiple testing nature of the inferential problem involved. We refer to the proposed method as One Covariate at a Time Multiple Testing (OCMT) procedure, and use ideas from the multiple testing literature to control the probability of selecting the approximating model, the false positive rate, and the false discovery rate. OCMT is easy to interpret, relates to classical statistical analysis, is valid under general assumptions, is faster to compute, and performs well in small samples. The usefulness of OCMT is also illustrated by an empirical application to forecasting U.S. output growth and inflation.","[Chudik, A.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Kapetanios, G.] Kings Coll London, London, England; [Pesaran, M.

The MTCov is the second multivariate tail conditional moment around the MTCE, the multivariate tail conditional expectation (MTCE) risk measure. Although MTCE was recently introduced in Landsman et al. (2016a), in this paper we essentially generalize it, allowing for quantile levels to obtain the different values corresponded to each risk. The MTCov measure, which is also defined for the set of different quantile levels, allows us to investigate more deeply the tail of multivariate distributions, since it focuses on the variance-covariance dependence structure of a system of dependent risks. As a natural extension, we also introduced the multivariate tail correlation matrix (MTCorr). The properties of this risk measure are explored and its explicit closed-form expression is derived for the elliptical family of distributions. As a special case, we consider the normal, Student-t and Laplace distributions, prevalent in actuarial science and finance. The results are illustrated numerically with data of some stock returns.

When all s passes are used, no player may ever 'pass' again. A pass option can be used at any time, up to the penultimate move, but cannot be used at the end of the game. The player who cannot make a move wins the game. The aim is to determine the game values of the positions of MLNim for all integers and and .

Treatment options include dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, fibre supplements, stool softeners, and laxatives. Objective We undertook this systematic review to comprehensively evaluate the cost effectiveness of treatments for CC. Methods We searched ten common databases to identify economic evaluations published to 13 June 2017. Abstract and full-text review were completed in duplicate. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria. Data extracted included costs and outcomes of treatments for CC and cost-effectiveness methods. A narrative synthesis was completed. Results From the 4338 unique citations identified, 79 proceeded to full-text review, with 10 studies forming the final dataset. Eight different definitions of CC were used to define the study populations. Study designs used were decision-tree models (4), Markov model (1), and retrospective (1) and prospective (4) studies. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were reported in five studies; other outcomes included, discontinuation of laxative treatment and frequency of bowel movements. The majority of studies stated that their results were from a payer perspective; however, some of these studies only considered treatment costs, a subset of costs included in the payer perspective. Lifestyle advice, dietary treatments and abdominal massage were each compared with current care with laxatives, while polyethylene glycol (PEG) and senna-fibre combination were each compared with lactulose. Two studies compared newer treatments in patients who had not responded to laxatives: prucalopride was compared with continuing laxatives, and linaclotide was compared with lubiprostone. All of the interventions were reported by the study authors to be cost effective, with the exception of abdominal massage. Conclusions A consistent definition of CC is needed and the QALY should be used to capture the diverse symptoms of CC. Further analysis is needed comparing all available treatments for patients who have not responded to laxatives. Overall, results from economic evaluations appear to align with stepwise practice guidelines.","[Han, Dolly; Iragorri, Nicolas; Clement, Fiona; Lorenzetti, Diane; Spackman, Eldon] Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Teaching Res & Wellness Bldg,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Han, Dolly; Iragorri, Nicolas; Clement, Fiona; Lorenzetti, Diane; Spackman, Eldon] Univ Calgary, OBrien Inst Publ Hlth, Teaching Res & Wellness Bldg,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada; [Han, Dolly; Iragorri, Nicolas; Clement, Fiona; Lorenzetti, Diane; Spackman, Eldon] Univ Calgary, Hlth Technol Assessment Unit, Community Hlth Sci, Teaching Res & Wellness Bldg,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Spackman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Teaching Res & Wellness Bldg,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB, Canada.;Spackman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, OBrien Inst Publ Hlth, Teaching Res & Wellness Bldg,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.;Spackman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Hlth Technol Assessment Unit, Community Hlth Sci, Teaching Res & Wellness Bldg,3280 Hosp Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.",eldon.spackman@ucalgary.ca,,"Spackman, David Eldon/0000-0001-8558-5973",,,,,27,14,17,0,27,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2018,36.0,4,,,,,435,449,,10.1007/s40273-018-0609-6,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY5UL,29352437.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426901000006,0

Using a dynamic programming approach, we determine the leading-order expansions of long-term growth rates and explicitly construct strategies that are optimal at the leading order. We further analyze the asymptotic performance of Morton-Pliska strategies in settings with proportional transaction costs.

We characterize the contraction core on the set of balanced cooperative games with transferable utility by four axioms: the two classic axioms of non-emptiness and individual rationality, a superadditivity principle and a weak version of a new axiom of consistency.","[Gonzalez, Stephane] Univ Lyon, UJM St Etienne, CNRS, GATE L SE UMR 5824, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Lardon, Aymeric] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Lardon, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",stephane.gonzalez@univ-st-etienne.fr; aymeric.lardon@unice.fr,,,"Programme Avenir Lyon Saint- Etienne of Universite de Lyon, within the program Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-IDEX-0007]","Programme Avenir Lyon Saint- Etienne of Universite de Lyon, within the program Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This work was supported by the Programme Avenir Lyon Saint- Etienne of Universite de Lyon, within the program Investissements d'Avenir (ANR-11-IDEX-0007).",,30,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

As our main behavioral assumption, we postulate that agents follow social learning rules that satisfy imperfect recall, according to which they treat the current beliefs of their neighbors as sufficient statistics for the entire history of their observations. We augment this assumption with various restrictions on how agents process the information provided by their neighbors and obtain representation theorems for the corresponding learning rules (including the canonical model of DeGroot). We then obtain general long-run learning results that are not tied to the learning rules' specific functional forms, thus identifying the fundamental forces that lead to learning, non-learning, and mislearning in social networks. Our results illustrate that, in the presence of imperfect recall, long-run aggregation of information is closely linked to (i) the rate at which agents discount their neighbors' information over time, (ii) the curvature of agents' social learning rules, and (iii) whether their initial tendencies are amplified or moderated as a result of social interactions.","[Molavi, Pooya] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Jadbabaie, Ali] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Northwestern University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Molavi, P (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",mpooya@mit.edu; alirezat@kellogg.northwestern.edu; jadbabai@mit.edu,"Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza/KCX-9521-2024; Molavi, Pooya/KCX-9445-2024","Tahbaz-Salehi, Alireza/0000-0002-6860-1836; Molavi, Pooya/0000-0002-1866-9365",Army Research Office (MURI) [W911NF-12-1-0509],Army Research Office (MURI)(MURI),"An earlier draft of this paper was circulated under the title Foundations of non-Bayesian Social Learning.

We consider four contracts, three of which were introduced in Zhang (2013) for a geometric Brownian motion. The first one is an insurance contract where the protection buyer pays a constant premium until the drawdown of fixed size of log-returns occurs. In return he/she receives a certain insured amount at the drawdown epoch. The next insurance contract provides protection from any specified drawdown with a drawup contingency. This contract expires early if a certain fixed drawup event occurs prior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of the previous ones by an additional cancellation feature which allows the investor to terminate the contract earlier. We focus on two problems: calculating the fair premium p for the basic contracts and identifying the optimal stopping rule for the policies with the cancellation feature. To do this we solve some two-sided exit problems related to drawdown and drawup of spectrally negative Levy processes, which is of independent mathematical interest. We also heavily rely on the theory of optimal stopping. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The COS method facilitates efficient computation of prices and hedge ratios of the GMWB riders when the underlying fund dynamics evolve under the influence of the general class of Levy processes. Formulae are derived to value the contract at each withdrawal date using a backward recursive dynamic programming algorithm. Numerical comparisons are performed with results presented in Bacinello et al. [Scand. Actuar. J., 2014, 1-20], and Luo and Shevchenko [Int. J. Financ. Eng., 2014, 2, 1-24], to confirm the accuracy of the method. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed by making comparisons with the approach presented in Bacinello et al. [op. cit.]. We find that the COS method presents highly accurate results with notably fast computational times. The valuation framework forms the basis for GMWB hedging. A local risk minimisation approach to hedging intra-withdrawal date risks is developed. A variety of risk measures are considered for minimisation in the general Levy framework. While the second moment and variance have been considered in existing literature, we show that the Value-at-Risk (VaR) may also be of interest as a risk measure to minimise risk in variable annuities portfolios.","[Alonso-Garcia, Jennifer; Ziveyi, Jonathan] UNSW Sydney, ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res CEPAR, Level 3,East Wing,223 Anzac Parade, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia; [Alonso-Garcia, Jennifer; Ziveyi, Jonathan] UNSW Sydney, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Level 6,East Wing,UNSW Business Sch Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2042, Australia; [Wood, Oliver] CommInsure, 11 Harbour St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Alonso-García, J (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res CEPAR, Level 3,East Wing,223 Anzac Parade, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia.;Alonso-García, J (通讯作者)，UNSW Sydney, Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Level 6,East Wing,UNSW Business Sch Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2042, Australia.",j.alonsogarcia@unsw.edu.au,"Wood, Oliver/HKO-7079-2023; Alonso-García, Jennifer/M-8643-2017","Alonso-García, Jennifer/0000-0003-3946-5051; Ziveyi, Jonathan/0000-0001-9029-8039",ARC Center of Excellence in Population Ageing Research [CE110001029],ARC Center of Excellence in Population Ageing Research(Australian Research Council),This project has received funding from the ARC Center of Excellence in Population Ageing Research [grant number CE110001029].,,47,23,24,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of various procedures in terms of exact coverage rates and lengths of the confidence intervals. These include the procedures of Bai (1997) based on the asymptotic distribution under a shrinking shift framework, Elliott and Muller (2007) based on inverting a test locally invariant to the magnitude of break, Eo and Morley (2015) based on inverting a likelihood ratio test, and various bootstrap procedures. On the basis of achieving an exact coverage rate that is closest to the nominal level, Elliott and Muller's (2007) approach is by far the best one. However, this comes with a very high cost in terms of the length of the confidence intervals. When the errors are serially correlated and dealing with a change in intercept or a change in the coefficient of a stationary regressor with a high signal-to-noise ratio, the length of the confidence interval increases and approaches the whole sample as the magnitude of the change increases. The same problem occurs in models with a lagged dependent variable, a common case in practice. This drawback is not present for the other methods, which have similar properties.

Finally, we illustrate our approach using real-world fund redemption data, and we discuss the goodness-of-fit of the estimated models.","[Desmettre, Sascha] KIT, Inst Stochast, Englerstr 2, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Desmettre, Sascha] Univ Kaiserslautern, Dept Math, Erwin Schrodinger Str, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [De Kock, Johan] Liberty Life Libfin Markets, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa; [Ruckdischel, Peter] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Math, POB 2503, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Seifried, Frank Thomas] Univ Trier, Dept Math 4, Univ Ring 19, D-54296 Trier, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; University of Kaiserslautern; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Universitat Trier,"Seifried, FT (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Dept Math 4, Univ Ring 19, D-54296 Trier, Germany.",seifried@uni-trier.de,,"Desmettre, Sascha/0000-0002-2084-9496","Volkswagen Foundation; DFG [RU 893/4-1, 1932]",Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),S.

We propose a framework based on cumulative prospect theory to compute and compare the trading strategies, fund risk, and managers' and investors' utilities in these two schemes analytically. The model is calibrated to the historical attrition rates of US hedge funds. We find that with reasonable parameter values, both fund managers' and investors' utilities can be improved and fund risk can be reduced simultaneously by replacing the traditional scheme (with 10% internal capital and 20% performance fee) with a first-loss scheme (with 10% first-loss capital and 30% performance fee). When the performance fee in the first-loss scheme is 40% (a current market practice), however, such substitution renders investors worse off.","[He, Xue Dong] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kou, Steven] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",Chinese University of Hong Kong; National University of Singapore,"He, XD (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Room 609,William MW Mong Engn Bldg, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xdhe@se.cuhk.edu.hk,,,Columbia University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; MOE in Singapore [MOE2014-T2-1-006]; NSFC in China [R-2015-S-005],"Columbia University; Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong); MOE in Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore); NSFC in China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors are grateful for comments from seminar and conference participants at Columbia University, Georgia State University, the INFORMS 2012 International Conference in Beijing, the Conference on Risk Pricing and Related Topics in Financial Engineering in Shanghai, the Second Texas Quantitative Finance Festival in Austin, the Midwest Finance Association 2012 Annual Meeting in New Orleans, the Eastern Finance Association 2012 Annual Meeting in Boston, the Seventh World Congress of the Bachelier Finance Society in Sydney, and the Asian Meeting of the Econometric Society in Singapore.

We associate with it a strategic market game of the kind first proposed by Lloyd S. Shapley, known as the Shapley window model. We analyze the relationship between the set of the Cournot-Nash allocations of the strategic market game and the Walras allocations of the exchange economy with which it is associated. We show, with an example, that even when atoms are countably infinite, any Cournot-Nash allocation of the game is not a Walras allocation of the underlying exchange economy. Accordingly, in the original spirit of Cournot (Recherches sur les principes math,matiques de la th,orie des richesses. Hachette, Paris, 1838), we partially replicate the mixed exchange economy by increasing the number of atoms, without affecting the atomless part, and ensuring that the measure space of agents remains finite. Our main theorem shows that any sequence of Cournot-Nash allocations of the strategic market games associated with the partial replications of the exchange economy has a limit point for each trader and that the assignment determined by these limit points is a Walrasian allocation of the original economy.","[Busetto, Francesca; Codognato, Giulio] Univ Udine, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Via Tomadini 30, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Codognato, Giulio] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France; [Ghosal, Sayantan] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Main Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Udine; Universite Paris Nanterre; University of Glasgow,"Codognato, G (通讯作者)，Univ Udine, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Via Tomadini 30, I-33100 Udine, Italy.;Codognato, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, EconomiX, 200 Ave Republ, F-92001 Nanterre, France.",giulio.codognato@uniud.it,"Ghosal, Sayantan/ABG-7926-2021",,MIUR [PRIN 20103S5RN3],"MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We would like to thank Walter Bossert, Simone Tonin, and an anonymous referee for their comments and suggestions.

The shot-noise effects are incorporated in the modeling of stock prices, implying that sudden jumps in the stock price are allowed, but their effects may gradually decline over time. The contracts are priced using the principle of equivalent utility. Under the assumption of exponential utility, we find the optimal investment strategy and show that the indifference premium solves a non-linear partial integro-differential equation (PIDE). The Feynman-Kat form solutions are derived for two special cases of the PIDE. We further discuss the problem for the asymptotic shot-noise process, and find the probabilistic representation of the indifference premium.

In particular, we address different aspects of stochastic games, namely: (1) When is a two-person stochastic game completely mixed? (2) Can we identify classes of undiscounted zero-sum stochastic games that have stationary optimal strategies? (3) When does a two-person stochastic game possess symmetric optimal/equilibrium strategies? Firstly, we provide some necessary and some sufficient conditions under which certain classes of discounted and undiscounted stochastic games are completely mixed. In particular, we show that, if a discounted zero-sum switching control stochastic game with symmetric payoff matrices has a completely mixed stationary optimal strategy, then the stochastic game is completely mixed if and only if the matrix games restricted to states are all completely mixed. Secondly, we identify certain classes of undiscounted zero-sum stochastic games that have stationary optima under specific conditions for individual payoff matrices and transition probabilities. Thirdly, we provide sufficient conditions for discounted as well as certain classes of undiscounted stochastic games to have symmetric optimal/equilibrium strategies-namely, transitions are symmetric and the payoff matrices of one player are the transpose of those of the other. We also provide a sufficient condition for the stochastic game to have a symmetric pure strategy equilibrium. We also provide examples to show the sharpness of our results.","[Babu, Sujatha] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India; [Krishnamurthy, Nagarajan] Indian Inst Management Indore, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Parthasarathy, T.] Indian Stat Inst, Chennai Ctr, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Indore; Indian Statistical Institute,"Babu, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Madras, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.",SujathaB@gmail.com; nagarajan@iimidr.ac.in; pacha14@yahoo.com,"Parthasarathy, Triplicane A/B-7146-2011","Krishnamurthy, Nagarajan/0000-0001-9543-815X",,,,,36,2,2,1,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

New oral anticoagulants (NOACs) may be more effective at preventing VTEs but are associated with more bleeding events versus traditional anticoagulants. The objective of this systematic review was to identify published economic analyses of NOACs for primary VTE prophylaxis following THR and TKR surgeries, and to summarise the modelling techniques used and the cost-effectiveness results. Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EconLit and The Cochrane Library were performed from January 2008 to February 2015. Reference lists of included articles and reviews were examined for relevant studies. Sixteen relevant economic analyses were identified, all of which used decision-tree structures to model acute events after surgery; 13 included a chronic-phase Markov module to capture long-term complications of VTE and recurrent VTE events. All studies included prophylaxis-related major bleeding events and captured both symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE-related events; nine studies distinguished between distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis events. Overall, rivaroxaban dominated enoxaparin in eight of 11 studies and dalteparin in one study, dabigatran dominated enoxaparin in five of seven studies and apixaban dominated enoxaparin in two of two studies. Rivaroxaban dominated dabigatran in four of four studies, apixaban dominated dabigatran in two of two studies and rivaroxaban dominated apixaban in one study. The economic analyses showed reasonable consistency in the model structures used and the events captured. The results strongly suggested that NOACs are cost effective alternatives to low molecular-weight heparin. Dabigatran appeared to be the least cost effective NOAC. More research is needed to assess the cost effectiveness of apixaban and edoxaban.","[Brockbank, James; Wolowacz, Sorrel] RTI Hlth Solut, Pavil,Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England",Research Triangle Institute,"Brockbank, J (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, Pavil,Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England.",jbrockbank@rti.org,,"Wolowacz, Sorrel/0000-0001-5497-612X",,,,,35,14,15,1,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAY,2017,35.0,5,,,,,517,535,,10.1007/s40273-017-0486-4,0.0,,,19,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,ER9SS,28185212.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399167600003,0

We apply this approach to data from the CMI Self-Administered Pension Scheme study, using U.K. population data as a reference. We then use the approach to investigate the potential differences in the evolution of mortality rates between these two populations and find that, in many practical situations, basis risk is much less of a problem than is commonly believed.","[Hunt, Andrew] Pacific Life Re, Tower Bridge House,St Katharines Way, London E1W 1BA, England; [Blake, David] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Pens Inst, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",City University London,"Hunt, A (通讯作者)，Pacific Life Re, Tower Bridge House,St Katharines Way, London E1W 1BA, England.",a.o.d.hunt.00@cantab.net; D.Blake@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,11,11,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0515-0361,1783-1350,,ASTIN BULL,Astin Bull.,MAY,2017,47.0,2,,,,,601,629,,10.1017/asb.2016.40,0.0,,,29,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EU6ML,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401148000009,0

In order to commit to a supply schedule, firms are required to build sufficient capacity to produce any quantity that may be prescribed by that schedule. When the cost of extra capacity (given the level of sales) is strictly positive, any Nash equilibrium outcome of supply function competition is also a Nash equilibrium outcome of the corresponding Cournot game, and vice-versa. Conversely, when the cost-savings from reducing output (given the capacity level) are sufficiently small, any outcome of iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies in the supply function game is also an outcome of the same process in Cournot, and vice-versa.","[Krol, Micha] Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Król, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Dept Econ, Manchester, Lancs, England.",michal.krol@manchester.ac.uk,"Krol, Michal/AAH-7963-2020","Krol, Michal/0000-0002-5512-214X",,,,,9,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Analytical results for the worst-case values of ES are obtained. For the loss from a large portfolio of insurance policies, an asymptotic equivalence of VaR and ES is established. Our results can be used to provide approximations for VaR and ES in collective risk models with unknown dependence.

Health technology appraisals of future interventions in MND need robust data on costs and utilities. Existing economic evaluations have been noted to be limited and fraught with challenges. Objective The aim of this study was to identify and critique methodological aspects of all published economic evaluations, cost studies, and utility studies in MND. Methods We systematically reviewed all relevant published studies in English from 1946 until January 2016, searching the databases of Medline, EMBASE, Econlit, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and the Health Economics Evaluation Database (HEED). Key data were extracted and synthesised narratively. Results A total of 1830 articles were identified, of which 15 economic evaluations, 23 cost and 3 utility studies were included. Most economic studies focused on riluzole (n = 9). Six studies modelled the progressive decline in motor function using a Markov design but did not include mutually exclusive health states. Cost estimates for a number of evaluations were based on expert opinion and were hampered by high variability and location-specific characteristics. Few cost studies reported disease-stage-specific costs (n = 3) or fully captured indirect costs. Utilities in three studies of MND patients used the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire or standard gamble, but included potentially unrepresentative cohorts and did not consider any health impacts on caregivers. Conclusions Economic evaluations in MND suffer from significant methodological issues such as a lack of data, uncertainty with the disease course and use of inappropriate modelling framework. Limitations may be addressed through the collection of detailed and representative data from large cohorts of patients.","[Moore, Alan; Hughes, Dyfrig A.] Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales; [Young, Carolyn A.] Walton Ctr NHS Trust, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Bangor University; Walton Centre,"Hughes, DA (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ & Med Evaluat, Holyhead Rd, Bangor LL57 2PZ, Gwynedd, Wales.",d.a.hughes@bangor.ac.uk,"Young, Carolyn A/IWD-4833-2023; Hughes, Dyfrig/H-5252-2012","Young, Carolyn A/0000-0003-1745-7720; Hughes, Dyfrig/0000-0001-8247-7459",Motor Neurone Disease Association UK,Motor Neurone Disease Association UK,The authors would like to thank the Motor Neurone Disease Association UK for their funding.,,75,4,5,0,10,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,APR,2017,35.0,4,,,,,397,413,,10.1007/s40273-016-0478-9,0.0,,,17,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,ER0FC,27975196.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398461700001,0

For self-completion, the health dimensions are presented in a standard order. However, for valuation, this may result in order effects. Thus, it is important to understand whether health state dimension ordering affects values. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of dimension ordering on DCE values using EQ-5D-5L. Methods A choice experiment presenting two health profiles and a third immediate death option was developed. A three-arm study was used, with the same 120 choice sets presented online across each arm (n = 360 per arm). Arm 1 presented the standard EQ-5D-5L dimension order, arm 2 randomised order between respondents, and arm 3 randomised within respondents. Conditional logit regression was used to assess model consistency, and scale parameter testing was used to assess model poolability. Results There were minor inconsistencies across each arm, but the magnitudes of the coefficients produced were generally consistent. Arm 3 produced the largest range of utility values (1 to -0.980). Scale parameter testing suggested that the models did not differ, and the data could be pooled. Follow-up questions did not suggest variation in terms of difficulty. Conclusions The results suggest that the level of randomisation used in DCE health state valuation studies does not significantly impact values, and dimension order may not be as important as other study design issues. The results support past valuation studies that use the standard order of dimensions.","[Mulhern, Brendan; Viney, Rosalie] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Norman, Richard] Curtin Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia; [Lorgelly, Paula] Off Hlth Econ, 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Lancsar, Emily] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Bldg 75,15 Innovat Walk, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Flinders Hlth Econ Grp, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Regent Court,30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Technology Sydney; Curtin University; Monash University; Flinders University South Australia; University of Sheffield,"Mulhern, B (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",Brendan.mulhern@chere.uts.edu.au,"Norman, Richard P/B-4290-2009; Lorgelly, Paula K/B-5400-2012; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Viney, Rosalie/0000-0002-0039-9635; Lancsar, Emily/0000-0003-2404-6735; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Norman, Richard/0000-0002-3112-3893; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988; Lorgelly, Paula/0000-0002-8990-9514",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council,Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),"This study was funded by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.Authors BM, RN and RV led the development of the study design, led the data collection and analysis,and drafted the first version of the manuscript.

Occasionally the efficacy of a treatment is assessed without a randomised comparator group (either active or placebo). Objective To identify and develop a taxonomic account of economic modelling approaches for pharmaceuticals licensed without RCT data. Methods We searched PubMed, the websites of UK health technology assessment bodies and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Scientific Presentations Database for assessments of treatments granted a marketing authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency from January 1999 to May 2014 without RCT data (74 indications). The outcome of interest was the approach to modelling efficacy data. Results Fifty-one unique models were identified in 29 peer-reviewed articles, 30 health technology appraisals, and 15 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research abstracts concerning 30 indications (44 indications had not been modelled). We noted the high rate of non-submission to health technology assessment agencies (28/98). The majority of models (43/51) were based on 'historical controls'-comparisons to previous meta-analysis or pooling of trials (5), individual trials (16), registries/case series (15), or expert opinion (7). Other approaches used the patient as their own control, performed threshold analysis, assumed time on treatment was added to overall survival, or performed cost-minimisation analysis. Conclusions There is considerable variation in the quality and approach of models constructed for drugs granted a marketing authorisation without a RCT. The most common approach is of a naive comparison to historical data (using other trials/registry data as a control group), which has considerable scope for bias.","[Hatswell, Anthony J.; Baio, Gianluca] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.] BresMed, 84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Freemantle, Nick] UCL, Dept Primary Care & Populat Hlth, UKGower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Stat Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.;Hatswell, AJ (通讯作者)，BresMed, 84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",ahatswell@bresmed.com,"Baio, Gianluca/A-2947-2012","Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X; Baio, Gianluca/0000-0003-4314-2570",,,,,105,9,9,1,14,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,FEB,2017,35.0,2,,,,,163,176,,10.1007/s40273-016-0460-6,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,EJ3LU,27778240.0,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393114500003,0

In a linear setup, recent research has found that an estimator based on the idea of redistribution-of-mass in Efron (1967, Proceedings of the Fifth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability, vol. 4, pp. 831-853, University of California Press) has better numerical performance than other available methods. In this paper, this idea is combined with the local polynomial kernel smoothing for nonparametric quantile regression of censored data. We derive the uniform Bahadur representation for the estimator and, more importantly, give theoretical justification for its improved efficiency over existing estimation methods. We include an example to illustrate the usefulness of such a uniform representation in the context of sufficient dimension reduction in regression analysis. Finally, simulations are used to investigate the finite sample performance of the new estimator.","[Kong, Efang; Xia, Yingcun] Univ Elect Sci & Technol, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Kong, Efang] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England; [Xia, Yingcun] Natl Univ Singapore, Singapore 117548, Singapore",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Kent; National University of Singapore,"Kong, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Canterbury, Kent, England.",e.kong@kent.ac.uk,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371095]; Ministry of Education, Singapore [MOE 2014-T2-1-072]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education, Singapore(Ministry of Education, Singapore)","The authors thank a Co-Editor, an Associate Editor and two referees for their thoughtful comments, and Dr Patrick Saart for his suggestions.

To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced-form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced-form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets. The results on program evaluation are obtained as a consequence of more general results on honest inference in a general moment-condition framework, which arises from structural equation models in econometrics. Here, too, the crucial ingredient is the use of orthogonal moment conditions, which can be constructed from the initial moment conditions. We provide results on honest inference for (function-valued) parameters within this general framework where any high-quality, machine learning methods (e.g., boosted trees, deep neural networks, random forest, and their aggregated and hybrid versions) can be used to learn the nonparametric/high-dimensional components of the model. These include a number of supporting auxiliary results that are of major independent interest: namely, we (1) prove uniform validity of a multiplier bootstrap, (2) offer a uniformly valid functional delta method, and (3) provide results for sparsity-based estimation of regression functions for function-valued outcomes.","[Belloni, A.] Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr,POB 90120,Off W312, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Chernozhukov, V.] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr,E52-361B, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Fernandez-Val, I.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, 270 Bay State Rd,Room 415A, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Hansen, C.] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Duke University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Boston University; University of Chicago,"Belloni, A (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, 100 Fuqua Dr,POB 90120,Off W312, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",abn5@duke.edu; vchern@mit.edu; ivanf@bu.edu; chansen1@chicagobooth.edu,"Fernandez-Val, Ivan/G-3455-2016",,"NSF; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1558636] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We gratefully acknowledge research support from the NSF.

The permanent component is a martingale that accomplishes a change of probabilities to the long forward measure, the limit of T-forward measures.

In our previous approach, we focused on human factor influence to BCWS only now we focus on its influence to a more complex EVM parameter estimating final project budget - EAC (Estimate at Completion). Work effort of a resource is hidden beyond majority of project parameters, including EVM. Such influence generates nonlinearity, which is usually ignored in estimations. Linear estimation can be doubtful and thus to express the BCWS, consequently EAC, non-linear mathematical models are used.

The Evidence Review Group (ERG) produced a critical review of the evidence contained within the company's submission (CS) to NICE. The clinical evidence related to one phase II, double-blind randomised controlled trial that recruited 265 patients with PSR serous ovarian cancer (OC) regardless of BRCAm status. Patients received olaparib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) or matched placebo. In the whole population, the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) was met (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.49, p < 0.01) for olaparib versus placebo. The BRCAm subgroup analysis (added after the study commenced but 1 month before the primary analysis was undertaken) reported an HR for PFS of 0.18 (95 % CI 0.10-0.31, p < 0.0001) for olaparib versus placebo, though interaction tests appeared inconclusive. Overall survival was not statistically significant in the whole group (HR 0.88; 95 % CI 0.64-1.21; p = 0.44) or the BRCAm subgroup (0.73; 95 % CI 0.45-1.17; p = 0.19), though treatment switching may have confounded results. The exclusion of data from sites allowing crossover resulted in an HR for overall survival (OS) of 0.52 (95 % CI 0.28-0.97, p = 0.039) in the BRCAm group. Health-related quality-of-life measures were not significantly different between groups. All post hoc exploratory outcomes (time to treatment discontinuation/death, time to first subsequent therapy/death, and time to second subsequent therapy/death) were statistically significantly better in the olaparib arm in the whole population and the BRCAm subgroup analyses. Adverse events were more frequent for olaparib but were largely minor or manageable. The company's semi-Markov model assessed the cost effectiveness of olaparib versus routine surveillance in patients with BRCAm PSR OC from a National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model suggests that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for olaparib versus routine surveillance is expected to be approximately A 49,146 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The ERG did not consider the company's cost-effectiveness estimates to be credible. Additional ERG analyses suggested that the ICER is likely to be more than A 92,214 pound per QALY gained. Additional analyses provided by the company in patients who received three or more lines of chemotherapy suggested a more favourable cost-effectiveness profile for olaparib. The NICE Appraisal Committee recommended olaparib for this subgroup provided the cost of olaparib for people who continue to receive treatment after 15 months will be met by the company.","[Tappenden, Paul; Harnan, Sue; Ren, Shijie; Thokala, Praveen; Wong, Ruth; Mukuria, Clara] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Green, Clare] Southampton Gen Hosp & Hampshire Hosp Fdn Trust, Southampton, Hants, England; [Pledge, Simon; Tidy, John] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Tappenden, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",p.tappenden@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Ren, Shijie/0000-0003-3568-7124; Tappenden, Paul/0000-0001-6612-2332; Thokala, Praveen/0000-0003-4122-2366",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme [14/57/01],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (Project No. 14/57/01).

Pharmacologic maintenance drugs (such as bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids) play an important role in the treatment of COPD. The cost effectiveness of these treatments has been frequently assessed, but studies to date have largely neglected the impact of treatment sequence and the exact stage of disease in which the drugs are used in real life. We aimed to systematically review recently published articles that reported the cost effectiveness of COPD maintenance treatments, with a focus on key findings, quality and methodological issues. We performed a systematic literature search in Embase, PubMed, the UK NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS-EED) and EURONHEED (European Network of Health Economics Evaluation Databases) and included all relevant articles published between 2011 and 2015 in either Dutch, English or German. Main study characteristics, methods and outcomes were extracted and critically assessed. The Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument was used as basis for quality assessment, but additional items were also addressed. The search identified 18 recent pharmacoeconomic analyses of COPD maintenance treatments. Papers reported the cost effectiveness of long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) monotherapy (n = 6), phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitors (n = 4), long-acting beta agonist/inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS) combinations (n = 4), LABA monotherapy (n = 2) and LABA/LAMA combinations (n = 2). All but two studies were funded by the manufacturer, and all studies indicated favourable cost effectiveness; however, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was small. Less than half of the studies reported a COPD-specific outcome in addition to a generic outcome (mostly QALYs). Exacerbation and mortality rates were found to be the main drivers of cost effectiveness. According to the QHES, the quality of the studies was generally sufficient, but additional assessment revealed that most studies poorly represented the cost effectiveness of real-life medication use. The majority of studies showed that pharmacologic COPD maintenance treatment is cost effective, but most studies poorly reflected real-life drug use. Consistent and COPD-specific methodology is recommended.","[van der Schans, Simon] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon, Groningen, Netherlands; [Goossens, Lucas M.

I spread the questionnaire online through the Facebook page of Boston Univerity. Among all the 104 responses that I received, only 84 responses are fully completed. By using the model of multiple linear regression, we can easily get the result: only one factor - the time of the earliest morning class, is significantly related to our dependent variable. Also, the result showed that the adjusted R-Squared value is only 0.301, which means the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is moderate but significantly positive, which means the result is pretty credible. Consequently, there is a strong relationship: the earlier the morning class is, the less number of breakfast a student could have.

Portfolio managers are also given the option of computing regret as a proportion of the benchmark's performance, which is more in line with market practice than other approaches suggested in the literature. Furthermore, we propose using regret as an extra constraint rather than as a brand new objective function, so practitioners can maintain their current framework. We also look into how such a triple optimization problem can be solved or at least approximated for a general class of objective functions and uncertainty and benchmark sets.

The valuation of the embedded guarantees with a surrender option can be formulated as a free boundary problem, and we can obtain a corresponding non-homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE). We apply the Mellin transform to the non-homogeneous POE in order to obtain an integral equation that produces the value of the embedded guarantee as well as the optimal surrender boundary in a variable annuity contract.

Finite automata, a bounded model of computation, have been extensively used to compactly represent strategies for these games and are a standard tool in game theoretic analyses. However, inference over these strategies in repeated games is challenging since the number of possible strategies grows exponentially with the number of repetitions yet behavioural data are often sparse and noisy. As a result, previous approaches start by specifying a finite hypothesis space of automata that does not allow for flexibility. This limitation hinders the discovery of novel strategies that may be used by humans but are not anticipated a priori by current theory. Here we present a new probabilistic model for strategy inference in repeated games by exploiting non-parametric Bayesian modelling. With simulated data, we show that the model is effective at inferring the true strategy rapidly and from limited data, which leads to accurate predictions of future behaviour. When applied to experimental data of human behaviour in a repeated prisoner's dilemma, we uncover strategies of varying complexity and diversity.","[Kleiman-Weiner, Max; Tenenbaum, Joshua B.] MIT, Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhou, Penghui] MIT, Dept Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Kleiman-Weiner, M (通讯作者)，MIT, Brain & Cognit Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",maxkw@mit.edu; jbt@mit.edu; phzhou@mit.edu,"peng, jy/JMB-2297-2023","peng, jy/0000-0001-9665-1059; /0000-0002-6067-3659","Hertz Foundation; NSF-GRFP; Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM); NSF STC [CCF-1231216]; ONR [N00014-13-1-0333]","Hertz Foundation; NSF-GRFP(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM); NSF STC(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ONR(Office of Naval Research)","We thank Victor Chernozukov, Muriel Niederle, Juuso Toikka, Erez Yoeli and the anonymous referee for comments and improvements.

The Evidence Review Group (ERG), the School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield, produced a document summarising the key points from the company submission alongside a critical review. Efficacy for progression-free survival (PFS) and safety was positively demonstrated in the pivotal GADOLIN trial, which compared obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance (O-Benda+O) against bendamustine monotherapy. Data on overall survival were immature. The company submitted a model-based economic analysis, including a patient access scheme. The ERG identified a number of limitations, in particular the absence of subgroup analysis and the approach used by the company to estimate overall survival (OS), which was more favourable to the intervention arm. The key uncertainty was the duration of the treatment effect on OS. This uncertainty is expected to be reduced when the final analysis of the GADOLIN trial is reported. Consequently, the NICE appraisal committee recommended O-Benda+O in the population covered by the marketing authorisation within the Cancer Drug Fund until NICE is able to review the guidance following publication of the final analysis of GADOLIN.","[Rafia, Rachid; Pandor, Abdullah; Davis, Sarah; Stevens, John W.; Harnan, Sue; Clowes, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Sorour, Youssef; Cutting, Robert] Barnsley Hosp NHS Trust, Haematol, Barnsley S75 2EP, England",University of Sheffield,"Rafia, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci HEDS, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",r.rafia@sheffield.ac.uk,"Pandor, Abdullah/E-4643-2010; Davis, Sarah E/A-2801-2010","Pandor, Abdullah/0000-0003-2552-5260; Davis, Sarah/0000-0002-6609-4287",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [14/177/09 STA],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (project number 14/177/09 STA).

In fact, the approach is so popular that it has given rise to a separate CCE literature. A common assumption in this literature is that the common factors are stationary, which would seem to rule out many empirically relevant cases. Moreover, deterministic factors are typically treated as known, which raises the issue of model misspecification. In the current paper, we show how the conditions placed on the factors in CCE can be made much more general than was previously thought possible. In fact, save for some mild regulatory moment conditions, the factors are essentially unrestricted. One implication of this result is that there is no need to discriminate between deterministic and stochastic factors, but that one can instead treat them all as unknown. This is very convenient for practitioners, because it means that under certain conditions they are spared the problem of having to decide which deterministic terms to include in the model.","[Westerlund, Joakim] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Westerlund, Joakim] Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Financial Econometr, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Lund University; Deakin University,"Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Westerlund, J (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, Ctr Financial Econometr, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",joakim.westerlund@nek.lu.se,,,Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation [P2014-0112:1],Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through a Wallenberg Academy Fellowship; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"Previous versions of this paper were presented at the 2016 Applied Financial Modelling Conference in Melbourne and at a seminar in Lund.

As part of a single technology appraisal (ID807) undertaken by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence, the Evidence Review Group, Warwick Evidence was invited to independently review the evidence submitted by the manufacturer of ixazomib, Takeda UK Ltd. The main source of clinical effectiveness data about IXA-LEN-DEX came from the Tourmaline-MM1 randomized controlled trial in which 771 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma received either IXA-LEN-DEX or placebo-LEN-DEX as their second-, third-, or fourth-line treatment. Takeda estimated the cost effectiveness of IXA-LEN-DEX using a de-novo partitioned-survival model with three health states (pre-progression, post-progression, and dead). In their first submission, this model was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of IXA-LEN-DEX vs. bortezomib plus dexamethasone (BORT-DEX) in second-line treatment, and of IXA-LEN-DEX vs. LEN-DEX in third-line treatment. To estimate the relative clinical performance of IXA-LEN-DEX vs. BORT-DEX, Takeda conducted network meta-analyses for important outcomes. The network meta-analysis for overall survival was found to be flawed in several respects, but mainly because a hazard ratio input for one of the studies in the network had been inverted, resulting in a large inflation of the claimed superiority of IXA-LEN-DEX over BORT-DEX and a considerable overestimation of its cost effectiveness. In subsequent submissions, Takeda withdrew second-line treatment as an option for IXA-LEN-DEX. The manufacturer's first submission comparing IXA-LEN-DEX with LEN-DEX for third-line therapy employed Tourmaline-MM1 data from third- and fourth-line patients as proxy for a third-line population. The appraisal committee did not consider this reasonable because randomization in Tourmaline-MM1 was stratified according to one previous treatment and two or more previous treatments. A further deficiency was considered to be the manufacturer's use of interim survival data rather than the most mature data available. A second submission from the company focussed on IXA-LEN-DEX vs. LEN-DEX as third- or fourth-line treatment (the two or more previous lines population) and a new patient access scheme was introduced. Covariate modeling of survival outcomes was proposed using the most mature survival data. The Evidence Review Group's main criticisms of the new evidence included: the utility associated with the pre-progression health state was overestimated, treatment costs of ixazomib were underestimated, survival models were still associated with great uncertainty, leading to clinically implausible anomalies and highly variable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates, and the company had not explored a strong assumption that the survival benefit of IXA-LEN-DEX over LEN-DEX would be fully maintained for a further 22 years beyond the observed data, which encompassed only approximately 2.5 years of observation. The appraisal committee remained unconvinced that ixazomib represented a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources. Takeda's third submission offered new base-case parametric models for survival outcomes, a new analysis of utilities, and proposed a commercial access agreement. In a brief critique of the third submission, the Evidence Review Group agreed that the selection of appropriate survival models was problematic and at the request of the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence investigated external sources of evidence regarding survival outcomes. The Evidence Review Group considered that some cost and utility estimates in the submission may have remained biased in favor of ixazomib. As a result of their third appraisal meeting, the committee judged that for the two to three prior therapies population, and at the price agreed in a commercial access agreement, ixazomib had the potential to be cost effective. It was referred to the Cancer Drugs Fund so that further data could accrue with the aim of diminishing the clinical uncertainties.","[Armoiry, Xavier; Connock, Martin; Tsertsvadze, Alexander; Melendez-Torres, G.

We also derive a class of derivative tests, which deliver model-free tests for such important hypotheses as omitted variables, Granger causality in various moments and conditional uncorrelatedness. The proposed tests have a convenient asymptotic null N(0,1) distribution, and are asymptotically locally more powerful than a variety of related smoothed nonparametric tests in the literature. Unlike other smoothed nonparametric tests for conditional independence, we allow nonparametric estimators for both conditional joint and marginal characteristic functions to jointly determine the asymptotic distributions of the test statistics. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate excellent power of the tests against various alternatives. In an application to testing Granger causality, we document the existence of nonlinear relationships between money and output, which are missed by some existing tests.","[Wang, Xia] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Hong, Yongmiao] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Hong, Yongmiao] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Cornell University; Xiamen University,"Hong, YM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Econ, 424 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Hong, YM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Stat Sci, 424 Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Hong, YM (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Econ Bldg, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;Wang, X (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Univ Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yh20@cornell.edu,,"Hong, Yongmiao/0000-0002-9711-9061",National Science Foundation of China [71401160]; Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of China [14YJC790120]; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Statistics (Xiamen University) [2016003],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of China; Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Statistics (Xiamen University)(Xiamen University),"Wang acknowledges financial supports from the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71401160), the Ministry of Education of Humanities and Social Sciences Project of China (No. 14YJC790120), Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Statistics (Xiamen University, No. 2016003).

A static structural model is constructed, in which for each obligor i its default is driven by a latent variable U-i, and its loss given default (LGD) is driven by another latent variable V-i, through a general loss settlement function G. In this way, the default indicator with a denoting a default threshold, and the LGD G(Vi) are not necessarily comonotonic, hence essentially different from the ones used in some recent works. It is further assumed that the two latent variables U-i and V-i are correlated in the way that they share a common systematic risk factor but each has its own idiosyncratic risk factor. We employ the law of large numbers (LLN) to derive the exact limit distribution of the portfolio loss as the portfolio size becomes large. As applications, we also derive exact approximations for the TVaR and moments of the portfolio loss. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These quantile differences correspond to (conditional) quantile treatment effects under (conditional) independence of a binary treatment and potential outcomes. Our methods use the probability integral transform and a Dirichlet (rather than Gaussian) reference distribution to pick appropriate L-statistics as confidence interval endpoints, achieving high-order accuracy. Using a similar approach, we also propose confidence intervals/sets for vectors of quantiles, interquantile ranges and differences of linear combinations of quantiles. In the conditional setting, when smoothing over continuous covariates, optimal bandwidth and coverage probability rates are derived for all methods. Simulations show that the new confidence intervals have a favourable combination of robust accuracy and short length compared with existing approaches. Detailed steps for confidence interval construction are provided in online Appendix E as supporting information, and code for all methods, simulations and empirical examples is provided.","[Goldman, Matt] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA; [Kaplan, David M.] Univ Missouri, Dept Econ, 118 Profess Bldg,909 Univ Ave, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Microsoft; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Goldman, M (通讯作者)，Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.",mattgold@microsoft.com; kaplandm@missouri.edu,,"Kaplan, David M./0000-0002-2333-1481",,,,,41,6,7,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1368-4221,1368-423X,,ECONOMET J,Econom.

The value sets' characteristics differ, and it is important to assess the implications of these differences. The aim of this paper is to compare the three value sets. We carried out analysis comparing the predicted values from each value set, and investigated how differences in health on the descriptive system is reflected in the utility score by assessing the value of adjacent states. We also assessed differences in values using data from patients who completed both EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L. The distribution of the value sets systematically differed. EQ-5D-5L values were higher than EQ-5D-3L/crosswalk values. The overall range and difference between adjacent states was smaller. In the patient data, the EQ-5D-5L produced higher values across all conditions and there was some evidence that the value sets rank different health conditions in a similar severity order. There are important differences between the value sets. Due to the smaller range of EQ-5D-5L values, the possible change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) might be reduced, but they will apply to both control and intervention groups, and will depend on whether the gain is in quality of life, survival, or both. The increased sensitivity of EQ-5D-5L may also favour QALY gains even if the changes in utility are smaller. Further work should assess the impact of the different value sets on cost effectiveness by repeating the analysis on clinical trial data.","[Mulhern, Brendan] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia; [Feng, Yan; Shah, Koonal; Herdman, Michael; Devlin, Nancy] Southside, Off Hlth Econ, 105 Victoria St, London SW1E 6QT, England; [Janssen, Mathieu F.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus MC, Dept Med Psychol & Psychotherapy, POB 2040, NL-3000 CA Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Hout, Ben] Univ Sheffield, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sch Hlth & Related Res, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Technology Sydney; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC; University of Sheffield,"Mulhern, B (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, 1-59 Quay St, Sydney, NSW 2000, Australia.",Brendan.mulhern@chere.uts.edu.au,"Shah, Koonal/M-9123-2014; Feng, Yan/M-5358-2014; Herdman, Michael/AAI-7280-2020","Shah, Koonal/0000-0002-4927-7858; Mulhern, Brendan/0000-0003-3656-8063",,,,,34,67,71,0,5,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,JUN,2018,36.0,6,,,,,699,713,,10.1007/s40273-018-0628-3,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,GG0LA,29476363.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432368700006,0

We show that the existence of a nondeterministic long rate in a factor model of the term structure implies, as a consequence of the Dybvig-Ingersoll-Ross theorem, that the model has an equivalent representation in which one of the state variables is nondecreasing. For two-dimensional factor models, we prove moreover that if the long rate is nondeterministic, the yield curve flattens out, and the factor process is asymptotically nondeterministic, then the term structure is unbounded. Finally, we provide an explicit example of a three-dimensional affine factor model with a nondeterministic yet finite long rate in which the volatility of the factor process does not vanish over time.","[de Kort, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"de Kort, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.p.dekort@uvt.nl,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0960-1627,1467-9965,,MATH FINANC,Math.

Factor concentrates absorb more than 90% of healthcare direct costs of haemophilia care, and the debate regarding the high cost of haemophilia treatments and their different use across different countries is increasing. The objective of this study was to review cost-effectiveness analyses conducted on treatment options in haemophilia, focusing on their results and their strengths and limitations; to highlight the possible issues associated with economic evaluations of new treatment options. Electronic searches in PubMed and EMBASE were performed to retrieve papers published between November 2015 and September 2017 to update the previous review of economic evaluations of haemophilia treatments by Drummond et al. Reference lists of included articles and reviews were examined for relevant studies, which were assessed for their quality and their empirical results. Twenty-six relevant economic analyses were identified; 15 (57.7%) were conducted in patients with haemophilia with inhibitors while 11 (42.3%) involved patients without inhibitors. There were methodological variations among the included studies, and differences in the treatment schemes make a comparative assessment of interventions for patients with haemophilia difficult. Only immune tolerance induction showed consistent results in its cost-saving profile compared with the treatment with bypassing agents. Economic evaluations of haemophilia treatments are increasing, but the identification of general cost-effectiveness trends is still difficult in these studies. We are now facing a new era in haemophilia management with a soaring need for high-quality economic evaluations, performed through proactive collaboration between clinical experts, budget holders and health economists.","[Cortesi, Paolo A.; D'Angiolella, Lucia S.; Lafranconi, Alessandra; Micale, Mariangela; Cesana, Giancarlo; Mantovani, Lorenzo G.] Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth CESP, Via G Pergolesi 33, I-20900 Monza, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Mantovani, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Res Ctr Publ Hlth CESP, Via G Pergolesi 33, I-20900 Monza, Italy.",lorenzo.mantovani@unimib.it,"Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/AAD-7926-2020; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/AAC-4263-2021","Cortesi, Paolo Angelo/0000-0001-5241-4473; Lafranconi, Alessandra/0000-0002-4586-9610; Mantovani, Lorenzo Giovanni/0000-0003-3866-8199",,,,,57,12,12,1,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,MAR,2018,36.0,3,,,,,263,284,,10.1007/s40273-017-0588-z,0.0,,,22,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FY3GD,29170896.0,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426705800002,0

First, we estimate univariate and multivariate models of cash-flow (consumption, output, dividends) growth that feature measurement errors, time-varying volatilities, and mixed-frequency observations. Monthly consumption data are important for identifying the stochastic volatility process; yet the data are contaminated, which makes the inclusion of measurement errors essential for identifying the predictable component. Second, we develop a novel state-space model for cash flows and asset prices that imposes the pricing restrictions of a representative-agent endowment economy with recursive preferences. To estimate this model, we use a particle MCMC approach that exploits the conditional linear structure of the approximate equilibrium. Once asset return data are included in the estimation, we find even stronger evidence for the persistent component and are able to identify three volatility processes: the one for the predictable cash-flow component is crucial for asset pricing, whereas the other two are important for tracking the data. Our model generates asset prices that are largely consistent with the data in terms of sample moments and predictability features. The state-space approach allows us to track over time the evolution of the predictable component, the volatility processes, the decomposition of the equity premium into risk factors, and the variance decomposition of asset prices.","[Schorfheide, Frank] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Song, Dongho] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Yaron, Amir] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Boston College; University of Pennsylvania,"Schorfheide, F (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",schorf@ssc.upenn.edu; dongho.song@bc.edu; yaron@wharton.upenn.edu,"Song, Dongho/GXA-0139-2022","Schorfheide, Frank/0000-0002-4256-634X","National Science Foundation [SES 1424843]; Rodney White center; Jacob Levy center; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1425740] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1424843] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Rodney White center; Jacob Levy center; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank a co-editor, four anonymous referees, Bent J.

Most models of taxation since Ramsey (1927) assume that a tax levied on the demand side only affects demand through the price after taxation. Econometrically, we show that this assumption acts as an exclusion restriction. Under the Ramsey Exclusion Restriction (RER), a single tax reform can serve to simultaneously identify the demand and supply elasticity. We develop an estimation method, which includes 2SLS estimators for the elasticities, and a test for strength of the instrument.

The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group (ScHARR-TAG) at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent evidence review group (ERG). The ERG produced a review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of mepolizumab as add-on to standard of care (SoC) compared with SoC and omalizumab, based upon the company's submission to NICE. The clinical-effectiveness evidence in the company's submission was based predominantly on three randomised controlled trials (DREAM, MENSA and SIRIUS) comparing add-on mepolizumab with placebo plus SoC. The relevant population was defined in terms of degree of asthma severity (four or more exacerbations in the previous year and/or dependency on maintenance oral corticosteroids [mOCS]) and degree of eosinophilia (a blood eosinophil count of >= 300 cells/mu l in the previous year) based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the pivotal trials. Other subpopulations were considered throughout the appraisal, defined by different eosinophil measurements, number of exacerbations and dependency (or lack thereof) on mOCS. Statistically significant reductions in clinically significant exacerbations were observed in patients receiving mepolizumab compared with SoC meta-analysed across MENSA and DREAM in the modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population (rate ratio [RR] 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.62) as well as in the relevant population (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.36-0.62). In terms of quality of life, differences on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire in MENSA for add-on subcutaneous mepolizumab 100 mg vs. placebo were 7 and 7.5 units in the modified ITT and relevant populations, respectively. A number of issues in the clinical evidence base warrant caution in its interpretation. The ERG noted that the definition of SoC used in the trials differed from that in clinical practice, where patients with severe uncontrolled asthma start treatment with a mOCS. The company's economic post-consultation analysis incorporating a confidential patient access scheme (PAS) estimated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for add-on mepolizumab compared with SoC was 27,418 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the relevant population if patients stopped mepolizumab after 1 year unless (1) the number of exacerbations decreased at least 50% or (2) a reduction in corticosteroids dose was achieved whilst maintaining asthma control. The ERG applied an age adjustment to all utilities and corrected the post-continuation assessment utilities, which resulted in an ICER for add-on mepolizumab compared with SoC of 29,163 pound per QALY gained. The ERG noted that this ICER was not robust for patients who continued treatment due to a corticosteroid dose reduction where exacerbations had decreased by less than 50%, because corticosteroid dose reduction was not allowed in the main trial in which the evidence was gathered (MENSA). The NICE appraisal committee (AC) concluded that add-on mepolizumab could be recommended as an option for treating severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults for the relevant population when the stopping rule suggested by the company was applied. The AC also concluded that the comparison between mepolizumab and omalizumab was not clinically relevant or methodologically robust.","[Bermejo, Inigo; Stevenson, Matt; Cooper, Katy; Harnan, Sue; Hamilton, Jean; Clowes, Mark; Carroll, Christopher] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Harrison, Tim] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Resp Res Unit, Nottingham, England; [Saha, Shironjit] Sheffield Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Northern Gen Hosp, Sheffield S5 7AU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Nottingham; Northern General Hospital; University of Sheffield,"Stevenson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Regent Court, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",i.bermejo@sheffield.ac.uk; m.d.stevenson@sheffield.ac.uk,"Bermejo, Iñigo/AAR-9134-2021; Bermejo, Inigo/AAE-7769-2022; Cooper, Katy L/A-3546-2010; Carroll, Chris/HHC-1512-2022","Bermejo, Iñigo/0000-0001-9105-8088; , Matt/0000-0002-3099-9877; Hamilton, Jean/0000-0003-3326-9842",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme [15/06/06],National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme (Project number 15/06/06).

The strong market competition has boosted the demand for a competitive premium. In actuarial science, scant literature still exists on how competition actually affects the calculation and the cycles of company's premiums. In this paper, we model premium dynamics via differential games, and study the insurers' equilibrium premium dynamics in a competitive market. We apply an optimal control theory methodology to determine the open-loop Nash equilibrium premium strategies. The market power of each insurance company is characterized by a price sensitive parameter, and the business volume is affected by the solvency ratio. We study two models. Considering the average market premiums, the first model studies an exponential relation between premium strategies and volume of business. The second model initially characterizes the competition between any selected pair of insurers, and then aggregates all the paired competitions in the market. Numerical examples illustrate the premium dynamics, and show that premium cycles may exist in equilibrium. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We show how the credit and collateral extended valuation framework presented in Pallavicini et al. [Funding valuation adjustment: FVA consistent with CVA, DVA, WWR, collateral, netting and re-hyphotecation, 2011], and the related collateralized valuation measure, can be helpful in defining the key market rates underlying the multiple interest rate curves that characterize current interest rate markets. A key point is that spot Libor rates are to be treated as market primitives rather than being defined by no-arbitrage relationships. We formulate a consistent realistic dynamics for the different rates emerging from our analysis and compare the resulting model performances to simpler models used in the industry. We include the often neglected margin period of risk, showing how this feature may increase the impact of different rates dynamics on valuation. We point out limitations of multiple curve models with deterministic basis considering valuation of particularly sensitive products such as basis swaps. We stress that a proper wrong way risk analysis for such products requires a model with a stochastic basis and we show numerical results confirming this fact.","[Bormetti, Giacomo] Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Bormetti, Giacomo] QUANTLab, Via Pietrasantina 123, I-56122 Pisa, Italy; [Brigo, Damiano; Francischello, Marco] Imperial Coll, Dept Math, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Pallavicini, Andrea] Banca IMI, Largo Mattioli 3, I-20121 Milan, Italy",Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa; Imperial College London,"Bormetti, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Normale Super Pisa, Piazza Cavalieri 7, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",giacomo.bormetti@sns.it,"Marino, Massimo/H-3616-2013","Pallavicini, Andrea/0000-0002-4927-9597; Bormetti, Giacomo/0000-0003-3542-2505",Scuola Normale Superiore [SNS14_B_BORMETTI],Scuola Normale Superiore,This work was supported by the Scuola Normale Superiore [grant number SNS14_B_BORMETTI].,,41,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We illustrate that for many classical problems, we can arrive at speed-ups of several orders of magnitude by deploying machine learning techniques based on Gaussian process regression. The price we have to pay for this extra speed is some loss of accuracy. However, we show that this reduced accuracy is often well within reasonable limits and hence very acceptable from a practical point of view. The concrete examples concern fitting and estimation. In the fitting context, we fit sophisticated Greek profiles and summarize implied volatility surfaces. In the estimation context, we reduce computation times for the calculation of vanilla option values under advanced models, the pricing of American options and the pricing of exotic options under models beyond the Black-Scholes setting.","[De Spiegeleer, Jan] Risk Concile, Kapeldreef 60, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Madan, Dilip B.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Reyners, Sofie; Schoutens, Wim] Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; KU Leuven,"Schoutens, W (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Celestijnenlaan 200B, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",wim.schoutens@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,10,53,61,5,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We show with an illustration that our proposed practical algorithm reproduces the theoretical results after a savings period of around 30 years by using daily, monthly, weekly or yearly updates of the investment positions. We calculate the percentiles of the final accumulated wealth distribution for the adjusted implementation. In the simulated illustration, we observe that the adjusted values converge to the theoretical values of the percentiles when the frequency of update increases. We conclude that monthly adjustments result in a practical way to implement theoretical results that were obtained under the hypothesis of a continuous process by Donnelly et al. (2015).

The main effect of this change will be to put more onus on the individual to make sure they have sufficient resources to last for their retirement, but it also removes the obligation to annuitise their funds at any future age. This paper is concerned with how people can best use their pension pots by aligning them to their personal financial objectives and longevity risks. It finds that for most people annuitising is not the best option, except for a few circumstances, and that draw down is preferable, especially where there is a bequest motive and the individual has assets such as property to fall back on. These options are low risk if simple rules are followed but they are not a substitute for professional advice and should only be used in conjunction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We generalise the existing literature in three ways. First, the domain to which these rates apply is much wider than the domains that have been considered in the existing literature, and can be chosen so as to contain as large a fraction of the sample as desired in the limit. Second, our results allow the regression disturbance to be serially correlated, and cross-correlated with the regressor; previous work on this problem (of obtaining uniform rates) having been confined entirely to the setting of an exogenous regressor. Third, we permit the bandwidth to be data-dependent, requiring it to satisfy only certain weak asymptotic shrinkage conditions. Our assumptions on the regressor process are consistent with a very broad range of departures from the standard unit root autoregressive model, allowing the regressor to be fractionally integrated, and to have an infinite variance (and even infinite lower-order moments).","[Duffy, James A.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Duffy, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Inst New Econ Thinking, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England.;Duffy, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Econ Dept, Oxford, England.",james.duffy@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0266-4666,1469-4360,,ECONOMET THEOR,Economet.

Modelling the whole range of the losses using a standard distribution is usually very hard and often impossible due to the specific characteristics of the body and the tail of the loss distribution. A possible solution is to combine two distributions in a splicing model: a light-tailed distribution for the body which covers light and moderate losses, and a heavy-tailed distribution for the tail to capture large losses. We propose a splicing model with a mixed Erlang (ME) distribution for the body and a Pareto distribution for the tail. This combines the flexibility of the ME distribution with the ability of the Pareto distribution to model extreme values. We extend our splicing approach for censored and/or truncated data. Relevant examples of such data can be found in financial risk analysis. We illustrate the flexibility of this splicing model using practical examples from risk measurement. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article presents a summary of the company's submission of T-VEC, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance (TA410), issued in September 2016. T-VEC is an oncolytic virus therapy granted a marketing authorisation by the European Commission for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic (stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1a) with no bone, brain, lung or other visceral disease. Clinical evidence for T-VEC versus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was derived from the multinational, open-label randomised controlled OPTiM trial [Oncovex (GM-CSF) Pivotal Trial in Melanoma]. In accordance with T-VEC's marketing authorisation, the company's submission focused primarily on 249 patients with stage IIIB to stage IV/M1a disease who constituted 57% of the overall trial population (T-VEC, n = 163 and GM-CSF, n = 86). Results from analyses of durable response rate, objective response rate, time to treatment failure and overall survival all showed marked and statistically significant improvements for patients treated with T-VEC compared with those treated with GM-CSF. However, GM-CSF is not used to treat melanoma in clinical practice. It was not possible to compare treatment with T-VEC with an appropriate comparator using conventionally accepted methods due to the absence of comparative head-to-head data or trials with sufficient common comparators. Therefore, the company compared T-VEC with ipilimumab using what it described as modified Korn and two-step Korn methods. Results from these analyses suggested that treatment with T-VEC was at least as effective as treatment with ipilimumab. Using the discounted patient access scheme (PAS) price for T-VEC and list price for ipilimumab, the company reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. For the comparison of treatment with T-VEC versus ipilimumab, the ICER per QALY gained was -A 16,367 pound using the modified Korn method and -A 60,271 pound using the two-step Korn method. The NICE Appraisal Committee (AC) agreed with the ERG that the company's methods for estimating clinical effectiveness of T-VEC versus ipilimumab were flawed and therefore produced unreliable results for modelling progression in stage IIIB to stage IVM1a melanoma. The AC concluded that the clinical and cost effectiveness of treatment with T-VEC compared with ipilimumab is unknown in patients with stage IIIB to stage IV/M1a disease. However, the AC considered that T-VEC may be a reasonable option for treating patients who are unsuitable for treatment with systemically administered immunotherapies (such as ipilimumab). T-VEC was therefore recommended by NICE as a treatment option for adults with unresectable, regionally or distantly metastatic (stage IIIB to stage IVM1a) melanoma that has not spread to bone, brain, lung or other internal organs, only if treatment with systemically administered immunotherapies is not suitable and the company provides T-VEC at the agreed discounted PAS price.","[Fleeman, Nigel; Bagust, Adrian; Boland, Angela; Beale, Sophie; Richardson, Marty; Krishan, Ashma; Stainthorpe, Angela; Abdulla, Ahmed; Kotas, Eleanor] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Room 2-10,Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England; [Banks, Lindsay] North West Med Informat Ctr, Liverpool L69 3GF, Merseyside, England; [Payne, Miranda] Oxford Univ NHS Hosp Trust, Oxford, England",University of Liverpool; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,"Fleeman, N (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Liverpool Reviews & Implementat Grp, Room 2-10,Whelan Bldg,Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB, Merseyside, England.",nigel.fleeman@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Stainthorpe, Angela/0000-0002-2531-9371; Richardson, Marty/0000-0002-7097-8704; Krishan, Ashma/0000-0002-0702-0261",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme (Project Number 14/206/04).

This paper introduces an empirical framework to analyze the permanent-transitory decomposition of SDF processes. Specifically, we show how to estimate nonparametrically the solution to the Perron-Frobenius eigenfunction problem of Hansen and Scheinkman, 2009. Our empirical framework allows researchers to (i) construct time series of the estimated permanent and transitory components and (ii) estimate the yield and the change of measure which characterize pricing over long investment horizons. We also introduce nonparametric estimators of the continuation value function in a class of models with recursive preferences by reinterpreting the value function recursion as a nonlinear Perron-Frobenius problem. We establish consistency and convergence rates of the eigenfunction estimators and asymptotic normality of the eigenvalue estimator and estimators of related functionals. As an application, we study an economy where the representative agent is endowed with recursive preferences, allowing for general (nonlinear) consumption and earnings growth dynamics.","[Christensen, Timothy M.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Christensen, TM (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",timothy.christensen@nyu.edu,,,,,,,57,21,22,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,SEP,2017,85.0,5,,,,,1501,1536,,10.3982/ECTA11600,0.0,,,36,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FI6NA,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412112000005,0

However, there does not appear to be any consensus as to the terminology used to describe affordability, or the thresholds used to determine whether new drugs are affordable. Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to investigate how affordability is defined and measured in healthcare. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and EconLit databases (2005-July 2016) were searched using terms covering affordability and budget impact, combined with definitions, thresholds and restrictions, to identify articles describing a definition of affordability with respect to new medicines. Additional definitions were identified through citation searching, and through manual searches of European health technology assessment body websites. Results In total, 27 definitions were included in the review. Of these, five definitions described affordability in terms of the value of a product; seven considered affordability within the context of healthcare system budgets; and 15 addressed whether products are affordable in a given country based on economic factors. However, there was little in the literature to indicate that the price of medicines is considered alongside both their value to individual patients and their budget impact at a population level. Conclusions Current methods of assessing affordability in healthcare may be limited by their focus on budget impact. A more effective approach may involve a broader perspective than is currently described in the literature, to consider the long-term benefits of a therapy and cost savings elsewhere in the healthcare system, as well as cooperation between healthcare payers and the pharmaceutical industry to develop financing models that support sustainability as well as innovation.","[Antonanzas, Fernando] Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, C La Ciguena 60, Logrono 26004, Spain; [Terkola, Robert] Univ Florida, Coll Pharm, Gainesville, FL USA; [Terkola, Robert; Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoTherapy Epidemiol & Econ PTE2, Groningen, Netherlands; [Overton, Paul M.] Beacon Med Commun, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Shalet, Natalie] NAS Healthcare Solut, Surbiton, England; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Inst Sci Hlth Aging & HealthcaRE SHARE, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands",Universidad de La Rioja; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Groningen; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Antoñanzas, F (通讯作者)，Univ La Rioja, Dept Econ, C La Ciguena 60, Logrono 26004, Spain.",fernando.antonanzas@unirioja.es,"Terkola, Robert/R-4048-2019","Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653; Overton, Paul/0000-0002-1557-3413; shalet, natalie/0000-0002-7075-492X","Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland) under the AGORA initiative (Advisory Group On Reimbursement and Access, a European Think Tank aiming to optimise access for patients to innovative treatments)","Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland) under the AGORA initiative (Advisory Group On Reimbursement and Access, a European Think Tank aiming to optimise access for patients to innovative treatments)","This work was supported by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland) under the AGORA initiative (Advisory Group On Reimbursement and Access, a European Think Tank aiming to optimise access for patients to innovative treatments).",,62,7,7,1,12,ADIS INT LTD,NORTHCOTE,"5 THE WAREHOUSE WAY, NORTHCOTE 0627, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND",1170-7690,1179-2027,,PHARMACOECONOMICS,Pharmacoeconomics,AUG,2017,35.0,8,,,,,777,791,,10.1007/s40273-017-0514-4,0.0,,,15,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,FD2XA,28477220.0,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407396900004,0

In particular, we consider kernel-based estimators of the Nadaraya-Watson type, introducing a new technical device called a damping function. This device allows us to derive sharp uniform rates over an infinite interval with minimal requirements on the processes: The existence of the moment of any order is not required and the boundedness of relevant functions can be significantly relaxed. Restrictions on kernel functions are also minimal: We allow for kernels with discontinuity, unbounded support, and slowly decaying tails. Our proofs proceed by using the covering-number technique from empirical process theory and exploiting the mixing and martingale properties of the processes. We also present new results on the path-continuity property of Brownian motions and diffusion processes over an infinite time horizon. These path-continuity results, which should also be of some independent interest, are used to control discretization biases of the nonparametric estimators. The obtained convergence results are useful for non/semiparametric estimation and testing problems of diffusion processes.","[Kanaya, Shin] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark; [Kanaya, Shin] IER, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Kanaya, S (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.;Kanaya, S (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",skanaya@econ.au.dk,,,"CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences [DFF - 4182-00279]","CREATES, Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Danish Council for Independent Research, Social Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","This is a substantially revised version of a chapter in my Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

An important design question is the frequency of such auctions. We use a simple dynamic auction model in continuous time to answer this question. We focus on the relationship between the persistency of bidders' valuations and the optimal choice of frequency. If the seller focuses on the equilibrium in which bidders follow a repeated static Nash strategy, then the frequency of auctions should typically increase when persistency declines. However, accounting for the fact that bidders can follow different equilibria that are collusive in nature, the comparative statics are reversed, forcing the seller to reduce the frequency when bidders' valuations are less persistent. The argument builds on the fact that high frequency auctions are more conducive to collusion among bidders.","[Kremer, Ilan] Stanford Univ, Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wiener, Zvi] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Business, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Winter, Eyal] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel",Stanford University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Winter, E (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Ctr Study Rat, IL-91904 Jerusalem, Israel.",kremer_ilan@GSB.Stanford.Edu; Zvi.Wiener@huji.ac.il; Eyal.winter@huji.ac.il,"Wiener, Zvi/AAE-9750-2019","Wiener, Zvi/0000-0002-5169-4642",,,,,6,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0020-7276,1432-1270,,INT J GAME THEORY,Int.

Interpreting 'more beneficial' as an increase in utility and considering sequences of exchangeable risks, we are able to formalize this notion from the policyholder's perspective and demonstrate its validity for various alternative preference functionals (e.g., expected utility, Choquet expected utility, and distortion risk measures). To obtain this result, we exploit that for a sequence of exchangeable risks the corresponding sequence of arithmetical averages is a reversed martingale. We conclude that pooling risks is fundamental for understanding the mechanisms of insurance because it favourably affects the utility of policyholders, and we refer to this phenomenon as the 'utility improving effect of risk pooling'. Moreover, we demonstrate that the utility of the policyholder is (strictly) increasing with the size of the risk pool. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Increased availability and accessibility of patient-level health-related utility data from clinical trials or observational database provide enhanced opportunities to conduct more patient-centered CEA. Regression-based approaches that incorporate patient-level data hold great promise for enhancing CEAs to be more patient centered; this paper provides guidance regarding two CEA approaches that apply regression-based approaches utilizing patient-level health-related utility and costs data. The first approach utilizes patient-reported preferences to determine patient-specific utility. This approach evaluates how individuals' unique clinical and demographic factors affect their utility and cost levels over the course of treatment. The underlying motivation of this approach is to produce CEA estimates that reflect patient-level utilities and costs while adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical factors to aid patient-centered coverage and treatment decision-making. In the second approach, patient utilities are estimated based on the clinically defined health states through which a patient may transition throughout the course of treatment. While this approach is grounded on the widely used Markov transition model, we refine the model to facilitate an enhancement in conducting regression-based analysis to achieve transparent understanding of differences in utilities and costs across diverse patient populations.

This framework matches the situation that nonlife insurance companies are faced with within the scope of premium calculation. Indeed, the risk measure of the collective risk divided by n can be seen as a suitable premium for each of the individual risks. For both estimators asymptotic normality has been obtained recently. Here we derive almost sure bootstrap consistency for both estimators, where we allow for the weighted exchangeable bootstrap and rather general law-invariant risk measures. Both estimators are subject to a relevant negative bias for small to moderate n. For one of them we investigate by means of numerical experiments the benefit of a bootstrap-based bias correction. The numerical experiments are performed for the Value at Risk and the Average Value at Risk, and the results are comparable to those of Kim and Hardy (2007) who did analogous experiments for classical nonparametric plug-in estimators. For the other estimator the benefit of a bootstrap-based bias correction can be ruled out by theoretical arguments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The agent has quasilinear preferences that are additively separable across the various components. We consider a robust version of the principal's problem, in which she knows the marginal distribution of each component of the agent's type, but does not know the joint distribution. Any mechanism is evaluated by its worst-case expected profit, over all joint distributions consistent with the known marginals. We show that the optimum for the principal is simply to screen along each component separately. This result does not require any assumptions (such as single crossing) on the structure of preferences within each component. The proof technique involves a generalization of the concept of virtual values to arbitrary screening problems. Sample applications include monopoly pricing and a stylized dynamic taxation model.","[Carroll, Gabriel] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Landau Econ Bldg,579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Carroll, G (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Landau Econ Bldg,579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",gdc@stanford.edu,,,,,,,58,61,81,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-9682,1468-0262,,ECONOMETRICA,Econometrica,MAR,2017,85.0,2,,,,,453,488,,10.3982/ECTA14165,0.0,,,36,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods; Statistics & Probability",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EX3EM,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403114800004,0

QHawkes models generalize the Hawkes price models introduced in Bacry and Muzy [Quant. Finance, 2014, 14(7), 1147-1166], by allowing feedback effects in the jump intensity that are linear and quadratic in past returns. Our model exhibits two main properties that we believe are crucial in the modelling and the understanding of the volatility process: first, the model is time-reversal asymmetric, similar to financial markets whose time evolution has a preferred direction. Second, it generates a multiplicative, fat-tailed volatility process, that we characterize in detail in the case of exponentially decaying kernels, and which is linked to Pearson diffusions in the continuous limit. Several other interesting properties of QHawkes processes are discussed, in particular the fact that they can generate long memory without necessarily being at the critical point. A non-parametric fit of the QHawkes model on NYSE stock data shows that the off-diagonal component of the quadratic kernel indeed has a structure that standard Hawkes models fail to reproduce. We provide numerical simulations of our calibrated QHawkes model which is indeed seen to reproduce, with only a small amount of quadratic non-linearity, the correct magnitude of fat-tails and time reversal asymmetry seen in empirical time series.","[Blanc, P.; Donier, J.; Bouchaud, J. -P.] Capital Fund Management, 23-25 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France; [Blanc, P.] Univ Paris Est, CERMICS, Projet MATHRISK ENPC INRIA UMLV, 6 & 8 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-77455 Marne La Vallee, France; [Donier, J.] Univ Paris 06, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [Bouchaud, J. -P.] Imperial Coll, CFM Imperial Inst Quantitat Finance, Dept Math, 180 Queens Gate, London SW7 2RH, England",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universite Paris Cite; Sorbonne Universite; Imperial College London,"Donier, J (通讯作者)，Capital Fund Management, 23-25 Rue Univ, F-75007 Paris, France.;Donier, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 06, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.",jonathan.donier@polytechnique.org,,,,,,,46,34,35,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

We provide a bias-corrected LS estimator.

To achieve this objective, we use a panel data regression, which results firstly confirm the direct influence of remittance growth on the growth of aggregate consumption and secondly they provide a basic view of consumption effect of remittances in the specific environment of the Central America region.","[Badura, Ondrej] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Zavacka, Jana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Syst Engn, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Badura, O (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",ondrej.badura@vsb.cz; jana.zavacka1@vsb.cz,"Závacká, Jana/L-2475-2015",,SGS project [SP2016/112]; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],SGS project; Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,This paper has been funded by SGS project No. SP2016/112 Remittances and their influence on macroeconomic and microeconomic indicators and the Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness - Project CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296.,,11,0,0,0,0,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

In markets that contain such bonds, agents optimizing expected utility of consumption and terminal wealth can mitigate their longevity risk. To examine how this influences optimal portfolio strategies and consumption patterns, we define a model in which the death of the agent is represented by a single jump process with Cox Ingersoll Ross intensity. This implies that our stochastic mortality rate is guaranteed to be nonnegative, in contrast to many other models in the literature. We derive explicit conditions for existence of an optimal consumption and investment strategy in terms of model parameters by analysing certain inhomogeneous Riccati equations. We find that constraints must be imposed on the market price of longevity risk to have a well-posed problem and we derive the optimal strategies when such constraints are satisfied.

The concept of backward simulation is presented and it is classified into two types. Under the framework of the second type backward simulation, we seek the solutions for the existing CIR schemes. Specifically, we propose forward-backward simulation approaches for Alfonsi's two implicit schemes, the fixed Euler schemes and the exact scheme. The proposed schemes are numerically tested and compared in pricing American options under the Heston model and the stochastic interest rate model. Some numerical properties such as the convergence order of the explicit-implicit Euler schemes, the storage requirement estimation of the forward-backward exact scheme and its computing time comparison with the squared Bessel bridge are also tested. Finally, the pros and cons of the related backward simulation schemes are summarized.","[Hu, Wenbin] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Junzi] Zhejiang Acad Commerce, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Dianzi University,"Zhou, JZ (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Acad Commerce, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",myzxzjz@zwmail.zcom.gov.cn,,"Zhou, Junzi/0009-0009-1889-662X; Hu, Wenbin/0000-0002-3494-366X",Humanities and Social Science Youth foundation of Ministry of Education of China [16YJCZH031],Humanities and Social Science Youth foundation of Ministry of Education of China,This work was supported by the Humanities and Social Science Youth foundation of Ministry of Education of China under Grant number 16YJCZH031.,,29,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Due to the communication and processing latencies involved in this negotiation, and in a continuously evolving market, the price may have moved by the time the liquidity provider considers the trader's request. At what point has the price moved too far away from the quote originally shown for the liquidity provider to reject the deal request? Or perhaps the request can still be accepted but only on a revised rate? Last look' is the process that makes this decision, i.e. it determines whether to acceptand if so at what rateor reject a trader's deal request subject to the constraints of an agreed trading protocol. In this paper, I study how the execution risk and transaction costs faced by the trader are influenced by the last look logic and choice of trading protocol. I distinguish between various symmetric' and asymmetric' last look designs and consider trading protocols that differ on whether, and if so to what extent, price improvements and slippage can be passed on to the trader. All this is done within a unified framework that allows for a detailed comparative analysis. I present two main findings. Firstly, the choice of last look design and trading protocol determines the degree of execution risk inherent in the process, but the effective transaction costs borne by the trader need not be affected by it. Secondly, when a trader adversely selects the liquidity provider she chooses to deal with, the distinction between the different symmetric and asymmetric last look designs fades and the primary driver of execution risk is the choice of trading protocol.","[Oomen, Roel] Deutsch Bank AG, 1 Great Winchester St, London EC2N 2DB, England; [Oomen, Roel] London Sch Econ, Dept Stat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Deutsche Bank; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Oomen, R (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bank AG, 1 Great Winchester St, London EC2N 2DB, England.;Oomen, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Stat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",roel.oomen@db.com,,,,,,,11,7,8,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1469-7688,1469-7696,,QUANT FINANC,Quant.

Materials and methods: A model is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of KEYNOTE-189 trial comparators pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed) vs chemotherapy alone. Clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility, and safety data are derived from the trial and projected over 20 years. For extrapolating survival beyond the trial, a novel SEER population-data approach is applied (primary analysis), with separate estimation via traditional parametric extrapolation methods. Costs for drugs and non-drug disease management are also incorporated. Based on an indirect treatment comparison, cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs pembrolizumab monotherapy is evaluated for patients with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) >= 50%. Results: In the full non-squamous population, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy is projected to increase life expectancy by 2.04 years vs chemotherapy (3.96 vs 1.92), for an approximate doubling of life years. Resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are $104,823/QALY and $87,242/life year. In patients with PD-L1 >= 50% and 1-49%, life expectancy is more than doubled (4.53 vs 1.88 years) and (4.87 vs 2.01 years), with a 32% (2.60 vs 1.97 years) increase in PD-L1 < 1% patients. Corresponding incremental costs/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) are $103,402, $66,837, and $183,529 for PD-L1 >= 50%, 1-49%, and <1% groups, respectively. Versus pembrolizumab monotherapy in PD-L1 >= 50% patients, representing current standard of care, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy increases life expectancy by 65% (4.53 vs 2.74 years) at an ICER of $147,365/QALY. Limitations and conclusions: The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to extend life expectancy to a point not previously seen in previously untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.

The model decomposes the grouped traffic time series into the latent common factor component and idiosyncratic component. It uses a few latent factor series to represent the co-movement of the underlying dynamics of grouped traffic flows, and idiosyncratic component to represent location-specific traffic characteristics. The dynamic factor model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method via an iterative EM (expectation maximization) algorithm. The traffic state forecast for each location is a combination of the respective forecast from the common factor component and idiosyncratic component. The dynamic factor model exhibits four advantages. It provides an excellent way to (1) seamlessly incorporate spatial correlations among grouped traffic flows into forecast; (2) produce forecast simultaneously for group locations; (3) perform dimension reduction such that high dimension grouped traffic time series can be modeled at a low-dimension space; (4) consider not only location-specific information but also global common dynamics in the forecast Meanwhile, it also has capacity to accommodate typical characteristics of traffic flows including temporal correlation, seasonality, structural change in mean and/or covariance function, and cointegration. Forecast accuracy is significantly improved across highway network as well as urban road network in comparison with the Sparse VAR and ARIMA models. The proposed method is suitable for large-scale network traffic forecast in the context of big data environment This research provides sufficient evidence that justified the importance and efficacy of spatial correlation for predictive accuracy and attempts to fill the gaps in literature of traffic forecast for groups of locations.

However, the common problem of missing initial observations in longitudinal data collection can lead to inconsistent estimates of perceived value of attributes in question, and thus inconsistent parameter estimates. In this paper, the stated problem is addressed by treating the missing observations as latent variables in an instance-based learning model that is estimated via maximum simulated likelihood (MSL). The MSL method is implemented in practice using random sampling and importance sampling. Monte Carlo experimentation based on synthetic data shows that both the MSL with random sampling (MSLrs) and MSL with importance sampling (MSLis) are effective in correcting for the endogeneity problem in that the percent error and empirical coverage of the estimators are greatly improved after the correction. Compared to the MSLrs method, the MSLis method is superior in both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Furthermore, MSLis passes a formal statistical test for the recovery of the population values up to a scale with a large number of missing observations, while MSLrs systematically fails due to the curse of dimensionality. The impacts of sampling size in MSLrs and number of high probability choice sequences in MSLis on the methods' performances are investigated the methods are applied to an experimental route-choice dataset to demonstrate their empirical application. Hausman-McFadden tests show that the estimators after correction are statistically equal to the estimators of the full dataset without missing observations, confirming that the proposed methods are practical and effective for addressing the stated problem.

While the Logit Mixture model with random parameters is mostly used to account for variation across individuals, preferences may also vary across different choice situations of the same individual. Up to this point. Logit Mixtures incorporating both inter- and intra-consumer heterogeneity are estimated with the classical Maximum Simulated Likelihood (MSL) procedure. The MSL procedure becomes computationally expensive with an increasing sample size and can be burdensome in the presence of a multi-modal likelihood function. We therefore propose a Hierarchical Bayes estimator for Logit Mixtures with both levels of heterogeneity. It builds on the Allenby-Train procedure, which considers only inter-consumer heterogeneity. To test the proposed procedures, we analyze how well the true patterns of heterogeneity are recovered in a simulation environment. Results from the Monte Carlo simulation suggest that falsely ignoring intra-consumer heterogeneity despite its presence in the data leads to biased estimates and a decreased goodness of fit. The latter is confirmed by a real-world example of explaining mode choices for GPS traces. We further show that the runtime of the proposed estimator is substantially faster than for the corresponding MSL estimator. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The procedure consist of two consecutive and independent processes: (1) estimate point observations of the cumulative vehicle number in space-time, i.e., N(x, t), based on relative flow data from the observers and (2) estimate flow and density in a pre-define space-time mesh based on the point observations of N. In this paper, the principles behind the first process are explained and a methodology (the Point-Observations N (PON) estimation methodology) is introduced for the second process. This methodology does not incorporate information in the form of a traffic flow model or historical data. To evaluate this performance and improve our understanding of the methodology, a microscopic simulation study is conducted. The estimation performance is effected by the homogeneity and stationarity of traffic in estimation area and in the sample area. In case of large changes in traffic conditions, e.g., from free-flow to congestion or stop-and-go waves, a better sampling resolution will improve localizing these changes in space and time and hence improve the estimation performance. In the simulation study, the proposed methodology is also compared with estimates based on loop-detector data. This indicates that the combination of the proposed methodology and data yields an alternative for existing combinations of methodology and data. Especially, in terms of density estimation the introduced methodology shows promising results. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

The empirical model is developed for modelling high school student escort and travel mode choices. The development of the model uncovered issues with an existing group decision model, the multi-linear logit, that has recently been applied to similar decision contexts. The paper proposes an expanded formulation of parallel constrained choices logit model as an alternative to the multi-linear logit. The proposed model explicitly considers both the choice of mode of the students and commuting adults within the household and how those decisions change in response to household escort decisions. This structure is powerful as it allows both individual and group level decisions to be jointly modelled. The application of the model in this paper is generalized such that any number of adults can be accommodated within the modelling structure whereas previous studies have been limited to either two adults or two workers. The key findings of the analysis include a certain degree of altruism (or dedication) from adults to household children. This altruism which is captured indirectly within the modelling framework based on a lower utility weight for the adults in the household relative to the utility weight for household children.

An optimal sensor location scheme can obtain reliable route travel time information. Most current travel-time-oriented sensor location models are deterministic and assume a given and correct travel time probability density function. Nevertheless, due to widespread observational and systematic errors, prior travel time information is not accurate or reliable. In our study, a novel data-driven link-based network sensor location method is proposed to maximize travel time information gain. The effect of route differentiation is considered, and the sensors are located at links rather than at nodes. In addition. to account for the uncertainty in the prior travel time distribution, the distributionally robust travel time information gain sensor location (DRTTIGSL) model is presented. The prior distribution information is taken into account based on a statistical measure called phi-divergence. The phi-divergence is used to construct the uncertainty set. The reformulation of DRTTIGSL is dependent on the choice of phi-divergence and is tractable. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the DRTTIGSL model. Compared with the optimal solutions for the deterministic model, the optimal solutions for the DRTTIGSL model can reduce the worst-case situation with a small price of the average objective value, especially when the total budget is not large.

The ability to detect such changes is critical for developing behavior models that are adaptive over time. We define travel pattern changes as abrupt, substantial, and persistent changes in the underlying patterns of travel behavior and develop a methodology to detect such changes in individual travel patterns. We specify one distribution for each of the three dimensions of travel behavior (the frequency of travel, time of travel, and origins/destinations), and interpret the change of the parameters of the distributions as indicating the occurrence of a pattern change. A Bayesian method is developed to estimate the probability that a pattern change occurs at any given time for each behavior dimension. The proposed methodology is tested using pseudonymized smart card records of 3210 users from London, U.K. over two years. The results show that the method can successfully identify significant changepoints in travel patterns. Compared to the traditional generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) approach, the Bayesian method requires less predefined parameters and is more robust. The methodology presented in this paper is generalizable and can be applied to detect changes in other aspects of travel behavior and human behavior in general. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Commuters are assumed to travel by auto or bus from their home locations to their workplace located in the city center through a ring-radial routing system. Auto users must pay tolls when passing through the cordons installed on the radial major roads. The multimodal two-dimensional urban system equilibrium is first formulated and its properties are analytically explored. A social welfare maximization model that simultaneously determines the optimal cordon toll location, toll level, bus service frequency and fare on each radial major road is then proposed. The effects of different tolling schemes (uniform and differential cordon-based, first-best, and no toll) on the multimodal urban system are also examined and compared. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The study develops mixed-integer linear programming models for various maintenance strategies that are commonly adopted in practice and in the literature. In developing these models, traffic, pavement age, and maintenance actions with heterogeneous effects are considered. The strategies include optimization-based, worst-first, best-first, and threshold based strategies. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework and present a practical situation in which engineering judgment is sometimes incorporated in pavement maintenance strategies, we further develop a mixed strategy. A solution procedure combining the off-shelf mixed-integer programming solver, greedy algorithms, and Lagrangian relaxation algorithms is developed to efficiently solve the models. Finally, a numerical example of a hypothetical network is established. Different maintenance strategies are applied given different budget levels, traffic loadings, and initial pavement conditions. The results of the numerical example are reasonable, and they provide insights into the efficient implementation of maintenance strategies. Results also show that the framework has the potential to aid maintenance agencies in evaluating maintenance strategies before they are implemented, improving pavement conditions, and reducing the budget for transportation infrastructure.

The objective of this study was to evaluate healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with XR-NTX compared with alternative treatments for opioid dependence.Methods: Adults with a diagnosis of opioid dependence who initiated treatment with XR-NTX, BUP, MET, or NPT between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2014 were identified in the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial administrative claims database. Healthcare resource utilization, costs (inpatient [IP], emergency department [ED], outpatient [OP], and pharmacy) and adherence were evaluated for each cohort during 12-month baseline and follow-up periods.Results: A total of 29,235 patients were included in the analysis; 1,041, 20,566, 745, and 6,883 received XR-NTX, BUP, MET, and NPT, respectively. Patients in the XR-NTX cohort were significantly younger and had more comorbidities compared with the other cohorts. Patients in the XR-NTX group had the largest percentage decrease in IP and ED utilization and costs from baseline to follow-up. OP and pharmacy costs increased significantly from baseline to follow-up for all cohorts. Overall, there was no significant change in total healthcare costs for the XR-NTX group, whereas the costs increased significantly for other groups (BUP=+43%, MET=+47.7%, NPT=+38.8%).Conclusions: Healthcare resource utilization and costs increased from baseline to follow-up in BUP, MET, and NPT patients, whereas patients receiving XR-NTX experienced no such increase.

ACCESS also has an education component in which hospitals receive training from stroke specialists on the triage and treatment of patients. This study assessed the clinical and economic outcomes of the ACCESS program in providing services to rural New Mexico from a healthcare payer perspective.Methods: A decision tree model was constructed using findings from the ACCESS program and existing literature, the likelihood that a patient will receive a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), cost of care, and resulting quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Data from the ACCESS program includes emergency room patients in rural New Mexico from May 2015 to August 2016. Outcomes and costs have been estimated for patients who were taken to a hospital providing neurological telecare and patients who were not.Results: The use of ACCESS decreased neuro-emergent stroke patient transfers from rural hospitals to urban settings from 85% to 5% (no tPA) and 90% to 23% (tPA), while stroke specialist reading of patient CT/MRI imaging within 3h of onset of stroke symptoms increased from 2% to 22%. Results indicate that use of ACCESS has the potential to save $4,241 ($3,952-$4,438) per patient and increase QALYs by 0.20 (0.14-0.22). This increase in QALYs equates to approximate to 73 more days of life at full health. The cost savings and QALYs are expected to increase when moving from a 90-day model to a lifetime model.Conclusion: The analysis demonstrates potential savings and improved quality-of-life associated with the use of ACCESS for patients presenting to rural hospitals with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).","[Whetten, Justin; van der Goes, David N.; Moffett, Maurice] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Huy Tran; Semper, Colin; Yonas, Howard] Univ New Mexico, Dept Neurosurg, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico,"Whetten, J (通讯作者)，1915 Roma Ave NE, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",whetten@unm.edu,,"Assouline Dayan, Yehudith/0000-0002-2851-6629","Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [1C1CMS331351]","Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services","This publication was made possible by Grant Number 1C1CMS331351 from the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

Assuming perfect model knowledge and perfect traffic demand prediction, the ramp metering problem can be cast as a finite horizon optimal control problem with the objective of minimizing the Total Time Spent, i.e., the sum of the travel times of all drivers. For this reason, the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to the ramp metering problem has been proposed. However, practical tests on freeways show that MPC may not outperform simple, distributed feedback policies. Until now, a theoretical justification for this empirical observation was lacking. This work compares the performance of distributed, non-predictive policies to the optimal solution in an idealised setting, specifically, for monotonic traffic dynamics and assuming perfect model knowledge. To do so, we suggest a distributed, non-predictive policy and derive sufficient optimality conditions for the minimization of the Total Time Spent via monotonicity arguments. In a case study based on real-world traffic data, we demonstrate that these optimality conditions are only rarely violated. Moreover, we observe that the suboptimality resulting from such infrequent violations appears to be negligible. We complement this analysis with simulations in non-ideal settings, in particular allowing for model mismatch, and argue that Alinea, a successful, distributed ramp metering policy, comes close to the ideal controller both in terms of control behavior and in performance.

In this field, mainly two research streams can be identified. On the one hand, train scheduling models are designed to include all conditions relevant to feasible and efficient operation of rail services, from the viewpoint of operations managers. On the other hand, delay management models focus on the impact of rescheduling decisions on the quality of service perceived by the passengers. Models in the first stream are mainly microscopic, while models in the second stream are mainly macroscopic. This paper aims at merging these two streams of research by developing microscopic passenger-centric models, solution algorithms and lower bounds. Several fast heuristic methods are proposed, based on alternative decompositions of the model. A lower bound is proposed, consisting of the resolution of a set of min-cost flow problems with activation constraints. Computational experiments, based on multiple test cases of the real-world Dutch railway network, show that good quality solutions and lower bounds can be found within a limited computation time.

In general, this limitation is overcome by introducing planned detours to battery charging stations. Most existing E-VRP models assume that the battery-charge level is a linear function of the charging time, but in reality the function is nonlinear. In this paper we extend current E-VRP models to consider nonlinear charging functions. We propose a hybrid metaheuristic that combines simple components from the literature and components specifically designed for this problem. To assess the importance of nonlinear charging functions, we present a computational study comparing our assumptions with those commonly made in the literature. Our results suggest that neglecting nonlinear charging may lead to infeasible or overly expensive solutions. Furthermore, to test our hybrid metaheuristic we propose a new 120-instance testbed.

This paper addresses TOD investment issue in terms of the location, number and size of the TOD zones along a rail line. An urban system equilibrium problem with TOD investment is first formulated. Two social welfare maximization models, which take into account different investment regimes for TOD projects (i.e., public and private), are then proposed for optimizing TOD investment schemes along a rail line and train service frequency on that line. In the public regime model, the government is responsible for the investment cost of TOD projects, which is borne by the private property developers in the private regime model. The proposed models explicitly consider the interactions among the government, property developers and households in the urban system, together with the effects of the TOD investment on households' residential location choices and housing market. The population thresholds for investing in a TOD project under the public and private regimes are also identified. The findings show that the TOD investment can cause population agglomeration at the TOD zones and a compact city; households and the society can benefit from the TOD investment; and the private TOD investment regime outperforms the public regime in terms of total social welfare of urban system.

Spreading the trains well in time and space in these areas has a big impact on the passenger robustness, i.e. the total travel time in practice of all passengers in the railway network in case of frequently occurring small delays. We focus on improving the performance in the bottleneck of the network in order to improve the performance of the whole railway network. This paper proposes a method that builds from scratch a routing plan and a cyclic timetable that optimizes the infrastructure occupation and the passenger robustness. An integer linear routing model assigns, without considering a timetable, every train to a route such that the maximal node usage is minimized and that the number of times that each node is used, is quadratically penalized. Thereafter, a mixed integer linear timetabling model assigns to each train the blocking times at which the nodes on its route, assigned by the routing model, are reserved and released. Different from other approaches is that we focus on the occupation of the railway infrastructure before constructing the timetable. The approach is validated on the complex railway station area of Brussels (Belgium). Our routing plan and timetable from scratch improve the passenger robustness up to 11% compared to a reference timetable and routing plan composed by the Belgian railway infrastructure manager Infrabel and by up to 2% compared to a reference timetable and routing plan from literature.

The problem of choosing the extent, specific system components, and timing of these investments over a long time horizon (e.g., 40-60 years) is modeled as a multi-stage, stochastic, bi-level, mixed-integer program wherein cost-effective investment decisions are taken in the upper level. The effects of possible episodic precipitation events on experienced travel delays are estimated from solution of a lower-level, traffic equilibrium problem. The episodic events and longer-term sea level changes exist on different time scales, making their integration a crucial element in model development. The optimal investment strategy is obtained at a Stackelberg equilibrium that is reached upon solution to the bilevel program. A recursive noisy genetic algorithm (rNGA), designed to address large-scale applications, is proposed for this purpose. The rNGA seeks the optimal combination of investment decisions to take now given only probabilistic information on the predicted sea level rise trend for a long planning horizon and associated likely extreme climatic events (in terms of their frequencies and intensities) that might arise over that planning period. The proposed solution method enables the evaluation of decisions concerning where, when and to what level to make infrastructure investments. The proposed rNGA has broad applicability to more general multi-stage, stochastic, bilevel, nonconvex, mixed integer programs that arise in many applications. The proposed solution methodology is demonstrated on an example representing a portion of the Washington, D.C. Greater Metropolitan area adjacent to the Potomac River. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand how to price this service, we formulate a two-sided platform's profit maximization problem by considering network externality. We focus on three pricing strategies, membership-based pricing, transaction-based pricing, and cross subsidization. When time discounting is absent and consumers' order frequency is price-insensitive, it is shown that these three strategies are equivalent. As membership-based pricing collects money the earliest and maximize price-sensitive order frequency, our analysis explains some platforms' promotion of it. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For the general multi-criteria case, we propose a decomposition procedure and theoretically prove that this method can identify all the Pareto-optimal paths from at most (u - 1)!|P| candidate paths, where u is the number of criteria.

Existing researches on collaborative development are mainly based on methodology of non-weighted static network, and assume that innovative search is independent with knowledge transfer and knowledge creation. This paper, based on scale-free network, establishes a new model to more precisely describe the process and behaviors of collaborative development for complex equipment, which includes innovation search, knowledge transfer and knowledge creation. By using simulation modeling, this paper investigates the dynamic mechanism of knowledge growth in the collaborative network, and probes the impact of innovation search on the performance of the collaborative development network. It is found that different strategies of innovation search have almost the same evolution path in the collaborative development network, and a similar equilibrium will be reached no matter what kind of search strategy is used. There is an inverted U-shape relationship between the tie density and the average knowledge stock (AKS) in the collaborative network, whereas network relation strength is positively correlated with the AKS. It is proved that strategies of innovation search significantly influence the AKS and the level of knowledge innovation in collaborative development environment.","[Zhang, Zhuo; Xu, Min] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Zhang, Z (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhangzhuo@nuaa.edu.cn; 823762438@qq.com,,,Jiangsu Social Science Foundation [15GLA001]; China National Social Science Foundation [16BTQ080],Jiangsu Social Science Foundation; China National Social Science Foundation,"This work was supported in part by the Jiangsu Social Science Foundation under grant No. 15GLA001, and China National Social Science Foundation under grant No. 16BTQ080.",,27,0,0,0,5,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6668-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,385,392,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ7HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427285800080,0

The Solopath device is an expandable vascular access system that has previously been shown to be associated with lower rates of vascular complications. This study sought to evaluate the impact of the use of this system on vascular complications and costs in a decision model analysis. Methods: A cost-consequence analysis was undertaken utilizing event rate data from the PARTNER trials and a published retrospective analysis of the Solopath device. The decision model estimated costs and benefits in a hypothetical cohort of patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI using either a standard sheath or Solopath. The modeled analysis compared the occurrence of vascular complications and mortality at 30 days and 1 year using TreeAge Pro. Results: The decision model demonstrated that use of the Solopath sheath resulted in 36 fewer major vascular complications, three fewer deaths at 30 days, and five fewer deaths at 1 year, resulting in a discounted cost savings of $846 CDN. Results were sensitive to decreasing rates of vascular complications with newer generation devices, however maintained modest cost-savings. Conclusions: Reduction in vascular complications is an important part of improving care for TAVI patients. The Solopath vascular access device offers an alternative to standard sheaths with a potential reduction in complications and cost-savings.","[Asgar, Anita W.; Pighi, Michele; Dorval, Jean-Francois; Ibrahim, Reda; Bonan, Raoul] Univ Montreal, Inst Cardiol Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Millan, Xavi] Hosp Santa Creu & Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain; [Kha, Razi] Royal Columbian Hosp, New Westminster, BC, Canada; [Azzalini, Lorenzo] Ist Sci San Raffaele, Milan, Italy",Universite de Montreal; Institut de Cardiologie de Montreal; Hospital of Santa Creu i Sant Pau; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele,"Asgar, AW (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Inst Cardiol Montreal, Dept Cardiol, 5000 Rue Belanger, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",anita.asgar@umontreal.ca,"Ibrahim, Reda/AAX-7882-2021; Pighi, Michele/AAH-8799-2020; MILLAN, XAVIER/M-9274-2017","Pighi, Michele/0000-0003-3703-3837; Azzalini, Lorenzo/0000-0001-9758-0360; MILLAN, XAVIER/0000-0001-6519-4190",,,,,12,2,2,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this paper, we present a new mathematical model to optimize flights' 4D-trajectories. This is a multi-objective binary integer programming (IP) model, which assigns a 4D-trajectory to each flight, while explicitly modeling priorities and highlighting the trade off involved with the Airspace Users (AUs) preferences. The scope of the model (to be used at pre-tactical level) is the computation of optimal 4D pre-departure trajectory for each flight to be shared or negotiated with other stakeholders and subsequently managed throughout the flight. These trajectories are obtained by minimising the deviation (delay and re-routing) from the original preferred 4D-trajectories as well as minimizing the air navigation service (ANS) charges subject to the constraints of the system. Computational results for the model are presented, which show that the proposed model has the ability to identify trade-offs between the objectives of the stakeholders of the ATM system under the TBO concept. This can therefore provide the ATM stakeholders with useful decision tools to choose a trajectory for each flight.

The framework formulates the information-based stochastic user equilibrium (ISUE) dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem for a multiple origin-destination (OD) network. Using the framework, we prove the linkage between the user equilibrium (UE) and system optimal (SO) solutions underpinned by the first-in-first out (FIFO) principle. This important property then enables us to develop an incremental loading method to obtain the ISUE solutions efficiently by solving a sequence of linear programs. Moreover, the proposed method is more scalable that avoids a huge enumeration of paths in large-scale networks as done in path-based methods of the existing literature on this topic. We show via numerical examples the impact of information on both route choices and network performance, and demonstrate the significant improvements in the obtained ISUE solution both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

Traditional anti-bunching methods considering only regularization of spacings might unnecessarily slow down buses en route. In this work a detailed but computationally lightweight dynamical model of a single line bus transport system involving both continuous and binary states is developed. Furthermore a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed, with a dual objective of regularizing spacings and improving speed of bus service operations. Performance of the predictive controller is compared with I- and Pl-controllers via extensive simulations using the proposed model. Results indicate the potential of the hybrid MPC in avoiding bus bunching and decreasing passenger delays inside and outside the buses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a model-based practical framework to predict future occupancy from historical occupancy data alone. The framework consists of two modules: estimation of model parameters, and occupancy prediction. At the core of the predictive framework, a queuing model is employed to describe the stochastic occupancy change of a parking facility. While the underlying queuing model can be any reasonable model, we demonstrate the framework with the well-established continuous-time Markov M\M\C\C queue in this paper. The possibility of adopting a different queuing model that can potentially incorporate the parking searching process is also discussed. The parameter estimation module and the occupancy prediction module are both built on the underlying queuing model. To apply the estimation and prediction methods in real world, a few practical considerations are accounted for in the framework with methods to handle variations of arrival and departure patterns from day to day and within a day, including special events. The proposed framework and models are validated using both simulated and real data. Our San Francisco case studies demonstrate that the parameters estimated offline can lead to accurate predictions of parking facility occupancy both with and without real-time update. We also performed extensive numerical experiments to compare the proposed framework and methods with several pure machine-learning methods in recent literature. It is found that our approach delivers equal or better performance, but requires a computation time that is orders of magnitude less to tune and train the model. Additionally, our approach can predict for any time in the future with one training process, while pure machine-learning methods have to train a specific model for a different prediction interval to achieve the same level of accuracy.

A solution method of branch-and-cut guided search algorithm is developed. Computational results from instances adapted from benchmarks of production routing problems show that, the algorithm is more effective when pickup requests are relative high. The problem is also easier to solve when production or transportation costs are lower. The optimal decisions are insensitive to the location of remanufacturing depot whether it is geographically centered or centered with gravity.","[Qiu, Yuzhuo; Ni, Ming; Wang, Liang; Li, Qinqin; Fang, Xuanjing] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Mkt & Logist Management, Jiangsu Key Lab Modern Logist, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Yuzhuo; Pardalos, Panos M.] Univ Florida, Fac Engn, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Qiu, YZ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Mkt & Logist Management, Jiangsu Key Lab Modern Logist, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yzqiu@nufe.edu.cn; 9120161002@nufe.edu.cn; 9120061053@nufe.edu.cn; 9120151023@nufe.edu.cn; 1120160533@nufe.edu.cn; pardalos@ufl.edu,"liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023; Qiu, Yuzhuo/O-8727-2019; Pardalos, Panos/AAY-8591-2020","Qiu, Yuzhuo/0000-0002-9772-1546;",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71571092]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); General Research Project for Humanities and Social Sciences from Chinese Ministry of Education [11YJCZH137]; Paul and Heidi Brown Professorship,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); General Research Project for Humanities and Social Sciences from Chinese Ministry of Education; Paul and Heidi Brown Professorship,This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 71571092.

Materials and methods: Patients aged >= 18 years with a primary diagnosis of AF undergoing ablation treatment using the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH catheter between January 2014 and June 2016 were identified from the Premier hospital database with the first date of such a procedure being defined as the index date. Hospital volume of prior THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH catheter use was determined during the 12-month pre-index period, and was classified into five groups: no volume (0), low volume (1-50), mid volume (51-100), high volume (101-150), and very high volume (>= 151). Outcomes, including length of stay (LOS; for inpatient procedure only), hospital costs (total, hospital pharmacy, supply), and all-cause re-admission were evaluated. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) with exchangeable correlation structure was used to examine the impact of hospital volume on LOS, hospital costs, and re-admissions controlling for hospital clustering and other covariates. Results: The study population included 640 hospitalized AF patients. The adjusted mean LOS was significantly shorter in very high-volume hospitals than hospitals with no volume (mean LOS 2.30 vs 4.33 days; p = .0377). As volume increased, the mean adjusted supply cost tended to decrease, although these changes emerged as non-significant. The 12-month all-cause re-admission was significantly lower among patients undergoing ablation in low (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.27; confidence interval [CI] = 0.08-0.85) and mid (OR = 0.12; CI = 0.02-0.61) volume hospitals compared to hospitals with no volume. Limitations: Study results may not be generalizable to all US hospitals. Conclusions: Among AF patients undergoing ablation, increased hospital volume of prior THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH catheter use was associated with shorter LOS and a lower likelihood of all-cause re-admission.","[Barnow, Andrea; Goldstein, Laura] Johnson & Johnson Med Devices, Irvine, CA USA; [Kalsekar, Iftekhar; Khanna, Rahul] Johnson & Johnson, Epidemiol, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Liao, Ray] Janssen R&D US, Raritan, NJ USA",Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Khanna, R (通讯作者)，410 George St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",rkhann14@its.jnj.com,,,Johnson and Johnson,Johnson and Johnson(Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson USA),This study was sponsored by Johnson and Johnson.,,16,1,1,1,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: A questionnaire was developed to capture the demographics, disease characteristics, healthcare use, informal care, employment, and wellbeing. Referencing international studies, standardized survey instruments were included (e.g. CSRI, MFIS-5, EQ-5D) or adapted (EDSS) for inclusion in an online survey platform. Recruitment was directed at people with MS via the MS Society mailing list and social media platforms, as well as in traditional media. The economic costing was primarily conducted using a bottom-up' methodology, and national estimates were achieved using prevalence-based' extrapolation. Results: A total of 594 people completed the survey in full. The sample had geographic, disease, and demographic characteristics indicating good representativeness. At an individual level, average societal cost was estimated at (sic)47,683; the average annual costs for those with mild, moderate, and severe MS were calculated as (sic)34,942, (sic)57,857, and (sic)100,554, respectively. For a total Irish MS population of 9,000, the total societal costs of MS amounted to (sic)429m. Direct costs accounted for just 30% of the total societal costs, indirect costs amounted to 50% of the total, and intangible or QoL costs represented 20%. The societal cost associated with a relapse in the sample is estimated as (sic)2,438. Limitations and conclusions: The findings highlight that up to 70% of the total costs associated with MS are not routinely counted. These hidden costs are higher in Ireland than the rest of Europe, due in part to significantly lower levels of workforce participation, a higher likelihood of permanent workforce withdrawal, and higher levels of informal care needs. The relationship between disease progression and costs emphasize the societal importance of managing and slowing the progression of the illness.","[Carney, Peter; McGuigan, Christopher; O'Rourke, Killian] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; [Carney, Peter; O'Boyle, Derek] Novartis Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [Larkin, Aidan] Multiple Sclerosis Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; [McGuigan, Christopher] St Vincents Univ Hosp, Dublin, Ireland; [O'Rourke, Killian] Mater Hosp, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin; Novartis; University College Dublin; Saint Vincent's University Hospital; University College Dublin; Mater Misericordiae University Hospital,"Carney, P (通讯作者)，Novartis Ireland Ltd, Vista Bldg,Elm Pk Campus,Merrion Rd, Dublin D04 A9N6 4, Ireland.",peterjcarney@gmail.com,,,Novartis Ireland [IE02/NEU16-CNF017],Novartis Ireland(NovartisNOVARTIS IRELAND),The study was part-funded by Novartis Ireland.

One of the most fundamental problems faced by community ecologists is how to measure the population sizes and distributions of plant species. In the northern Savanna region, the survival of tree species is being threatened by changes in climate and human activities. This chapter examines the diversity of woody tree species in terms of the size of the population and pattern of dispersion in household farmlands and open parklands in the Talensi area of the Upper East Region of Ghana. In total, 839 individual woody trees (652 in household farmlands and 187 in open parklands) belonging to 78 species were identified. The commonly identified species were Adansonia digitata L., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn, Diospyros mespiliformis Hochst. ex A. Rich, Ficus trichopoda Baker, Lannea acida A. Rich, and Mangifera indica L. The variance-to-mean ratios determined for household farmlands and open parklands were 8.97 and 8.99 respectively, indicating clumped dispersion patterns for these tree species in both land types. The findings of this chapter provide a good foundation for ecologists, foresters, developers, and others who are trying to understand the state of tree resources in Ghana in this era of changing climate in order to develop appropriate mitigation strategies.","[Chimsah, Francis Azumah; Dittoh, Joseph Saa] UDS, Fac Agr, Nyankpala Campus, Tamale, Ghana; [Dzomeku, Israel Kwame] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Agron, Tamale, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Chimsah, FA (通讯作者)，UDS, Fac Agr, Nyankpala Campus, Tamale, Ghana.",fachimsah@uds.edu.gh,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,137,148,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_8,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300008,0

Costs arise from increased healthcare spending and work-related social benefits, while smoking itself provides significant revenue for government from tobacco taxes. To better understand the public economic impact of smoking and smoking cessation therapies, this study developed a government perspective framework for assessing smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality and associated public costs. This framework includes changes in lifetime tax revenue and health costs, as well as changes in tobacco tax revenue, from fewer smokers. Methods: A modified generational accounting framework was developed to assess relationships between smoking-attributable morbidity and mortality and public economic consequences of smoking, including lifetime tax revenue gains/losses, government social transfers, and health spending. Based on the current prevalence of smoking in South Korean males, a cohort model was developed for smokers, former-smokers, and never-smokers. The model simulated the lifetime discounted fiscal transfers for different age cohorts in 5 year age bands, and the return on investment (ROI) from smoking cessation therapy. Results: Former smokers are estimated to generate higher lifetime earnings and direct tax revenues and lower lifetime healthcare costs due to the reduction of smoking-attributable mortality and morbidity compared to smokers, even after accounting for reduced tobacco taxes paid. Based on the costs of public investments in varenicline, this study estimated a ROI from 1.4-1.7, depending on treatment age, with higher ROI in younger cohorts, with an average ROI of 1.6 for those aged less than 65. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that reductions in smoking can generate positive public economic benefits for government, even after accounting for lost tobacco tax revenues. The results described here are likely applicable to countries having similar underlying smoking prevalence, comparable taxation rates, and social benefit protection provided to individuals with smoking-related conditions.","[Connolly, Mark P.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit PharmacoEpidemiol & PharmacoEcon, Groningen, Netherlands; [Connolly, Mark P.; Kotsopoulos, Nikolaos] Global Market Access Solut, St Prex, Switzerland; [Baker, Christine L.] Pfizer Inc, Patient & Hlth Impact, New York, NY USA; [Kotsopoulos, Nikolaos] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, Athens, Greece",University of Groningen; Pfizer; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Connolly, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm PharmacoEcon & PharmacoEpidemiol, NL-9713 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",m.connolly@rug.nl,,"KOTSOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS/0000-0002-8248-7697","Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY","Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY(Pfizer)","This study was sponsored by Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY.",,28,1,1,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study elicited, using best-worst scaling (BWS), what HTA experts in Colombia consider to be the most important barriers and facilitators in the use of HTA, and makes a comparison to results from the Netherlands. Methods: Two object case surveys (one for barriers, one for facilitators) were conducted among 18 experts (policymakers, health professionals, PhD students, senior HTA-researchers) from Colombia. Seven respondents were employees of the national HTA agency Instituto de Evaluacion Tecnologica de Salud (IETS). In total, 22 barriers and 19 facilitators were included. In each choice task, participants were asked to choose the most and least important barrier/facilitator from a set of five. Hierarchical Bayes modeling was used to compute the mean relative importance scores (RIS) for each factor, and a subgroup analysis was conducted to assess differences between IETS and non-IETS respondents. The final ranking was further compared to the results from a similar study conducted in the Netherlands. Results: The three most important barriers (RIS >6.00) were Inadequate presentation format, Absence of policy networks, and Insufficient legal support. The six most important facilitators (RIS >6.00) were Appropriate timing, Clear presentation format, Improving longstanding relation, Appropriate incentives, Sufficient qualified human resources, and Availability to relevant HTA research. The perceived relevance of the barriers and facilitators differed slightly between IETS and non-IETS employees, while the differences between the rankings in Colombia and the Netherlands were substantial. Conclusion: The study suggests that barriers and facilitators related to technical aspects of processing HTA reports and to the contact and interaction between researchers and policymakers had the greatest importance in Colombia.","[Dams, Florian] Maastricht Univ, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Dams, Florian] Univ Bern, Ctr Competence Publ Management, Bern, Switzerland; [Dams, Florian] Sitem Insel AG, Swiss Inst Translat & Entrepreneurial Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Gonzalez Rodriguez, Javier Leonardo] Univ Rosario, Campus Sede Norte, Bogota, Colombia; [Cheung, Kei Long; Wijnen, Ben F.

Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study (NCT01564537), 722 patients with RRMM following 1-3 prior lines of therapy received Rd plus ixazomib (ixazomib-Rd; n = 360) or matching placebo (placebo-Rd; n = 362) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Healthcare resource utilization data were captured on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle, every 4 weeks during follow-up for progression-free survival, and every 12 weeks during subsequent follow-up, and included medical encounters (length of stay, inpatient, outpatient, and reason) and number of missing days from work or other activities for patients and caregivers. Results: Exposure-adjusted rates of hospitalization were similar between the ixazomib-Rd and placebo-Rd arms, at 0.530 and 0.564 per patient year (ppy), respectively, as were outpatient visit rates (3.305 and 3.355 ppy). Mean length of hospitalization per patient was 10.0 and 10.8 days, respectively. In both arms, hospitalization and outpatient visit rates were higher in patients with two or three prior lines of treatment (ixazomib-Rd: 0.632 and 3.909 ppy; placebo-Rd: 0.774 and 3.539 ppy) compared with patients with one prior line (ixazomib-Rd: 0.460 and 2.888 ppy; placebo-Rd: 0.436 and 3.243 ppy). Patients and their caregivers who missed any work or other activity missed a median of 7 and 5 days in the ixazomib-Rd arm, respectively, vs 8 and 4 days with placebo-Rd. Limitations: The study was not powered for a statistical comparison of healthcare resource utilization between treatment arms, nor did it capture costs associated with utilization of the identified healthcare resources. Conclusions: This pre-specified analysis demonstrated that the all-oral triplet regimen of ixazomib added to Rd did not increase healthcare resource utilization compared with placebo-Rd.","[Hari, Parameswaran] Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Med, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA; [Lin, Huamao Mark; Zhu, Yanyan; Berg, Deborah] Millennium Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Richardson, Paul G.] Dana Farber Canc Inst, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Moreau, Philippe] Univ Hosp Hotel Dieu, Nantes, France",Medical College of Wisconsin; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Millennium Pharmaceuticals; Harvard University; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Nantes Universite; CHU de Nantes,"Hari, P (通讯作者)，Med Coll Wisconsin, Dept Med, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.",phari@mcw.edu,,"moreau, philippe/0000-0003-1780-8746","Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited","Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd); Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd)","This study was funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

Molecular monitoring assists in the timely detection of primary or secondary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and is a recommended practice by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. An economic model was developed to estimate the potential impact of CML monitoring vs lack of monitoring on patient healthcare costs. Methods: An Excel-based decision-analytic economic model was developed from a US payer perspective. The model was used to estimate the expected healthcare cost differences between regular molecular monitoring of CML patients and lack of monitoring. CML progression rates among patients with vs without monitoring, the annual cost of CML progression, the average number of monitoring tests per year, and the average cost per RT-qPCR monitoring test were incorporated into the model. Univariate and multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Based on estimates in published literature, disease progression to the accelerated/blast phase occurs among 0.35% of patients with monitoring and 5.12% of patients without monitoring, and the annual cost of CML progression is $136,308 per patient year. The analysis found that total healthcare costs, including the costs associated with CML progression and RT-qPCR monitoring tests (three tests per year), were $1,142 for patients with monitoring and $6,982 for patients without monitoring (difference = $5,840). In a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients with CML, achieving a 100% monitoring rate was associated with a total cost-savings of $584,005 compared to a 0% monitoring rate. This cost-savings remained consistent under both univariate and multivariable sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Regular CML monitoring was associated with improved outcomes among CML patients and, consequently, reduced healthcare costs.","[Jabbour, Elias J.] Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Siegartel, Lisa R.; Makenbaeva, Dinara] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA; [Lin, Jay; Lingohr-Smith, Melissa; Menges, Brandy] Novosys Hlth, Green Brook, NJ USA",University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Jabbour, EJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas MD Anderson Canc Ctr, Dept Leukemia, Box 428,1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",ejabbour@mdanderson.org,"Jabbour, Elias/IWM-6804-2023",,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,12,8,8,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A survival analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 1,366 patients who participated in the PAP. The progression-free survival (PFS) and median maintenance treatment cycle of pemetrexed were analyzed. A 36-month Markov model from a payer's perspective was constructed to analyze the cost and effectiveness associated with the PAP for pemetrexed. The inputs of the model were sourced from the PAP clinical database and published literature. The study estimated the incremental quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) (pemetrexed plus best supportive care [BSC] vs BSC only), the cost saving of the PAP, the impact on the percentage of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE), and poverty headcount ratio (HCR). Results: The median of PFS and maintenance treatment cycles were 187 days and five cycles (total nine cycles, which included four cycles of induction therapy), respectively. The pemetrexed plus BSC treatment with PAP resulted in an additional 0.12 QALYs over BSC only. The total cost was $48,034.46 and $96,191.57 for the patients who had or had not joined the PAP in 3 years, respectively. Compared to the patients without PAP, the percentage of CHE and HCR with PAP was reduced from 98.39% to 19.91% and 66.98% to 4.89%, respectively, indicating that the PAP substantially decreased the number of patients who had CHE and fallen into poverty. Conclusion: The study concluded that the pemetrexed PAP generated noticeable clinical and economic benefits to society and to patients. The program also increased patients' compliance with chemotherapy by allowing patients, for whom the pemetrexed treatment was unaffordable, to continue to receive it.","[Lu, Yongji; Lin, Ziyi] Shanghai Fumin Sci Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Ji; Chen, Yuan] China Primary Healthcare Fdn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Jianwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Xuan, JW (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Higher Educ Megactr, 132 Waihuan East Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xuanjw3@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Lin, Ziyi/0000-0002-3656-3601",China Primary Healthcare Foundation,China Primary Healthcare Foundation,This research was funded by China Primary Healthcare Foundation.,,22,3,4,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The SIPPET study, the first randomized controlled trial to compare the immunogenicity of plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII)/von Willebrand factor (VWF) and recombinant-DNA-derived FVIII (rFVIII), demonstrated higher inhibitor rates in previously untreated patients (PUPs) treated with rFVIII than in PUPs treated with pdFVIII/VWF. Objective: To quantify the economic impact of treating PUPs with pdFVIII/VWF vs rFVIII. Methods: An Excel-based clinical and economic model was developed from a US healthcare payer perspective and run over a 5-year period. The analysis utilized a cohort approach to model patient treatment and outcomes over a monthly cycle to quantify differences in costs of FVIII, bypassing agents, and hospitalizations for serious bleeds. Rates of high-titer inhibitor development were obtained from the SIPPET study. Patients developing high-titer inhibitors were treated with immune tolerance induction (ITI). Patients who developed low-titer inhibitors and those who did not develop inhibitors continued their usual FVIII treatment. Patients who were successfully treated with ITI returned to FVIII treatment, while unsuccessfully treated patients received bypassing agents. Total costs per treated patient were estimated and a one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the impact of parameter uncertainty on the model outcomes. Results: Total cumulative costs per patient over 5 years were $834,621 for pdFVIII/VWF patients and $1,237,163 for rFVIII patients, representing a total saving of $402,542 per patient over the 5-year period, for an average annual saving of $80,508 per patient. Conclusions: Based on data from the SIPPET study, this analysis found that initiating FVIII treatment in severe hemophilia A PUPs with pdFVIII/VWF has the potential to offer substantial cost savings to healthcare payers, amounting to a one-third reduction in costs.","[Neufeld, Ellis J.] St Jude Childrens Res Hosp, 332 N Lauderdale St, Memphis, TN 38105 USA; [Sidonio, Robert F., Jr.] Emory Univ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Sidonio, Robert F., Jr.] Aflac Canc & Blood Disorders, Atlanta, GA USA; [O'Day, Ken; Meyer, Kellie] Xcenda, Palm Harbor, FL USA; [Runken, M.

Dabigatran was proven to have at least similar efficacy and a similar or better safety profile when compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in preventing arterial thromboembolism in patients with AF. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and monetary benefit of dabigatran vs VKAs in Dutch patients with non-valvular AF. Value-based pricing considerations and corresponding negotiations on dabigatran will be explicitly considered. Methods: The base case economic analysis was conducted from the societal perspective. Health effects and costs were analysed using a Markov model. The main model inputs were derived from the RE-LY trial and Dutch observational data. Univariate, probabilistic sensitivity, and various scenario analyses were performed. Results: Dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs. A total of 4,552 QALYs were gained, and (sic)13,892,288 was saved in a cohort of 10,000 AF patients. The economic value of dabigatran was strongly related to the costs of VKA control that are averted. Notably, dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs if annual costs of VKA control exceeded (sic)159 per person, or dabigatran costs were below (sic)2.81 per day. Conclusion: Dabigatran was cost saving compared to VKAs for the prevention of atrial thromboembolism in patients with non-valvular AF in the Netherlands. This result appeared robust in the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, volume based reduction of the price in the Netherlands will further increase the monetary benefits of dabigatran.","[van Hulst, Marinus; Jacobs, Maartje S.] Martini Hosp, Dept Clin Pharm & Toxicol, Van Swietenpl 1, NL-9728 NT Groningen, Netherlands; [van Hulst, Marinus; Stevanovic, Jelena; Jacobs, Maartje S.; Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Dept PharmacoTherapy Epidemiol & Econ, Groningen, Netherlands; [Tieleman, Robert G.] Martini Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Tieleman, Robert G.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Cardiol, Groningen, Netherlands; [Kappelhoff, Bregt] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Alkmaar, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Inst Sci Hlth Aging & HealthcaRE SHARE, Groningen, Netherlands; [Postma, Maarten J.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, Groningen, Netherlands",Martini Hospital; University of Groningen; Martini Hospital; University of Groningen; Boehringer Ingelheim; University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"van Hulst, M (通讯作者)，Martini Hosp, Dept Clin Pharm & Toxicol, Van Swietenpl 1, NL-9728 NT Groningen, Netherlands.",r.hulst@mzh.nl,,"Postma, Maarten/0000-0002-6306-3653",Boehringer Ingelheim,Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim),Boehringer Ingelheim paid personal fees to MVH to conduct this study.,,42,3,3,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A transit operator would benefit from an accurate forecast of bus propagation in order to effectively control the system. To this end, we propose an 'ad-hoc' bus propagation model taking into account vehicle overtaking and distributed passenger boarding (DPB) behaviour. The latter represents the dynamic passenger queue swapping among buses when bunching at bus stops occurs and where bus capacity constraints are explicitly considered. The enhanced bus propagation model is used to build the simulation environment where different holding control strategies are tested. A quasi first-depart-first-hold (FDFH) rule is applied to the design of schedule- and headway-based holding control allowing for overtaking, with the objective to minimise the deviation from the targeted headway. The effects of control strategies are tested in an idealised bus route under different operational setting and in a real bus route in Guangzhou. We show that when the combined overtaking and queue-swapping behaviour are considered, the control strategies can achieve better headway regularity, less waiting time and less on-board travel time than their respective versions without overtaking and DPB. The benefit is even greater when travel time variability is higher and headway is smaller, suggesting that the control strategies are preferably deployed in high-frequency service.

The traffic dynamics is captured by an underlying kinematic wave model in Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. With traffic data collected through loop detectors and bus positioning devices, the control actions are carried out through adjusting signal timing plans according to short-term estimations of traffic flows and bus arrivals. We derive the optimality conditions of multi-objective control formulations and present an open loop solution algorithm. The proposed control system is applied to a test arterial developed based upon a real-world scenario in Central London, UK. It is found that the model is capable of regulating bus service reliability through utilising traffic signals while managing delays induced to surrounding traffic.

However, inconsistent lags for information propagation between boundaries may be observed with this single accumulation-based model. For example, outflow is reacting too fast when inflow varies rapidly, whereas this information should be carried by vehicles that are never driving faster than the free-flow speed. To overcome this limitation, a trip-based model has been recently proposed, but whose solution cannot be obtained analytically. In this paper we compare both models under piecewise linear MFD and a piece wise constant demand. These assumptions allow to establish the exact solution of the accumulation-based model, and continuous approximations of the trip-based model at any order using Taylor series. Moreover, a flexible event-based simulation framework is implemented to solve the latter model, making it a promising tool to account for heterogeneity in distance traveled. Thanks to these resolution schemes we are able to measure the inaccuracy of the accumulation-based approach when the demand varies rapidly, and propose a validity domain for this model. Other applications with different trip lengths and supply limitations are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This work, for the first time, makes a comprehensive and thorough retrospective examination of the major developments of DF modelling and applications in public transport (PT) planning and operations over the past 50 years, introduces some new developments, and offers future research directions. It is shown and proven that the graphical DF concept helps in creating efficient PT vehicle schedules, timetables, crew duties, networks of routes, bus rapid transit systems, and operational parking spaces. For instance, in one large bus company the total number of vehicles and crew duties were reduced by 6% to 12% and 8% to 15%, respectively.

Existing approaches for single junction Signal Setting Design (SSD) can be grouped into two classes: Stage-based or Phase-based methods. Both these approaches take the lane marking layouts as exogenous inputs, but lane-based optimisation method may be found in literature, even though for isolated signal-controlled junctions only. The Network Signal Setting Design (NSSD) requires that offsets are introduced; a traffic flow model is also needed to compute total delay. All existing methods for NSSD follow a stage-based approach; these methods do not allow for stage matrix optimisation: it is shown that explicit enumeration of stage sequences is only practicable for very small networks. This paper focuses on Network Signal Setting Design introducing the so-called scheduled synchronisation that includes green scheduling, green timing and coordination into one optimisation problem. The paper proposes a stage-based method to solve such a problem, as an extension of the synchronisation method and the traffic flow model proposed in Cantarella et al. (2015): first a set of candidate stages is defined for each junction, then the stage sequences, the stage lengths and the offsets are optimised all together. To the authors' knowledge, no other one-step optimisation method is available in literature for scheduled synchronisation. Results of the proposed method to a small network were compared with those from explicit enumeration of all stage sequences; results for a larger network are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we present a new Riemann solver at a general network junction in the demand-supply space. In the Riemann solutions, traffic states on a link include the initial, stationary, and interior states, and a discrete Cell Transmission Model flux function in interior states is used as an entropy condition, which is consistent with fair merging and first-in-first-out diverging rules. After deriving the feasibility conditions for both stationary and interior states, we obtain a set of algebraic equations, and prove that the Riemann solver is well-defined, in the sense that the stationary states, the out-fluxes of upstream links, the in-fluxes of downstream links, and kinematic waves on all links can be uniquely solved. In addition, we show that the resulting global flux function in initial states is the same as the local one in interior states. Hence we presents a new definition of invariant junction models, in which the global and local flux functions are the same. We also present a simplified framework for solving the Riemann problem with invariant junction flux functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study we further examine the stability property of stationary states with the same map, and the results will help us to understand the long-term trend of a network traffic system. We first review a network kinematic wave model and properties of stationary states on a link, define the criticality of junctions in stationary states, and discuss information propagation in stationary states on links and junctions. We then present the map and examine information propagation in the map. We apply the map to analytically study the stability of stationary states on ring roads and diverge-merge networks with circular information propagation and compare them with results obtained from the Poincare map [Jin, W.-L., 2013. Stability and bifurcation in network traffic flow: A Poincare map approach. Transportation Research Part B 57, 191-208]. We further study the stability property of general stationary states in a grid network. We find that the stability of fixed points of the map is the same as that of stationary states in a network, and the new approach is more general than the Poincare map approach. We conclude the study with future directions and implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem calls for the simultaneous determination of (i) the battery swap stations (BSSs) to be constructed out of a set of candidate locations, and (ii) the electric vehicle routes to serve a set of customers with the goal of minimizing the sum of construction and routing cost. On the benchmark instances from the literature, the extended AVNS is able to significantly improve the previously known best solutions for the large majority of instances while using only a small fraction of the run-times reported for the comparison methods of Yang and Sun (2015). Moreover, the AVNS proves robust with regard to its average solution quality and is able to strongly reduce the number of constructed BSSs in the solutions compared to the results from the literature. Therefore, we generate additional benchmark instances which prove to be more meaningful with respect to the necessity of using BSSs and that are suitable to analyze the impact of varying construction cost on the location decision.

It has been tested in phase-3 trials, but no data on its cost-effectiveness have been published.Purpose: To determine the cost-effectiveness of PP3M compared with once-monthly paliperidone (PP1M), haloperidol long-acting therapy (HAL-LAT), risperidone microspheres (RIS-LAT), and oral olanzapine (oral-OLZ) for treating chronic schizophrenia in The Netherlands.Methods: A previous 1-year decision tree was adapted, based on local inputs supplemented with data from published literature. The primary analysis used DRG costs in 2016 euros from the insurer perspective, as derived from official lists. A micro-costing analysis was also conducted. For the costing scenario, official list prices were used. Clinical outcomes included relapses (treated as outpatients, requiring hospitalization, total), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Rates and utility scores were derived from the literature. Economic outcomes were the incremental cost/QALY-gained or relapse-avoided. Model robustness was examined in scenario, 1-way, and probability sensitivity analyses.Results: The expected cost was lowest with PP3M (8,781Euro), followed by PP1M (10,325Euro), HAL-LAT (11,278Euro), RIS-LAT (11,307Euro), and oral-OLZ (13,556Euro). PP3M had the fewest total relapses/patient (0.36, 0.94, 1.39, 1.21, and 1.70, respectively), hospitalizations (0.11, 0.46, 0.40, 0.56, and 0.57, respectively), emergency room visits (0.25, 0.48. 0.99, 0.65, and 1.14, respectively) and the most QALYs (0.847, 0.735, 0.709, 0.719, and 0.656, respectively). In both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, PP3M dominated all other drugs. Sensitivity analyses confirmed base case findings. In the costing analysis, total costs were, on average, 31.9% higher than DRGs.Conclusions: PP3M dominated all commonly used drugs. It is cost-effective for treating chronic schizophrenia in the Netherlands. Results were robust over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. For patients requiring a depot medication, such as those with adherence problems, PP3M appears to be a good alternative anti-psychotic treatment.","[Einarson, Thomas R.; Bereza, Basil G.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, 144 Coll St,Room 674, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada; [Tedouri, Fadi] Janssen Janssen Pharmaceut NV, Beerse, Belgium; [Van Impe, Kristel; Denee, Tom R.] Janssen Cilag BV, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Dries, Pieter J.

Methods: This study compared the long-term costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from home-based (HBI) vs specialist clinic-based intervention (CBI) among elderly patients (mean age = 71 years) with heart failure discharged home (mean intervention duration = 12 months). Cost-utility analysis was conducted from a government-funded health system perspective. A Markov cohort model was used to simulate disease progression over 15 years based on initial data from a randomized clinical trial (the WHICH? study). Time-dependent hazard functions were modeled using the Weibull function, and this was compared against an alternative model where the hazard was assumed to be constant over time. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the key drivers of cost-effectiveness and quantify uncertainty in the results. Results: During the trial, mortality was the highest within 30 days of discharge and decreased thereafter in both groups, although the declining rate of mortality was slower in CBI than HBI. At 15 years (extrapolated), HBI was associated with slightly better health outcomes (mean of 0.59 QALYs gained) and mean additional costs of AU$ 13,876 per patient. The incremental cost-utility ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit (vs CBI) were AU$ 23,352 per QALY gained and AU$ 15,835, respectively. The uncertainty was driven by variability in the costs and probabilities of readmissions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed HBI had a 68% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$ 50,000 per QALY. Conclusion: Compared with CBI (outpatient specialized HF clinic-based intervention), HBI (home-based predominantly, but not exclusively) could potentially be cost-effective over the long-term in elderly patients with heart failure at a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$ 50,000/ QALY, albeit with large uncertainty.","[Maru, Shoko; Byrnes, Joshua M.; Scuffham, Paul A.] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Sch Med & Populat & Social Hlth Res, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Carrington, Melinda J.] Australian Catholic Univ, Mary MacKillop Inst Hlth Res, Ctr Primary Care & Prevent, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Stewart, Simon] Australian Catholic Univ, Mary MacKillop Inst Hlth Res, Ctr Res Excellence Reduce Inequal Heart Dis, Melbourne, Australia",Griffith University; Australian Catholic University; Australian Catholic University,"Maru, S (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Sch Med, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",shoko.maru@griffithuni.edu.au,"Maru, Shoko/J-6820-2019; Stewart, Simon/JPX-8611-2023; Scuffham, Paul/AAS-8084-2021; Byrnes, Josh/AAA-4387-2021","Maru, Shoko/0000-0002-4722-4111; Stewart, Simon/0000-0001-9032-8998; Scuffham, Paul/0000-0001-5931-642X; Byrnes, Joshua/0000-0001-6562-711X",National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [519823]; Victorian Government,National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Victorian Government,"This work was supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia program grant [grant #519823], and in part by the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program.",,45,5,6,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The index date was defined as the first OA diagnosis indicated by ICD-9-CM codes. One year before and after the index date were defined as the baseline and study periods, respectively. A second OA diagnosis during the study period was also required. Patients with OA were matched one-to-one on age, gender, index date, and minimum length of follow-up to controls without OA. Baseline characteristics and study period resource utilization and costs (2016 USD) were compared between cohorts.Results: This study identified 199,539 patients with OA (knee: 87,271, hip: 19,953, hand: 15,670, spine: 12,496). The average age was 54 years, and 58% were female. OA patients had higher healthcare resource utilization than matched controls in inpatient, emergency room, and outpatient settings (p<.001 for all). Further, patients with OA had 4-times the excess total medical costs of their matched controls ($14,521 vs $3,629; p<.001). Patients with hip OA had the highest medical costs among all joint locations. Outpatient and pharmacy costs were similar among patients with knee, hip, and hand OA, but higher in patients with spine OA. In sub-group analyses, older patients (45-64 years old) had higher costs.Limitations: This sample, obtained using claims data, only includes patients who were actively seeking care for OA and were likely symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients would likely not be captured in this analysis.Conclusions: Patients with OA incur greater healthcare resource utilization and costs than patients without OA, with substantial variation by joint location.","[Wang, Susanne X.; Ganguli, Arijit X.; Bodhani, Amit; Medema, Jeroen K.] AbbVie Inc, N Chicago, IL USA; [Reichmann, William M.; Macaulay, Dendy] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA",AbbVie; Analysis Group Inc.,"Macaulay, D (通讯作者)，10 Rockefeller Plaza,15th Floor, New York, NY 10020 USA.",dendy.macaulay@analysisgroup.com,,"Reichmann, William/0009-0006-9954-2740; Medema, Jan Paul/0000-0003-3045-2924","AbbVie, Inc.","AbbVie, Inc.(Abbott LaboratoriesAbbVie)","This study was funded by AbbVie, Inc.

Travellers choose between multiple alternatives, have heterogeneous values of travel times, and may differ in their valuation of variety. We derive first-best and second-best tolls taking into account how the overall network demand responds to expected generalized prices, including tolls. For second-best pricing, we show that with homogeneous values of times the welfare losses of second-best pricing are smaller when route choice is probabilistic than when route choice is deterministic. Furthermore, we find that with heterogeneous values of times and benefits of variety, uniform second-best tolls and group-differentiated tolls can be very close, implying potentially low welfare losses from the inability to differentiate tolls. Finally, we show that there are cases where all groups benefit from second-best congestion pricing, but that these cases are likely to be politically unacceptable because tolls are then higher for low income groups.

We demonstrate that the welfare gain of a Pigouvian tax may first fall and then increase as building height restrictions become more stringent. For example, a Pigouvian toll imposed in a city without restrictions may produce up to 40% larger welfare gains than Pigouvian tolling in a city with a mild, uniform in space, floor-to-area ratio restriction. In the presence of a tax-induced distortion, deviations of the Pigouvian toll can lead to non-negligible welfare gains. We discuss the important policy implications of the above findings.

Although many control strategies, such as static and dynamic holding strategies, have been implemented to mitigate the effects of unreliable bus schedules, most of them would impose longer dwell times on the passengers. In this paper, we investigate the potential of an alternative bus substitution strategy that is currently implemented by some transit agencies in an ad-hoc manner. In this strategy, the agency deploys a fleet of standby buses to take over service from any early or late buses so as to contain deviations from schedule, and the intention is to impose minimum penalties on the onboard passengers. We develop a discrete-time infinite-horizon approximate dynamic programming approach to find the optimal policy to minimize the overall agency and passenger costs. It is shown through numerical examples that schedule deviations can be controlled by regularly inserting standby buses as substitutions. In some implementation scenarios, the proposed strategy holds the potential to achieve comparable performance with some of the most advanced strategies, and to outperform the conventional slack-based schedule control scheme. In light of the emerging opportunities associated with autonomous driving, the performance of the proposed strategy can become even stronger due to the reduction in costs for keeping the fleet of standby buses.

Our model differs from the existing two-stage stochastic models by considering not only flight timing and potential passenger demand, but also expected operational expenses, such as fuel burn and carbon emission costs. We include aircraft cruise speed decisions to compensate for non-cruise time variability so as to satisfy the time requirements of the passenger connections. We handle nonlinear functions of fuel and emission costs associated with cruise speed adjustments by utilizing mixed integer second order cone programming. Because the three-stage stochastic model leads to a large decision tree and can be very time-consuming to solve optimally, we suggest a scenario group-wise decomposition algorithm to obtain lower and upper bounds for the optimal value of the proposed model. The lower and upper bounds are obtained by solving a number of group subproblems, which are similar to proposed multi-stage stochastic model defined over a reduced number of scenarios. We suggest a cutting plane algorithm, along with improvements, to efficiently solve each group subproblem. In the numerical experiments, we provide a significant cost savings over two-stage stochastic programming and deterministic approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Our model incorporates two countervailing effects of HSR speed, namely the travel time effect and the safety effect: while increasing HSR speed reduces HSR travel time, it may bring about a safety concern especially in emerging HSR markets such as China. Our theoretical analysis suggests that HSR speed impact on airline traffic and price depends on the relative dominance of the travel-time and safety effects, and air-HSR substitutability may reinforce the HSR speed effect. Furthermore, HSR speed has a larger impact on airline traffic than on airline price. Our empirical results from a rare natural experiment of HSR speed reduction in China show that HSR speed reduction raises both airline traffic and price, suggesting the dominance of travel-time effect. More importantly, consistent with the theoretical prediction, the HSR speed effect is empirically stronger on short-haul routes where the airline and HSR services are more substitutable.

The integrated management of loading operations, planning of the transport vehicles to use and their scheduling is what we define as the Flexible Ship Loading Problem (FSLP). The flexibility comes from a cooperative agreement between the terminal operator and the liner shipping company, specifying that the terminal has the right to decide which specific container to load for each slot obeying the class-based stowage plan received from the liner. We formulate a mathematical model for the problem. Then we present various modelling enhancements and a mathematical model to obtain strong lower bounds. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. It is shown that enhancements improve the performance of formulation significantly, and the heuristic efficiently generates high-quality solutions. Results also point out that substantial cost savings can be achieved by integrating the ship loading operations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, Calvin Klein and Timberland authorize Li & Fung to sub-source materials and manufacture clothes (referred to as sub-sourcing in this paper). Motivated by these observations, we consider a three-layer supply chain comprising of a material supplier, a procurement agent and a fashion brand, and analyze their preferences over two typical procurement structures: direct-sourcing and sub-sourcing. Under sub-sourcing, buy-back contracts, through which fashion brands return unsold products and thus shift overstock risk to procurement agents, are widely adopted in fashion industry. We identify demand enlargement effect and wholesale power effect of the buy-back contract under sub-sourcing. These two effects change the fashion brands' profit balance between direct-sourcing and sub-sourcing, and may induce the fashion brand to prefer sub-sourcing. We further examine the impact of demand uncertainty on the fashion brand's profits, and observe that sub-sourcing is dominant under low demand uncertainty. When demand uncertainty is high, sub-sourcing with buy-back may outperform direct sourcing given a moderate buy-back price.","[Niu, Baozhuang; Chen, Lei] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, Xiaopo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yue, Xiaohang] Univ Wisconsin, Lubar Sch Business, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",South China University of Technology; Sun Yat Sen University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Zhuo, XP (通讯作者)，Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Business Sch, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bmniubz@scut.edu.cn; 201610105349@mail.scut.edu.cn; zhuoxp@mail2.sysu.edu.cn; xyue@uwm.edu,"Niu, Baozhuang/HMD-9527-2023","Niu, Baozhuang/0000-0002-7374-9835","NSFC, China [71571194, 71633002]; Chang Jiang Scholars Program; GDUPS; HKPolyU [GUA7Y]","NSFC, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chang Jiang Scholars Program(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)); GDUPS; HKPolyU","The authors are grateful to the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

In order to provide more realistic traffic data for estimations of environmental impacts, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models have been adopted in transportation planning and traffic management models concerning environmental sustainability. This review summarizes and examines the recent methodological advances of DTA models in environmentally sustainable road transportation applications including traffic signal control concerning vehicular emissions and emission pricing. A classification of emission estimation models and their integration with DTA models are accordingly reviewed as supplementary to the existing reviews. Finally, a variety of future research prospects of DTA for environmentally sustainable road transportation research are discussed. In particular, this review also points out that at present the research about DTA models in conjunction with noise predictive models is relatively deficient. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Optimal delivery policy of the empty container and the ocean carrier's optimal free detention time are derived.

They operate in cooperative, but competitive, co-opetitive, environments wherein individual port throughput is linked through an underlying transshipment network. Short-term port performance and long-term market share can be significantly impacted by a disaster event; thus, ports plan to invest in capacity expansion and protective measures to increase their reliability or resiliency in times of disruption. To account for the co-opetition among ports, a bi-level multiplayer game theoretic approach is used, wherein each individual port takes protective investment decisions while anticipating the response of the common market-clearing shipping assignment problem in the impacted network. This lower-level assignment is modeled as a cost minimization problem, which allows for consideration of gains and losses from other ports decisions through changes in port and service capacities and port cargo handling times. Linear properties of the lower-level formulation permit reformulation of the individual port bilevel optimization problems as single-level problems by replacing the common lower-level by its equivalent Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simultaneous consideration of individual port optimization problems creates a multi-leader, common-follower problem, i.e. an unrestricted game, that is modeled as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC). Equilibria solutions are sought by use of a diagonalization technique. Solutions of unrestricted, semi-restricted and restricted games are analyzed and compared for a hypothetical application from the literature involving ports in East Asia and Europe. The proposed co-opetitive approach was found to lead to increased served total demand, significantly increased market share for many ports and improved services for shippers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In response, the government of Ghana and other stakeholders have initiated programs and policies aimed at integrating disaster risk reduction (DRR) into educational curricula. This study assessed the current level of DRR integration in the pre-tertiary education system in Ghana by assessing teachers' perceptions and preparedness to handle DRR lessons and the challenges they experience. Using secondary data and in-depth interviews with officials from the Ghana Education Service (GES), National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), information on the current level of DRR integration in the pre-tertiary education system in Ghana was reviewed. Semi-structured questionnaires were also used to obtain information from teachers sampled from selected schools in the La Nkwantanang District of the Greater Accra Region. The results revealed that the level of DRR integration in pre-tertiary schools remain low, and challenges to further integration include inadequate teacher training and learning materials and poor support from disaster management organizations. These factors adversely affect the ability of teachers to impart DRR knowldge and mainstreaming of DRR into pre-tertiary education in Ghana. Therefore, the findings suggest that training teachers in the delivery of DRR lessons at the pre-tertiary level should be prioritized in Ghana. In addition, disaster management organizations should be encouraged to partner with schools to support the practical teaching of DRR lessons to be able to enhance the knowledge and skills of both students and teachers.","[Apronti, Priscilla Toloo] Queens Univ, 99 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Boakye-Danquah, John] Rivers Forest & Life Fdn RFL, POB 12, Enyiresi Aniynam, Ghana; [Antwi, Effah Kwabena] UTIAS, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci IR3S, Tokyo, Japan",Queens University - Canada,"Apronti, PT (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, 99 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",15pta@queensu.ca; jdboakye@gmail.com; effah.can@gmail.com,"Boakye-Danquah, John/E-1452-2019",,,,,,32,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER JAPAN,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,313,330,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_17,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300017,0

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of de-escalation from micafungin vs escalation from fluconazole from a Chinese public payers perspective. Materials and methods: Cost-effectiveness was estimated using a decision analytic model, in which patients begin treatment with fluconazole 400 mg/day (escalation) or micafungin 100 mg/day (de-escalation). From Day 3, when susceptibility results are available, patients are treated with either fluconazole (if isolates are fluconazole-sensitive/dose-dependent) or micafungin (if isolates are resistant). The total duration of (appropriate) treatment is 14 days. Model inputs are early (Day 3) and end-of-treatment mortality rates, treatment success rates, and health resource utilization. Model outputs are costs of health resource utilization over 42 days, incremental cost per life-year, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) over a lifetime horizon. Results: In the base-case analysis, the de-escalation strategy was associated with longer survival and higher treatment success rates compared with escalation, at a lower overall cost (-(sic)1,154; -175 United States Dollars). Life-years and QALYs were also better with de-escalation. Thus, this strategy dominated the escalation strategy for all outcomes. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99% of 10,000 simulations were below the very cost-effective threshold (1 x gross domestic product). Limitations: The main limitation of the study was the lack of real-world input data for clinical outcomes on treatment with micafungin in China; data from other countries were included in the model. Conclusion: A de-escalation strategy is cost-saving from the Chinese public health payer perspective compared with escalation. It improves outcomes and reduces costs to the health system by reducing hospitalization, due to an increase in the proportion of patients receiving appropriate treatment.","[Chen, Dechang] Jiaotong Univ, Sch Med, Shanghai Ruijin Hosp, Dept Crit Care Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wan, Xianyao] Dalian Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Intens Care Unit, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Kruger, Eliza] IMS Hlth Asia, Singapore, Singapore; [Chen, Can] IMS Hlth China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yue, Xiaomeng] Univ Cincinnati, James L Winkle Coll Pharm, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA; [Wang, Liang] Astellas Pharma China Inc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jiuhong] 306th Hosp PLA, Pharm Dept, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kruger, Eliza] QuintilesIMS, San Francisco, CA USA; [Chen, Can] QuintilesIMS, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Dalian Medical University; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; IQVIA; IQVIA,"Wu, JH (通讯作者)，306th Hosp PLA, Pharm Dept, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",jiuhongwu2015@163.com,"Yue, Xiaomeng/GYJ-1728-2022","Yue, Xiaomeng/0000-0002-4418-7079",Astellas Pharma China Inc.,Astellas Pharma China Inc.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals),This study was funded by Astellas Pharma China Inc.,,41,2,2,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this paper, we present a behavioral kinematic wave model to explain the three bottleneck effects of sags and tunnels. Assuming increasing time gaps, we derive location-dependent triangular fundamental diagrams to explain the capacity reduction effect; with a bounded acceleration constraint on the stationary states inside the capacity reduction zone, we demonstrate the occurrence of capacity drop and derive a formula to calculate the dropped capacity from the fundamental diagram, road geometry, and acceleration process; from the structure of continuous standing waves we verify the low acceleration rate out of the upstream queue. We also present a simplified phenomenological model of capacity drop at sag/tunnel bottlenecks and two Cell Transmission Models for numerical simulations. With four stationary trajectories at the Kobotoke tunnel in Japan, we calibrate and validate the behavioral model and find that the theoretical predictions match the observations very well. This study can help to develop better design and control strategies to improve the performance of a sag or tunnel bottleneck. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: A partitioned survival model with three health states (stable disease, progressive disease, death) was developed over a 20-year time horizon. Ceritinib's efficacy inputs (progression-free and overall survival) were estimated from ASCEND-4; parametric survival models extrapolated data beyond the trial period. The relative efficacy of ceritinib vs chemotherapy was obtained from ASCEND-4, the relative efficacy of ceritinib vs crizotinib was estimated using a matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. Drug acquisition, treatment administration, adverse event management, and medical costs were obtained from publicly available databases and the literature, and inflated to 2016 US dollars. Treatment-specific stable-state utilities were derived from trials and progressive-state utility from the literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated for ceritinib vs each comparator. Cost-effectiveness was assessed based on US willingness-to-pay thresholds. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test model robustness. Results: In the base case, first-line ceritinib was associated with total direct costs of $299,777 and 3.28 QALYs (from 4.61 life years gained [LYG]) over 20 years. First-line crizotinib and chemotherapy were associated with 2.73 and 2.41 QALYs, 3.92 and 3.53 LYG, and $263,172 and $228,184 total direct costs, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $66,064 for ceritinib vs crizotinib and $81,645 for ceritinib vs chemotherapy. In the first 2 years following treatment initiation, ceritinib dominated crizotinib by conferring greater health benefits at reduced total costs. Results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Limitations: In the absence of head-to-head trials, an indirect comparison method was used. Conclusions: Ceritinib is cost-effective compared to crizotinib and chemotherapy in the treatment of previously untreated ALK-positive metastatic NCSLC in the US.","[Zhou, Zheng-Yi; Ricculli, Marie Louise; Xie, Jipan] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY USA; [Mutebi, Alex; Dalal, Anand; Culver, Ken] Nova Pharmaceut Corp, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Han, Simeng; Bensimon, Arielle G.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.,"Zhou, ZY (通讯作者)，10 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10020 USA.",jenny.zhou@analysisgroup.com,,,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),Funding for this research was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,,45,13,14,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Thanks to scientific and technical advances in many relevant domains nowadays, changes in the routing environment are often more or less predictable. This study mainly focuses on path optimization in a given dynamic routing environment (POGDRE). A common practice to deal with dynamic routing environment is to conduct online re-optimization (OLRO), i.e., at each time t, environmental parameters are measured/predicted first, and then the best path is re-calculated by resolving SPO based on the newly measured/predicted environmental parameters. In theory, POGDRE is equivalent to time-dependent path optimization (TDPO), which is usually resolved as SPO on a time expanded hypergraph (TEHG) with a significantly enlarged size. In other words, during a single online run of OLRO-based methods or a single run of TEHG-based methods, the route network is actually fixed and static. Inspired by the multi-agent co-evolving nature reflected in many methods of evolutionary computation, this paper proposes a methodology of co-evolutionary path optimization (CEPO) to resolve the POGDRE. Distinguishing from OLRO and TEHG methods, in CEPO, future routing environmental parameters keep changing during a single run of optimization on a network of original size. In other words, the routing environment co-evolves with the path optimization process within a single run. This paper then reports a ripple-spreading algorithm (RSA) as a realization of CEPO to resolve the POGDRE with both optimality and efficiency. In just a single run of RSA, the optimal actual travelling trajectory can be achieved in a given dynamic routing environment.

Methods: Macro-indicators were obtained from the WHO Health for All Database. Inter-regional comparison among post-Semashko, former Yugoslavia, and prior-1989-free-market SEE economies was conducted. Results: United Nations Development Program Human Development Index growth was strongest among prior-free-market SEE, followed by former Yugoslavia and post-Semashko. Policy cuts to hospital beds and nursing-staff capacities were highest in post-Semashko. Physician density increased the most in prior-free-market SEE. Length of hospital stay was reduced in most countries; frequency of outpatient visits and inpatient discharges doubled in prior-free-market SEE. Fertility rates fell for one third in Post-Semashko and prior-free-market SEE. Crude death rates slightly decreased in prior-free-market-SEE and post-Semashko, while growing in the former Yugoslavia region. Life expectancy increased by 4 years on average in all regions; prior-free-market SEE achieving the highest longevity. Childhood and maternal mortality rates decreased throughout SEE, while post-Semashko countries recorded the most progress. Conclusions: Significant differences in healthcare resources and outcomes were observed among three historical health-policy legacies in south-eastern Europe.

Methods: Data from September 2010 to December 2012 from three hospitals in the Roper St. Francis Healthcare (RSFH) were used: Roper Hospital (368 beds), Bon Secours St. Francis Hospital (204 beds), and Roper St. Francis Mt. Pleasant Hospital (85 beds). Insulin wastage and associated acquisition costs were estimated using regression models. Results: The conversion from IPS of 3-mL pens of insulin aspart to FS of 3-mL vials of lispro was associated with a significant decrease in insulin wastage (204,042 IUs; p<.001) and equated to an average savings of $106.40 per patient at all three hospitals combined (p<.001). For basal insulin, conversion from IPS of 3-mL pens of insulin detemir to CUD of 10-mL vials was associated with a significant decrease in insulin wastage at Roper and St. Francis Hospitals (p<.001). For Mt. Pleasant Hospital, the decrease was not statistically significant. The predicted average reduction in insulin wastage per month was 52,542.9 IUs (p<.001) at all three hospitals combined. Conclusions: Switching RAI from IPS of 3-mL pens of insulin aspart to one-time unit dose insulin lispro dispensed from FS 3-mL vials as needed significantly reduced insulin wastage and associated acquisition costs at the three combined hospitals.

The influence of the pedestrians' behaviours is investigated by prescribing a selfish attitude to a fraction c(s) of the participants, while the others behave politely. Thanks to an original setup enabling the re-injection of egressed participants into the room, the analysis is conducted in a (macroscopically) quasi-stationary regime. We find that, as c(s) is increased, the flow rate J rises, interpolating between published values for egresses in normal conditions and measurements for competitive evacuations. The dependence of several flow properties on the pedestrian density rho at the door, independently of cs, suggests that macroscopically the behavioural aspects could be subsumed under the density, at least in our specific settings with limited crowd pressure. In particular, under these conditions, J grows monotonically with rho up to close-packing (p approximate to 9m(-2)). The flow is then characterised microscopically. Among other quantities, the time lapses between successive escapes, the pedestrians' waiting times in front of the door, and their angles of incidence are analysed statistically. In a nutshell, our main results show that the flow is orderly for polite crowds, with narrowly distributed time lapses between egresses, while for larger c(s) the flow gets disorderly and vanishing time lapses emerge. For all c(s), we find an alternation between short and long time lapses, which we ascribe to a generalised zipper effect. The average waiting time in the exit zone increases with its occupancy. The disorder in the flow and the pressure felt by participants are also assessed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Three VSL control strategies are developed with different levels of complexity and capabilities to enhance traffic stability using: (i) only one CV (per lane) (Strategy 1), (ii) one CV (per lane) coupled with variable message signs (Strategy 2), and (iii) multiple CVs (Strategy 3). We further develop adaptive schemes for the three strategies to remedy potential control failures in real time. These strategies are designed to accommodate different queue detection schemes (by CVs or different sensors) and CV penetration rates. Finally, probability of control failure is formulated for each strategy based on the stochastic features of traffic instability to develop a general framework to (i) estimate expected delay savings, (ii) assess the stability of different VSL control strategies, and (iii) determine optimal control speeds under uncertainty. Compared to VMS-only strategies, the CV-based strategies can effectively impose dynamic control over continuous time and space, enabling (i) faster queue clearance around a bottleneck, (ii) less restrictive control with higher control speed (thus smoother transition), and (iii) simpler control via only one or a small number of CVs.

Compared with other resource allocation methods, timetable adjustment is a relatively cost-effective approach for improving timetable adherence. The insertion of appropriate time supplement and buffer time into a timetable to reduce delays as well as their propagation can improve punctuality. However, to appropriately distribute available supplement/buffer time is a challenging task, especially for real-world cases. Moreover, a very robust timetable may not necessarily be a good choice, since ideal punctuality might come at the cost of large time slacks. In this study, we propose a simulation-based approach that embeds a linear programming model to effectively adjust the time supplement and buffer time in a given passenger railway timetable to reduce the average delay. The proposed solution approach is empirically applied to instances of various sizes. It is shown that the heuristic can quantify the relationship between timetable efficiency and robustness, which helps railway operators select their ideal balance between these two important yet conflicting issues. Further, numerical studies with a real timetable demonstrate that the timetable can achieve better punctuality with an even lower time supplement after adjustment, and the insights observed in this work have not only academic value but also value for practitioners in their preparation of timetables.

Methods: The Premier Hospital Database was utilized to estimate the number of SRSE cases based on hospital discharges during 2012. Discharges were classified as SRSE cases based on an algorithm using seizure-related International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and treatment protocols (e.g. benzodiazepines, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), and ventilator use). Secondary analyses were conducted using more restrictive algorithms for SRSE. Results: A total of 6,325 hospital discharges were classified as SRSE cases from a total of 5,300,000 hospital discharges. Applying a weighting based on hospital characteristics and 2012US demographics, this projected to an estimated 41,156 cases of SRSE in the US during 2012, an estimated incidence rate of similar to 13/100,000 annually for SRSE in the US. Secondary analyses using stricter SRSE algorithms resulted in estimated incidence rates of similar to 11/100,000 and 8/100,000 annually. The mean LOS for SRSE hospitalizations was 16.5 days (median =11; interquartile range [IQR]=6-20), and the mean ICU LOS was 9.3 days (median =6; IQR =3-12). The mean cost of an SRSE hospitalization was $51,247 (median = $33,294; 95% CI = $49,634-$52,861). Limitations: The analysis uses ICD-9 diagnostic codes and claims information, and there are inherent limitations in any methodology based on treatment protocol, which created challenges in distinguishing with complete accuracy between SRSE, RSE, and SE on the basis of care patterns in the database. Conclusion: SRSE is associated with high mortality and morbidity, which place a high burden on healthcare resources. Projections based upon the findings of this study suggest an estimated 25,821-41,959 cases of SRSE may occur in the US each year, but more in-depth studies are required.","[Beg, Jamil M.; Anderson, Thomas D.; Kanes, Stephen J.] Sage Therapeut Inc, 215 First St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Francis, Kevin; Meckley, Lisa M.; Fitzhenry, David; Foster, Todd; Sukhtankar, Susheel] Trinity Partners, Waltham, MA USA; [Moura, Lidia M.

J,"Benson, T",,,,"Benson, Tim",,,The Load Model: an alternative to QALY,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Quality-adjusted life years; Morbidity; Mortality; Cost-benefit analysis; Outcome assessment (healthcare); Load,LIFE EXPECTANCY; QUALITY; INEQUALITIES; UTILITIES; ENGLAND; FUTURE; INDEX,"Background: QALYs are widely used in health economic evaluation, but remain controversial, largely because they do not reflect how many people behave in practice. This paper presents a new conceptual model (Load Model) and illustrates it in comparison with the QALY model. Methods: Load is the average annual weight attributed to morbidity and mortality over a defined period, using weightings based on preference judgements. Morbidity Load is attributed to states of illness, according to their perceived severity. When people are in full health, Load is zero (no morbidity). Death is treated as an event with negative consequences, incurred in the year following death. Deaths may be weighted equally, with a fixed negative weight such as -100, or differ according to the context of death. After death, Load is zero. In a worked example, we use the standard gamble method to obtain a weighting for an illness state, for both Load and QALY models. A judge is indifferent between certainty of 1.5 years' illness followed by death, or a 50/50 chance of 1.5 years' full health or 1-year illness, each followed by death. The weightings calculated are applied to a hypothetical life, 72 years in full health followed by 3 years with illness then death, using both models. Three other hypothetical outcomes are also compared. Results: For an example life, the relative size of the morbidity component compared with the mortality component is much higher in the Load model than in the QALY model. When comparing alternative outcomes, there are also substantial differences between the two models. Conclusions: In the Load model the weight of morbidity, relative to mortality, is very different from that in the QALY model. Given the role of the QALYs in economic evaluation, the implications of an alternative, which generates very different results, warrant further exploration.","[Benson, Tim] R Outcomes Ltd, 14 Pinewood Crescent, Hermitage RG18 9WL, Thatcham, England; [Benson, Tim] UCL, Inst Hlth Informat, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Benson, T (通讯作者)，R Outcomes Ltd, 14 Pinewood Crescent, Hermitage RG18 9WL, Thatcham, England.",tim.benson@r-outcomes.com,,"Benson, Tim/0000-0002-2101-1353",,,,,48,3,3,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this paper, through the adoption of Chinese hi-tech listed companies' panel data from 2004 to 2012emprirical analysis of technology diversification's relationship with corporate performance has been made. Also, analysis of the adjustment to the relationship of the characteristics of TMT technology diversification and performance has been done. Results indicate positive correlation between the technology diversification and corporate financial performance and inverted u-shaped relationship between technological diversification and innovation performance. The functions of TMT output have the positive adjustment to technology diversification and performance.

The aim was to conduct a cost-efficiency analysis for the US of the direct acquisition and administration costs of the recently approved biosimilar filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio EP2006) with reference to filgrastim (Neupogen), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), and a pegfilgrastim injection device (Neulasta Onpro; hereafter pegfilgrastim-injector) for CIN/FN prophylaxis. Methods: A cost-efficiency analysis of the prophylaxis of one patient during one chemotherapy cycle under 1-14 days' time horizon was conducted using the unit dose average selling price (ASP) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for subcutaneous prophylactic injection under four scenarios: cost of medication only (COSTMED), patient self-administration (SELFADMIN), healthcare provider (HCP) initiating administration followed by self-administration (HCPSTART), and HCP providing full administration (HCPALL). Two case studies were created to illustrate real-world clinical implications. The analyses were replicated using wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). Results: Using ASP+CPT, cost savings achieved with filgrastim-sndz relative to reference filgrastim ranged from $65 (1day) to $916 (14 days) across all scenarios. Relative to pegfilgrastim, savings with filgrastim-sndz ranged from $834 (14 days) up to $3,666 (1day) under the COSTMED, SELFADMIN, and HPOSTART scenarios; and from $284 (14 days) up to $3,666 (1day) under the HPOALL scenario. Similar to the cost-savings compared to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim-sndz achieved savings relative to pegfilgrastim-injector: from $834 (14 days) to $3,666 (1day) under the COSTMED scenario, from $859 (14 days) to $3,692 (1day) under SELFADMIN, from $817 (14 days) to $3,649 (1day) under HPOSTART, and from $267 (14 days) to $3,649 (1day) under HPOALL. Cost savings of filgrastim-sndz using WAC+CPT were even greater under all scenarios. Conclusions: Prophylaxis with filgrastim-sndz, a biosimilar filgrastim, was associated consistently with significant cost-savings over prophylaxis with reference filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, and pegfilgrastim-injector, and this across various administration scenarios.","[McBride, Ali] Banner Univ, Med Ctr, Tucson, AZ USA; [McBride, Ali; Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Canc Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [McBride, Ali; Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Practice & Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Campbell, Kim; Bikkina, Mohan; Balu, Sanjeev] Sandoz, Princeton, NJ USA; [MacDonald, Karen; Abraham, Ivo] Matrix45, Tucson, AZ USA; [Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & PharmacoEcon Res, Drachman Hall B-306H,1295 N Martin Ave, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Coll Med Tucson, Dept Family & Community Med, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Novartis; Sandoz; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Abraham, I (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & PharmacoEcon Res, Drachman Hall B-306H,1295 N Martin Ave, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",abraham@pharmacy.arizona.edu,,,"Sandoz, Inc.","Sandoz, Inc.","This work was sponsored by Sandoz, Inc.",,41,28,28,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A semi-Markov model was developed including the following health states: Progression free; Progressive disease: Treat with best supportive care; Progressive disease: Treat with subsequent active therapy; Attempted resection of metastases; Disease free after metastases resection; Progressive disease: after resection and relapse; and Death. Parametric survival analyses of patient-level progression free survival and overall survival data from the PEAK Phase II clinical trial were used to estimate health state transitions. Additional data from the PEAK trial were considered for the dose and duration of therapy, the use of subsequent therapy, the occurrence of adverse events, and the incidence and probability of time to metastasis resection. Utility weightings were calculated from patient-level data from panitumumab trials evaluating first-, second-, and third-line treatments. The study was performed from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective including only direct costs. A life-time horizon was applied. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model. Results: Based on the PEAK trial, which demonstrated greater efficacy of panitumumab vs bevacizumab, both in combination with mFOLFOX6 first-line in wild-type RAS mCRC patients, the estimated incremental cost per life-year gained was (sic)16,567 and the estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was (sic)22,794. The sensitivity analyses showed the model was robust to alternative parameters and assumptions. Limitations: The analysis was based on a simulation model and, therefore, the results should be interpreted cautiously. Conclusions: Based on the PEAK Phase II clinical trial and taking into account Spanish costs, the results of the analysis showed that first-line treatment of mCRC with panitumumab + mFOLFOX6 could be considered a cost-effective option compared with bevacizumab + mFOLFOX6 for the Spanish NHS.","[Rivera, Fernando] Hosp Univ Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain; [Valladares, Manuel] Hosp Univ Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain; [Gea, Salvador] AMGEN SA, Unidad Farmacoecon & Invest Resultados Salud, Barcelona, Spain; [Lopez-Martinez, Noemi] Oblikue Consulting S L, Barcelona 08006, Spain",Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla (HUMV); Virgen del Rocio University Hospital,"López-Martínez, N (通讯作者)，Oblikue Consulting S L, Barcelona 08006, Spain.",noemi.lopez@oblikue.com,,,"AMGEN, S.A.","AMGEN, S.A.(Amgen)","The study was financed by AMGEN, S.A.

The research indicates that the increase of investment could improve the best sales volume and maximum of supply chain profits when influence parameter exceeds the threshold. And when influence parameter stays much lower, the increase of cost is superior to the increase of profits, resulting in the decrease of maximum of supply chain profits, which implies a worse chance to invest a lot.","[Zhao, Leizhou; Zhang, Qing] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics,"Zhao, LZ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zlz7681466@163.com; karlnuaa@nuaa.edu.cn,,,,,,,17,0,0,2,20,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6668-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,372,377,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ7HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427285800077,0

The deployment of sensors has a significant impact on the accuracy of positioning and effectiveness of surveillance. In this paper, we develop a reliable sensor location model that aims at optimizing the location of sensors so as to maximize the accuracy of object positioning/surveillance under the risk of possible sensor disruptions. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and develop solution approaches based on a customized Lagrangian relaxation algorithm with an embedded approximation subroutine. A series of hypothetical examples and a real-world Wi-Fi access point design problem for Chicago O'Hare Airport Terminal 5 are used to demonstrate the applicability of the model and solution algorithms.

Thus, this paper proposes a new P&R service mode, Remote P&R (RPR), where the car park locates in a suburban area with lower land value. Dedicated express bus service is used to connect this site and a nearby train station. To quantitatively evaluate the impacts of RPR on the network flows, a combined modal split and traffic assignment model (CMSTA) is developed, where a cross-nested logit (CNL) model is adopted to cope with the mode similarity. The problem is formulated as a convex programming model and solved by the Evans algorithm, and then extended to asymmetric path-based cases, where a variational inequality (VI) model is built and solved by a self-adaptive gradient projection (SAGP) algorithm. Taking the CMSTA as the lower level and multimodal stochastic system optimum (MSSO) as the objective, we further develop a mathematical programming model with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) for the optimal network design of RPR. Based on an origin-based reformulation of the MPEC model, an exact solution method based on the nonlinear valid inequalities (NVI) is applied. Numerical examples demonstrate that the RPR services can significantly influence network users' travel decisions, promote the usage of public transportation and mitigate traffic congestion in the congested area of metropolitan cities.

To further improve the service quality and reduce accident risks, this paper proposes an effective method for collaboratively optimizing the train timetable and accurate passenger flow control strategies on an oversaturated metro line. Through considering the dynamic characteristics of passenger flow, a rigorous integrated integer linear programming model is firstly formulated to minimize the total passenger waiting time at all of involved stations, in which the train timetable provides a service-oriented operation plan and optimal passenger flow control is imposed to avoid congestion on platforms within the transportation capacities. To solve the problem of interest efficiently, a hybrid algorithm, which combines an improved local search and CPLEX solver, is designed to search for high-quality solutions.

Observation of such matching relationship raises some interesting questions: what factors drive the matching of two agents? Is the formation of matching relationship related with joint behavior which may lead to different understandings of planning and operation? To answer these questions, econometric models may be the best methodology. However, to the authors' best knowledge, there lacks a well established econometric model to explain the observed data that contains matching relationship in a two-sided transportation market. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative ordinal joint response model to bridge the gap. The proposed model consists of two regression equations: the first uses a latent dependent variable to disentangle the many-to-many matching relationship; the second specifies an ordered probit equation to investigate the ordinal outcome of joint behavior.

The sample was split into two: one sub-sample to construct the model (algorithm construction sample, n=184), and the other one to confirm it (validation sample, n=61). Various multiple regression models including two-part model, tobit model, and generalized additive models were tested and/or evaluated for predictive ability, consistency of estimated coefficients, normality of prediction errors, and simplicity.Results: Across these studies, mean age was 50-60 years and the proportion of males was 36-59%. At overall level the percentage of patients with controlled disease was 37.4%. Mean (SD) scores for AcroQoL Global Score and EQ-5D utility were 62.3 (18.5) and 0.71 (0.28), respectively. The best model for predicting EQ-5D was a generalized regression model that included the Physical Dimension summary score and categories from questions 9 and 14 as independent variables (Adj. R-2=0.56, with mean absolute error of 0.0128 in the confirmatory sample). Observed and predicted utilities were strongly correlated (Spearman r=0.73, p<.001) and paired t-Student test revealed non-significant differences between means (p>.05). Estimated utility scores showed a minimum error of 10% in 45% of patients; however, error increased in patients with an observed utility score under 0.2. The model's predictive ability was confirmed in the validation cohort.Limitations and conclusions: A mapping algorithm was developed for mapping of AcroQoL to EQ-5D, using patient level data from three previously published studies, and including validation in the confirmatory sub-sample. Mean (SD) utilities index in this study population was estimated as 0.71 (0.28). Additional research may be needed to test this mapping algorithm in other acromegaly populations.","[Badia, Xavier; Carreno, Agata; Roset, Montse] IMS Hlth, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Barcelona, Spain; [Trainer, Peter] Christie NHS Fdn Trust, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Biermasz, Nienke R.; Tiemensma, Jitske] Leiden Univ, Med Ctr, Ctr Endocrine Tumors, Dept Endocrinol & Metab, Leiden, Netherlands; [Tiemensma, Jitske] Univ Calif Merced, Psychol Sci, Merced, CA USA; [Forsythe, Anna] Novartis Pharmaceut, Novartis Oncol, Global Hlth Econ & Market Access, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Webb, Susan M.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Hosp St Pau, IIB St Pau,Endocrinol Dept, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Raras CIBERER, Barcelona, Spain; [Webb, Susan M.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Hosp St Pau, IIB St Pau,Med Dept, Ctr Invest Biomed Red Enfermedades Raras CIBERER, Barcelona, Spain",Christie NHS Foundation Trust; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of California System; University of California Merced; Novartis; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERER; Autonomous University of Barcelona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERER; Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Roset, M (通讯作者)，QuintilesIMS, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res Real World Evidence Solu, Provenca 392,3rd Floor, Barcelona 08025, Spain.",montserrat.roset@quintilesims.com,"Tiemensma, Jitske/F-2355-2010; Biermasz, Nienke/ABE-9436-2021; Webb, Susan/ABQ-3487-2022","Biermasz, Nienke/0000-0001-5817-3594; Webb, Susan/0000-0001-7052-6436; Roset, Montse/0000-0002-4641-9814",Novartis Oncology,Novartis Oncology,"This project was performed with an unrestricted grant from Novartis Oncology.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of budesonide MMX versus commonly used corticosteroids, in the second-line treatment of active mild-to-moderate UC in the Netherlands. Materials and methods: An eight-state Markov model with an 8 week cycle length captured remission, four distinct therapy stages, hospitalization, possible colectomy and mortality. Remission probability for budesonide MMX was based on the CORE-II study. Population characteristics were derived from the Dutch Inflammatory Bowel Disease South Limburg cohort (n = 598) and included patients with proctitis (39%), left-sided (42%) and extensive disease (19%). Comparators (topical budesonide foam and enema, oral budesonide and prednisolone) were selected based on current Dutch clinical practice. Treatment effects were evaluated by network meta-analysis using a Bayesian framework. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over a 5 year time horizon from a societal perspective, with costs, health-state and adverse event utilities derived from published sources. Outcomes were weighted by disease extent distribution and corresponding comparators. Results: Budesonide MMX was associated with comparable quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain versus foam and oral formulations (+0.01 QALYs) in the total UC population, whilst being cost-saving (EUR 366 per patient). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated an 86.6% probability of budesonide MMX being dominant (cost-saving with QALY gain) versus these comparators. Exploratory analysis showed similar findings versus prednisolone. Limitations: Differing definitions of trial end-points and remission across trials meant indirect comparison was not ideal. However, in the absence of head-to-head clinical data, these comparisons are reasonable alternatives and currently offer the only comparison of second-line UC treatments. Conclusions: In the present analysis, budesonide MMX was shown to be cost-effective versus comparators in the total UC population, for the second-line treatment of active mild-to-moderate UC in the Netherlands.","[Gherardi, Alexandre; Roze, Stephane] HEVA HEOR, Immeuble 6e Sens,186 Ave Thiers, F-69006 Lyon, France; [Kuijvenhoven, Johan] Spaarne Gasthuis, Haarlem, Netherlands; [Ghatnekar, Ola] Ferring Int PharmaSci Ctr, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Sonderegger, Yum Lina Yip] Ferring Int Ctr, St Prex, Switzerland",Spaarne Hospital; Ferring Pharmaceuticals; Ferring Pharmaceuticals,"Gherardi, A (通讯作者)，HEVA HEOR, Immeuble 6e Sens,186 Ave Thiers, F-69006 Lyon, France.",agherardi@heva-heor.com,,,Ferring Pharmaceuticals; HEVA-HEOR,Ferring Pharmaceuticals(Ferring Pharmaceuticals); HEVA-HEOR(Health Economics & Outcomes Research Ltd),"HEVA-HEOR received funding from Ferring Pharmaceuticals for analyzing the cost-effectiveness of budesonide MMX in the Netherlands, including the production of a technical report.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) established a total HAC scoring methodology to rank hospitals based upon their HAC performance. Hospitals that rank in the lowest quartile based on their HAC score are subject to a 1% reduction in their total Medicare reimbursements. In FY 2017, 769 hospitals incurred payment reductions totaling $430 million. This study analyzes how improvements in the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), based on the implementation of a cranberry-treatment regimen, impact hospitals' HAC scores and likelihood of avoiding the Medicare-reimbursement penalty. Methods: A simulation model is developed and implemented using public data from the CMS' Hospital Compare website to determine how hospitals' unilateral and simultaneous adoption of cranberry to improve CAUTI outcomes can affect HAC scores and the likelihood of a hospital incurring the Medicare payment reduction, given results on cranberry effectiveness in preventing CAUTI based on scientific trials. The simulation framework can be adapted to consider other initiatives to improve hospitals' HAC scores. Results: Nearly all simulated hospitals improved their overall HAC score by adopting cranberry as a CAUTI preventative, assuming mean effectiveness from scientific trials. Many hospitals with HAC scores in the lowest quartile of the HAC-score distribution and subject to Medicare reimbursement reductions can improve their scores sufficiently through adopting a cranberry-treatment regimen to avoid payment reduction. Limitations: The study was unable to replicate exactly the data used by CMS to establish HAC scores for FY 2018. The study assumes that hospitals subject to the Medicare payment reduction were not using cranberry as a prophylactic treatment for their catheterized patients, but is unable to confirm that this is true in all cases. The study also assumes that hospitalized catheter patients would be able to consume cranberry in either juice or capsule form, but this may not be true in 100% of cases. Conclusion: Most hospitals can improve their HAC scores and many can avoid Medicare reimbursement reductions if they are able to attain a percentage reduction in CAUTI comparable to that documented for cranberry-treatment regimes in the existing literature.","[Saitone, T.

Materials and methods: The authors performed a search for PE guidelines using PubMed, the Cochrane library database, and the websites of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. Information of each guideline was extracted using a pre-designed extraction template, which included 22 aspects; the guidelines were summarized in the forms of charts, and their characteristics have been described. Results: A total of 40 PE guidelines were studied. The most common methodological issues include the types of analysis, sources for effectiveness, use of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to measure outcomes, and use of incremental cost effectiveness ratios to present results. The majority of the guidelines preferred a cost utility analysis with outcomes expressed in terms of QALYs. Most of the guidelines preferred meta-analysis or meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials, and required a systematic review of all evidence. Issues that varied most in the guidelines were the choice of the comparator, recommended costs to be included, methods related to indirect cost calculations, methods of sensitivity analysis, and discounting rate. Conclusion: A comparison of these guidelines revealed that a number of differences exist among them in several key aspects, and some critical methodological issues still exist, for which no best solution is available. Furthermore, efforts need to be made to develop harmonious methods for the PE, and to improve the transferability of the outcomes of PE evaluations.","[Zhao, Ye; Ma, Wen-juan; Tian, Jin-hui] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Feng, Hai-ming; Qu, Ji] Lanzhou Univ, Clin Med Coll 2, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Luo, Xiu] Ningxia Med Univ, Dept NICU, Gen Hosp, Yinchuan, Peoples R China; [Tian, Jin-hui] Key Lab Evidence Based Med & Knowledge Translat G, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University; Ningxia Medical University,"Tian, JH (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ, Sch Basic Med Sci, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",tjh996@163.com,,,,,,,56,29,30,0,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

State-of-the-art research in this field (e.g. anticipatory traffic control approaches) often formulates this as a bi-level optimization problem where users' reactions to changes in signal control are taken into account in the design of the control policies. Solving such a combined optimization problem is possible but difficult and complex which often involves the determination of the dynamic user equilibrium (UE). Nevertheless, anticipatory control inherently aims to optimize the signal control that anticipates or reacts to the users' route choice and thus is a reactive control. Furthermore, the approaches used in anticipatory control are based on the coupling between control and traffic assignment where the route choice behavior of road users is unrealistically assumed to be in equilibrium. This paper proposes a novel utility based optimization framework to design a distributed control scheme based on a so-called BackPressure principle that is scalable and proactively influences the drivers' route choice behavior. In particular, as opposed to the well-studied anticipatory control and bi-level optimization, the proposed utility optimization formulation solves for a system optimal problem where the optimal turning fraction (as an output decision variable) is enforced as a desirable outcome. The optimal turning fractions would then be achieved in a practical deployment either by directly asking the users to follow the systems routing advice or by influencing, i.e. manipulating, the route choice decisions made by them so that the resulting turning fraction is (or is close to) the optimal value. Although drivers may not follow the computed optimal fractions as desire, there exist several ways, e.g. see Groot et al. (2015), to design appropriate incentives for drivers to follow the route guidance, and thus improve the compliance rate and overall journey experience for everyone inside the network. To this end, we demonstrate by numerical results that better network performance is achieved using the proposed framework even with a limited compliance from the users. Furthermore, we have formally proved that our proposed utility optimization based BackPressure scheme stabilizes the network for any feasible traffic demands thus maximizing network throughput. In addition, we show through simulation and numerical results that the new policy outperforms the original BackPressure-based distributed control scheme both in terms of network throughput and other congestion measures such as travel time.

This paper presents an efficient method for finding transport network cuts, which may constitute such bottlenecks. Methods for assessing network vulnerability found in the literature require origin-destination demands and path assignment. However, in transport network planning and design, demand information is often missing, out of date, partial or inaccurate. Capacity weighted spectral partitioning is proposed to identify potential flow bottlenecks in the network, without reference to demand information or path assignments. This method identifies the network cut with least capacity, taking into account the relative sizes of the sub-networks either side of the cut. Spectral analysis has the added advantage of tractability, even for large networks, as shown by numerical examples for a five-node illustrative example, the Sioux Falls road network and the Gifu Prefecture road network.

Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), this study included hospitalizations for IPF (ICD-9-CM 516.3) with a principal diagnosis of respiratory disease (ICD-9-CM 460-519) from 2009-2011; lung transplant admissions were excluded. Total inpatient cost, LOS, in-hospital death, and discharge disposition were reported. Linear regression models were used to determine variables predictive of LOS and cost. Results: From 2009-2011, 22,350 non-transplant IPF patients with a principal diagnosis of respiratory disease were admitted: mean (SE) age was 70.0 (0.32), and 49.1% were female. While in hospital, 11.4% of patients received mechanical ventilation and 8.9% received non-invasive ventilation. Mean (SE) LOS was 7.4 (0.15) days overall (p<.001). The mean (+/- SD) admission cost was $16,042 (+/- 631). Of hospitalized patients, 14.1% died, 20.6% transferred facilities, and 46.4% were routinely discharged. The adjusted LOS (95% CI) for patients with and without mechanical ventilation was 16.1 days (15-17.5) vs. 6.3 (6-6.5); adjusted costs were $48,772 (43,979-53,565) vs. $11,861 (11,292-12,431). Limitations: The positive predictive value of the algorithm used to identify IPF is not optimal. The NIS database does not follow patients longitudinally, and claims after admission are not available. Claims do not indicate whether listed diagnoses were present on admission or developed during hospitalization. The exclusion of transplant-related expenditures lead to under-estimation of cost. Conclusion: Using a nationally-representative database, we found IPF respiratory-related hospitalizations represent a significant economic burden with similar to 7,000 non-transplant IPF admissions per year, at a mean cost of $16,000 per admission. Mechanical ventilation is associated with statistically significant increases in LOS and cost. Therapeutic advances that reduce rates and costs of IPF hospitalizations are needed.","[Mooney, Joshua J.] Stanford Univ, Dept Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Raimundo, Karina] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Chang, Eunice; Broder, Michael S.] Partnership Hlth Analyt Res LLC, Beverly Hills, CA USA",Stanford University; Roche Holding; Genentech; Partnership HealthPlan,"Raimundo, K (通讯作者)，Genentech Inc, US Med Affairs, 1 DNA Way, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA.",raimundo.karina@gene.com,,"Mooney, Joshua/0000-0002-4687-194X",,,,,32,23,24,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We provide an axiomatic set of conditions that a solution should satisfy and use cooperative game theory to model the cost allocation problem. We provide an allocation, called the equal cost share solution, which is efficient to compute and is the unique solution that satisfies the conditions. In addition, we show not only that the cost allocation game has a nonempty core, but further, that the game is concave, meaning that the Shapley value allocation, which coincides with the equal cost share solution, always lies in the core of the game. We provide an application of the equal cost share solution to the Washington, D.C. Metro transit network and compare it to the existing fare pricing structure. As compared to equal cost share pricing, the Metro overcharges for short downtown trips and undercharges for very long commutes. The equal cost share solution is easy to update in real time as the cost data and user distribution change, or when the transit network expands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The model was a simple decision tree, with a 6-month time horizon. The perspective was that of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Modeled treatment effects included reported per-patient histological clearance and recurrence rates. Cost inputs comprised professional consultation time and cost of medication. Health-related utility estimation followed previously published methodology. Adverse events were not modeled. The key data and model structural assumptions followed expected UK practice. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess structural and parameter uncertainty. Results: 5-FU-SA was found to be less costly (-204) and more effective (+0.001 QALY) in base case and sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic analysis there was 100% probability of being cost-effective over cryotherapy at 20,000 willingness to pay. Cost of professional time was a key driver of the model outcome. 5-FU-SA remained dominant across a range of scenario analyses, including exploration of assumptions around setting of care. Limitations: The time horizon of the analysis was short and data were not extrapolated beyond the duration of the clinical trial; however, this approach is consistent with likely follow-up of an AK patient. The clinical outcomes observed in the trial were based on a large proportion of cryotherapy patients undergoing an additional cycle of treatment; this may not occur or be required in an experienced secondary care setting. Conclusion: 5-FU-SA could be considered as a cost-effective choice for treatment of AK lesions of the face and scalp in secondary and mixed care settings in the UK. Use of 5-FU-SA in patients who would otherwise be managed with cryotherapy has the potential to result in cost savings.","[Wojcik, Radek; Lowin, Julia] IMS Hlth Ltd, London, England; [Vilardell, David; Maeso, Silvia; Ruiz, Leonardo] Almirall SA, Global Med Affairs, Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain; [Lear, John T.] Manchester Royal Infirm, Dermatol, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Morton, Colin] Stirling Community Hosp, Valley Dermatol Ctr 4, Stirling, Scotland",Almirall; University of Manchester,"Wojcik, R (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, Real World Evidence Solut & Hlth Econ & Outcomes, 210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England.",rwojcik@uk.imshealth.com,,,Almirall S.A.,Almirall S.A.(Almirall),This study was funded by Almirall S.A.,,24,3,3,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The control policies might meter the number of transferring vehicles from one region to another, resulting in queueing vehicles at regional boundaries. Concentrated vehicles at boundaries might affect the existence of well-defined MFDs. Most pievious works neglect the effect of the boundary concentrated vehicles on the traffic flow dynamics, and do not explicitly consider their effect on the perimeter control policy. This paper introduces a new MFD-based model for two-region networks with aggregate boundary queue dynamics. The dynamic flow characteristics for the two urban regions are modeled by the MFD functions, while aggregate boundary queue dynamics for both regions are modeled by input-output balance differential equations. Maximum lengths are imposed on the aggregate boundary queues, that aim at maintaining the existence of well-defined MFDs and their dynamics. Based on the developed model, the optimal control policy to maximize the total network throughput is found. Analytical solutions for the optimal perimeter control problem, with constrained perimeter control inputs and constrained lengths of aggregate boundary queues, are derived. The optimal synthesis for principal cases are found and verified by numerical tests. The numerical results demonstrate the effect of aggregate boundary queues on the optimal perimeter control policy.

The expected cost minimization framework accounts for travel time cost, schedule miss penalties and fuel cost. It is shown that platooning is beneficial only when scheduled arrival times differ less than a certain threshold. Travel time uncertainty typically reduces the threshold schedule difference for platooning to be beneficial. Platooning in networks is less beneficial on converging routes than diverging routes, due to delay at the merging point. The model provides valuable insights regarding platooning benefits for freight transport planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Healthcare utilization, costs, and mortality were assessed in HSCT patients diagnosed with SOS, with and without multi-organ dysfunction (MOD). Materials and methods: This retrospective observational study identified real-world patients undergoing HSCT between January 1, 2009 and May 31, 2014 using the Premier Healthcare Database. In absence of a formal ICD-9-CM diagnostic code, SOS patients were identified using a pre-specified definition adapted from Baltimore and Seattle criteria and clinical practice. Severe SOS (SOS/MOD) and non-severe SOS (SOS/no-MOD) were classified according to clinical evidence for MOD in the database. Results: Of the 5,418 patients with a discharge diagnosis of HSCT, 291 had SOS, with 134 categorized as SOS/MOD and 157 as SOS/no-MOD. The remaining 5,127 patients had HSCT without SOS. Overall SOS incidence was 5.4%, with 46% having evidence of MOD. Distribution of age, gender, and race were similar between the SOS cohorts and non-SOS patients. After controlling for hospital profile and admission characteristics, demographics, and clinical characteristics, the adjusted mean LOS was 31.0 days in SOS/MOD compared to 23.9 days in the non-SOS cohort (medians=26.9 days vs 20.8 days, p<.001). The adjusted mean cost of SOS/MOD patients was $140,653, which was $41,702 higher than the non-SOS cohort (medians=$105,749 vs $74,395, p<.001). An almost 6-fold increased odds of inpatient mortality was associated with SOS/MOD compared to the non-SOS cohort (odds ratio=5.88; 95% CI=3.45-10.33). Limitations: Limitations of retrospective observational studies apply, since the study was not randomized. Definition for SOS was based on ICD-9 diagnosis codes from a hospital administrative database and reliant on completeness and accuracy of coding. Conclusions: Analysis of real-world data shows that SOS/MOD is associated with significant increases in healthcare utilization, costs, and inpatient mortality.","[Cao, Zhun; Lipkin, Craig B.; Robinson, Scott B.] Premier Res Serv, Charlotte, NC USA; [Villa, Kathleen F.; Nejadnik, Bijan] Jazz Pharmaceut, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Dvorak, Christopher C.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Benioff Childrens Hosp, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",Jazz Pharmaceuticals; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Cao, Z (通讯作者)，Premier Inc, 13034 Ballantyne Corp Pl, Charlotte, NC 28277 USA.",zhun_cao@premierinc.com,"Dvorak, Christopher C/AAX-1630-2020","Dvorak, Christopher C/0000-0002-6146-3952",Jazz Pharmaceuticals,Jazz Pharmaceuticals(Jazz Pharmaceuticals),This study was sponsored and funded by Jazz Pharmaceuticals.,,29,10,10,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Treatment effects and baseline characteristics of patients were derived from the DIAMOND randomized controlled clinical trial; all other assumptions and costs were sourced from published research. The accuracy and clinical effectiveness of G5 Mobile CGM is the same as the G4 Platinum CGM used in the DIAMOND randomized clinical trial. Base case assumptions included (a) baseline HbA1c of 8.6%, (b) change in HbA1c of -1.0% for CGM users vs -0.4% for SMBG users, and (c) disutilities of -0.0142 for non-severe hypoglycemic events (NSHEs) and severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs) not requiring medical intervention, and -0.047 for SHEs requiring medical resources. Treatment costs and outcomes were discounted at 1.5% per year.Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the base case G5 Mobile CGM vs SMBG was $33,789 CAD/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analyses showed that base case results were most sensitive to changes in percentage reduction in hypoglycemic events and disutilities associated with hypoglycemic events. The base case results were minimally impacted by changes in baseline HbA1c level, incorporation of indirect costs, changes in the discount rate, and baseline utility of patients.Conclusions: The results of this analysis demonstrate that G5 Mobile CGM is cost-effective within the population of adults with T1DM using MDI, assuming a Canadian willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 CAD per QALY.","[Chaugule, Shraddha; Graham, Claudia] Dexcom Inc, 6310 Sequence Dr, San Diego, CA 92121 USA",,"Chaugule, S (通讯作者)，Dexcom Inc, 6310 Sequence Dr, San Diego, CA 92121 USA.",shraddha.chaugule@dexcom.com,,,"Dexcom, Inc.","Dexcom, Inc.","This study was supported by funding from Dexcom, Inc.",,62,13,15,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: The search strategy was designed to identify peer-reviewed cost-effectiveness evaluations of non-surgical, pharmaceutical therapies for neuropathic pain published since January 2000, accessing five key databases. All identified publications were reviewed and screened according to pre-defined eligibility criteria. Data extraction was designed to reflect key data challenges and approaches to modeling in neuropathic pain and based on published guidelines. Results: The search strategy identified 20 cost-effectiveness analyses meeting the inclusion criteria, of which 14 had original model structures. Cost-effectiveness modeling in neuropathic pain is established and increasing across multiple jurisdictions; however, amongst these studies, there is substantial variation in modeling approach, and there are common limitations. Capturing the effect of treatments upon health outcomes, particularly health-related quality-of-life, is challenging, and the health effects of multiple lines of ineffective treatment, common for patients with neuropathic pain, have not been consistently or robustly modeled. Conclusions: To improve future economic modeling in neuropathic pain, further research is suggested into the effect of multiple lines of treatment and treatment failure upon patient outcomes and subsequent treatment effectiveness; the impact of treatment-emergent adverse events upon patient outcomes; and consistent and appropriate pain measures to inform models. The authors further encourage transparent reporting of inputs used to inform cost-effectiveness models, with robust, comprehensive and clear uncertainty analysis and, where feasible, open-source modeling is encouraged.","[Critchlow, Simone; Akehurst, Ron; Philips, Zoe; Sullivan, Will] BresMed Hlth Solut, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Hirst, Matthew; Dunlop, Will C.

Materials and methods: A multi-center, retrospective chart review, observational study was designed to describe the treatment patterns, clinical burden, resources use, and associated costs for adult patients diagnosed with cITP and treated in public and private institutions in Brazil. Patient charts were screened in reverse chronological order based on their last visit post January 1, 2012. (All costs were calculated using 1.00 USD=3.9571 BRL, from February 2016.) Results: Of 340 patient charts screened, 50 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Single-drug therapy (prednisone, dexamethasone, or dapsone) was the most commonly used treatment, followed by combination therapies (azathioprine+prednisone, azathioprine+prednisone+danazol, and prednisone+dapsone). Splenectomy was performed in 22% of patients after at least first-line treatment. Platelet count and number of bleeding episodes at diagnosis were 31,561.1/mm(3) (SD = 26,396.1) and 40 episodes, respectively; in first-line, 92,631.1/mm(3) (SD = 79,955.3) and 19 episodes, respectively; in second-line, 96,950.0/mm(3) (SD = +/- 76,476.4) and 17 episodes, respectively. Private system patients had a higher median cost compared to public system patients (USD 17.49/month, range = 0-2,020.77 vs USD 9.51/month, range = 0-192.64, respectively). Limitations: This study does not allow conclusions for causal explanations due to the cohort study design, and treatment patterns represent only the practices of physicians who have agreed to participate in the study. Conclusions: The data indicate that available therapeutic strategies for second- and third-line therapies appear to be limited.","[Kneese Virgilio do Nascimento, Ana Clara] Santa Casa Misericordia Sao Paulo, Dept Clin Med, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Kneese Virgilio do Nascimento, Ana Clara] Ctr Hematol Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Annichino-Bizzacchi, Joyce Maria] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Hematol & Hemoterapia, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Maximo, Claudia de Alvarenga] Inst Estadual Hematol Arthur Siqueira Cavalcanti, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Minowa, Eimy; Julian, Guilherme Silva] Evidencias Kantar Hlth, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [dos Santos, Rafael Freitas] Amgen Brasil, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"dos Santos, RF (通讯作者)，Ave Nacoes Unidas 14-171,22 Andar, BR-04794000 Santo Amaro, Brazil.",rdossant@amgen.com,,"Maximo, Claudia/0000-0002-9351-3766; Silva Julian, Guilherme/0000-0002-3487-2240",Amgen Brazil,Amgen Brazil,This study was sponsored and monitored by Amgen Brazil.

Patient characteristics and treatment costs were analyzed according to the type of cancer. Then the costs and characteristics of patients associated with the use of different G-CSF products were analyzed in the sub-set of breast cancer patients.Results: The most frequent malignancies in the database population were breast cancer (23.3%), hematological malignancies (22.2%), and lung cancer (12.4%). The reimbursed G-CSF was pegfilgrastim in 34.1% of cases, lenograstim in 26.7%, and filgrastim in 17.9%. More than one G-CSF product was reimbursed to 21.3% of patients. The total annual reimbursed health expenses per patient, according to the type of G-CSF, were Euro27,001, Euro24,511, and Euro20,802 for patients treated with filgrastim, lenograstim, and pegfilgrastim, respectively. Ambulatory care accounted for, respectively, 35%, 38%, and 41% of those costs. In patients with breast cancer, ambulatory care cost was Euro7,915 with filgrastim, Euro7,750 with lenograstim, and Euro6,989 with pegfilgrastim, and the respective cost of G-CSF was Euro1,733, Euro1,559, and Euro3,668.Conclusion: All available G-CSF products have been shown to be effective in cancer patients, and both daily G-CSFs and pegylated G-CSF are recommended in international guidelines. Nevertheless, this analysis of G-CSF reimbursement indicates that the choice of product can markedly affect the total cost of ambulatory care.","[Tilleul, Patrick] Paris Sorbonne Univ Pharm, Pitie Salpetriere APHP, Pharm Dept, Paris, France; [Jacot, William] Inst Reg Canc Montpellier ICM, Dept Med Oncol, Montpellier, France; [Emery, Corinne; Lafuma, Antoine] Cemka Eval, 43 Blvd Marechal Joffre 92 340, Bourg La Reine, France; [Gourmelen, Julie] INSERM, U1018, Villejuif, France",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Pitie-Salpetriere - APHP; Sorbonne Universite; Universite de Montpellier; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Saclay,"Emery, C (通讯作者)，Cemka Eval, 43 Blvd Marechal Joffre 92 340, Bourg La Reine, France.",corinne.emery@cemka.fr,,,Chugai Pharma France,Chugai Pharma France,This study was funded by Chugai Pharma France.,,31,4,4,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The main difference between EVs and GVs lies in that certain EVs with immediate charging need have to traverse a specific station for recharging, while GVs and other EVs without immediate charging need do not have such a requirement. The proportion of EVs with immediate charging need, referred to as charging ratio in this study, is an OD specific endogenous variable, related to their daily commute trip lengths and EV driving ranges, i.e., EVs will need recharging once every few days. The MUE conditions state that EVs with charging need choose the routes via a charging station while en route to their destinations with minimum travel time cost, electricity cost plus charging station cost; whereas GVs and EVs without charging need select the routes with minimum travel cost without having to traverse any charging station. This study also captures the interaction between network design (such as charging station locations) and EV demand which follows a logit model calibrated with an EV market survey conducted in Hong Kong. We formulate the MUE problem first with a nonlinear complementarity (NCP) approach and solve it with a gap function, then we relax the charging ratio to be exogenous and formulate a convex mathematical program for efficient solutions, with the charging ratio iteratively determined. Furthermore, we observe that the resultant link flows exhibit the property of link flow preservation, i.e., the total link flows remain unchanged under a range of EV and GV demands. We first solve the Yang-Bell network to demonstrate its properties, and then solve the Sioux-Falls network to show its solution efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Although this practice has been justified by computational tractability and data constraints, it can introduce arbitrary changes to choice-share predictions. We isolate and characterize the implications of using composite vehicles for choice prediction, given exogenously determined model parameters. We first identify correction factors needed for composite models to predict choice shares that are consistent with those from models that use the full set of disaggregated elemental alternatives. We then assess the distortion of choice-share predictions under various composite specifications and partial corrections using two case studies based on models in the literature used in transportation and energy policymaking: (1) we examine a logit model without alternative-specific constants (ASCs) and find that the distortion in share predictions due to composite specification is substantial and can be larger than variation due to parameter uncertainty; (2) we examine counterfactual predictions of a nested logit model with ASCs based on the NEMS and LVChoice models and find that composite models using ASCs can mitigate or eliminate distortion in some, but not all, counterfactual scenarios. In particular, the distortion is larger when the scenario significantly affects the differences in elemental membership or utility heterogeneity between composite groups. We provide explicit correction factors for composite models with and without ASCs that can be used to take advantage of the tractability of composite models while ensuring that their choice-share predictions exactly match those of their corresponding elemental models in counterfactual and forecasting scenarios.

Most methodologies for routing currently minimize distance or travel time. This paper compares total cost (based on driver and fuel costs), fuel consumption/emissions, distance, and travel time for routes resulting from optimizing each of those measures. We explore the impact of multiple factors on these measures as well as the structure of the routes.

Given a timetable of bus trips, it consists of finding a set of bus schedules that covers every trip exactly once while satisfying vehicle availability at each depot and minimizing the operating costs. This work considers a generalization of the MDVSP that allows slight modifications of the trip scheduled start times. By shifting some trips, one can indeed expect to cover all trips with fewer vehicles or less expensive deadheads (vehicle moves without passengers). However, reducing the operational costs in this way should not be too detrimental to the overall quality of the timetable and, therefore, the following criteria should be controlled: the number of shifted trips, the headways between the consecutive trips of a line, and the quality of some passenger connections. To solve this generalized problem, we develop a two-phase matheuristic: the first phase computes vehicle schedules with a column-generation heuristic: the second relies on a mixed integer program to find the best possible timetable considering the computed vehicle schedules. Penalties are introduced in the first phase to increase the chances of finding a better-quality timetable in the second phase. Computational tests on real-life datasets from a bus company show that the proposed matheuristic can solve the problem efficiently, yielding solutions with a significant reduction in the number of vehicles used compared to the solutions of the classical MDVSP and a limited alteration of the timetable.

By adopting a well-defined accessibility measure, this paper studies a new discrete network design problem for metropolitan areas, in which some concepts, including the accessible flow, travel time budget function and principles of user equilibrium and system optimization with travel time budgets, are proposed. Then, two deterministic bi-level programming models are firstly formulated to maximize the network accessible flow. The upper level focuses on choosing the potential links in the pre-specified candidate set, and the lower level assigns all the flows to the super network with principles of user equilibrium or system optimization with travel time budgets. Moreover, to handle uncertain potential demands in reality, the problem of interest is further formulated as two-stage stochastic programming models. To solve these proposed models, efficient heuristic algorithms are designed on the basis of probability search algorithm, Frank-Wolfe algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation method. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments in the Sioux Falls network and San Diego freeway network, are executed to test and analyze the rationality and efficiency of the proposed approaches.

Synchronizing relevant arrival and departure times through small timetable modifications could reduce excess transfer times, but may also directly affect the operational costs, as the timetable defines the set of feasible vehicle schedules. Therefore better results in terms of passenger service, operational costs, or both, could be obtained by solving these problems simultaneously. This paper addresses the tactical level of the integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling problem as a bi-objective mixed integer programming problem that minimizes transfer costs and operational costs. Given an initial non-cyclical timetable, and time dependent service times and passenger demand, the weighted sum of transfer time cost and operational costs is minimized by allowing modifications to the timetable that respect a set of headway constraints. Timetable modifications consist of shifts in departure time and addition of dwell time at intermediate stops with transfer opportunities. A matheuristic is proposed that iteratively solves the mathematical formulation of the integrated timetabling and vehicle scheduling problem allowing timetable modifications for a subset of timetabled trips only, while solving the full vehicle scheduling problem. We compare different selection strategies for defining the sub-problems. Results for a realistic case study of the Greater Copenhagen area indicate that the matheuristic is able to find better feasible solutions faster than a commercial solver and that allowing the addition of dwell time creates a larger potential for reducing transfer costs.

This stream of research is aimed at guiding safe designs and effective evacuation plans by simulating emergency scenarios and estimating measures such as total evacuation time. A large body of research has also been dedicated to the development of modelling tools with the capability to identify (and thus prevent) circumstances that lead to crowd discomfort, crashes or disasters in mass gatherings and public facilities. It has, however, been argued that the empirical knowledge in this area has lagged behind the theoretical developments and computational capabilities. This has left the descriptive power of the existing models for reproducing the natural behaviour of humans questionable given that in many cases there is a lack of reliable and well-conditioned data for model validation or calibration purposes. Methods: With the vast majority of the empirical knowledge in this fast-growing and interdisciplinary field being very recent, a survey of the existing literature is still missing. Here, we gather together the existing empirical knowledge in this area in a comprehensive review (based on surveying more than 160 studies restricted to those published in peer-reviewed journals since 1995) in order to help bridge this gap. We introduce for the first time a categorisation system of the relevant data collection techniques by recognising seven general empirical approaches. We also differentiate between various aspects of human behaviour pertinent to crowd behaviour by putting them into perspective in terms of three general levels of decision making. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages offered by each data collection technique. Major gaps and poorly-explored topics in the current literature are discussed. Findings and applications: Our major conclusion is that the empirical evidence in this area is largely disperse and even in some cases mixed and contradictory, requiring a more unified system of terminologies and problem definitions as well as unified measurement methods in order for the findings of different studies to become replicable and comparable. We also showed that the existing body of empirical studies display a clear imbalance in addressing various aspects of human behaviour with certain (but crucial) aspects (such as pre-movement time and choice of activity) being poorly understood (as opposed to our knowledge and amount of data about walking behaviour for example). Our review also revealed that previous studies have predominantly displayed a stronger tendency to study the behaviour based on aggregate measures as opposed to individual-level data collection attempts. We hope that this collection of findings sets clearer avenues for advancing the knowledge in this area, guides future experiment designs and helps researchers form better-informed hypotheses and choose most suitable data collection methods for their question in hand.

The purpose of this study was to benchmark healthcare resource utilization and costs for patients with THA via AA relative to matched patients. Materials and methods: This study queried Medicare claims data (2012-2014) to identify patients who received THA via an AA from experienced surgeons, and matched these patients to a control cohort (all THA approaches). Direct and propensity-score matching were employed to maximize similarity between patients and hospitals in the two cohorts. Hospital length of stay (LOS), the proportion of patients discharged to home or home health, and post-acute claim payments during the 90-day episode were assessed. Generalized estimating equations were applied to control for imbalances between the cohorts and clustering of outcomes within hospitals. Results: A total of 1,794 patients were included after patient matching. Patients who received AA had significantly lower mean hospital LOS vs patients in the control group (2.061.36 vs 2.98 +/- 1.58 days, p<.0001). The adjusted proportion of patients discharged to home was nearly 20 percentage points higher in the AA cohort vs the control cohort (87.3% vs 68.7%, p<.0001). Post-acute claim payments for AA patients were nearly 50% lower than those for control patients ($4,139 vs $7,465, p<.0001). Conclusion: AA patients had significantly lower post-acute care resource use when compared to control patients. Further research is warranted to evaluate the cost effectiveness of AA among surgeons of varying experience levels.","[Kamath, Atul F.] Univ Penn, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Chitnis, Abhishek S.; Holy, Chantal] Johnson & Johnson Co, Epidemiol Med Devices, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Lerner, Jason] Johnson & Johnson Co, Hlth Econ & Market Access, Raynham, MA USA; [Curtin, Brian] OrthoCarolina, Charlotte, NC USA; [Lochow, Steve] St Marys Hosp, Scott Orthoped Ctr, Huntington, WV USA; [DeCook, Charles] Northside Hosp, Arthrit & Total Joint Specialists, Atlanta, GA USA; [Matta, Joel M.] St Johns Ctr, Hip & Pelvis Inst, Santa Monica, CA USA",University of Pennsylvania; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Chitnis, AS (通讯作者)，Johnson & Johnson Co, Real World Analyt & Res Med Devices, 410 George St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",achitni@its.jnj.com,,"Holy, Chantal/0000-0002-5901-1156",Johnson Johnson (JnJ),Johnson Johnson (JnJ),This study was funded by Johnson & Johnson (JnJ).,,23,13,13,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: The data were retrospectively collected from six tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Overall, 330 patients who were hospitalized for acute heart failure between January 2011 and July 2012 were selected. Data were collected on their follow-up medical visits for 1 year, including medical costs incurred toward treatment. Those who died within the observational period or who had no records of follow-up visits were excluded. Annual per patient medical costs were estimated according to the type of medical services, and factors contributing to the costs using Gamma Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with log link were analyzed. Results: On average, total annual medical costs for each patient were USD 6,199 (+/- 9,675), with hospitalization accounting for 95% of the total expenses. Hospitalization cost USD 5,904 (+/- 9,666) per patient. Those who are re-admitted have 88.5% higher medical expenditure than those who have not been re-admitted in 1 year, and patients using intensive care units have 19.6% higher expenditure than those who do not. When the number of hospital days increased by 1day, medical expenses increased by 6.7%. Limitations: Outpatient drug costs were not included. There is a possibility that medical expenses for AHF may have been under-estimated. Conclusion: It was found that hospitalization resulted in substantial costs for treatment of heart failure in South Korea, especially in patients with an acute heart failure event. Prevention strategies and appropriate management programs that would reduce both frequency of hospitalization and length of stay for patients with the underlying risk of heart failure are needed.","[Kim, Eugene; Yang, Bong-Min] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Hye-Young] Mokwon Univ, Div Biol & Publ Hlth, 88 Doanbuk Ro, Daejeon 35349, South Korea; [Baek, Sang Hong] Catholic Univ Korea Seoul, St Marys Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Haeyoung] Seoul Natl Univ Hosp, Div Cardiol, Dept Internal Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoo, Byung-Su] Yonsei Univ, Wonju Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Kang, Seok-Min] Yonsei Univ, Dept Internal Med, Div Cardiol, Seoul, South Korea; [Ahn, Youngkeun] Cheonnam Natl Univ, Dept Cardiol, Gwangju, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Mokwon University; Seoul St. Mary's Hospital; Catholic University of Korea; Catholic University Korea Hospital; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University Hospital; Yonsei University; Yonsei University,"Kwon, HY (通讯作者)，Mokwon Univ, Div Biol & Publ Hlth, 88 Doanbuk Ro, Daejeon 35349, South Korea.",haeyoungkwon0111@gmail.com,,"Kang, Seok-Min/0000-0001-9856-9227; KIM, EU GENE/0000-0002-3159-3780; Kwon, Hye-Young/0000-0001-9772-1354",Novartis Korea,Novartis Korea,This study was funded by Novartis Korea.,,37,4,4,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The cost-effectiveness of denosumab vs zoledronic acid in MM in the US was assessed from societal and payer perspectives. Methods: The XGEVA Global Economic Model was developed by integrating data from the phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy of denosumab with zoledronic acid for the prevention of SREs in MM. SRE rates were adjusted to reflect the real-world incidence. The model included utility decrements for SREs, administration, serious adverse events (SAEs), and disease progression. Drug, administration, SRE management, SAEs, and anti-MM treatment costs were based on data from published studies. For the societal perspective, the model additionally included SRE-related direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated using a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: From a societal perspective, compared with zoledronic acid, the use of denosumab resulted in an incremental cost of US$26,329 and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.2439, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US$107,939 and a NMB of US$10,259 in favor of denosumab. Results were sensitive to SRE rates and PFS parameters. Limitations: Costs were estimated from multiple sources, which varied by tumor type, patient population, country, and other parameters. PFS and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves. Conclusion: Denosumab's efficacy in delaying or preventing SREs, potential to improve PFS, and lack of renal toxicity make it a cost-effective option for the prevention of SREs in MM compared with zoledronic acid.","[Raje, Noopur] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Canc Ctr, Boston, MA USA; [Roodman, Garson David] Indiana Univ, Simon Canc Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Willenbacher, Wolfgang] Innsbruck Univ Hosp Internal Med Hematol & Oncol, Ctr Personalized Canc Med, Innsbruck, Austria; [Shimizu, Kazuyuki] Natl Hosp Org Higashi Nagoya Natl Hosp, Dept Hematol Oncol, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Garcia-Sanz, Ramon] Hosp Univ Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain; [Terpos, Evangelos] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Alexandra Gen Hosp, Athens, Greece; [Kennedy, Lisa] Epiphany, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Sabatelli, Lorenzo; Intorcia, Michele] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland; [Hechmati, Guy] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA",Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; University of Salamanca; Alexandra Hospital; Athens Medical School; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen,"Intorcia, M (通讯作者)，Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland.",intorcia@amgen.com,"Terpos, Evangelos/AAD-3667-2019; Garcia-Sanz, Ramon/B-7986-2017; Shimizu, Kazuyuki/GVT-4698-2022","Terpos, Evangelos/0000-0001-5133-1422; Garcia-Sanz, Ramon/0000-0003-4120-2787; Shimizu, Kazuyuki/0000-0002-4847-0197","Amgen, Inc","Amgen, Inc(Amgen)","This study was funded by Amgen, Inc.",,59,15,19,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Such a scenario is known as the field service routing problem. Large companies often outsource their field service tasks to several contractors. Each contractor may serve several companies. Since the contractors cannot share the information about the tasks of their other clients, the most common practice involves allocating the tasks to the contractors heuristically based on geographical considerations. In this approach, the tasks for which the contractors have already been committed to other companies are not considered. As a result, the allocation of new tasks can be inefficient. This study develops 2-stage task allocation mechanisms that cope with the problem and result in nearly optimal allocations. In the first stage, a feasible allocation of tasks to contractors is generated. We consider two possible allocation procedures: sequential combinatorial auctions and sequential negotiations. The sequential combinatorial auctions procedure implements the Generalized Vickrey auction, which is a strategy-proof mechanism for the allocation of multiple goods among several competing agents. A sequential negotiation method is suggested as an alternative task allocation mechanism. The method automates a multi-lateral negotiation process in which the company is the leader, and the contractors are followers. In the second stage, the contractors are allowed to exchange the tasks among themselves so as to decrease their operational costs. The exchanges may or may not include money transfers. We found that the first-stage procedures yield fairly efficient allocations and the second stage further improves them. The obtained allocations are considerably more efficient than the solutions generated by a reasonable benchmark heuristic. Moreover, the allocations' costs are close to a lower bound established by the optimal allocation of a central planner. That is, the price of decentralization is shown to be small.

Besides congestion caused by the daily commuters, congestion during public holidays is also very typical. The traffic volume often has a sharp increase during public holidays, which puts a heavy burden on the road capacity and results in severe congestion. This is especially true for the beginning and ending of the holidays. The situation is even worse under some government policies designed initially to benefit people, e.g. the highway toll-exemption during public holidays in China. The focus of this paper is to model the evolution of traffic congestion caused by the demand from residential place to the famous resorts during public holidays. The research questions include: (1) how do tourists tradeoff between schedule delay, queuing time and the overcrowding of the resort? and (2) the impact of the toll-exemption policy during public holidays on tourists' departure time choices and the social welfare. By adopting the bottleneck model, we obtain the cumulative departure curves of tourists during public holidays. Closed-form results of tourists' departure time variation with the toll-exemption policy are obtained, as well as the resulting social efficiency loss, which is significant for the management of the traffic mobility during public holidays.

We first present an equivalent formulation of the problem using a Hamilton Jacobi equation. Then, using a semi-analytic formula, we show that the model constraints resulting from the Hamilton Jacobi equation are linear ones. We then pose the problem of estimating the traffic density given incomplete and inaccurate traffic data as a Mixed Integer Program. We then extend the density estimation framework to highway networks with any available data constraint and modeling junctions. Finally, we present a travel estimation application for a small network using real traffic measurements obtained obtained during Mobile Century traffic experiment, and comparing the results with ground truth data.

However, the majority of this literature assumes that supply is always available. In reality, a significant portion of the materials that flow through the humanitarian relief chain are donations, which represent an uncertain supply source in terms of both quantity and timing. This paper investigates a two-stage relief chain consisting of a single staging area (SA) where donations arrive over time in uncertain quantities, which are periodically distributed to random numbers of disaster survivors located at a point of distribution (POD). A single vehicle travels back and forth between the SA and POD transporting relief supplies during a finite horizon. The goal of this study is to identify dispatching policies for the vehicle with the sole purpose of minimizing unsatisfied demand at the POD. To this end, we examine the effectiveness of two common-sense heuristic policies relative to the optimal dispatching policy, the latter of which is determined via stochastic dynamic programming. Our findings indicate that although continuously dispatching the vehicle between the SA and POD is not an optimal policy, it is either optimal or close to optimal in most situations.

Passengers in these large cities heavily rely on urban subway networks for their daily life. The departure times of the last trains running on different lines of an urban subway network should be well coordinated in order to serve more passengers who can successfully transfer from one line to another, which is referred to as the last train departure time choice problem. This study aims to develop a global optimization method that can solve the last train departure time choice problem for large-scale urban subway networks. To do so, it first formulates a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by introducing auxiliary binary and integer decision variables. For the real-life and large-scale instances, however, the formulated MILP model cannot be solved directly by the global optimization methods such as branch-and-bound algorithm invoked by CPLEX one of the powerful optimization solvers because of the instance sizes. An effective two-phase decomposition method is thus proposed to globally solve the large-scale problems by decomposing the original MILP into two MILP models with small sizes. Finally, a real case study from the Beijing subway network is conducted to assess the efficiency and applicability of the two-phase decomposition method and perform the necessary sensitivity analysis of the operational parameters involved in the last train departure time choice problem.

The ATTS is different from ITS in both entry policy and fare setting, and brings competition into the market. To account for the revolution of the taxi industry, in this study, we analyze the characteristics of the TTS and ATTS, model the taxi market as a multiple-leader-follower game at the network level, and investigate the equilibrium of taxi market with competition (TMC Equilibrium). In particular, passengers are modeled as the leaders who seek to minimize their travel cost associated with taxi rides. Followers involve TTS and NITS drivers, who compete for passengers to maximize their revenue. The network model captures selfish behavior of passengers and drivers in the taxi market, and we prove the existence of TMC Equilibrium for the proposed model using variational inequality formulations. An iterative algorithm is further developed to find the TMC Equilibrium, which corresponds to the strongly stationary point of the multi-leader-follower game.

The resulting model is also straightforward and fast to use for prediction. Following Daly and Bierlaire (2006), the correlation structure is defined by a rooted, directed graph where each node without successor is an alternative. We formulate a family of MEV models as dynamic discrete choice models on graphs of correlation structures and show that the dynamic models are consistent with MEV theory and generalize the network MEV model (Daly and Bierlaire, 2006). Moreover, we show that these models can be estimated quickly using the concept of network flows and the nested fixed point algorithm (Rust, 1987). The main reason for the short computational time is that the new formulation allows to benefit from existing efficient solution algorithms for sparse linear systems of equations. We present numerical results based on simulated data with varying number of alternatives and nesting structures. We estimate large models, for example, a cross-nested model with 200 nests and 500,000 alternatives and 210 parameters that needs between 100200 iterations to converge (4.3 h on an Intel(R) 3.2 GHz machine using a non-parallelized code). We also show that our approach allows to estimate a cross-nested logit model of 111 nests with a real data set of more than 100,000 observations in 14 h. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on ICD-9 codes, patients were stratified into cohorts by type of metastases (BM, other metastases [OM], or no metastases [NM]), and by when the metastasis diagnosis occurred (synchronous or asynchronous).Results: The population (synchronous BM [SBM]=24, synchronous OM [SOM]=23, asynchronous BM [ASBM]=15, asynchronous OM [ASOM]=49, NM=85) was mostly female (57%), average age 69 years (SD=11). SBM patients experienced more fatigue and nausea/vomiting compared with SOM and NM patients and more headaches and loss of appetite than NM patients. ASBM was associated with more fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headaches, pain/numbness, altered mental status, and seizures than NM, and more headaches and pain/numbness than ASOM. SBM patients experienced a greater increase in per-member-per-month all-cause total healthcare costs after diagnosis ($20,301) vs SOM ($9,131, p=.001) and NM ($2,493, p=.001). ASBM's cost increase between baseline and follow-up ($7,867) did not differ from ASOM's ($4,947, p=.195); both were larger than NM ($2,493, p=.001 and p=.009, respectively).Limitations:EGFR mutation status was inferred based on EGFR-TKI treatment, not by molecular testing. Patients were from US commercial insurance plans; results may not be generalizable to other populations.Conclusions: Among patients with EGFR-TKI-treated NSCLC, patients with BM experienced more symptoms and, when diagnosed synchronously, had significant increases in total medical costs vs patients with OM and NM. Therapeutic options with central nervous system activity may offer advantages in symptomatology and costs in EGFR-mutated patients with BM.","[Fernandes, Ancilla W.] AstraZeneca Pharmaceut LP, 1 Medimmune Way, Gaithersburg, MD 20578 USA; [Wu, Bingcao] Janssen Pharmaceut Inc, Titusville, NJ USA; [Turner, Ralph M.] HealthCore Inc, Wilmington, DE USA","AstraZeneca; Medimmune; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; HealthCore, Inc","Fernandes, AW (通讯作者)，AstraZeneca Pharmaceut LP, 1 Medimmune Way, Gaithersburg, MD 20578 USA.",ancilla.fernandes@astrazeneca.com,,,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),Funding for this study was provided by AstraZeneca.,,43,20,21,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective of this analysis was to assess healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with AEs, previously identified using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) in another study, among TKI-treated patients. Methods: Adult patients with >= 1 inpatient or >= 2 outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for CML and >= 1 claim for a TKI treatment between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2012 were identified from the Commercial and Medicare MarketScan databases. The first claim for a TKI was designated as the index event. Patients were required to have no TKI treatment during a 12-month baseline period. Healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with select AEs having the strongest association with TKI treatment (femoral arterial stenosis [FAS], peripheral arterial occlusive disease [PAOD], intermittent claudication, coronary artery stenosis [CAS], pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, malignant pleural effusion, conjunctival hemorrhage) were evaluated during a 12-month follow-up period. Results: The study sample included 2,005 CML patients receiving TKI therapy (mean age=56 years; 56% male). Among all evaluated AEs, the highest mean inpatient healthcare costs were observed for FAS ($16,800 per patient) and PAOD ($14,263 per patient), which had total mean medical costs (inpatient+outpatient) of $17,015 and $15,154 per patient, respectively. Mean outpatient healthcare costs were highest for CAS ($1,861 per patient), followed by intermittent claudication ($947 per patient), PAOD ($891 per patient), and pleural effusion ($890 per patient). Total mean medical costs for fluid retention-related AEs, including pericardial effusion and pleural effusion, were $2,797 and $1,908 per patient, respectively. Conclusions: The healthcare costs of AEs identified in the FAERS as having the strongest association with TKI treatment are substantial. Vascular stenosis-related AEs, including FAS and PAOD, have the highest cost burden.","[Lin, Jay; Lingohr-Smith, Melissa] Novosys Hlth, 288 Route 22 West,Suite G-H Mail 7, Green Brook, NJ 08812 USA; [Makenbaeva, Dinara; Bilmes, Robyn] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Lin, J (通讯作者)，Novosys Hlth, 288 Route 22 West,Suite G-H Mail 7, Green Brook, NJ 08812 USA.",jay.lin@novosyshealth.com,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study and development of this manuscript was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,9,4,4,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study aimed to evaluate long-term cost-effective of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor monothearpy vs sulfonylurea (SFU) monotherapy in people with T2DM and CKD. Methods: A validated IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to estimate the long-term costs and outcomes. The efficacy parameters were identified and synthesized using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Baseline characteristics and cost parameters were obtained from published studies and hospital databases in Thailand. Costs were expressed in 2014 US Dollars. Outcomes were presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate parameter uncertainty. Results: From a societal perspective, treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors yielded more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.024) at a higher cost (> 66,000 Thai baht (THB) or > 1,829.27 USD) per person than SFU, resulting in the ICER of > 2.7 million THB/QALY (> 74,833.70 USD/QALY). The cost-effectiveness results were mainly driven by differences in HbA1c reduction, hypoglycemic events, and drug acquisition cost of DPP-4 inhibitors. At the ceiling ratio of 160,000 THB/QALY (4,434.59 USD/QALY), the probability that DPP-4 inhibitors are cost-effective compared to SFU was less than 10%. Conclusions: Compared to SFU, DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy is not a cost-effective treatment for people with T2DM and CKD in Thailand.","[Permsuwan, Unchalee] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, CPOR, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Fac Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Inst Clin & Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Saokaew, Surasak] Univ Phayao, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res & Therapeut Safety COHORTS, Phayao, Thailand; [Saokaew, Surasak; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Pharm, Wisconsin, MA USA",Chiang Mai University; Naresuan University; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; University of Toronto; University of Phayao; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; University of Queensland,"Chaiyakunapruk, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia.",nathorn.chaiyakunapruk@monash.edu,"Saokaew, Surasak/AAI-9804-2021; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/AFR-0151-2022","Saokaew, Surasak/0000-0002-1382-0660; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/0000-0002-6981-1771; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn/0000-0003-4572-8794; Thavorn, Kednapa/0000-0003-4738-8447","Subcommittees of the National List of Essential Medicine, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand","Subcommittees of the National List of Essential Medicine, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand","This study was supported by grants from the Subcommittees of the National List of Essential Medicine, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand.",,51,8,8,4,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

From a health plan perspective using claims data in a commercial population, the objective was to identify and quantify the effects of cost drivers in economic models of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer costs over a 6-month episode following initial chemotherapy. Research design and methods: This study analyzed claims data from 9,748 Cigna beneficiaries with diagnosis of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer following initial chemotherapy from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. We used multivariable regression models to quantify the impact of key factors on cost during the initial 6-month cancer care episode. Results: Metastasis, facility provider affiliation, episode risk group (ERG) risk score, and radiation were cost drivers for all three types of cancer (breast, lung, and colorectal). In addition, younger age (p<.0001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 oncogene overexpression (HER2+)-directed therapy (p<.0001) were associated with higher costs in breast cancer. Younger age (p<.0001) and female gender (p<.0001) were also associated with higher costs in colorectal cancer. Metastasis was also associated with 50% more hospital admissions and increased hospital length of stay (p<.001) in all three cancers over the 6-month episode duration. Chemotherapy and supportive drug therapies accounted for the highest proportion (48%) of total medical costs among beneficiaries observed. Conclusions: Value-based reimbursement models in oncology should appropriately account for key cost drivers. Although claims-based methodologies may be further augmented with clinical data, this study recommends adjusting for the factors identified in these models to predict costs in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.","[Sagar, Bhuvana] Cigna Hlth & Life Insurance Co, Plano, TX USA; [Lin, Yu Shen] Cigna Hlth & Life Insurance Co, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Castel, Liana D.] Cigna Hlth & Life Insurance Co, 900 Cottage Grove Rd, Bloomfield, CT 06002 USA; [Castel, Liana D.] Univ Mt Olive, Tillman Sch Business, Mt Olive, NC USA",,"Castel, LD (通讯作者)，Cigna Hlth & Life Insurance Co, 900 Cottage Grove Rd, Bloomfield, CT 06002 USA.",liana.castel@cigna.com,"Bruce, Liana/JXN-9508-2024; Bruce, Liana DesHarnais/E-7343-2011","Bruce, Liana DesHarnais/0000-0003-1221-2441",Cigna,Cigna,"Work was performed at, and funded by, Cigna.

Through analyzing the direct loss of storm surge in five typical coastal provinces by GCRA model, we can draw the conclusion that five typical provinces can be divided into three types. For the government and related disaster management departments, when they make the policy and take relevant measures in the process of storm surge prevention, they may take similar policies or measures for the same type of provinces, in order to improve administrative efficiency.

Materials and methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2014 Japan National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS) (n = 144,692). HRQoL (Short Form 36-Item Health Survey version 2), impairments to work productivity and daily activities (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire), healthcare resource utilization, and annual costs were compared between respondents with PD (n = 133) and controls without PD (n = 144,559). The effect of PD on outcomes was estimated using propensity score weighting and multivariable regression models. Results: HRQoL was lower in patients with PD compared to the control group, with reduced physical (41.3 vs 51.3) and mental (35.7 vs 45.4) component summary scores and health state utility scores (0.62 vs 0.77; p < .001 for all). Patients with PD also reported higher levels of absenteeism (19.3% vs 3.3%), presenteeism (45.2% vs 18.5%), overall work impairment (52.8% vs 20.3%), and activity impairment (49.6% vs 20.8%) than controls without PD (p < .001 for all). In addition, patients with PD had higher healthcare resource utilization, direct ( yen 3,856,921/$37,994 vs yen 715,289/$7,046), and indirect ( yen 2,573,938/$25,356 vs yen 902,534/$8,891) costs compared with controls without PD (p < .001 for both). Limitations: Data were cross-sectional and did not allow for causal inferences. Although the NHWS demographically represents the Japanese adult population, it is unclear whether it adequately represents the adult population with PD in Japan. Conclusions: PD was associated with poorer HRQoL, greater work productivity loss, and higher direct and indirect costs. The findings suggest that an unmet need exists among patients with PD in Japan. Improving PD treatment and management could benefit both patients and society.","[Yamabe, Kaoru] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Liebert, Ryan; Flores, Natalia] Kantar Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Pashos, Chris] Takeda Pharmaceut Int Co, Cambridge, MA USA","Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.","Yamabe, K (通讯作者)，Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Healthcare Policy & Access, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Nihon Bashi Honcho, Tokyo, Japan.",kaoru.yamabe@takeda.com,,,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd),This study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.,,37,8,9,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This problem, known as the Time Window Assignment Vehicle Routing Problem, can be viewed as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem, where time window assignments constitute first-stage decisions, vehicle routes adhering to the assigned time windows constitute second-stage decisions, and the objective is to minimize the expected routing costs. To that end, we develop in this paper a new scenario decomposition algorithm to solve the sampled deterministic equivalent of this stochastic model. From a modeling viewpoint, our approach can accommodate both continuous and discrete sets of feasible time window assignments as well as general scenario-based models of uncertainty for several routing specific parameters, including customer demands and travel times, among others. From an algorithmic viewpoint, our approach can be easily parallelized, can utilize any available vehicle routing solver as a black box, and can be readily modified as a heuristic for large-scale instances. We perform a comprehensive computational study to demonstrate that our algorithm strongly outperforms all existing solution methods, as well as to quantify the trade-off between computational tractability and expected cost savings when considering a larger number of future scenarios during strategic time window assignment.

However, as an effect of the used choice models, conventional applications of SUE are based on the assumption that all available routes have a positive probability of being chosen, however unattractive. In this paper, a novel choice model, the Bounded Choice Model (BCM), is presented along with network conditions for a corresponding Bounded SUE. The model integrates an exogenously-defined bound on the random utility of the set of paths that are used at equilibrium, within a Random Utility Theory (RUT) framework. The model predicts which routes are used and unused (the choice sets are equilibrated), while still ensuring that the distribution of flows on used routes accords to a Discrete Choice Model. Importantly, conditions to guarantee existence and uniqueness of the Bounded SUE are shown. Also, a corresponding solution algorithm is proposed and numerical results are reported by applying this to the Sioux Falls network. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Contrary to the classic double marginalization problem, the first implication is that a monopolistic manufacturer benefits from decentralization when its technology is sufficiently polluting. Secondly, with two competing manufacturers, both are more likely to decentralize in equilibrium when their technologies are more polluting. Under certain conditions, decentralized manufacturers may enjoy higher profits thanks to tax cuts without affecting social welfare or consumer surplus.

Since 2007, Benin has experienced frequent floods. In the semiarid zone of Benin, the last flood occurred in August 2012, and many farmers lost most of their crops. However, no study was conducted to show the effects of recent flooding on the livelihoods of farmers. To fill this gap in knowledge, a survey was conducted in Benin, a small country located in the south of the Sahel. Two municipalities, Malanville and Karimama, were chosen because of their locations at the downstream of the Benin part of the Niger basin and the harsh effects experienced by the farmers during the flooding in 2012. Within these municipalities, we focused on the villages near the four rivers of the basin. Within the 19 villages targeted, the sampling rate was 14.67%, and the sample size was 228 farmers. The econometric framework adopted was the Rubin causal model with simple linear regression using ordinary least squares. The results show that the 2012 flood had significant impacts. An increase of 1% in flooding duration was found to correspond to a loss in agricultural income of approximately 0.40%. When a farmer stated that the severity of flooding in 2012 was major, his household agricultural income was reduced by approximately 1.44% compared to a farmer who stated that the flooding was minor. An increase of 1% in the cultivated area that was flooded corresponded to a loss in agricultural income of approximately 0.27%. The introduction of water-resistant species to withstand the effects of flooding should be encouraged in the study area. Future researches will focus on the estimation of flood insurance premiums, the design of the insurance, and the implementation of the insurance.","[Bonou, Alice] ASE, Abomey Calavi, Benin; [Bonou, Alice; Wunscher, Tobias] Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, WASCAL, GRP Climate Change Econ, Dakar, Senegal; [Bonou, Alice; Adegbidi, Anselme Adeniyi] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Lab Appl Ecol, Cotonou, Benin; [Wunscher, Tobias] EARTH Univ, Guacimo De Limon, Costa Rica; [Adegbidi, Anselme Adeniyi] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Abomey Calavi, Benin; [Diaw, Adama] Univ Gaston Berger, St Louis, Senegal",University of Abomey Calavi; University Cheikh Anta Diop Dakar; University of Abomey Calavi; University of Abomey Calavi; Universite Gaston Berger,"Bonou, A (通讯作者)，ASE, Abomey Calavi, Benin.;Bonou, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cheikh Anta Diop, West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, WASCAL, GRP Climate Change Econ, Dakar, Senegal.;Bonou, A (通讯作者)，Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Agron Sci, Lab Appl Ecol, Cotonou, Benin.",alice.bonou@gmail.com; twuenscher@earth.ac.cr; ansadegbidi@yahoo.fr; adamadiaw@netcourrier.com,"Bonou, Alice/AAV-6037-2021","Bonou Fandohan, Alice/0000-0001-8754-5086; Wunscher, Tobias/0000-0003-1632-9065",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL),German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through the West African Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL).

Methods: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, this study identified patients with lung cancer between 2006-2010, at least 66 years of age, and continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B in the 12 months prior to cancer diagnosis. The diagnosis of pre-existing COPD in lung cancer patients was identified using ICD-9 codes. Healthcare utilization and costs were categorized as inpatient hospitalizations, skilled nursing facility (SNF) use, physician office visits, ER visits, and outpatient encounters for every stage of lung cancer. The adjusted analysis was performed using a generalized linear model for healthcare costs and a negative binomial model for healthcare utilization. Results: Inpatient admissions in the COPD group increased for each stage of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to the non-COPD group per 100 person-months (Stage I: 14.67 vs 9.49 stays, p<.0001; Stage II: 14.13 vs 10.78 stays, p<.0001; Stage III: 28.31 vs 18.91 stays, p<.0001; Stage IV: 49.5 vs 31.24 stays, p<.0001). A similar trend was observed for outpatient visits, with an increase in utilization among the COPD group (Stage I: 1136.04 vs 796 visits, p<.0001; Stage II: 1325.12 vs 983.26 visits, p<.0001; Stage III: 2025.47 vs 1656.64 visits, p<.0001; Stage IV: 2825.73 vs 2422.26 visits, p<.0001). Total direct costs per person-month in patients with pre-existing COPD were significantly higher than the non-COPD group across all services ($54,799.16 vs $41,862.91). Outpatient visits represented the largest cost category across all services in both groups, with higher costs among the COPD group ($41,203 vs $31,140.08). Conclusion: Healthcare utilization and costs among lung cancer patients with pre-existing COPD was similar to 2-3-times higher than the non-COPD group.","[Shah, Shweta; Blanchette, Christopher M.; Howden, Reuben] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Coyle, Joseph C.; Arthur, Susan T.; Howden, Reuben] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Dept Kinesiol, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Kowalkowski, Marc] Carolinas Healthcare Syst, Levine Canc Inst, Charlotte, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Carolinas HealthCare System,"Shah, S (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, 9201 Univ City Bvld, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",shweta.kshah1@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,8,8,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study proposes an analytical capacity model for highway mixed traffic based on a Markov chain representation of spatial distribution of heterogeneous and stochastic headways. This model captures not only the full spectrum of CAV market penetration rates but also all possible values of CAV platooning intensities that largely affect the spatial distribution of different headway types. Numerical experiments verify that this analytical model accurately quantifies the corresponding mixed traffic capacity at various settings. This analytical model allows for examination of the impact of different CAV technology scenarios on mixed traffic capacity. We identify sufficient and necessary conditions for the mixed traffic capacity to increase (or decrease) with CAV market penetration rate and platooning intensity. These theoretical results caution scholars not to take CAVs as a sure means of increasing highway capacity for granted but rather to quantitatively analyze the actual headway settings before drawing any qualitative conclusion. This analytical framework further enables us to build a compact lane management model to efficiently determine the optimal number of dedicated CAV lanes to maximize mixed traffic throughput of a multi-lane highway segment. This optimization model addresses varying demand levels, market penetration rates, platooning intensities and technology scenarios. The model structure is examined from a theoretical perspective and an analytical approach is identified to solve the optimal CAV lane number at certain common headway settings. Numerical analyses illustrate the application of this lane management model and draw insights into how the key parameters affect the optimal CAV lane solution and the corresponding optimal capacity. This model can serve as a useful and simple decision tool for near future CAV lane management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The promotion of green transport modes is a worthwhile and sustainable approach to change transport mode shares and to contribute to healthier travel choices. In this paper, we provide an alternate weibit-based model for the combined modal split and traffic assignment (CMSTA) problem that explicitly considers both similarities and, heterogeneous perception variances under congestion. Instead of using the widely-adopted Gumbel distribution, both mode and route choice decisions are derived from random utility theory using the Weibull distributed random errors. At the mode choice level, a nested weibit (NW) model is developed to relax the identical perception variance of the logit model. At the route choice level, the recently developed path-size weibit (PSW) is adopted to handle both route overlapping and route-specific perception variance. Further, an equivalent mathematical programming (MP) formulation is developed for this NW-PSW model as a CMSTA problem under congested networks. Some properties of the proposed models are also rigorously proved. Using this alternate weibit-based NW-PSW model, different go-green strategies are quantitatively evaluated to examine (a) the behavioral modeling of travelers' mode shift between the private motorized mode and go-green modes and (b) travelers' route choice with consideration of both non-identical perception variance and route overlapping. The results reveal that mode shares and route choices from the NW-PSW model can better reflect the changes in model parameters and in network characteristics than the traditional logit and extended logit models.

Different types of experimental designs that underlie such surveys have been used in practice. In unlabelled experiments, where all alternatives are described by the same generic utility function, such designs may suffer from choice tasks containing a dominant alternative. Also in labelled experiments with alternative specific attributes and constants such dominance may occur, but to a lesser extent. We show that dominant alternatives are problematic because they affect scale and may bias parameter estimates. We propose a new measure based on minimum regret to calculate dominance and automatically detect such choice tasks in an experimental design or existing dataset. This measure is then used to define a new experimental design type that removes dominance and ensures the making of trade-offs between attributes. Finally, we propose a new regret-scaled multinomial logit model that takes the level of dominance within a choice task into account. Results using simulated and empirical data show that the presence of dominant alternatives can bias model estimates, but by making scale a function of a smooth approximation of normalised minimum regret we can properly account for scale differences without the need to remove choice tasks with dominant alternatives from the dataset.

Our analysis shows that parking reforms at the CBD that increase delay congestion costs in the short-run such as parking supply limits can be welfare improving if other commuting externalities such as air pollution can be reduced. In addition, because parking limits can also change location decisions such as where to live and invest they may complement anti-sprawl policies efforts by leading to a more compact urban spatial structure in the long run. We also show that changes in downtown parking supply can have different spatial impacts on the market supply of residential parking by affecting urban residents' location decisions. Finally, we investigate whether the self-financing theorem of transportation economics holds within the context of our spatial urban model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Propensity score weighting was used to balance baseline characteristics that were associated with increased healthcare expenditures across treatment groups. Multivariate analyses assessed the impact of switching and persistence on all-cause and OAB-related healthcare costs and resource utilization in the year following each patient's index date.Results: In total, 449 patients were included in this study: 54 patients were included in the onabotA group, and 395 patients were included in the mirabegron persister group. Compared with the mirabegron persister patients, the onabotA patients observed significantly higher OAB-related total costs ($5,504 vs $1,772, p<.001), OAB-related medical costs ($5,033 vs $351, p<.001), sacral neuromodulation costs ($865 vs $60, p=.017), and outpatient costs ($17,385 vs $9,035, p=.009), and more OAB-related medical visits (6.0 vs 1.9, p<.001). OnabotA patients had lower OAB-related prescription costs ($470 vs $1,421, p<.001) and fewer OAB-related pharmacy claims (1.6 vs 5.0, p<.001).

One of the major issues faced by the operators of these systems is the optimization of the relocation operations of personnel and vehicles. These relocation operations are essential in order to ensure that vehicles are available for use at the right place at the right time. Vehicle availability is a key indicator expressing the level of service offered to customers. However, the relocation operations, that ensure this availability, constitute a major cost component for the provision of these services. Therefore, clearly there is a trade-off between the cost of vehicle and personnel relocation and the level of service offered. In this paper we are developing, solving, and applying, in a real world context, an integrated multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MMILP) optimization and discrete event simulation framework to optimize operational decisions for vehicle and personnel relocation in a carsharing system with reservations. We are using a clustering procedure to cope with the dimensionality of the operational problem without compromising on the quality of the obtained results. The optimization framework involves three mathematical models: (i) station clustering, (ii) operations optimization and (iii) personnel flow. The output of the optimization is used by the simulation in order to test the feasibility of the optimization outcome in terms of vehicle recharging requirements. The optimization model is solved iteratively considering the new constraints restricting the vehicles that require further charging to stay in the station until the results of the simulation are feasible in terms of electric vehicles' battery charging levels. The application of the proposed framework using data from a real world system operating in Nice, France sheds light to trade-offs existing between the level of service offered, resource utilization, and certainty of fulfilling a trip reservation.

As PAH progresses, patients become unable to perform even routine daily tasks without severe shortness of breath (dyspnea), fatigue, dizziness, and fainting (syncope). Treatment strategies largely depend on assessment of an individual patient's WHO Functional Class. The aim of the present study was to determine whether PAH functional decline, as described by the WHO Functional class (FC), is associated with increased healthcare costs for patients.Methods: Patients with a prescription for a FDA-approved treatment for PAH and a medical claim indicating chronic pulmonary heart disease or right heart catheterization were identified from an administrative claims database. Provider-reported data from prior authorization forms required for advanced PAH therapies and medical charts were examined for reported FC. Healthcare resource utilization and costs were the primary outcomes of interest. Costs were accounted in 2014US dollars ($) from a healthcare payer perspective.Results: Patients with a reported FC-IV were observed to have the worst outcomes; averaging significantly more inpatient admissions, longer average lengths of stay, and more emergency department visits than the other FC sub-groups, resulting in higher medical costs.Conclusions: Using administrative data to document disease severity, this study replicates and expands on findings obtained from the registry study; disease severity was associated with higher healthcare resource utilization and costs.

In the study of complex systems, we tend to get highly uncertain information due to the dynamic and complexity of the cases and our knowledge limitations. Moreover, complex systems are compounded of many parts, and the methods of data collection and storage vary considerably. Hence, the data processed by complex systems are associated with multi-type uncertainty, such as randomness, fuzziness and greyness. To solve the problems of limitations in the conventional representation and operations of uncertain data, this paper proposes a new type of method to represent and operate multi-type uncertain data. Firstly, we fully analyze the features of probability numbers, fuzzy numbers, interval valued fuzzy numbers and grey numbers, and study their relation and commonness so as to propose the concept and representation methods of generalized standard grey numbers.

Materials and methods: The Local Impact of Hypoglycemia Tool (LIHT) was used to estimate the costs associated with insulin-related hypoglycemia. Average utilization of healthcare resources, including the costs of pre-hospitalization, hospital admission, healthcare professional contact and follow-up, glucose/ glucagon, and extra SMBG tests to monitor blood glucose following an episode, was used to calculate an average cost per severe and per non-severe hypoglycemic episode. The cost per episode was then applied to the rates of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia in people with T1DM and T2DM in Denmark. Results: The direct cost of insulin-related hypoglycemia in Denmark is DKK 96.2 million per year, which equates to EUR 12.9 million. For people with T1DM prone to severe hypoglycemia (defined as having >= 2 severe episodes in the past year), the cost per person per year increases by DKK 4,155 compared with the T1DM population average, and for people with T2DM prone to non-severe hypoglycemia (defined as having >= 1 non-severe episode in the last 4 weeks), the cost increases by DKK 647 per person per year compared with the T2DM population average. Conclusions: The LIHT highlights the substantial economic burden of insulin-related hypoglycemia in Denmark, and provides a means to estimate the savings that could be made by lowering hypoglycemia rates. For example, the costs associated with using a new insulin or introducing a patient education program could be offset with the cost saving from reducing hypoglycemia.","[Hoskins, Nicki] DRG Abacus, Bicester, Oxon, England; [Tikkanen, Christian Klyver] Novo Nordisk Hlth Care AG, Novo Nordisk, Zurich, Switzerland; [Pedersen-Bjergaard, Ulrik] Nordsjaellands Hosp Hillerod, Dept Cardiol Nephrol & Endocrinol, Hillerod, Denmark",Novo Nordisk; University of Copenhagen,"Tikkanen, CK (通讯作者)，Novo Nordisk Hlth Care AG, Novo Nordisk, Zurich, Switzerland.",ctik@novonordisk.com,"Pedersen-Bjergaard, Ulrik/AAI-2425-2019","Tikkanen, Christian/0000-0003-4474-6237; Pedersen-Bjergaard, Ulrik/0000-0003-0588-4880",Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),This study was funded by Novo Nordisk.,,38,8,8,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Adult CML patients initiated on first-line dasatinib or nilotinib in 2010-2014 were identified from two large US administrative claims databases. Treatment patterns, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) adherence and healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs were measured from the 1st-line TKI initiation (index date) to the end of follow-up. Results: A total of 604 and 418 patients were included in the dasatinib and nilotinib cohorts (mean ages = 50.9 and 52.5 years, 46.4% and 45.7% female), respectively. Among the dasatinib patients, 91% started with 100mg/day, 3% with <100mg/day, and 6% with >100mg/day. Among the nilotinib patients, 76% started with 600mg/day, 16% with >600mg/day, and 8% <600mg/day. The dasatinib cohort had a higher hazard of dose decrease (hazard ratio [HR]=1.66; p=.002) and of switching to another TKI (HR =1.62; p=.019) compared to the nilotinib cohort. The hazard of dose increase (HR =0.76; p=.423) and treatment discontinuation (HR =1.10; p=.372) were not significantly different between cohorts. There was also no significant difference in TKI adherence levels (mean proportion of days covered [PDC] difference over first 6 months = -0.0003, p=.981; mean PDC difference over first 12 months = -0.0022, p=.880) and HRU (inpatient day incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.03, p=.930; emergency room IRR =1.26, p=.197; and days with outpatient services IRR = 1.01, p=.842). The dasatinib cohort incurred higher healthcare costs by $749 per patient per month (p=.044) compared to the nilotinib cohort. Limitation: Information on CML phase and Sokal score was not available.

When the two competing enterprises are engaged in manufacturing activities, consumers are more inclined to choose products of the multinational company, and with the increasing dependence on production factors, the preference becomes stronger.

The majority of TTR measures rely on the travel time percentile function as a basic element for performance evaluation. There are two main approaches for deriving the travel time percentile function: simple unimodal probability distribution models and mixture/nonparametric models. Despite the tractability of the former approach, they cannot sufficiently capture the travel time distributions (TTDs) due to their heterogeneity, and also often encounters many issues such as the failure of significance tests and the indecisiveness among multiple fitted distributions. On the other hand, the latter approach possesses greater flexibility for capturing diverse TTDs, but it does not have a simple and closed-form travel time percentile function. Motivated by the above drawbacks, this paper proposes a closed-form and flexible approach for estimating the travel time percentile function of diverse TTDs based on the Cornish-Fisher expansion without the need to assume/fit a certain distribution type. To ensure a high-quality estimation, we introduce and integrate two improvements with theoretically proven foundation into the Cornish-Fisher expansion while guaranteeing a closed-form expression of the travel time percentile function. Specifically, the first improvement, logarithm transformation, increases the probability of satisfying the validity domain of the Cornish-Fisher expansion; while the second improvement, rearrangement, guarantees a monotone travel time percentile function when travel time datasets cannot satisfy the validity domain after the logarithm transformation. Realistic travel time datasets are used to examine the accuracy and robustness of the pro-posed method. Compared to five widely-used probability distributions, the proposed method is sufficiently adaptable to estimating percentile function of diverse TTDs with lower estimation error. More importantly, it has a closed-form expression of the travel time percentile function, which would facilitate characterizing TTR in large-scale network applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

(1994) to formulate the day-to-day evolution of departure time choice under bounded rationality in the bottleneck model. It is shown that the stationary points of the doubly dynamical systems exist and are equivalent to the boundedly rational user equilibrium (BRUE) points. We propose a dynamic pricing policy implemented in the day-to-day evolution process. Despite that the stationary points correspond to a set of BRUE points and the day-to-day departure rate without pricing may not converge to the set of BRUE points, the pricing policy can drive the day-to-day departure rate to reach a new equilibrium state, which is system-optimal (SO). The convergence to the SO state is theoretically proved. Finally, by numerical examples, we demonstrate the properties of the doubly dynamical systems and the effectiveness of the pricing policy.

In real world, both the MFD and demand however suffer from various intrinsic uncertainties while travel demand is of time-varying nature. Hence, robust control for traffic networks with uncertain MFDs and demand is much appealing and of greater interest in practice. In literature, there would be a lack of robust control strategies for the problem. One major hurdle is of requirement on model linearization that is actually a basis of most existing results. The main objective of this paper is to explore a new robust perimeter control framework for dynamic traffic networks with parameter uncertainty (on the MFD) and exogenous disturbance induced by travel demand. The disturbance in question is in general time-varying and stochastic. Our main contribution focuses on developing a control-Lyapunov function (CLF) based approach to establishing a couple of universal control laws, one is almost smooth and the other is Bang-bang like, for different implementation scenarios. Moreover, it is indicated that the almost smooth control is more suited for road pricing while the Bang-bang like control for signal timing. In sharp contrast to existing methods, in which adjusting extensive design parameters are usually needed, the proposed methods can determine the control in an automatic manner. Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate that the control can drive the system dynamics towards a desired equilibrium under various scenarios with uncertain MFDs and travel demand. Both stability and robustness can be substantially observed. As a major consequence, the proposed methods achieve not only global asymptotic stability but also appealing robustness for the closed-loop traffic system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, our study integrated/contributed the following technical approaches. First, the car-following behavior of human-drive vehicles is modeled by well accepted Newell car-following models. Accordingly, an online curve matching algorithm is integrated to anticipate the aggregated response delay of the human-drive vehicles using real-time trajectory data. Built upon that, constrained One- or P-step MPC models are developed to control the movement of the CAV platoon upstream or downstream of the HDV platoon so that we can ensure both transient traffic smoothness and asymptotic stability of this sample mixed flow platoon, leveraging the communication and computation technologies equipped on CAVs. Considering the lack of the centralized computation facilities and severe changes of the platoon topology, this study develops a distributed algorithm to solve the MPCs according to the properties of the optimizers, such as solution uniqueness, sequentially feasibility, and nonempty interior point of the solution space. The convergence of the distributed algorithm as well as the stability of the MPC control is proved by both the theoretical analysis and the experimental study. Extensive numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the distributed algorithm can solve the One-step and P-step MPCs efficiently. The cooperative MPC can dampen traffic oscillation propagation and stabilize the traffic flow more efficiently for the entire mixed flow platoon. Moreover, the cooperative platoon control scheme outperforms the other three control strategies, including the non-cooperative control strategy and a latest CACC strategy in literature.

A novel aspect of this framework is its integration of the continuous-time double queue traffic flow model in a signal controlled traffic network to capture queue spillbacks in continuous-time. Furthermore, drivers' long term responses to changes in traffic signal control settings are captured by their route choices following Wardrop's first principle, which results in the dynamic user equilibrium state. Two signal control strategies, the fixed-timing control and the adaptive signal control, are considered. A continuous approximation method for the signal control is applied to eliminate integer variables and enhance the computational efficiency. A heuristic genetic algorithm based solution procedure is proposed to solve the proposed nonlinear programming problem with time-varying delay terms. Numerical tests are conducted in two testing networks and the results show that adaptive control with drivers taking into account signal timing on their route travel times performs best, and in some cases nearly as well as the benchmark performance derived from system optimal control without equilibrium constraints. The results also show that the advantage of adaptive over fixed-time signal control is more pronounced under UE than SO routing behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a hybrid modeling framework for 1-PDP, where a continuum approximation (CA) approach is used to model internal pickup and delivery routing within each of multiple subregions, while matching of net surplus or deficit of the commodity out of these subregions is addressed in a discrete model with a reduced problem size. The interdependent local routing and system-level matching decisions are made simultaneously, and a Lagrangian relaxation based algorithm is developed to solve the hybrid model. A series of numerical experiments are conducted to show that the hybrid model is able to produce a good solution for large-scale instances in a short computation time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: NVAF patients initiating apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin were selected from the OptumInsight Research Database from January 1, 2013-September 30, 2015. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed between apixaban and each oral anticoagulant. Cox models were used to estimate the risk of stroke/SE and major bleeding. Generalized linear and 2-part models were used to compare healthcare costs. Results: Of the 47,634 eligible patients, 8,328 warfarin-apixaban pairs, 3,557 dabigatran-apixaban pairs, and 8,440 rivaroxaban-apixaban pairs were matched. Compared to apixaban, warfarin patients were associated with a significantly higher risk of all-cause (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21-1.40) as well as stroke/SE-related (HR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.23-2.07) and major bleeding-related (HR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.60-2.39) hospitalization; rivaroxaban patients were associated with a higher risk of all-cause (HR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.07-1.24) and major bleeding-related hospitalization (HR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.39-2.10); and dabigatran patients were associated with a higher risk of major bleeding hospitalization (HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.02-2.10). Warfarin patients had significantly higher major bleeding-related and total all-cause healthcare costs compared to apixaban patients. Rivaroxaban patients had significantly higher major bleeding-related costs compared to apixaban patients. No significant results were found for the remaining comparisons. Limitations: No causal relationships can be concluded, and unobserved confounders may exist in this retrospective database analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a significantly higher risk of hospitalization (all-cause, stroke/SE, and major bleeding) associated with warfarin, a significantly higher risk of major bleeding hospitalization associated with dabigatran or rivaroxaban, and a significantly higher risk of all-cause hospitalization associated with rivaroxaban compared to apixaban.

The need for frequent injections with existing rFVIII products may, however, result in poor adherence to prophylaxis, leading to increased bleeding and long-term joint damage. Recombinant FVIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) is an extended half-life fusion protein which can offer prolonged protection and reduced dosing frequency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc in severe hemophilia A from the perspective of the Swedish health system.Methods: A Markov model was built to estimate lifetime costs and benefits of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc vs rFVIII products. Clinical outcomes were represented by annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and quality of life via disutility applied to bleeding events and injection frequency. Costs included the cost of FVIII for routine prophylaxis and bleed resolution. The pooled comparator was costed by weighting the cost of individual products by their market share.Results: In the base case, rFVIIIFc was dominant vs the pooled comparator. Savings of SEK 9.0 million per patient resulted from lower factor consumption for prophylaxis and bleed resolution. Fewer bleeds and reduced injection frequency yielded an estimated 0.59 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were sensitive to drug dosage and robust to variation in other parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a greater than 85% probability of rFVIIIFc being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 500,000 SEK/QALY.Limitations: Due to unavailibilty of patient-level data, treatment benefit was based on a non-adjusted indirect comparison. Dosing and treatment outcomes were assumed to persist over the model duration in the absence of long-term outcome data.Conclusion: The results suggest that rFVIIIFc may be a cost-effective option for hemophilia A prophylaxis, generating greater quality of life and reduced costs for the Swedish payer compared to more frequently administered rFVIII alternatives.","[Henry, Nathaniel; Joyanovic, Jelena; Schlueter, Max] IQVIA, 210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England; [Kritikou, Persefoni; Wilson, Koo; Myren, Karl-Johan] Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, Stockholm, Sweden",IQVIA; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum,"Henry, N (通讯作者)，IQVIA, 210 Pentonville Rd, London N1 9JY, England.",nathaniel.henry@iqvia.com,,,,,,,38,26,27,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study aimed to compare the short-term medical costs between patients with SC outpatient visits (SCOVs) and those without SCOVs, consisting of SCOV itself and overall medical costs. Materials and methods: This study is a retrospective, observational study using a Japanese employee-based health insurance claims database (January 1, 2005-December 31, 2013). It analyzed individuals who were registered as smokers based on their medical checkup details. It compared the per-patient-per-year (PPPY) medical costs for male smokers who made >= 1 claim for SCOVs with those who made no claims. We also assessed whether the number of SCOVs by male and female smokers impacted medical costs. The Index Year was the year after the first SCOV claim and that after the first registration as a smoker (non-SCOV group). Medical costs were calculated using regression analysis and adjusted for baseline costs. Results: In Index Year -1, PPPY medical costs for male smokers were similar to USD 323.01 (JPY 36,500, as of November 2017) higher in the SCOV (n = 5,608) vs the non-SCOV (n = 81,721) group; however, by Year 6 the costs were similar. From Year 4-6, PPPY medical costs for SCOVs were lower than those in the adjusted non-SCOV group. For 2,576 male and female smokers in the SCOV group, the average rates of increasing medical costs before and after the SCOV for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 SCOVs made were 58%, 44%, 50%, 41%, and 34%, respectively. Limitations: The database includes limited data on individuals >65 years. Only SCOVs based on claims data and not on other outcomes were assessed. Conclusions: Medical costs declined in the short-term following the first SCOV. Attendance at a greater number of SCOVs was associated with a lower increase ratio of medical costs.","[Suwa, Kiyomi; Yoshikawa, Reiko] Pfizer Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan; [Iwasaki, Kosuke] Milliman Inc, Tokyo, Japan; [Igarashi, Ataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Tokyo, Japan",Pfizer; University of Tokyo,"Suwa, K (通讯作者)，22-7 Yoyogi,Shibuya Ku, Tokyo 1518589, Japan.",kiyomi.suwa@pfizer.com,,"igarashi, ataru/0000-0001-6307-6916",Pfizer,Pfizer(Pfizer),This study was funded by Pfizer.,,29,3,3,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this study, we present a framework for addressing the limited-stop service design problem over a corridor, and formally introduce a family of subproblems involved in its solution. Using a bi-level optimization approach, we introduce a method of designing these services while considering bus capacity, transfers, and two behavioral models for passengers: deterministic and stochastic. The algorithm and its variants were tested on nine scenarios with up to 80 stops. Working with deterministic passenger assignment, our model solved the problem in a small fraction of the time required by a benchmark algorithm. We use this algorithm to show that neglecting transfers can lead to suboptimal solutions. We finally show that although it makes the problem much harder, working with stochastic assignment leads to more realistic and robust solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These models have two parts: a link model, which describes traffic flow behavior on individual roads, and a node model, which describes behavior at road junctions. As the road networks under study become larger and more complex nowadays often including arterial networks the node model becomes more important. Despite their great importance to macroscopic models, however, only recently have node models had similar levels of attention as link models in the literature. This paper focuses on the first order node model and has two main contributions. First, we formalize the multi-commodity flow distribution at a junction as an optimization problem with all the necessary constraints. Most interesting here is the formalization of input flow priorities. Then, we discuss a very common conservation of turning fractions or first-in first-out (FIFO) constraint, and how it often produces unrealistic spillback. This spillback occurs when, at a diverge, a queue develops for a movement that only a few lanes service, but FIFO requires that all lanes experience spillback from this queue. As we show, avoiding this unrealistic spillback while retaining FIFO in the node model requires complicated network topologies. Our second contribution is a partial FIFO mechanism that avoids this unrealistic spillback, and a (first-order) node model and solution algorithm that incorporates this mechanism. The partial FIFO mechanism is parameterized through intervals that describe how individual movements influence each other, can be intuitively described from physical lane geometry and turning movement rules, and allows tuning to describe a link as having anything between full FIFO and no FIFO. Excepting the FIFO constraint, the present node model also fits within the well-established general class of first-order node models for multi-commodity flows. Several illustrative examples are presented.

The computation of solutions associated with the presence of moving bottlenecks is complex, since they both influence and are influenced by surrounding traffic. In this study, we propose a fast numerical scheme that can efficiently compute the solutions to an arbitrary number of moving (and fixed) bottlenecks, for a stretch of road modeled by the Lighthil-lWhitham-Richards (LWR) model. Several different moving bottlenecks can be simulated endogenously all together by means of an algorithm based on a semi-analytic Lax-Hopf formula. Since the numerical scheme is semi-analytic and requires a very low number of operations, it can be employed for traffic estimation problems where fast and accurate solutions are required.

In particular, it considers that the city network can be partitioned into two regions (center and periphery). There are park-and-ride facilities located at the boundary between the city center region and the periphery. Travelers can either drive to the city center, or take public transit, or drive to the park-and-ride facilities and then transfer to the public transit. Travelers can learn from their travel experience, as well as real-time information about traffic conditions, thus will adjust their choices accordingly. It follows that the dynamic traffic pattern (within day) in the city network will evolve over (calendar) time (day-to-day). To improve traffic efficiency in the network, an adaptive mechanism, which does not need detailed travelers' behavioral characteristics, is developed to update parking pricing (or congestion pricing) from period to period (e.g., one period can be one month). The developed doubly dynamics methodological framework coupled with a feedback pricing mechanism unfolds and influences equilibrium system characteristics that traditional static day-to-day models cannot observe. The proposed adaptive pricing approach is practical for implementation in large-scale networks as the variables involved can be observed in real life with monitoring techniques. Also, it can contribute to reduce total social cost effectively, as shown in the numerical experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there appears to be a lack of systematic and critical overview on what specific problems and research methodologies these studies proposed and used for quantitatively analyzing the BOT highway projects. Therefore, this study critically reviews the relevant traffic oriented quantitative studies, which mainly focus on the determination of fundamental design factors for a BOT highway project in the planning stage.

However, widespread EV use can impose significant stress on electricity-distribution systems due to their added charging loads. This paper proposes a centralized EV charging-control model, which schedules the charging of EVs that have flexibility. This flexibility stems from EVs that are parked at the charging station for a longer duration of time than is needed to fully recharge the battery. The model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem. The model captures the use of distributed energy resources and uncertainties around EV arrival times and charging demands upon arrival, non-EV loads on the distribution system, energy prices, and availability of energy from the distributed energy resources. We use a Monte Carlo based sample-average approximation technique and an L-shaped method to solve the resulting optimization problem efficiently. We also apply a sequential sampling technique to dynamically determine the optimal size of the randomly sampled scenario tree to give a solution with a desired quality at minimal computational cost. We demonstrate the use of our model on a Central-Ohio-based case study. We show the benefits of the model in reducing charging costs, negative impacts on the distribution system, and unserved EV-charging demand compared to simpler heuristics. We also conduct sensitivity analyses, to show how the model performs and the resulting costs and load profiles when the design of the station or EV-usage parameters are changed.

The signals in the network have a common cycle time and a fixed timing plan. It is assumed that the exogenous demands are constant or periodic with the same period as the cycle time and the intersections are under-saturated. The resulting queuing processes are periodic. These periodic processes are approximated by sinusoids. The sinusoidal approximation leads to an analytical expression of the queue lengths at every intersection as a function of the demands and the vector of offsets. The optimum offset vector is the solution of a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which is solved via its convex semidefinite relaxation. Unlike existing techniques, our approach accommodates networks with arbitrary topology and scales well with network size. We illustrate the result in two case studies. The first is an academic example previously proposed in the literature, and the second case study consists of an arterial corridor network in Arcadia, California. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Larger ships combined with increased container throughput require more yard space and generate more traffic, straining the urban fabric in the vicinity of the port. A promising solution to this problem is the development of urban intermodal container terminals (IMTs) that interface with both road and rail (or possibly inland waterway) networks. This raises two linked choices; where to locate the intermodal terminals and what will be their likely usage by multiple shippers, each having a choice of whether or not to use the IMT as part of an intermodal transport chain. The use of an IMT by a shipper indicates the shipper's choice of intermodal transport, which comprises a combined use of a high capacity mode (rail or barge between the port and the IMT) and trucks (between the IMT and the cargo origin or destination). The overall problem therefore comprises a mode choice problem embedded within a facility location problem. This paper employs the method of entropy maximisation to combine a logit mode choice model with a facility location model, leading to a non-linear mixed integer programming model. The principal features of the entropy maximising facility location model are illustrated by small and large numerical examples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide once weekly vs liraglutide 1.8mg once daily for the treatment of T2DM in Spain in patients with a BMI >= 30kg/m(2). Methods: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to estimate costs and outcomes from the perspective of Spanish National Health System, capturing relevant direct medical costs over a lifetime time horizon. Comparative safety and efficacy data were derived from direct comparison of dulaglutide 1.5mg vs liraglutide 1.8mg from the AWARD-6 trial in patients with a body mass index (BMI) >= 30kg/m(2). All patients were assumed to remain on treatment for 2 years before switching treatment to basal insulin at a daily dose of 40IU. One-way sensitivity analyses (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore the sensitivity of the model to plausible variations in key parameters and uncertainty of model inputs. Results: Under base case assumptions, dulaglutide 1.5mg was less costly and more effective vs liraglutide 1.8mg (total lifetime costs (sic)108,489 vs (sic)109,653; total QALYS 10.281 vs 10.259). OWSA demonstrated that dulaglutide 1.5mg remained dominant given plausible variations in key input parameters. Results of the PSA were consistent with base case results. Limitations: Primary limitations of the analysis are common to other cost-effectiveness analyses of chronic diseases like T2DM and include the extrapolation of short-term clinical data to the lifetime time horizon and uncertainty around optimum treatment durations. Conclusion: The model found that dulaglutide 1.5mg was more effective and less costly than liraglutide 1.8mg for the treatment of T2DM in Spain. Findings were robust to plausible variations in inputs. Based on these results, dulaglutide may result in cost savings to the Spanish National Health System.","[Dilla, Tatiana] Eli Lilly SA, Madrid, Spain; [Alexiou, Dimitra; Chatzitheofilou, Ismini; Ayyub, Ruba; Lowin, Julia] IMS Hlth, London, England; [Norrbacka, Kirsi] Eli Lilly Finland, Laajalahdentie 23, Helsinki 00330, Finland",Lilly SA; Eli Lilly; Eli Lilly,"Norrbacka, K (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly Finland, Laajalahdentie 23, Helsinki 00330, Finland.",norrbacka_kirsi@lilly.com,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),The project was conducted by IMS Health and was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.,,47,15,14,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

While mixed-traffic for autonomous and conventional vehicles could be considered, separation amplifies the benefits of automation. Combined with mobility as a service, separation also opens new possibilities in terms of demand management. We consider in this paper a single bottleneck dynamic framework, in which the capacity of a freeway is dedicated either to conventional or to autonomous vehicles. Users of conventional vehicles freely choose their departure time from home and compete for the best departure times from the bottleneck. Users of autonomous vehicles need to book their trip in advance. As the number of time slots available for booking does not exceed the capacity, booking users are guaranteed no delay at the bottleneck. An individual-specific cooperation cost is introduced in the modeling framework. We then investigate how a central planner should allocate the capacity to these two vehicle types depending on the regime (laissez-faire, welfare- or profit-maximizing). Two major findings are that the equilibrium demand split Pareto-dominates the case with only conventional cars and that the social cost difference between equilibrium and socially optimal demand splits is small compared to their benefits. Although the Pareto-improvement result may not hold for every single user in the case of richer heterogeneity, it remains a key advantage of our booking scheme. Profit-maximizing strategies however turn out to be hardly compatible with welfare maximization.

This is often done in a two-step process where first a feasible timetable is found for a given line structure, and consecutively the stability of this timetable is evaluated and local modifications are performed to the timetable. This paper describes an optimization method to find a feasible periodic timetable that also ensures maximum stability for heterogeneous railway networks. The model is capable to handle flexible train orders, running and dwell times, and overtaking locations. We use the minimum cycle time of the periodic timetable as an indicator for stability, and define an optimization problem with this minimum cycle time as the objective function to be minimized. We also present dimension reduction methods and an iterative optimization approach to improve the mathematical optimization process.

Transcatheter mitral repair with the MitraClip device is a safe and effective therapy for selected patients denied surgery. The authors sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes and economic impact of this therapy compared to medical management in heart-failure patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation. Methods and results: The study was comprised of two phases; an observational study of patients with heart failure and mitral regurgitation treated with either medical therapy or the MitraClip, and an economic model. Results of the observational study were used to estimate parameters for the decision model, which estimated costs, and benefits in a hypothetical cohort of patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation treated with either standard medical therapy or MitraClip. The cohort of patients treated with the MitraClip was propensity matched to a population of heart failure patients, and their outcomes compared. At a mean follow-up of 22 months, all-cause mortality was 21% in the MitraClip cohort and 42% in the medical management cohort (p=.007). The decision model demonstrated that MitraClip increased life expectancy from 1.87-3.60 years and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) from 1.13-2.76 years. The incremental cost was $52,500 Canadian dollars, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $32,300.00 per QALY gained. Results were sensitive to the survival benefit. Conclusion: In heart failure patients with symptomatic moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, therapy with the MitraClip is associated with superior survival and is cost-effective compared to medical therapy.","[Asgar, Anita W.; Khairy, Paul; Ducharme, Anique; Bonan, Raoul; Basmadjian, Arsene; Tardif, Jean-Claude] Montreal Heart Inst, Dept Cardiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Guertin, Marie-Claude; Cournoyer, Daniel] Montreal Heart Inst, Coordinating Ctr, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Cohen, David J.] St Lukes Mid Amer Heart Inst, Dept Cardiol, Kansas City, MO USA",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute,"Asgar, AW (通讯作者)，5000 Rue Belanger, Montreal, PQ H1T 1C8, Canada.",anita.asgar@umontreal.ca,"Cohen, David/AAF-1648-2019; Ducharme, Anique/AAC-5946-2020","Ducharme, Anique/0000-0003-1681-9187",Montreal Heart Institute Foundation,Montreal Heart Institute Foundation,This work was supported by a grant from the Montreal Heart Institute Foundation.,,20,18,19,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This report sought to assess healthcare costs up to 12-months following an index VTE in patients prescribed either rivar-oxaban or warfarin. Materials and methods: This study analyzed claims from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database from November 2011-July 2015. It selected adults newly-diagnosed with VTE (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolism [PE]) if they had an outpatient prescription claim for rivar-oxaban or warfarin within 7-days of the index event. Warfarin users were 2: 1 propensity-score matched to rivaroxaban users and followed until the end of insurance coverage, end of data availability or 12-months of follow-up. Total per patient healthcare costs, including inpatient, outpatient, and overall pharmacy costs, were compared using a multivariable generalized linear model. Results: In total, 10,929 rivaroxaban patients were matched to 21,858 warfarin patients. Mean follow-up for rivaroxaban and warfarin patients was 317- and 321-days for those experiencing an index DVT, and 313- and 318-days for those with PE. Mean overall treatment costs per patient were lower for rivaroxaban vs warfarin users (-$ 1,116, p = .0016). This cost difference was driven by lower inpatient (-$ 622) and outpatient (-$ 1,156) treatment costs, and the higher pharmacy costs ($661) were, therefore, fully offset. Results were similar when analysis was restricted to DVT patients. No significant difference in total costs was observed in patients experiencing an index PE. Limitations: Claims databases are subject to inaccuracies and missing data. Prescription claims may not fully reflect actual medication utilization. Despite propensity-score matching and regression, residual confounding cannot be excluded. Conclusions: Rivaroxaban was associated with significantly lower total per patient VTE treatment costs, despite higher pharmacy costs. These savings are the result of decreased inpatient and outpatient healthcare utilization costs associated with rivaroxaban.","[Coleman, Craig I.] Univ Connecticut, Sch Pharm, 69 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Baugh, Christopher] Brigham & Womens Hosp, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Baugh, Christopher] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA USA; [Crivera, Concetta; Milentijevic, Dejan; Nelson, Winnie W.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA; [Wang, Sheng-Wei; Lu, Lang] Janssen Res & Dev LLC, Raritan, NJ USA",University of Connecticut; Harvard University; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Janssen Biotech Inc,"Coleman, CI (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Sch Pharm, 69 North Eagleville Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",craig.coleman@hhchealth.org,"Nelson, Winnie/JJE-4288-2023; Baugh, Christopher William/AAJ-3688-2021","Baugh, Christopher William/0000-0002-2360-1891; Coleman, Craig/0000-0003-4868-7158","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLLC, Raritan, NJ","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLLC, Raritan, NJ","This study was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLLC, Raritan, NJ.",,15,14,14,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health records from men aged 40 years diagnosed with favorable risk PCa (T1 or 2, PSA 15ng/mL, Gleason 7 [3+4]) between January 2005 and October 2013. Prostate-specific healthcare costs were compared between the OBS and IMT cohorts in men with 3 years of follow-up and available linked claims data. Sub-group analyses focused on those men with low-risk PCa (T1-2a, PSA 10ng/mL, Gleason 6). Sensitivity analysis stratified the study sample in three cohorts: OBS, switched from OBS to definitive treatment (OBS switch), and IMT. Results: A total of 352 patients were included (OBS=70 and IMT=282). Compared with IMT, OBS resulted in significantly lower cumulative PCa-related healthcare costs for the first 3 years ($15,785 vs $23,177; p-value <.001). The main cost drivers were outpatient procedures. The OBS cohort had the lowest incremental PCa-related healthcare costs in the first 3 years (OBS: $5,011 vs OBS switch: $26,040, net cost savings=$21,029, p<.001; OBS: $5,011 vs IMT: $24,064, net cost savings=$19,053, p<.001). Conclusions: In favorable risk PCa, half of the patients who initially chose OBS eventually underwent treatment after their PCa diagnosis.

Advanced PD (aPD) has a significant impact on quality-of-life (QoL) for patients and their caregivers/families. Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is indicated for the treatment of advanced levodopa-responsive PD with severe motor fluctuations and hyper-/dyskinesia when available combinations of therapy have not given satisfactory results.Aims: To determine the cost-effectiveness of LCIG vs standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of aPD patients.Methods: A Markov model was used to evaluate LCIG vs SoC in a hypothetical cohort of 100 aPD patients with severe motor fluctuations from an Irish healthcare perspective. Model health states were defined by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scalecombined with amount of time in OFF-timeand death. SoC comprised of standard oral therapysubcutaneous apomorphine infusion and standard follow-up visits. Clinical efficacy, utilities, and transition probabilities were derived from published studies. Resource use was estimated from individual patient-level data from Adelphi 2012 UK dataset, using Irish costs, where possible. Time horizon was 20 years. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4%. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for LCIG vs SOC was Euro26,944/quality adjusted life year (QALY) (total costs and QALYs for LCIG vs SoC: Euro537,687 vs Euro514,037 and 4.37 vs 3.49, respectively).

Patients with sarcoidosis have a reduced quality-of-life and are at an increased risk for several comorbidities. Little is known about the direct and indirect cost of sarcoidosis following the initial diagnosis. Aims: To provide an estimate of the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs borne by commercial payers for sarcoidosis patients in the US. Methods: Patients with a first diagnosis of sarcoidosis between January 1, 1998 and March 31, 2015 (index date) were selected from a de-identified privately-insured administrative claims database. Sarcoidosis patients were required to have continuous health plan enrollment 12 months prior to and following their index dates. Propensity-score (1:1) matching of sarcoidosis patients with non-sarcoidosis controls was carried out based on a logistic regression of baseline characteristics. Burden of HCRU and work loss (disability days and medically-related absenteeism) were compared between the matched groups over the 12-month period following the index date (outcome period). Results: A total of 7,119 sarcoidosis patients who met the selection criteria were matched with a control. Overall, commercial payers incurred $19,714 in mean total annual healthcare costs per sarcoidosis patient. The principle cost drivers were outpatient visits ($9,050 2015 USD, 46%) and inpatient admissions ($6,398, 32%). Relative to controls, sarcoidosis patients had $5,190 (36%) higher total healthcare costs ($19,714 vs $14,524; p<0.001). Sarcoidosis patients also had significantly more work loss days (15.9 vs 11.3; p<0.001) and work loss costs ($3,288 vs $2,527; p<0.001) than matched controls. Sarcoidosis imposes an estimated total direct medical cost of $1.3-$8.7 billion to commercial payers, and an indirect cost of $0.2-$1.5 billion to commercial payers in work loss. Conclusions: Sarcoidosis imposes a significant economic burden to payers in the first year following diagnosis.","[Rice, J.

Use of ASA co-therapy with proton pump inhibitors in patients at risk may be suboptimal. PA32540 (Yosprala (TM)) is a coordinated-delivery tablet combining EC-ASA 325mg and immediate-release omeprazole 40 mg. The objective of this flexible budget impact model was to project the financial consequences of introducing PA32540 325 mg/40 mg to prevent recurrent CV events, while reducing ASA-associated GI events in US adults. Methods: A Markov Model was employed to estimate health state transitions associated with ASA 75-325 mg, ASA 75-325 mg + generic delayed-release omeprazole 40 mg, PA32540, or clopidogrel 75 mg to prevent recurrent CV events. Health states included ulcers, GI bleeding, CV events, and death. Model inputs included demographics, treatment dosages, treatment costs, adverse GI and CV events, and premature death. Data from peer-reviewed literature and censuses enabled appropriate allocation of CV and GI disease prevalence and mortality. The PA32540 non-adherence rate was conservatively set at 20%. PA32540 market share was set to 50%. Results: The model projected annual savings of $81.0 million to $190.9 million within 1-5 years after PA32540 introduction to the plan, which included 134,558 members at risk for recurrent CV events. These values translate into savings of $602 (year 5) to $1,419 (year 1) per patient per year, and $81 (year 5) to $191 (year 1) per member per year. These values were robust to variations in parameters under a deterministic sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: PA32540 use to prevent recurrent CV events was associated with cost reductions in each year examined with the model. From a health plan perspective, PA32540 is likely to have a net overall effect, resulting in significant cost savings.","[Zhang, Wenjie; Han, Yi] WG Consulting, 200 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10010 USA; [Fort, John G.; Schofield, David; Tursi, James P.] Aralez Pharmaceut R&D Inc, Princeton, NJ USA",,"Zhang, WJ (通讯作者)，WG Consulting, 200 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10010 USA.",wenjie.zhang@wg-group.com,,"Zhang, Wenjie/0000-0001-8301-2821",Aralez Pharmaceuticals RD Inc.,Aralez Pharmaceuticals RD Inc.,Funded by Aralez Pharmaceuticals R&D Inc.,,50,2,2,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Adapted from the shooting heuristic proposed by Zhou et al. (2017) and Ma et al. (2017), this model confines each vehicle's trajectory as a piecewise quadratic function with no more than five pieces and lets all trajectories in the same platoon share identical acceleration and deceleration rates. Similar to the shooting heuristic, the proposed simplified model is able to control the overall smoothness of a platoon of connected automated vehicles and approximately optimize traffic performance in terms of fuel efficiency and driving comfort. While the shooting heuristic relies on numerical meta-heuristic algorithms that cannot ensure solution optimality, we discover a set of elegant theoretical properties for the general objective function and the associated constraints in the proposed simplified model, and consequentially propose an efficient analytical algorithm for solving this problem to the exact optimum. Interestingly, this exact algorithm has intuitive physical interpretations, i.e., stretching the transitional parts of the trajectories (i.e., parts with acceleration and deceleration adjustments) as far as they reach the upstream end of the investigated segment, and then balancing the acceleration and deceleration magnitudes as close as possible. This analytical exact model can be considered as a core module to a range of general trajectory optimization problems at various infrastructure settings. Numerical examples reveal that this exact algorithm has much more efficient computational performance and the same or better solution quality compared with the previously proposed shooting heuristic. These examples also illustrate how to apply this model to CAV control problems on signalized segments and at non-stop intersections. Further, we study a homogeneous special case of this model and analytically formulate the relationship between queue propagation and trajectory smoothing. One counter-intuitive finding is that trajectory smoothing may not always cause longer queue propagation but instead may mitigate queue propagation with appropriate settings. This theoretical finding has valuable implications to joint optimization of queuing management and traffic smoothing in complex transportation networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

While models and algorithms for these problems have been extensively studied in literature, little attention has been devoted to investigating whether/how different locations, kinds (pricing controllers, traffic lights, . . .) and amounts of controllers in a network affect the overall performance of network-wide schemes. In this work, we adapt the control-theoretical approach of controllability of complex networks to the specific instance of transportation networks, considering both propagation/spillback dynamics and users' behavior in terms of route choice. Thanks to the newly developed methodology, we then provide exact solutions to the Full Controllability Pricing Controller Location Problem for transportation networks. Comparing different pricing controller location policies through two artificial test cases, we empirically demonstrate how indeed the amount and kind of controllers in a network strongly affect the level of performance reachable by network-wide control policies, specifically in terms of Total Cost minimization.

Such models provide a description of not only transient change and 'steady' behaviour, but also represent additional variability that occurs through prob-abilistic descriptions. They are therefore highly suited to modelling both the disturbance and subsequent 'drift' of networks that are subject to some systematic change, be that a road closure or capacity reduction, new policy measure or general change in demand patterns. In this paper we derive analytic results to probabilistically capture the nature of the transient effects following such a systematic change. This can be thought of as understanding what happens as a system moves from varying about one equilibrium state to varying about a new equilibrium state. The results capture analytically the changes over time in descriptors of the system, in terms of link flow means, variances and covariances. Formally, the analytic results hold asymptotically as approximations, as we imagine demand increasing in tandem with capacities; however, our interest is in general cases where such tandem increases do not occur, and so we provide conditions under which our approximations are likely to work well. Numerical results of applying the methods are reported on several examples. The quality of the approximations is assessed through comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations from the true underlying process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite having the vital role of food security in the growth, emerging economies are facing a number of challenges in their food logistics system. One of the most attention-seeking challenges is the management of security and safety of food commodities in food logistics. The prime concern is to monitor food quality throughout its supply chain and track the physical movement till it reaches end-consumers. This requires implementation of an effective and efficient traceability system. The successful implementation of traceability system requires consideration of multiple stakeholders' perspectives. On the basis of critical success factor (CSF) theory and multiple stakeholders' view on ensuring the security of quality food, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for implementation of traceability-based food logistics system. It attempts to identify and classify various CSFs necessary for the implementation of traceability system using a questionnaire-based survey followed by exploratory factor analysis. Further, an analysis of inter-relationships among the statistically significant CSFs is performed using total interpretive structural modeling, which considers multiple stakeholders' views. The study helps in developing a comprehensive understanding of directional inter-relationships among CSFs and provides significant insights related to ways to improve consumer satisfaction through safe and quality food in food logistics.","[Shankar, Ravi; Pathak, Devendra Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Vishwakarma Bhawan, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi 110016, India; [Gupta, Rachita] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Bharti Sch Telecommun Technol & Management, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Bharti Sch Telecommun Technol & Management, New Delhi 110016, India.",ravil@dms.iitd.ac.in; rachitagupta1987@gmail.com; pathakdev15@gmail.com,"Gupta, Rachita/AAE-5406-2022; Pathak, Devendra Kumar/HMO-5483-2023; Pathak, Devendra Kumar/AAT-9014-2020; Shankar, Ravi/HSF-1169-2023","Gupta, Rachita/0000-0001-7987-1164; Pathak, Devendra Kumar/0000-0001-8639-6592; SHANKAR, RAVI/0000-0001-8724-593X",,,,,55,89,94,3,65,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,1878-5794,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

In practice, appropriate EV rebalancing operations can satisfy user reservations with limited resources and effectively save system investments. This paper proposes an integrated framework that can determine the optimal allocation plan of EVs and staff on the strategic level while considering the operational EV relocation and staff relocation decisions, in order to minimize the total cost, including the EV and staff investment, EV rebalancing and staff relocation costs. In this framework, the dispatching routes of EVs and staff are represented by two sets of space-time paths in the planning time horizon by using a space-time network representation, and the considered problem is then formulated into a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP). This model explicitly considers (1) the satisfaction of time-dependent user reservations through dynamically rebalancing EVs and relocating staff to keep the service quality of carsharing system, and (2) the EV battery capacity with limited traveling distance and the charging process of EVs at parking stations. A Lagrangian relaxation-based solution approach is developed to decompose the primal problem into several sets of computationally efficient subproblems. In order to generate good-quality solutions, we also propose a three-phase implementing algorithm based on dynamic programming according to the values of Lagrangian multipliers. An illustrative numerical example and a real-world case study (based on the operation data of Seattle, WA) are conducted to verify the applicability of the formulated model and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In particular, we show that the reported computational efficiency of the MM algorithm is actually lost for large choice sets. Because the logit link that represents the parameter space in LML is intrinsically treated as a large choice set, the MM algorithm for LML actually becomes unfeasible to use in practice. We thus propose a faster MM algorithm that revisits a simple step-size correction. In a Monte Carlo study, we compare the maximum simulated likelihood estimator (MSLE) with the algorithms that we derive to estimate LML and MON-MNL models. Whereas in LML estimation alternative algorithms are computationally uncompetitive with MSLE, the faster MM algorithm appears emulous in MON-MNL estimation. Both algorithms - faster-MM and MSLE - could recover parameters as well as standard errors at a similar precision in both models. We further show that parallel computation could reduce estimation time of faster-MM by 45% to 80%. Even though faster-MM could not surpass MSLE with analytical gradient (because MSLE also leveraged similar computational gains), parallel faster-MM is a competitive replacement to MSLE for MON-MNL that obviates computation of complex analytical gradients, which is a very attractive feature to integrate it into a flexible estimation software. We also compare different algorithms in an empirical application to estimate consumer's willingness to adopt electric motorcycles in Solo, Indonesia. The results of the empirical application are consistent with those of the Monte Carlo study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the starting time of the drivers shift is not fixed a priori and the breaks can be allocated anywhere in the schedule as long as labor regulations are satisfied.

Under these separation conditions there will always be at least one clear section of track between the two trains. When these conditions are violated the following train must adopt a revised strategy that will enable it to stop at the next signal if required. In this paper we find necessary conditions on non-level track to minimize the total tractive energy required for both trains to complete their respective journeys within the allowed time subject to safety-compatible separation constraints in the form of a prescribed set of latest allowed section exit times for the leading train and a corresponding prescribed set of earliest allowed section entry times for the following train. We use classical methods of constrained optimzation to show that the optimal driving strategy for each train is defined by a unique optimal driving speed on each section and that the sequence of optimal driving speeds is a decreasing sequence for the leading train and an increasing sequence for the following train.

The operations of individual Metroplex airports are highly interdependent, rendering their efficient management rather difficult. This paper proposes a framework for the design of dynamic arrival and departure routes in MAS Terminal Maneuvering Areas, which fundamentally changes the operation in MAS airspaces for much improved efficiency when compared to the current situation. The framework consists of three components. The first presents a new procedure for characterizing dynamic arrival and departure routes based on the spatio-temporal distributions of flights. The second component is a novel Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model for the prioritization of the dynamic routes, which takes into account a set of quantitative and qualitative attributes important for MAS operations. The third component is a priority based method for the positioning of terminal waypoints as well as the design of three-dimensional, conflict-free terminal routes. Such a method accounts for the AHP-derived priorities while satisfying the minimal separation and aircraft maneuverability constraints. The developed framework is applied to a case study of the New York Metroplex, using aircraft trajectories during a heavy traffic period on typical day of operation in the New York Terminal Control Area in November 2011. The proposed framework is quantitatively assessed using the AirTOp fast-time simulation model. The results suggest significant improvements of the new design over the existing one, as measured by several key performance indicators such as travel distance, travel time, fuel burn, and controller workload. The operational feasibility of the framework is further validated qualitatively by subject matter experts from the Port Authority of New York and New jersey, the operator of the New York Metroplex.

The early papers on the model circumvented this complication by making approximating assumptions, but without solution of the proper model it is unclear how accurate the results are. More recent work has either considered special cases that can be solved analytically using familiar methods, or has turned to generic computational solution. This paper develops a customized method for computational solution of equilibrium in the basic bathtub model with smooth preferences that exploits the mathematical structure of the problem. An inner loop solves numerically for the entry rate, conditional on the equilibrium utility level, by verifying a trip distance condition. An outer loop uses the computed start time from the inner loop to solve for the population that commutes over the rush hour, then lowers the equilibrium utility level to repeat the inner loop for a new level of utility. One result in that, even though tastes and the congestion technology are smooth, the entry rate and exit rate functions exhibit discontinuities at breakpoints. Another result is that, depending on the form of tastes and the congestion technology, the user cost curve as a function of population and may be backward bending.

It constitutes the fourth phase of the classical Railway Planning Process, after Network design, Line Planning and Services Scheduling/Timetabling. Rolling stock circulation consists of defining individual train paths over the network accomplishing pre-defined services. Those services are previously designed in order to attend certain passengers' demand, and fulfilling some design criteria. In this paper we propose, in the context of Railway Rapid Transit Systems, a general mixed integer programming model in order to design rolling stock circulation plans and simultaneously considering the problem of determining the number and location of rest facilities. The model yields then rolling stocks plans that facilitate the posterior design of rotating maintenance schemes. According to the problem structure, we propose a sequential solving approach. We first determine the minimum number of vehicles needed to perform the complete weekly train schedule. In a second phase, we obtain the set of daily routes that must be performed at each line every day. In a third stage, we deal with the problem of determining weekly circulations and depot locations by means of a Genetic Algorithm. The objective at this stage is to minimize empty movements and to equilibrate the number of kilometers covered by each unit. In order to illustrate the proposed approach, this is applied to design a rotating rolling stock plan for the RRT Network of Seville.","[Canca, David] Univ Seville, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, Seville, Spain; [Barrena, Eva] Univ Granada, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Granada, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Granada,"Canca, D (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Ind Engn & Management Sci, Seville, Spain.",dco@us.es; ebarrena@ugr.es,"Canca, David/K-5037-2014; Barrena, Eva/AAZ-6766-2021","Canca, David/0000-0002-8769-234X; Barrena, Eva/0000-0002-8936-725X",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain)/FEDER [MTM2015-67706-P],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain)/FEDER(Spanish Government),This research work was partially supported Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Spain)/FEDER under grant MTM2015-67706-P.,,47,34,35,3,56,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,1878-5794,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

Existing studies related to FFC mainly focus on the analysis of operational management and user preferences. Efforts to model the dynamic choices of free-floating shared cars (SCs) in individuals' daily multi-modal multi-activity trip chains have still been rare. This study proposes a tolerance-based dynamic user equilibrium model of activity-travel scheduling that formulates free-floating SC as an alternative transport mode for conducting daily activities. The model embeds the choice of SC into daily trip chains by extending the state-of-the-art multi-state supernetwork representation. The dynamic traffic flows and supply-demand interactions of SCs are captured endogenously. Moreover, traveler heterogeneity and different pricing schemes are taken into account. A path-flow swapping method is suggested to solve the tolerance-based dynamic user equilibrium model. Numerical examples of various scenarios demonstrate that fleet size, distribution, and rental-parking price of FFC significantly influence the choice of SC and activity travel pattern.

Their performances are still confronted with disruptions unavoidably, which impact on the reliability of the traffic and passenger satisfaction. This paper presents a rescheduling model which is able to solve the critical problem of effective disruption management (namely, fast and dynamic train speed adaptation, supervision of braking and changing train sequence due to incidents, warnings or alarms), and consider in detail the signalling and safety systems based on a quasi-moving block system with variable headways. We integrate the modelling of efficient traffic management measures and the supervision of speed, braking and headway in one general job-shop model. We use a commercial solver with a custom-designed two-step method to speed up the procedure in order to solve instances from real-world high-speed networks in China quickly. Overall, the approach guarantees the resolution of the traffic control and speed management within few minutes of computation time. The output demonstrates that the proposed approach can achieve a reduction of train delays by 70% compared to the solution determined by keeping the order of the original timetable, and get the optimality for more than 90% of instances with a realistic case.

Here a discrete event simulation (DES) model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of natalizumab and fingolimod in the RES population, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, is reported. Methods: A DES model was developed to track individual RES patients, based on Expanded Disability Status Scale scores. Individual patient characteristics were taken from the RES sub-groups of the pivotal trials for fingolimod. Utility data were in line with previous models. Published costs were inflated to NHS cost year 2015. Owing to the confidential patient access scheme (PAS) discount applied to fingolimod in the UK, a range of discount levels were applied to the fingolimod list price, to capture the likelihood of natalizumab being cost-effective in a real-world setting. Results: At the lower National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) threshold of 20,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), fingolimod only required a discount greater than 0.8% of list price to be cost-effective. At the upper threshold of 30,000 pound/QALY employed by the NICE, fingolimod was cost-effective if the confidential discount is greater than 2.5%. Sensitivity analyses conducted using fingolimod list-price showed the model to be most sensitive to changes in the cost of each drug, particularly fingolimod. Conclusions: The DES model shows that only a modest discount to the UK fingolimod list-price is required to make fingolimod a more cost-effective option than natalizumab in RES RRMS.","[Montgomery, Stephen M.; Maruszczak, Maciej J.; Slater, David; Kusel, Jeanette] Costello Med Consulting Ltd, Cambridge, England; [Nicholas, Richard] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hosp, London, England; [Adlard, Nicholas] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Camberley, Surrey, England",Costello Medical Consulting; Imperial College London; Novartis,"Adlard, N (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, 200 Frimley Business Pk, Frimley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England.",nicholas.adlard@novartis.com,"Slater, David A/K-5908-2013; Montgomery, Stephen/B-5683-2011","Adlard, Nicholas/0000-0001-6912-1685; Montgomery, Stephen/0000-0002-8481-5850","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK.",,51,14,16,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A 3-state Markov model was developed to determine costs and outcomes between the CCO and non-CCO groups over a 2-year time horizon. Outcome data were derived from a retrospective clinical study and included the proportion of pressure ulcers that were closed (epithelialized) over 2 years and the time to wound closure. Transition probabilities for the Markov states were estimated from the clinical study. In the Markov model, the clinical outcome is presented as ulcer-free weeks, which represents the time the wound is in the epithelialized state. Costs for each 4-week cycle were based on frequencies of clinic visits, debridement, and CCO application rates from the clinical study. The final model outputs were cumulative costs (in US dollars), clinical outcome (ulcer-free weeks), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at 2 years. Results: Compared with the non-CCO group, the CCO group incurred lower costs ($11,151 vs $17,596) and greater benefits (33.9 vs 16.8 ulcer-free weeks), resulting in an economically dominant ICER of -$375 per ulcer. Thus, for each additional ulcer-free week that can be gained, there is a concurrent cost savings of $375 if CCO treatment is selected. Over a 2-year period, an additional 17.2 ulcer-free weeks can be gained with concurrent cost savings of $6,445 for each patient. Conclusions: In this Markov model based on real-world data from the US Wound Registry, the addition of CCO to selective debridement in the treatment of pressure ulcers was economically dominant over selective debridement alone, resulting in greater benefit to the patient at lower cost.","[Carter, Marissa J.] Strateg Solut Inc, 1143 Salsbury Ave, Cody, WY 82414 USA; [Gilligan, Adrienne M.] Truven Hlth Analyt, Rosenberg, TX USA; [Gilligan, Adrienne M.; Waycaster, Curtis R.] Univ North Texas, Hlth Sci Ctr, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Ft Worth, TX USA; [Waycaster, Curtis R.; Schaum, Kathleen] Smith & Nephew Inc, Ft Worth, TX USA; [Fife, Caroline E.] Intellicure Inc, The Woodlands, TX USA",University of North Texas System; University of North Texas Denton; Smith & Nephew,"Carter, MJ (通讯作者)，Strateg Solut Inc, 1143 Salsbury Ave, Cody, WY 82414 USA.",mcarter@stragetic-solutions-inc.com,,,"Smith & Nephew, Inc., Fort Worth, TX","Smith & Nephew, Inc., Fort Worth, TX","This study was funded by Smith & Nephew, Inc., Fort Worth, TX.",,27,6,6,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The purpose of this research was to describe and implement methods for estimating the cost of hospitalizations, prescriptions, and general practitioner and specialist visits used to manage hyperlipidemia patients experiencing cardiovascular (CV) events in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics data. Costs were incorporated based on reference costs from the National Health Service, and labor costs from the Personal Social Services Research Unit. The study population included patients seen by general practitioners in the UK from 2006-2012. Patients 18 years were selected at the time of their first CV-related hospitalization defined as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack, unstable angina, or revascularization. To be included, patients must have received 2 lipid-lowering therapies. Outcome measures included healthcare utilization and direct medical costs for hospitalizations, medications, general practitioner visits, and specialist visits during the 6-month acute period, starting with the CV hospitalization, and during the subsequent 30-month long-term period. Results: There were 24,093 patients with a CV hospitalization included in the cohort. This study identified and costed 69,240 hospitalizations, 673,069 GP visits, 32,942 specialist visits, and 2,572,792 prescriptions, representing 855 unique drug and dose combinations. The mean acute period and mean annualized long-term period costs (2014) were 4,060 pound and 1,433 pound for hospitalizations, 377 pound and 518 pound for GP visits, 59 pound and 103 pound for specialist visits, and 98 pound and 209 pound for medications. Conclusions: Hospital costs represent the largest portion of acute and long-term costs in this population. Detailed costing using utilization data is feasible and representative of UK clinical practice, but is labor intensive. The availability of a standardized coding system in the UK drug costing data would greatly facilitate drug costing.","[Danese, Mark D.; Gleeson, Michelle; Griffiths, Robert I.] Outcomes Insights Inc, Westlake Village, CA USA; [Griffiths, Robert I.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Catterick, David] Amgen Ltd, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Kutikova, Lucie] Amgen Europe GmbH, Zug, Switzerland",University of Oxford; Amgen; Amgen Limited; Amgen; AMGEN Europe,"Danese, MD (通讯作者)，Townsgate Rd,Suite 330, Westlake Village, CA 91361 USA.",mark@outins.com2801,,"Danese, Mark/0000-0002-7068-9603",Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),This study was funded by Amgen Inc.,,37,8,7,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study quantifies and compares adverse event (AE) crude rates and costs associated with ITP treatments as found in claims data.Materials and methods: A retrospective claims-based analysis was conducted using IMS Pharmetrics Plus database. Included patients were 18 years old, with a diagnosis of ITP (2007-2012); an ITP-related claim for anti-D, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab, romiplostim, or eltrombopag; and 1-year continuous enrollment (3-years for rituximab) during follow-up. AEs and event costs were identified during active treatment, defined from the first claim of each drug to a pre-defined treatment gap or end of study period. Descriptive statistics were reported with Wilcoxon rank-sum significance tests.Results: A total of 2,518 patients were identified (mean age=50.8 (16.3 years); 55.8% male). Of all patients, 22.8% experienced any AE. Significantly fewer anti-D patients had any AE (13.8% vs IVIG: 21.1%, rituximab: 29.4%, romiplostim: 28.1%, eltrombopag: 22.4%). Nausea/vomiting and arthralgia/musculoskeletal pain were most common across treatments, and hemolytic events did not differ significantly across treatments. Most costly AEs were urinary tract infection, aseptic meningitis, and fever ($5000+/case); headache, nasal congestion, and hemolytic event were $4,000-5,000/case. Cost per AE did not differ by treatment.Limitations and conclusions: Although lower than trial-based AE rates, claims for ITP treatment-related AEs are common, with higher numbers for rituximab and lower numbers for anti-D. This disparity suggests a possible differential cost burden overall that future analysis should explore.","[Donga, Prina Z.] IMS Hlth, Plymouth Meeting, PA USA; [Bilir, Sara P.; Munakata, Julie] IMS Hlth, 425 Market St,7th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Little, Gregg; Babinchak, Tim] Emergent BioSolut, Gaithersburg, MD USA",,"Bilir, SP (通讯作者)，IMS Hlth, 425 Market St,7th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",pbilir@us.imshealth.com,,,Emergent BioSolutions,Emergent BioSolutions,Funding for this study was provided by Emergent BioSolutions.,,30,8,8,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We model the problem as an area partitioning problem in which a rectangular service area has to be divided into sectors, each served by a single vehicle. The length of the routes, which depends on the dimension of the sectors and on customer density in the area, is calculated using a continuous approximation. The aim is to partition the area and to determine the type of vehicles to use in order to minimize the sum of ownership or leasing, transportation and labor costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear problem and as a dynamic program. We develop efficient algorithms to obtain an optimal solution and present some structural properties regarding the optimal partition of the service area and the set of vehicle types to use.

The network arcs experience recurrent congestion, leading to stochastic and time-dependent travel times. Based on vehicle location, time of day, and current and projected network congestion states, we generate dynamic routing policies (DRP) for every pair of sites using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). By simulating DRP we find travel time distributions for each pair of sites which is used to build the robust tour using another SDP formulation. Results are very promising when the algorithms are tested in a simulated network using historical traffic data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, according to the idea of TOPSIS method, a kind of comprehensive grey interval incidence coefficient of three-parameter interval grey number is defined, and the regret-rejoice value is calculated out based on the grey interval relational coefficients, so the grey relational comprehensive perceptional utility of decision attribute value is obtained by adding the perceptive utility value of comprehensive grey interval incidence coefficient. Then, differing from the traditional grey-incidence clustering method, in this paper, grey clustering analysis is proceeded on the basis of the calculated matrix of comprehensive perceptional utility, so the comprehensive clustering results are achieved, and the ranking of the alternatives which are included in one class can be achieved too. Finally, the rationality and validity of the proposed method are verified by comparison analysis with an example.","[Li, Ye; Niu, Yufei; Wang, Wenliang; Li, Bingjun] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Management Sci, Zhengzhou 450011, Henan, Peoples R China",Henan Agricultural University,"Li, Y (通讯作者)，Henan Agr Univ, Coll Informat & Management Sci, Zhengzhou 450011, Henan, Peoples R China.",,"Niu, Yufei/JPA-4499-2023; Niu, Yufei/AAU-8962-2021",,Henan Soft science project [122400450013]; Henan Education Department research project of Humanity culture and Society science [2017 ZZJH 233],Henan Soft science project; Henan Education Department research project of Humanity culture and Society science,"Henan Soft science project (122400450013), Henan Education Department research project of Humanity culture and Society science (2017 ZZJH 233).",,26,7,7,2,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5090-6668-1,,,,2017,,,,,,,211,218,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Economics; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BJ7HW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427285800049,0

Methods: Medical records were reviewed for a stratified random sample of GT1 CHC patients first attending two liver clinics between 2011-2013 (principal population; PP), supplemented by all GT1 CHC patients attending one transplant clinic in the same period (transplant population; TP). CHC-related MRU and associated costs are reported for the PP by treatment status (treated/not treated) stratified by baseline fibrosis grade; and for the TP for the pre-transplant, year of transplant and post-transplant periods. Results: A total 1636 patients were screened and 590 patients (36.1%) were included. Comprehensive MRU data were collected for 276 PP patients (F0-1 n=59, F2 n=58, F3 n=53, F4 n=106; mean follow-up=17.3 months). Thirty-eight (13.8%) were treatment-experienced prior to enrolment; 55 (19.9%) received triple therapy during the study. Data were collected for 112 TP patients (mean follow-up=29.9 months), 33 (29.5%) received a transplant during the study, and 51 (45.5%) beforehand. The annual direct medical costs, excluding drug costs, were higher among treated PP vs untreated PP (AU$: $1,954 vs $1,202); and year of transplant TP vs pre-/post-transplant TP (AU$: pre-transplant $32,407, transplant $155,138, post-transplant $7,358). Limitations: To aid interpretation of results, note that only patients with GT1 CHC who are actively managed are included, and MRU data were collected specifically from liver outpatient clinics. That said, movement of patients between hospitals is rare, and any uncaptured MRU is expected to be minimal. Conclusions: CHC-related MRU increases substantially with disease severity. These real-world MRU data for GT1 CHC will be valuable in assessing the impact of new hepatitis C treatments.","[McElroy, Heather J.] Covance Asia Pte Ltd, 1 Int Business Pk,01-01 Synergy, Singapore 609917, Singapore; [Roberts, Stuart K.] Alfred Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Roberts, Stuart K.] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thompson, Alex J.] St Vincents Hosp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Thompson, Alex J.; Angus, Peter W.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Angus, Peter W.] Austin Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McKenna, Sarah Jane] Covance Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Warren, Emma] HERA Consulting, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Musgrave, Sharon] AbbVie Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; Monash University; NSW Health; St Vincents Hospital Sydney; St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Florey Institute of Neuroscience & Mental Health; Austin Research Institute; AbbVie,,heather.mcelroy@covance.com,,,AbbVie Pty Ltd.,AbbVie Pty Ltd.,This research was sponsored by AbbVie Pty Ltd.,,30,1,1,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Moreover, evidence from different healthcare settings suggests reduced healthcare resource utilization with omalizumab. Based on these findings, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the addition of omalizumab to standard-of-care therapy in patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma in a Brazilian healthcare setting. Methods: A previously published Markov model was adapted using Brazil-specific unit costs to compare the costs and outcomes of the addition of omalizumab to standard-of-care therapy vs standard-of-care therapy alone. Model inputs were largely based on the eXpeRience study. Costs and health outcomes were calculated for lifetime-years and were annually discounted at 5%. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: An additional cost of R$280,400 for 5.20 additional quality-adjusted life-years was estimated with the addition of omalizumab to standard-of-care therapy, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R$53,890. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that discount rates, standard-of-care therapy exacerbation rates, and exacerbation-related mortality rates had the largest impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Limitations: Assumptions of lifetime treatment adherence and rate of future exacerbations, independent of previous events, might affect the findings. The lack of Brazilian patients in the eXpeRience study may affect the findings, although sample size and baseline characteristics suggest that the modeled population closely resembles Brazilian severe allergic asthma patients. Conclusion: Results indicate that omalizumab as an add-on therapy is more cost-effective than standard-of-care therapy alone for Brazilian patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma, based on the World Health Organization's cost-effectiveness threshold of up to 3-times the gross domestic product.","[Suzuki, Cibele; da Silva, Nilceia Lopes] Novartis Biociencias SA, Ave Prof Vicente Rao 90, BR-04636000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Kumar, Praveen; Pathak, Purnima] Novartis Healthcare Private Ltd, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Ong, Siew Hwa] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland",Novartis; Novartis,"Suzuki, C (通讯作者)，Novartis Biociencias SA, Ave Prof Vicente Rao 90, BR-04636000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",cibele.suzuki@novartis.com,,"Kumar, Praveen/0000-0003-4948-968X",Novartis Pharma AG,Novartis Pharma AG,This manuscript was funded by Novartis Pharma AG.,,33,13,14,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: This was a cost-utility analysis based on published data. A state-transition cohort model was constructed with six health states based on best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye. The cycle time was 4 weeks, and the time horizon was 12 years. The model compared IAI 2mg every 8 weeks (2q8) for 2 years after three initial monthly injections, ranibizumab as needed, ranibizumab 0.5mg every 4 weeks (0.5q4), pegaptanib sodium 0.3mg every 6 weeks, verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT), and best supportive care, assumed to include medical management and monitoring, but no active therapy. Costs (expressed as Japanese yen [JPY]) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were estimated for each treatment and discounted at 2.0%. Input data were obtained from clinical studies, the Japanese drug tariff and social insurance reimbursement schedule, and expert opinion. The analysis was conducted from the societal perspective, including medical costs as well as costs of blindness. Results: IAI 2q8 was dominant (i.e. more effective in terms of QALYs and less costly) to all other comparators (ranibizumab as needed, ranibizumab 0.5q4, pegaptanib sodium, PDT, and best supportive care), as shown by the incremental cost-utility ratio (i.e. cost per QALY gained). Limitations: The strengths of the analysis include the wide range of comparators evaluated and the use of Japanese-specific utility data. The limitations include the use of one eye, inclusion of published data up to 2 years only, and assumptions on disease course over 5 years. Conclusions: IAI 2q8 was more effective in terms of QALYs and less costly compared with other treatments for wAMD in Japan.","[Yanagi, Yasuo] Singapore Natl Eye Ctr, 11 Third Hosp Ave, Singapore 168751, Singapore; [Yanagi, Yasuo] Singapore Eye Res Inst, Singapore, Singapore; [Yanagi, Yasuo] Duke NUS Natl Univ Singapore, Grad Sch Med, Singapore, Singapore; [Fukuda, Aya; Adachi, Kenji] Bayer Yakuhin Ltd, Osaka, Japan; [Barzey, Victor] IMS Hlth, London, England",Singapore National Eye Center; Singapore National Eye Center; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Bayer AG,,yasuo.yanagi@snec.com.sg,"Yanagi, Yasuo/AAA-5441-2022; Yanagi, Yasuo/AFN-0692-2022; Yanagi, Yasuo/AAF-2670-2020","Yanagi, Yasuo/0000-0002-0362-7285;","Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Japan","Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Japan","This study was performed by IMS Health, UK, which was funded by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Japan.",,54,8,10,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

As the first CAR T-cell therapy available for adults in the US, there are important questions about clinical and economic value. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of axi-cel compared to salvage chemotherapy using a decision model and a US payer perspective. Materials and methods: A decision model was developed to estimate life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime cost for adult patients with R/R LBCL treated with axi-cel vs salvage chemotherapy (R-DHAP). Patient-level analyses of the ZUMA-1 and SCHOLAR-1 studies were used to inform the model and to estimate the proportion achieving long-term survival. Drug and procedure costs were derived from US average sales prices and Medicare reimbursement schedules. Future healthcare costs in long-term remission was derived from per capita Medicare spending. Utility values were derived from patient-level data from ZUMA-1 and external literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. Outcomes were calculated over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 3% per year. Results: In the base case, LYs, QALYs, and lifetime costs were 9.5, 7.7, and $552,921 for axi-cel vs 2.6, 1.1, and $172,737 for salvage chemotherapy, respectively. The axi-cel cost per QALY gained was $58,146. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the fraction achieving long-term remission, discount rate, and axi-cel price. The likelihood that axi-cel is cost-effective was 95% at a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY. Conclusion: Axi-cel is a potentially cost-effective alternative to salvage chemotherapy for adults with R/R LBCL. Long-term follow-up is necessary to reduce uncertainties about health outcomes.","[Roth, Joshua A.; Sulliyan, Sean D.; Bansal, Aasthaa; Ramsey, Scott D.] Fred Hutchinson Canc Inst, Hutchinson Inst Canc Outcomes Res, 1100 Fairview Ave N,M2-B230, Seattle, WA 98109 USA; [Roth, Joshua A.; Sulliyan, Sean D.; Bansal, Aasthaa; Ramsey, Scott D.] Univ Washington, Sch Pharm, Comparat Hlth Outcomes Policy & Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lin, Vincent W.; Purdum, Anna G.; Nayale, Lynn; Cheng, Paul] Kite, Santa Monica, CA USA",Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Roth, JA (通讯作者)，Fred Hutchinson Canc Inst, Hutchinson Inst Canc Outcomes Res, 1100 Fairview Ave N,M2-B230, Seattle, WA 98109 USA.",jroth@fredhutch.org,,,"Kite, a Gilead Company","Kite, a Gilead Company","This study was funded by Kite, a Gilead Company.",,38,77,80,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Furthermore, temporal analysis of DCNs indicates that the culprits of delay propagation in the air transport system are not a fixed set of airports; instead, they vary daily depending on the operational environment.","[Du, Wen-Bo; Zhang, Ming-Yuan; Cao, Xian-Bin] Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ming-Yuan] Beihang Univ, Shen Yuan Honors Coll, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Zhang, Jun] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Beihang University; Beihang University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Cao, XB (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.;Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",xbcao@buaa.edu.cn; buaazhangjun@vip.sina.com,"du, wen-bo/G-5959-2011","Zhang, Yu/0000-0003-1202-626X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB1200100]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [61425014, 61521091, 91538204, 61671031, 61722102]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFB1200100) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61425014, 61521091, 91538204, 61671031, and 61722102).",,43,97,100,7,39,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

In this paper, we build a simple theoretical model to compare the implications of fuel financial hedge and operational fuel efficiency improvement on airlines' expected profit. We find that financial hedge is more efficient in reducing airlines' profit volatility/risk exposure, while operational improvement will generate a higher expected profit level when its effectiveness is sufficiently high. With market competition, operational improvement will be less prevalent. Furthermore, a fuel/carbon tax makes financial hedge less attractive and operational improvement more attractive.

The objective of population synthesis is to reproduce the underlying statistical properties of real population based on available microsamples and marginal distributions. However, characterizing the joint associations among a large set of attributes is challenging because of the curse of dimensionality, in particular when attributes are organized in a hierarchical household-individual structure. In this paper, we use a hierarchical mixture model to characterize the joint distribution of both household and individual attributes. Based on this model, we propose a framework of generating representative household structures in population synthesis. The framework integrates three models: (1) probabilistic tensor factorization, (2) multilevel latent class model, and (3) rejection sampling. With this framework, one can generalize not only the associations of within- and cross-level attributes, but also reproduce structural relationships among household members (e.g., husband-wife). As a case study, we implement this framework based on the household interview travel survey (HITS) data of Singapore, and then use the inferred model to generate a synthetic population pool. This model demonstrates great potential in reproducing the underlying statistical distribution of real population. The generated synthetic population can serve as a replacement for census in developing agent-based models, with privacy and confidentiality being protected and preserved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Further results and a computational study show how these different models compare in practice.","[Escalona, P.; Stegmaier, R.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Ind Engn, Ave Espana 1680, Valparaiso, Chile; [Marianov, V.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Avda Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago, Chile; [Ordonez, F.] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Republ 701, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Escalona, P (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Ind Engn, Ave Espana 1680, Valparaiso, Chile.",pablo.escalona@usm.cl,"Ordonez, Fernando/JCO-4671-2023; Ordonez, Fernando/I-4889-2013; Marianov, Vladimir/D-1360-2011; Stegmaier, Raul/A-5090-2019","Ordonez, Fernando/0000-0001-7037-6300; Marianov, Vladimir/0000-0002-5343-0106; Stegmaier, Raul/0000-0002-4299-6729; Escalona, Pablo/0000-0002-9967-136X",Complex Engineering Systems Institute [CONICYT-PIA-FB0816],Complex Engineering Systems Institute,"Ordonez and Marianov gratefully acknowledge the support by the Complex Engineering Systems Institute, through grant CONICYT-PIA-FB0816.",,22,7,9,1,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

Depending on whether the demand adaptive service is operated along circular or radial transit lines, two variants of such systems are considered: a Circular Model (or C-Model) and a Radial Model (or R-Model). A continuous approximation approach is employed to develop the optimal design problem, which is formulated as a mixed integer program. A comprehensive numerical experiment is performed to compare various cost components corresponding to the optimal design of the two systems, and a discrete-event simulation is developed to validate the analysis. Numerical and simulation results suggest that the radial route network outperforms the grid route network, which was analyzed previously in the literature, with a significant margin, while the C-Model and R-Model offer similar performance.","[Chen, Peng (Will); Nie, Yu (Marco)] Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Nie, Y (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",y-nie@northwestern.edu,"Nie, Yu/B-7083-2009; Nie, Yu/J-6620-2014","Nie, Yu/0000-0003-2083-470X",National Science Foundation [CMMI-1402911],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This project was funded by National Science Foundation under the award number CMMI-1402911.,,42,27,31,4,27,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

The aim of this study was to investigate treatment patterns in HMB in Japan, and to assess healthcare resource utilization and costs among women newly-diagnosed with the condition. Materials and methods: This study retrospectively analyzed health insurance data available in the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) database on women aged 18-49 years who were newly-diagnosed with primary or secondary HMB. Treatment patterns were analyzed, and healthcare utilization and costs were evaluated and compared to matched controls. Results: The study included a total of 635 patients, 210 with primary HMB and 425 with secondary HMB. In the primary HMB cohort, 60.0% of patients received one or more pharmacological or surgical treatments, compared with 76.2% in the secondary HMB cohort. The most commonly prescribed medications in all patients were hemostatic agents (28.7%), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (12.1%), and low-dose estrogen progestins (LEPs) (10.1%). After adjustment for patient baseline characteristics, healthcare costs were 1.93-times higher in primary HMB cases (p<.0001) and 4.44-times higher in secondary HMB cases (p<.0001) vs healthy controls. Outpatient care was the main cost driver. Limitations: The main limitations of this study are related to its retrospective nature, and the fact that only reimbursed medications were captured in the source database. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of HMB patients did not receive the recommended treatments. Healthcare costs were considerably increased in the presence of an HMB diagnosis.","[Akiyama, Sayako; Tanaka, Erika] Bayer Yakuhin Ltd, Market Access, Chiyoda Ku, 6-5,Marunouchi 1 Chome, Tokyo 1008265, Japan; [Cristeau, Olivier] Creat Ceut, Paris, France; [Onishi, Yoshie] Creat Ceut KK, Tokyo, Japan; [Osuga, Yutaka] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Obstet & Gynecol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan",Bayer AG; University of Tokyo,"Akiyama, S (通讯作者)，Bayer Yakuhin Ltd, Market Access, Chiyoda Ku, 6-5,Marunouchi 1 Chome, Tokyo 1008265, Japan.",sayako.akiyama@bayer.com,,"CRISTEAU, Olivier/0000-0001-7434-4349","Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd.","Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd.","This study was funded by Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd.",,25,3,3,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This survey focuses on important principles and key results from CA models. In particular, we consider how these studies fill the gaps identified by the most recent literature reviews in this field. We observe that CA models are used in a wider range of applications, especially in the areas of facility location and integrated supply chain management. Most studies use CA as an alternative and a complement to discrete solution approaches: however, CA can also be used in combination with discrete approaches.

The present analysis is focused on the cost-effectiveness of SCIT compared to SLIT and symptomatic treatment of grass pollen allergy in Austria, Spain, and Switzerland. It will address specific properties of the underlying healthcare systems.Methods: The investigation is based on a previously published health economic model calculation. This was designed as a Markov model with pre-defined health stages and a duration of 9 years covering specific preparations for SCIT (Allergovit) and SLIT (Oralair). The effectiveness was assessed as symptom-score based quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Additionally, total cost has been determined as well as the cost-effectiveness of SCIT. The robustness of model results was proved in further sensitivity analyses.Results: With regard to the effectiveness of both SCIT and SLIT, preparations were dominant compared to pharmacological symptomatic therapy. Both strategies were associated with additional cost, but, combined with the results on effectiveness, both have to be regarded as cost-effective. A direct comparison of the SCIT (Allergovit) and SLIT (Oralair) showed lower total costs of SCIT vs SLIT for Austria, Spain, and Switzerland (Euro1,368 vs Euro2,012, Euro2,229 vs Euro2,547, and Euro1,901 vs Euro2,220) and superior effectiveness (SCIT =8.02 QALYs; SLIT =7.98 QALYs; and symptomatic therapy =7.90 QALYs).Conclusion: In patients with allergic rhinitis, SIT offers cost-effective treatment options compared to symptomatic treatment. When comparing SCIT (Allergovit) and SLIT (Oralair), SCIT was dominant in terms of QALYs as well as costs, in particular due to a slightly higher patient compliance and lower drug costs.","[Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] SHB, Inst Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Reinhold, Thomas] Charite Univ Med Berlin, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin,"Brüggenjürgen, B (通讯作者)，Steinbeis Hsch Berlin GmbH, Steinbeis Haus,Gurtelstr 29A-30, D-10247 Berlin, Germany.",bernd.brueggenjuergen@stw.de,,"Reinhold, Thomas/0000-0001-5169-7029",,,,,57,16,16,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A short-term decision-analytic model with a 1-year time horizon was developed from a payer's perspective in the United States setting. Costs and benefits associated with four clinical end-points (glycated hemoglobin [A1C], body weight, systolic blood pressure [SBP], and risk of hypoglycemia) were evaluated in the analysis. The impact of DAPA and other glucose-lowering therapy classes on these clinical end-points was estimated from a network meta-analysis (NMA). Data for costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with a per-unit change in these clinical end-points were taken from published literature. Drug prices were taken from an annual wholesale price list. All costs were inflation-adjusted to December 2016 costs using the medical care component of the consumer price index. Total costs (both medical and drug costs), total QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. Sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed to explore uncertainty in the inputs. To assess face validity, results from the short-term model were compared with long-term models published for these drugs. Results: The total annual medical cost for DAPA was less than that for GLP-1RA ($186 less), DPP-4i ($1,142 less), SU ($2,474 less), and TZD ($1,640 less). Treatment with DAPA resulted in an average QALY gain of 0.0107, 0.0587, 0.1137, and 0.0715 per treated patient when compared with GLP-1RA, DPP-4i, SU, and TZD, respectively. ICERs for DAPA vs SU and TZD were $19,005 and $25,835, respectively. DAPA was a cost-saving option when compared with GLP-1RAs and DPP-4is. Among all four clinical end-points, change in weight had the greatest impact on total annual costs and ICERS. Sensitivity analysis showed that results were robust, and results from the short-term model were found to be similar to those of published long-term models. Conclusion: This analysis showed that DAPA was cost-saving compared with GLP-1RA and DPP-4i, and cost-effective compared with SU and TZD in the US setting over 1 year. Furthermore, the results suggest that, among the four composite clinical end-points, change in weight and SBP had an impact on cost-effectiveness results.","[Chakravarty, Abhiroop; Rastogi, Mohini] Complete HEOR Solut, Gurugram, India; [Dhankhar, Praveen] Complete HEOR Solut, N Wales, PA USA; [Bell, Kelly F.] AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE USA",AstraZeneca,"Dhankhar, P (通讯作者)，1120 North Wales Rd,Suite 205, N Wales, PA 19454 USA.",praveen.dhankhar@cheors.com,,,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),This research is funded by AstraZeneca.,,43,21,22,4,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Objective: To compare RA-related treatment, healthcare utilization, and joint erosion between anti-CCP-positive and anti-CCP-negative RA patients. Methods: Newly-diagnosed RA patients were identified from the Henry Ford Health System database between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014; the date of the first RA diagnosis within the study period was the index date. Baseline anti-CCP test was used to categorize patients as anti-CCP-positive or anti-CCP-negative, and outcomes were evaluated in the 6 months post-index. Results: There were 217 anti-CCP-positive and 191 anti-CCP-negative RA patients included in the study. A higher proportion of anti-CCP-positive patients were initiated on RA treatment than anti-CCP-negative patients (70.5% vs 23.0%; p<.0001). More anti-CCP-positive patients received methotrexate (73.2% vs 56.8%; p=.0374), while more anti-CCP-negative patients received hydroxychloroquine (31.8% vs 13.1%; p=.0037) in first-line therapy. A higher proportion of anti-CCP-negative patients were tested for rheumatoid factor (RF) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Of those tested, there were more positive test results in the anti-CCP-positive cohort compared to the anti-CCP-negative cohort (RF: 84.4% vs 18.2%, p<.0001; C-reactive protein [CRP]: 69.7% vs 48.3%, p=.0008; and ESR: 89.5% vs 53.9%, p<.0001). Outpatient utilization predominated, with more anti-CCP-positive patients having any outpatient physician office visit (96.3% vs 77.5%, p<.0001) and a higher mean number of visits (5.3 vs 2.5, p<.0001) than anti-CCP-negative patients. Among anti-CCP-positive (n=113) and anti-CCP-negative (n=58) patients with imaging results, more anti-CCP-positive patients had joint erosion compared to anti-CCP-negative patients (18.6% vs 8.6%; p=.0858); however, statistical significance was not reached. Conclusion: RA patients with positive anti-CCP antibodies had higher degrees of inflammation and disease activity as indicated by laboratory results, which likely contributed to their higher rates of healthcare utilization, joint erosion, and proportions of RA treatment.","[Lamerato, Lois] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Detroit, MI USA; [Price, Kwanza; Szymialis, Rick; Ahmad, Harris] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA; [Eaddy, Michael; Ogbonnaya, Augustina; Shih, Huai-Che] Xcenda LLC, Palm Harbor, FL USA","Henry Ford Health System; Henry Ford Hospital; Bristol-Myers Squibb; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Price, K (通讯作者)，Bristol Myers Squibb Co, 3401 Princeton Pike, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.",kwanza.price@bms.com,,,"Bristol-Myers Squibb; Xcenda, LLC","Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Xcenda, LLC","This study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Materials and methods: A longitudinal retrospective cohort study was conducted using Medicaid claims data from six states. Patients initiated on aripiprazole or paliperidone palmitate were assigned to the OM cohort; risperidone-treated patients were assigned to the TM cohort. HRU and healthcare costs were assessed during the first 12 months following stabilization on the medication. Adherence was measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) during the first year of follow-up. Persistence to the index medication was measured during the first 2 years following the index date. Comparison between the cohorts was achieved using multivariable generalized linear models, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Patients in the OM LAI cohort had lower inpatient HRU and medical costs when compared with patients in the TM cohort. Higher medical costs in the TM LAI cohort offset the higher pharmacy costs in the OM LAI cohort. Mean PDC during the first 12 months of follow-up was higher in the OM cohort than in the TM cohort (0.56 vs 0.50, p<.01). Median persistence was longer in the OM cohort than in the TM cohort (7.5 months vs 5.5 months), as was the hazard of discontinuing the index medication (hazard ratio=0.83, p=.01). Kaplan-Meier rates of persistence at 1 year were higher for OM patients than for TM patients (37.6% vs 29.6%, p<.01). Limitations: This was a Medicaid sample with few aripiprazole LAI patients (5.4% of OM cohort). Medication use was inferred from pharmacy claims. Conclusions: Among Medicaid patients in these six states, OM AP treatment was associated with lower HRU, better adherence and persistence, and similar total costs compared to patients on TM treatment.","[Pilon, Dominic; Xiao, Yongling; Thompson-Leduc, Philippe; Lafeuille, Marie-Helene; Lefebvre, Patrick] Anal Grp Inc, 1000 De La Gauchetiere West,Suite 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada; [Alcusky, Matthew] Univ Massachusetts, Med Sch, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Benson, Carmela] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Titusville, NJ USA",Analysis Group Inc.; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals,"Pilon, D (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 1000 De La Gauchetiere West,Suite 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",dominic.pilon@analysisgroup.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Supported by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.",,42,12,12,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Endovascular treatments for the management of a stroke event have been coupled in the past years with the possibility to mechanically remove the occlusion by means of specially designed thrombectomy devices, and their exclusive use showed levels of effectiveness in line with those of the existing pharmacological treatments. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with the Solitaire Revascularization Device (stent retriever) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs), comparing MT plus intravenous tissue plasminogen activation (MT plus IV t-PA) vs IV t-PA alone, in Italy. Methods: A Markov model was used to simulate costs and benefits of MT plus IV t-PA and IV t-PA alone over a 5-year time horizon and considering the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). Results are reported in terms of Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are carried out in order to test the robustness of the results. Results: Total costs of MT plus IV t-PA and IV t-PA alone are equal to Euro31,798 and Euro34,855, respectively. The MT allows incremental QALYs for 0.77, determining a dominant ICER. The utilities associated to the mRS health states are the parameters with the highest impact on the results. Multiway sensitivity analyses determined a 90% probability of dominance. Conclusions: MT plus IV t-PA for AIS patients with LVO is cost-effective from year 1 through year 3, and cost-saving from year 4 onward in the Italian context, achieving better results, both in terms of efficacy and in terms of resource consumption.","[Ruggeri, Matteo; Basile, Michele; Coretti, Silvia; Cicchetti, Americo] ALTEMS Postgrad Sch Hlth Econ, Rome, Italy; [Zini, Andrea] Modena Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosci, Stroke Unit, Nuovo Osped Civile S Agostino Estense,Neurol Clin, Modena, Italy; [Mangiafico, Salvatore] Careggi Univ Hosp, Neurovasc Intervent Unit, Florence, Italy; [Agostoni, Elio Clemente] Osped Niguarda Ca Granda, Neurosci Dept, Milan, Italy; [Lobotesis, Kyriakos] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, London, England; [Saver, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Neurol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Saver, Jeffrey] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Comprehens Stroke Ctr, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Drago, Carlo] Nicolo Cusano Univ, Rome, Italy",Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia Hospital; University of Florence; Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi; IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico; Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda; Imperial College London; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA,"Basile, M (通讯作者)，Largo Francesco Vito 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy.",michelebasile@icloud.com,"Ruggeri, Mirella/E-6091-2010; Cicchetti, Americo/AAP-9403-2021; Drago, Carlo/Y-3357-2019; Agostoni, Elio Clemente/AAC-2897-2019; Zini, Andrea/K-1136-2014","Drago, Carlo/0000-0002-3920-0267; Agostoni, Elio Clemente/0000-0002-0462-0755; Zini, Andrea/0000-0003-1486-4507; Saver, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9141-2251; Lobotesis, Kyriakos/0000-0001-5093-9751; ruggeri, matteo/0000-0002-5703-7424; Cicchetti, Americo/0000-0002-4633-9195",Medtronic Italia,Medtronic Italia,This study was funded by Medtronic Italia.

The MFD can be also rescaled to approximate network outflow as a function of the vehicular accumulation of the system in the morning commute problem. In this research, we develop a bathtub model (macro-scale traffic congestion model) by combining Vickrey's (1969) model of dynamic congestion with the MFD to formulate the user equilibrium over the peak as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This problem can be solved numerically to estimate the exact solution of the morning commute problem. Alternatively, the morning commute problem can be solved analytically by approximating the solution of the ODE using a well-behaved function. Here, we present a quadratic and also a linear approximation of the equilibrium solution for a semi-quadratic MFD, considering that the declining part of the MFD is shown to be well estimated by a quadratic function. To optimize the system, we present pricing strategies for network users (dynamic tolling) and employers inside the region (dynamic taxing) that can minimize the generalized cost of the system by keeping the outflow maximized over the peak. Finally, we compare the exact and the approximate solutions of the problem, and also the proposed pricing strategies of the region in a numerical example.

However, the firms have private cost information which they are not willing to disclosure. We develop a computable mechanism based on a decentralized local search heuristic combined with simulated annealing, which allows for not only system optimization but also cost allocation. The mechanism is especially applicable to the firms with private cost information, due to its good incentive properties and budget balance in almost all the cases. Computational experiments indicate that the cost savings are significant for both the system and the individual firm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop risk-averse optimization formulations to compute resilient location and customer assignment solutions for two cases (i.e., under either independent or correlated disruptions), where the risks are expressed through a family of risk measures including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and absolute-semideviation (ASD). The risk-averse RUFL with independent facility disruptions is to control the risks at each individual customer and modeled as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which is challenging to be solved. In response, we develop a branch-and-cut algorithm combined with augmented Lagrangian decomposition for globally optimizing the problem. As for the risk averse RUFL with correlated facility disruptions, we propose a scenario-based model to minimize the total fixed costs and risks across the entire customer set. The resulting formulation is a pure MILP and a Lagrangian decomposition scheme is proposed for computational aspects in large-scale cases. Our numerical results show that the risk-averse models outperform the classic risk-neutral models in improving the reliability. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithms perform well. To conclude, we extract managerial insights that suggest important guidelines for controlling risk in the face of disruption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary purpose of this work is to investigate the impact of potential factors on the carriers' operational efficiency. These factors, which are typically under managerial influence, are vehicle diversion capability, the DPDFL decision interval, and how far in advance the carrier knows of the clients' shipment requirements (i.e., advance load information (ALI)). Through comprehensive numerical experiments and statistical analysis, we found that the ALI and decision interval significantly influence the total cost, however, the diversion capability does not. The findings also reveal that the impact of the re-optimization interval depends on the subcontracting cost and the amount of advance load information provided. A major contribution of this work is the development of an efficient benchmark solution for the static version of the DPDFL through the discretization of time windows. We observed that using three-day ALI and an appropriate decision interval can reduce deviation from the benchmark solution to less than 8%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, it considers the situation when a proportion of commuters have to drive their children to school first and then go to work (household travel). For household travel, departure time choice is a joint decision based on all household members' preferences. Unlike the standard bottleneck model, the rush-hour dynamic traffic pattern with mixed travelers (household travelers and individual travelers) varies with the numbers of individual travelers and households, as well as the schedule difference between school and work. Given the numbers of individual travelers and households, we show that by appropriately coordinating the schedules of work and school, the traffic congestion at the highway bottleneck can be relieved, and hence the total travel cost can be reduced. This is because, departure/arrival of individual and household travels can be separated by schedule coordination. System performance under schedule coordination is quantified in terms of the relative proportions of the two classes of travelers and is compared with the extreme case when the same desired arrival time applies to both schooling and working. Furthermore, the efficiency of work and school schedule coordination in reducing travel cost is bounded. This efficiency is also compared with that at the system optimum where queuing is fully eliminated and schedule delay cost is minimized (achieved by a joint scheme of first-best pricing and schedule coordination).

Facing demand uncertainty, an airport first determines the capacity for immediate investment (the prior capacity) and the size of the land or other resources to be reserved for possible future expansion (the reserve). Once demand is observed, the airport can use a portion of the reserve to build extra capacity and set airport charge. Our analytical results show that if demand uncertainty is low and capacity and reserve costs are relatively high, an airport will not acquire a real option for expansion. Otherwise, it can use an expansion option to improve its expected profit or social welfare. Both the magnitude of profit or welfare gain and the optimal size of the reserve increase with demand uncertainty. A higher reserve cost leads to a larger prior capacity and a smaller reserve, whereas a higher capital cost leads to lower prior capacity. A profit-maximizing airport would choose a smaller prior capacity and reserve than would a welfare-maximizing airport. Competition within the airline market promotes airport capacity investment and the adoption of real options by profit-maximizing airports, whereas airport commercial services increase prior capacity but not the reserve.

Our objective is to establish the rolling horizon approach to lane-based control delay for group-based optimization of signal timings in adaptive traffic control systems. The challenges involved in this task include identification of the most appropriate incremental queue accumulations based on group-based variables for individual lanes to the queueing formation patterns and establishment of the rolling horizon procedure for predicting the future components of lane-based incremental queue accumulations in the time windows. For lane-based estimation of incremental queue accumulations, temporal and spatial information were collected on the basis of estimated lane-based queue lengths from our previous research to estimate lane-based incremental queue accumulations. We interpret the given signal plan as group-based variables, including the start and duration of the effective green time and the cycle time. Adjustment factors are defined to identify the characteristics of the control delay in a specific cycle and to clarify the relationship between group-based variables and the temporal information of queue lengths in the proposed estimation method. We construct the rolling horizon procedure based on Kalman filters with appropriate time windows. Lane-based queue lengths at an inflection point and adjustment factors in the previous cycle are used to estimate the adjustment factors, arrival rates, and discharge rates in the next cycle, in which the predictive computation is performed in the current cycle. In the simulations sets and the case study, the proposed model is robust and accurate for estimation of lane-based control delay under a wide range of traffic conditions. Adjustment factors play a significant role in increasing the accuracy of the proposed model and in classifying queueing patterns in a specific cycle. The Kalman filters enhance the accuracy of the predictions by minimizing the error terms caused by the fluctuation in traffic flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

VKA drug costs are relatively low, but they necessitate frequent international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring. There are currently minimal data describing the economic impact of this in Mexico. Materials and methods: Cardiologists provided data on their NVAF patients (n=400) to quantify direct medical costs (INR testing, appointments, drug costs). A sub-set of patients (n=301) completed a patient questionnaire providing data to calculate direct non-medical costs (travel and other expenses for attendance at VKA-associated appointments) and indirect costs (opportunity cost and reduced work productivity associated with VKA treatment). Results: Estimated annual direct medical costs totaled $753.6 per patient. Annual direct non-medical and indirect costs were USD$149.8 and $132.1, respectively.Limitations: Recruited patients were those who consulted with a cardiologist during the study period and selected due to inclusion criteria. All had received uninterrupted treatment for 12-24 months. Consequently, the results are not fully generalizable to all VKA treated NVAF patients. Conclusions: The true cost of VKA treatment cannot be appreciated by a consideration of drug costs alone. Ongoing monitoring appointments incur additional expenses for both patients and the healthcare system.","[Briere, Jean Baptiste; Bowrin, Kevin] Bayer Pharma AG, Mullerstr 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany; [Wood, Robert; Holbrook, Tim; Roberts, Jenna] Adelphi Real World, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England",Bayer AG; Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals; Adelphi Group Ltd,"Briere, JB (通讯作者)，Bayer Pharma AG, Mullerstr 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",jean-baptiste.briere@bayer.com,,"Briere, Jean-baptiste/0000-0002-3925-7677; Wood, Robert/0000-0002-6977-435X",Bayer Pharma AG,Bayer Pharma AG,The study was sponsored by Bayer Pharma AG.,,31,7,7,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Patients were required to have 1 prescription for rivaroxaban or apixaban within 3 months prior to MB hospitalization. AF patients treated with Xa inhibitors, but who did not have any diagnosis of MB during the study period were identified. Hospital resource use and costs were evaluated for index MB hospitalizations. Healthcare resource use and associated costs were also evaluated for up to 12 months and compared between AF patients with and without MB.Results: Of the overall patient population with AF treated with factor Xa inhibitors (n=92,949), 3,081 (3.3%) were identified as patients with MB and 89,868 without MB. The mean hospital length of stay and hospital cost for index MB hospitalizations were 5.3 days and $28,059, respectively. Total all-cause healthcare costs were higher during the 12 months of follow-up for AF patients with MB vs without ($63,866 vs $37,916, p<.001). After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics, mean total healthcare costs were estimated at $58,169 for patients with MB vs $41,241 for patients without MB.Limitations: Since this was an observational study using a claims database analysis, a causal relationship between factor Xa inhibitor treatment and MB events cannot be inferred from the results of this study.Conclusion: In the real-world setting, the cost of initial hospitalizations for MB was substantial, and the incremental burden of total healthcare costs within 1 year following MB hospitalization was high. Approaches to better manage the continuum of care of AF patients with factor Xa inhibitor-associated MB may reduce the healthcare economic burden.","[Deitelzweig, Steven] Ochsner Clin Fdn, Dept Hosp Med, New Orleans, LA USA; [Deitelzweig, Steven] Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Ochsner Clin Sch, New Orleans, LA USA; [Neuman, W.

This paper presents a comprehensive method to estimate the user cost of crowding in terms of the equivalent travel time loss, in a revealed preference route choice framework. Using automated demand and train location data we control for fluctuations in crowding conditions on the entire length of a metro journey, including variations in the density of standing passengers and the probability of finding a seat. The estimated standing penalty is 26.5% of the uncrowded value of in-vehicle travel time. An additional passenger per square metre on average adds 11.9% to the travel time multiplier. These results are in line with earlier revealed preference values, and suggest that stated choice methods may overestimate the user cost of crowding.

Methods: A Markov cohort model with a 20-year horizon was developed to compare ocrelizumab with SC interferon beta-1a from a US payer perspective. A cohort of patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of 0-6, who initiated treatment with ocrelizumab or SC interferon beta-1a, were entered into the model. The model considered 21 health states: EDSS 0-9 in RRMS, EDSS 0-9 in secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), and death. Patients with RRMS could transition across EDSS scores, progress to SPMS, experience relapses, or die. Transition probabilities within RRMS while patients received ocrelizumab or SC interferon beta-1a were based on data from the two SC interferon beta-1a-controlled Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials of ocrelizumab in RMS. Transitions within RRMS when off-treatment, RRMS-to-SPMS transitions, transitions within SPMS, and transitions to death were based on the literature. Utilities of health states, disutilities of relapses, costs of therapies, and medical costs associated with health states, relapse, and adverse events were from the literature and publicly available data sources. The model estimated per-patient total costs, incremental cost per life year (LY) gained, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained. Deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model results. Results: Ocrelizumab was associated with a cost savings of $63,822 and longer LYs (Delta = 0.046) and QALYs (Delta = 0.556) over a 20-year time horizon. The results of the model were robust in the DSA and PSA. Limitations: The model did not consider subsequent treatments and their impact on disease progression. Conclusions: The results suggest that ocrelizumab is more cost-effective than SC interferon beta-1a for the treatment of RMS.","[Yang, Hongbo; Duchesneau, Emilie] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Foster, Rebekah] Anal Grp Inc, New York, NY USA; [Guerin, Annie] Anal Grp Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ma, Esprit; Thomas, Nina P.] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Analysis Group Inc.; Roche Holding; Genentech,"Yang, HB (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",hongbo.yang@analysisgroup.com,"Duchesneau, Emilie/JED-6453-2023","Duchesneau, Emilie/0000-0002-0974-8539","Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","This work was funded by Genentech, Inc.",,42,17,18,1,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of sequential treatment regimens for mRCC and associated adverse events (AEs) from the Chinese payers' perspective. Methods: Key inputs included in the calculation were patient population, dosing information, incidence rates and associated costs of Grade 3/4 AEs, treatment costs (including drug discount programs), and patients' progression-free survival (PFS) as a proxy for length of treatment. To calculate PFS, this study identified pivotal clinical trials and generated a reconstructed individual patient data set from the published Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The median PFS from the pooled estimates were used in the calculation. In the base-case scenario, sunitinib was used as first line and the other three therapies were used as second line. Sensitivity analyses were conducted where (1) sorafenib was used as first line, or (2) a third-line therapy was added to the base-case scenario. Results: In the base case, the cost per patient per treatment month (PPPM) cost was the lowest for sunitinib + axitinib among all sequential regimens ( yen 14,898) and was the highest for sunitinib + sorafenib ( yen 20,103). If sorafenib is used as first line, everolimus had lower per patient per months (PPPM) cost than axitinib ( yen 17,046 vs yen 23,337), but also had shorter PFS (13.5 months vs 15 months). Second sensitivity analysis with an additional third-line therapy showed consistent results with the base-case scenario; axitinib as second line was the least costly. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, for mRCC sequential treatment, sunitinib followed by axitinib generates the highest cost savings from the Chinese payers' perspective. Future studies are warranted to examine the cost-effectiveness of various mRCC treatment regimens in Chinese populations.","[Shi, Guohai; Lu, Xiaolin] Fudan Univ, Dept Urol, Shanghai Canc Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Shi, Guohai; Lu, Xiaolin] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Med Coll, Dept Oncol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Park, Sang Hee; Xue, Mei; Gao, Xin] Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Ren, Hongye] Pfizer Investment Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Dong, Peng] Pfizer Investment Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Pharmerit North America LLC; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Gao, X (通讯作者)，Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway,Suite 1110, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",cgao@pharmerit.com,"Gao, Xin/D-5487-2013; lu, xl/HDO-8340-2022",,"Pfizer, Inc.","Pfizer, Inc.(Pfizer)","This study was funded by Pfizer, Inc.",,51,14,17,5,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Developing efficient models and control methods for large-scale urban road networks is, therefore, an important research challenge. Alleviating congestion via manipulation of traffic flows or assignment of vehicles to specific paths has a great potential in achieving efficient network usage. Motivated by this fact, this paper proposes a hierarchical traffic management system. The upper-level route guidance scheme builds a model predictive control (MPC) scheme and optimizes network performance based on actuation via regional split ratios, whereas the lower-level path assignment mechanism develops an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation and recommends subregional paths for vehicles to follow, satisfying the regional split ratios in order to achieve said performance. Simulation results from a 49-subregion or 7-region network shows a great potential of the proposed scheme in achieving coordination and efficient use of network capacity, leading to increased mobility.

Invariant ratios reduce a control policy's impact on the crossing streets, so a policy can be optimized and evaluated by focusing on the street itself without the confounding factors present in networks. Designed for heavy traffic with spillovers, the proposed policies are adaptive and need little data they only require average traffic density readings and no demand forecasts. A battery of numerical experiments simulating the dynamics of rush hour traffic on a congested, homogeneous circular street reveals that the proposed form of adaptation reduces the duration of the rush and overall congestion compared with pre-timed control strategies. Eighteen different adaptation policies were considered. All inspect the street densities periodically and simultaneously, and retime the signals immediately thereafter. The period is a fixed multiple of the cycle. The street is evenly divided into sections that contain a set number of consecutive blocks and signals. The offset is the same for all blocks in a section. Three inspection intervals and six section sizes were tested. The latter ranged from a single block/signal to the whole street. It was found that adaptation worked best when sections were large and adaptation frequent. The effects were considerable across all scenarios. For a short street with a short rush and high input flows the probabilistic incidence of gridlock was reduced from 10 to 0%, and the average duration of a trip from 216 to 181 s. For a long street with a long rush and high input flows the gridlock probability was reduced from 23 to 0% and the average trip duration from 2037 to 1143s. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing adoption and improved predictive abilities of Traveler Information Systems (TIS) enable commuters to plan their trips; however, there are inherent heterogeneities in information access and TIS accuracies. Our work addresses the open problem posed in Arnott et al. (1991) about the need to consider asymmetrically informed commuters in the bottleneck model of traffic congestion. We consider a Bayesian game with two heterogeneous commuter populations: one population is privately informed of the realized network state while the other only knows the public information about the distribution of states. We characterize the equilibrium of the game, in which each population chooses a departure rate function over time to minimize its expected cost based on its private belief about the state and the behavior of the other population. We provide a full equilibrium characterization for the complete range of values of link reliability, incident probability, and information penetration. The populations' equilibrium strategies can broadly be categorized into two distinct regimes. Specifically, when information penetration is above a certain threshold, the populations' equilibrium strategies are non-unique, and the relative Value of Information (VoI) is 0, i.e. the two populations face the same cost. On the other hand, when information penetration is below the threshold, equilibrium is unique, and Vol is positive and decreasing in information penetration. Importantly, we find that the lowest social cost is always achieved when a non-zero fraction of commuters are uninformed. The more unreliable the link, the higher the information penetration that achieves this minimum. We define the Value of Heterogeneity (VoH) as the difference between the minimum social cost and the cost under complete information penetration, and find that it can be significant under practically relevant conditions.

An iterative global search method is proposed that incorporates the possible reaction of the follower in the leader's problem as new constraints (i.e. cuts) in each iteration. Several numerical experiments are conducted whose results demonstrate ignoring the foresight competition would lead to loss of market share and profitability of the new entrant's supply chain.","[Amiri, A.

This study investigated the association between PPG levels and healthcare resource utilization among adults with diabetes treated with basal-bolus insulin. Methods: A web-based, cross-sectional survey (n = 940) of adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and treated with basal and bolus insulins was conducted in Italy, the UK, and the US. Descriptive analyses included frequencies, cross-tabulations, and comparison of means. Incidence-rate ratios (IRR) were calculated using negative binomial regression analysis to investigate the relationship between elevated PPG and healthcare resource utilization. Models controlled for demographic characteristics, duration of diabetes, and diabetes-related complications. Results: Among respondents who measured PPG regularly and reported their two highest PPG values in the past week (n = 691), the mean average highest PPG value was 11.9 mmol/L (SD = 4.0). On average, holding other variables constant at their means, a 1 mmol/L increase in PPG was associated with an increase in healthcare resource utilization related to diabetes and elevated PPG, including the expected number of healthcare provider (HCP) visits in the past 6 months (IRR [95% CI] = 1.14 [1.08-1.21], p < .001), the expected number of calls/emails to HCPs in the past 6 months (IRR [95% CI] = 1.12 [1.06-1.19], p < .001), and the expected number of overnight hospitalizations in the past year (IRR [95% CI] = 1.14 [1.07-1.23], p < .001). Limitations: The study relied on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias. Given the cross-sectional nature of the study, results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions: Increased PPG levels were significantly associated with increased healthcare resource utilization among adults with diabetes. Additional education regarding PPG monitoring may help improve the day-to-day management of diabetes and reduce healthcare costs.","[Pfeiffer, Kathryn M.; Brod, Meryl] Brod Grp, 219 Julia Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA; [Sandberg, Anna; Nikolajsen, Annie] Novo Nordisk AS, Soborg, Denmark",The Brod Group; Novo Nordisk,"Brod, M (通讯作者)，Brod Grp, 219 Julia Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941 USA.",mbrod@thebrodgroup.net,,"Pfeiffer, Kathryn/0000-0003-2186-6340","Novo Nordisk, A/S","Novo Nordisk, A/S(Novo Nordisk)","This research was funded by Novo Nordisk, A/S.",,28,9,9,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Based on a space-time lattice, we present a set of integer programming and dynamic programming models for scheduling longitudinal trajectories, where the goal is to consider both system-wide safety and throughput requirements under supports of various communication technologies. Newell's simplified linear car following model is used to characterize interactions and collision avoidance between vehicles, and a control variable of time-dependent platoon-level reaction time is introduced in this study to reflect various degrees of vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication connectivity. By adjusting the lead vehicle's speed and platoon-level reaction time at each time step, the proposed optimization models could effectively control the complete set of trajectories in a platoon, along traffic backward propagation waves. This parsimonious multi-vehicle state representation sheds new lights on forming tight and adaptive vehicle platoons at a capacity bottleneck. We examine the principle of optimality conditions and resulting computational complexity under different coupling conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the construction of a weighted directed graph, a multi-path searching model, namely, a 0-1 linear programming model, is built to minimize the total travel time of all period-types of trains subject to many operational constraints, including station parking capacity and train minimum load factors. After decomposing this model by introducing some Lagrangian multipliers to relax its complicated constraints, a solution algorithm, including a multi-path simultaneous searching sub-algorithm for each period-type of train, is designed to optimize both the feasible and dual solutions, which correspond to the upper and lower bounds, respectively. Finally, the performance, convergence, sensitivity, and practicability of our method are analyzed using many instances on both a small rail network and the high-speed railway between Beijing and Shanghai in China.

We formulate time headways as time series and compare several prediction methods by testing on data from a busy bus route in Dublin. Furthermore we review and extend an analytical model of an artificial bus route and discuss stability properties and dynamic holding strategies using both data available at the time and predicted headway data.

A feasible timetable of the trains currently scheduled in the network is given. Additional trains should be scheduled to meet the increasing passenger demand. To achieve this goal, we are allowed to increase the dwelling time of some trains at some stations, to let them stop at some additional stations and even to skip a few stops. Thereby, we need to take explicitly into account the deceleration and acceleration times that are needed by the train when it stops at a station. This problem integrates the choice of the train schedule with the choice of the train stops, the latter being usually made in the Line Planning process. To solve this problem, we propose a heuristic algorithm, extended from a previous method to include the new features of the studied application, and show its performance on real-world instances of the Chinese high-speed JingHu corridor (between Beijing and Shanghai) involving up to 387 trains.

We first prove that the percentile based fundamental diagrams are obtainable based on the proposed model. We further prove the proposed model has continuity, differentiability and convexity properties so that it can be easily solved by Gauss Newton method. By selecting different percentile values from 0 to 1, the speed distributions at any given densities can be derived. The model has been validated based on the GA400 data and the calibrated speed distributions perfectly fit the speed-density data. This proposed methodology has wide applications. First, new approaches can be proposed to evaluate the performance of calibrated fundamental diagrams by taking into account not only the residual but also ability to reflect the stochasticity of samples. Secondly, stochastic fundamental diagrams can be used to develop and evaluate traffic control strategies. In particular, the proposed stochastic fundamental diagram is applicable to model and optimize the connected and automated vehicles at the macroscopic level with an objective to reduce the stochasticity of traffic flow. Last but not the least, this proposed methodology can be applied to generate the stochastic models for most regression models with scattered samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies suggested that if the caused driving range limit makes any impact on travel behaviors, it more likely occurs on the tour or trip chain level than the trip level. To properly assess its impacts on travel choices and traffic congestion, this research is devoted to studying a new network equilibrium problem that implies activity location and travel path choices on the trip chain level subject to stochastic driving ranges. Convex optimization and variational inequality models are respectively constructed for characterizing the equilibrium conditions under both discretely and continuously distributed driving ranges. For deriving the equilibrium flow solutions for these problem cases, we suggested different adaptations of a well-known path-based algorithm the projected gradient method. While the problem instance with a discrete number of driving ranges can be simply treated as a multi-class version of its deterministic counterpart, the one with continuous driving ranges poses a much more complicated situation. To overcome this arising modeling and algorithmic complication, we introduce a couple of newly defined variables, namely, path-indexed travel subdemand rate and traffic subflow rate, by which the demand and flow rates as well as their corresponding feasible path sets can be dynamically indexed in the solution process with reference to path lengths. An illustrative example with various types and forms of driving range distributions demonstrates the applicability of the proposed modeling and solution methods and various impacts of the heterogeneity of range anxiety on network flows and computational costs. The numerical analysis results from this example show that stochastic driving ranges confine network flows in a different way from deterministic or no driving ranges and the projected gradient procedure relying on dynamically indexed subdemand and subflow rates is generally preferable to its counterpart on pre-indexed ones for both the discrete and continuous driving range cases. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model explicitly incorporates the effects of competition between regional ports and between shipping companies, and captures operational considerations such as the inventory costs of in-transit cargo, and the tradeoff between enlarged fleet size and slow steaming. The behaviors of shipping companies and ports are modeled in a two stage game so that market equilibria under alternative regulations can be solved and compared. The findings suggest that a unilateral regulation may actually lead to an increase in total emissions, whereas a uniform regulation always reduces total emissions. Under either type of regulation, there can be asymmetric effects on shipping companies and ports. Therefore, regulators and the maritime industry need to strike a balance between emission reduction and fair competition. Our study cautions against unilateral regulations, and emphasizes the importance to take into account the effects of alternative emission policies on the operations of shipping companies and ports.

In Hong Kong, the total number of patient discharges and deaths for ischemic heart diseases in 2009 was 33,363, including 4,360 deaths. There are over 5,000 cases of PCI yearly. This study aimed to compare clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes among patients receiving drug-eluting stent (DES) or bare metal stent (BMS) in Hong Kong. Methods: Patients who received stent implantation between September 15, 2009 and October 11, 2010 in Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, were recruited and followed for 18 months. Occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, non-fatal MI, TLR and TVR) was employed as the clinical outcome measurements. Improvement in quality-of-life by stent interventions was measured as quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). EQ-5D questionnaire was adopted to assess the QALY gained. Cost-utility analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis for BMS and DES were employed as the economic outcome measurement. Results: Six hundred and eighty-four patients (DES=402; BMS=282) were included. From 0-18 months, TLR rate (2.7% vs 3.5%, p=.549) and TVR rate (3.7% vs 6.4%, p=.111) were lower in the DES group, but without statistical significance. EQ VAS (71.0614.56 vs 71.07 +/- 16.57, p=.998) and utility score (0.81 +/- 0.17 vs 0.78 +/- 0.16, p=.162) were comparable between DES and BMS group. Overall, the cost per QALY gained was HKD + 1,178,100 and ICER was HKD + 187,000 (1USD=7.8 HKD). Conclusions: No significant difference in TVR, TLR rates, EQ VAS, and utility score was found between the DES and BMS group. The higher cost of index procedure for the DES group was found to be partly offset by reduced cost of follow-up, offering cost-effectiveness in ACS patients, predominantly in STEMI patients. DES was recommended for STEMI patients.","[Lee, Vivian W.; Cheng, Franco W.; Choi, Adrian Y.; Fong, Sam T.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Pharm, Fac Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Cheuk Man; Yan, Bryan P.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Med & Therapeut, Fac Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Lee, VW (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Pharm, 8th Floor, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",vivianlee@cuhk.edu.hk,"Yan, Bryan P/P-5928-2015; Lee, Vivian WY/ABE-2416-2021; Cheng, Franco WT/J-4541-2019","Lee, Vivian WY/0000-0001-5802-8899; Cheng, Franco WT/0000-0001-7818-1575","School of Pharmacy, The Chinese University of Hong Kong","School of Pharmacy, The Chinese University of Hong Kong(Chinese University of Hong Kong)","This study was supported by the School of Pharmacy, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.",,33,4,4,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A model using a particle-based, Lagrange representation, is developed, instead of an Eulerian, flow-based one, usual in routing problems of the game-theoretical approach. This choice allows representation of phenomena such as fuel exhaustion, vehicle collision, and wave propagation. The elements necessary to represent interactions in a multi-agent transportation system are defined, including a distributed, priority-based resource allocation protocol, where resources are nodes and links in a spatial network and individual routing strategies are performed. A fuel consumption dynamics is developed in order to account for energy cost and vehicles having limited range. The analysis shows that only the scenarios with cooperative resource allocation can achieve optimal values of either collective cost or equity coefficient, corresponding respectively to the centralized and to the distributed cases.

Materials and methods: An analysis of administrative claims data among patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer from 2007-2015 was conducted. Future costs were projected through 2040 based on these data using autoregressive models. Results: Analysis of claims data found the average total cost of care during first- and second-line therapy was $1,161.70 and $561.80 for patients, and $45,175.70 and $26,201.40 for insurers, respectively. By 2040, the average total patient out-of-pocket costs are projected to reach $3,047.67 for first-line and $2,211.33 for second-line therapy, and insurance will pay an average of $131,262.39 for first-line and $75,062.23 for second-line therapy. Limitations: Claims data are not collected for research purposes; therefore, there may be errors in entry and coding. Additionally, claims data do not contain important clinical factors, such as stage of disease at diagnosis, tumor histology, or data on disease progression, which may have important implications on the cost of care. Conclusions: The trajectory of the cost of lung cancer care is growing. This study estimates that the cost of care may double by 2040, with the greatest proportion of increase in patient out-of-pocket costs. Despite the average cost projections, these results suggest that a small sub-set of patients with very high costs could be at even greater risk in the future.","[Hess, Lisa M.; Cui, Zhanglin Lin; Gaynor, Paula J.; Oton, Ana B.] Eli Lilly & Co, LCC DC 5220, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Wu, Yixun; Fang, Yun] InVentiv Hlth, Indianapolis, IN USA",Eli Lilly,"Hess, LM (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, LCC DC 5220, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",hess_lisa_m@lilly.com,,,Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),"LMH, ZCL, PJG, and ABO are employees of Eli Lilly and Company.

Methods: A targeted literature review and seven one-to-one interviews with physicians and imaging center directors were conducted to identify attributes that could impact physicians' referral decisions. The impact of the identified attributes was assessed via an online discrete choice survey among eligible PCPs and cardiologists randomly selected from a nationally representative panel, and quantified with an odds ratio (OR) scale estimated with a multivariable logistic regression. Results: Nine two-level attributes were identified: ease of the referral process, waiting time for tests, insurance preauthorization assistance, time to receive results, conclusive test reports, patient satisfaction, a protocol for rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test, patient communication, and assistance with parking/wheelchair access. A total of 410 physicians, including 208 (50.7%) cardiologists and 202 (49.3%) PCPs completed the survey. Among all physicians, a protocol that allows for a rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test (OR=2.9) and preauthorization assistance (OR=2.6) were the most impactful attributes. Additionally, cardiologists preferred imaging centers that provide an easy referral process (OR=2.7), while PCPs favored centers offering a conclusive test report (OR=2.4). Limitations: Some center features that might impact physician referral decision were not evaluated in this study, if they were not easily changeable from an imaging center's perspective. Conclusions: The availability of a protocol for rapid conversion from an exercise to a pharmacological stress test and preauthorization assistance had the most significant impact on physician referral decisions for SPECT-MPI. Additionally, cardiologists preferred centers providing an easy referral process, while PCPs favored those offering a concluding statement and actionable steps in test reports.","[Li, Junlong; Yang, Hongbo; Xiang, Cheryl Q.; Wu, Eric Q.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Houle, Christy R.; Spalding, James R.; Kitt, Therese M.; Kristy, Rita M.] Astellas Pharma Global Dev Inc, Northbrook, IL USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Astellas Pharmaceuticals,"Li, JL (通讯作者)，111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02119 USA.",Junlong.Li@analysisgroup.com,,,Astellas Pharma Global Development Inc.,Astellas Pharma Global Development Inc.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals),Funding for this research was provided by Astellas Pharma Global Development Inc.,,24,1,2,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Finally, numerical experiments based on a city's metro in China are performed and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can significantly improve the riding experience and decrease the operating cost.","[Li, Changle; Ma, Jiao; Luan, Tom H.; Zhou, Xun] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Changle; Xiong, Lei] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China",Xidian University; Beijing Jiaotong University,"Li, CL (通讯作者)，Xidian Univ, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",clli@mail.xidian.edu.cn,"Luan, Tom H./HLG-0711-2023; Luan, Tom/ABA-2407-2021","Luan, Tom/0000-0002-5215-7443","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61571350]; Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi [2017KW-004, 2017ZDXM-GY-022, 2018ZDXM-GY-038]; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety [RCS2016K011]; Beijing Jiaotong University; 111 Project [B08038]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi; State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety; Beijing Jiaotong University; 111 Project(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61571350, Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi (Contract No. 2017KW-004, 2017ZDXM-GY-022, 2018ZDXM-GY-038), the State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety (Contract No. RCS2016K011), Beijing Jiaotong University, and the 111 Project (B08038).",,45,11,12,0,30,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

Using Markov decision processes, we obtain optimal order and dynamic shipment decisions for small networks. We compare optimal solutions of different four-node network structures. Results indicate product characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of network structures. Surprisingly, two-echelon networks are occasionally costlier than any other network.

A gravity-type model for origin-destination (OD) demand estimation is first presented and calibrated based on the current cargo volumes of the Indonesian maritime market. A model for maximizing total social welfare is then proposed to design the shipping network with cargo demand levels forecasted for future years. The results show that for the Indonesian maritime market, a hub-and-spoke network with fully connected hub ports is better than a network with sequentially connected hub ports in terms of total social welfare. The optimal choices for the international gateway and domestic hub ports vary as cargo demand increases over time. The results suggest that a progressive policy can be promising for infrastructure investments in developing countries: government planning and regulations may be introduced in early years to enhance infrastructure utilization and economic return. With increased demand the market may be liberalized to promote healthy competition.","[Tu, Ningwen; Li, Zhi-Chun] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Adiputranto, Dimas; Fu, Xiaowen] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; University of Sydney,"Li, ZC (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",smzcli@gmail.com,"li, zhi-chun/F-9865-2011","li, zhi-chun/0000-0002-1451-0904; Fu, Xiaowen/0000-0002-1925-046X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71525003, 71222107]; National Social Science Foundation of China [13 ZD175]; Huazhong University of Science and Technology [5001300001]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017KFKJXX003]; University of Sydney; Sydney Southeast Asia Center, Australia","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Huazhong University of Science and Technology; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); University of Sydney(University of Sydney); Sydney Southeast Asia Center, Australia","We are grateful to three anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier version of the paper.

On each day, commuters adjust their modal choice, based on the previous day's perceived travel cost and intraday toll or subsidy of each mode, to minimize their perceived travel cost. Meanwhile, the transportation authority sets the number of bus runs and the tolls or subsidies of two modes on each day, based on the previous day's modal choice of commuters, to simultaneously reduce the daily total actual travel cost of the transportation system and achieve a Pareto improvement or zero-sum revenue target at a stationary state. The evolution process of the modal choice of commuters, associated with the strategy adjustment process of the authority, is formulated as a dynamical system model. We analyze several properties of the dynamical system with respect to its stationary point and evolutionary trajectory. Moreover, we introduce new concepts of Pareto improvement and zero-sum revenue in a day-to-day dynamic setting and propose the two targets' implementations in either a prior or a posterior form. We show that, although commuters have different perceived travel costs for using the same travel mode, the authority need not know the probability distribution of perceived travel costs of commuters to achieve the Pareto improvement target. Finally, we give a set of numerical examples to show the properties of the model and the implementation of the toll or subsidy schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A nonlinear chance-constrained optimization model is solved to determine delivery quantities, and a tabu search metaheuristic is used to determine vehicle routes. The goal of this research is to assure that a logistics company would satisfy the demands of customers with a high probability, while minimizing the overall transportation cost. We introduce the concept of premium customers, who are guaranteed a higher level of service. We show that our chance constrained method has some strategic advantages over the CVRP with recourse approach. We examine the possibility of the logistics company charging customers selectively with an additional service fee to assure a high level of service. Moreover, we provide managerial insight on when the best time is to pay for the premium membership. We present computational results on commonly studied small to large-scale CVRP instances. A simulation study Is conducted to explore the performance of the proposed chance-constrained approach using the CVRP with recourse. We conclude that our chance-constrained CVRP model could serve a logistics company well when resource costs and service guarantees are of concern.","[Chen, Lijian] Univ Dayton, Dept MIS Operat Management & Decis Sci, Dayton, OH 45469 USA; [Chiang, Wen-Chyuan; Russell, Robert] Univ Tulsa, Finance Operat Management & Int Business, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA; [Chen, Jun; Sun, Dengfeng] Purdue Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Dayton; University of Tulsa; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Chen, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Dayton, Dept MIS Operat Management & Decis Sci, Dayton, OH 45469 USA.",lchenl@udayton.edu; wen-chyuan-chiang@utulsa.edu; rrussell@utulsa.edu; chenl241@purdue.edu; dsun@purdue.edu,"Zhang, Yihao/JGM-3514-2023; Chen, Jun/Y-7882-2018","Chen, Jun/0000-0001-9896-6898; Chiang, Wen-Chyuan/0000-0003-3214-8539; Sun, Dengfeng/0000-0003-2983-2997",,,,,34,13,17,5,30,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

The proposed variational inequality models describe the uncertain demand on trains using the Newsvendor model and impose time deadline constraints on paths considering flow-dependent lead time. The constraints are then reformulated based on the Dirac delta function so that they can be directly dualized.

For reducing the complication of analysis, previous studies adopted the alpha - beta - gamma preference of travel time, arrival early and late penalties. This handling method destroys the continuity of user equilibrium (UE) inflow rate as pointed out by Li and Huang (2017). In this paper, we investigate the single-entry traffic corridor with continuous scheduling preference (CSP) and develop a customized method to find the computational solution of UE flow pattern. Analytical and numerical results show that the introduction of CSP lets inflow rate of early arrivals first increase then decrease. This extends the knowledge given by classical bottleneck model and flow congestion model with alpha - beta - gamma preference. Another finding is that, even though the introduction of CSP can smooth inflow rate at departure time of the punctual commuter and make the UE flow pattern more stable, a series of shock waves still exist.

Climate change affects the agroecological and growing conditions of crops and livestock. Conversely, agriculture engenders climate change via its role in greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration. In the rain-fed agricultural systems of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the effects of climate change on precipitation and temperature are the major causes of crop failure and low yields, although these problems are often attributed to small farm sizes and the low uses of fertilizers, improved seeds, and pesticides. However, empirical evidence for the economic impacts of climate change on smallholder farmers in SSA is lacking. In this study, I use the trade-off analysis minimum data model to estimate the effects of climate change on farmers in the Upper White Volta Basin of Ghana by 2050. The analysis, which was based on surveys and simulated crop and livestock yields from 300 farms, aims to determine the sensitivity of current agricultural production systems to climate change without adaptation and to ascertain the benefits of implementing adaptation strategies. The findings reveal varying levels of negative impacts of climate change on the net per farm revenues, per capita incomes, and poverty rates of farmers under climate change. When adaptation was accounted for, the scale of the negative impacts was reduced; the gains to most farmers increased by as much as 36%, per capita income increased, and the poverty rate declined. The benefits of adaptation indicate that climate change is not necessarily bad and that possibilities exist for farmers to benefit given the right measures and incentives and the adoption of climate-smart technologies.","[Amikuzuno, Joseph] Univ Dev Studies, Dept Climate Change & Food Secur, POB TL 1882, Tamale, Ghana",University for Development Studies,"Amikuzuno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Dev Studies, Dept Climate Change & Food Secur, POB TL 1882, Tamale, Ghana.",amikj26@yahoo.com,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER JAPAN,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,79,91,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_5,0.0,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300005,0

Methods: A retrospective, observational, matched cohort study used health insurance claims data (January 2008 to June 2013) to assess COPD-related outcomes for subjects aged >= 40 years. Subjects were assigned to a study cohort according to the first observed prescription fill for a long-acting bronchodilator (fluticasone propionate 250 mcg/salmeterol 50 mcg [FSC] or tiotropium bromide 18 mcg [TIO]). The analysis period for each subject comprised a 1-year pre-index date and 1-year post-index date. Primary outcome measure was total COPD-related costs per-patient per-year (PPPY) during the follow-up period. Secondary outcome measures included COPD-related exacerbations and the components of COPD-related costs. Results: Overall, 24,040 subjects were identified; the analysis sample consisted of 19,090 subjects (9,545 per cohort) with no significant differences between cohorts. Mean COPD-related total costs PPPY were numerically lower among the FSC cohort; however, the difference was not statistically significant ($2,224 [+/- 4,108] vs $2,352 [+/- 3,721], p=.057). There was no difference between cohorts for COPD-related medical costs (p = .894) . COPD-related pharmacy costs were significantly, yet modestly, lower in the FSC cohort compared with the TIO cohort ($1,160 [+/- 1,1061 vs 1,275 [+/- 1,110], p < .001). There were no statistically significant differences in the rate or number of exacerbations between the matched cohorts. Limitations: While propensity scoring achieved balance in baseline characteristics, some residual confounding unobserved in the database may be present. Conclusions: Few clinical and economic differences between subjects initiating maintenance therapy with FSC or TIO were observed.","[Bell, Christopher F.] GlaxoSmithKline, Res Triangle Pk, NC USA; [Coutinho, Anna D.; Farrelly, Eileen; Lokhandwala, Tasneem; Landsman-Blumberg, Pamela] Xcenda, Palm Harbor, FL USA","GlaxoSmithKline; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Bell, CF (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline, US Med Affairs, CEVEO, 5 Moore Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",christopher.f.bell@gsk.com,,"Lokhandwala, Tasneem/0000-0002-1983-9557",GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) [HO-14-14965/201512],GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)(GlaxoSmithKline),This manuscript was funded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) (HO-14-14965/201512).,,50,0,1,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods and materials: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free, progressed disease, and death) from a UK payer perspective and over lifetime (15 years) was developed. Direct costs included disease management, treatment-related (acquisition, administration, monitoring, adverse events), and T790M testing costs. Efficacy and safety data were taken from clinical trials AURA extension and AURA2 for osimertinib and IMPRESS for PDC. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison was applied to reduce the potential bias in the non-randomized comparison. Parametric functions were utilized to extrapolate survival beyond the observed period. Health state utility values were calculated from EQ-5D data collected in the trials and valued using UK tariffs. Resource use and costs were based on published sources. Results: Osimertinib was associated with a gain of 1.541 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of 64,283 vs PDC (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]: 41,705/QALY gained). Scenario analyses showed that none of the plausible scenarios produced an ICER above 44,000 pound per QALY gained, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated a 63.4% probability that osimertinib will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 pound. Limitations: The analysis is subject to some level of uncertainty inherent to phase 2 single-arm data and the immaturity of the currently available survival data for osimertinib. Conclusions: Osimertinib may be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared with PDC in the second-line setting in patients with EGFR-T790M mutation-positive NSCLC from a UK payer perspective. Further data from the ongoing AURA clinical trial program will reduce the inherent uncertainty in the analysis.","[Bertranou, Evelina; Dansk, Viktor; Large, Samuel] PAREXEL Access, London, England; [Bodnar, Carolyn; Dyer, Matthew] AstraZeneca, Cambridge, England; [Greystoke, Alastair] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Dyer, M (通讯作者)，Acad House,136 Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 8PA, Cambs, England.",matthew.dyer@astrazeneca.com,,"greystoke, alastair/0000-0001-9168-0387; Large, Samuel/0009-0008-9628-1922",AstraZeneca PLC,AstraZeneca PLC(AstraZeneca),This study and manuscript were funded by AstraZeneca PLC.,,33,27,30,3,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to explore how methods of elicitation impact utility values for CVD. Materials and methods: This review identified English-language articles in Embase, MEDLINE, and the gray literature published between September 1992 and August 2015 using keywords for utilities and stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, or angina. Variability in utility values based on the method of elicitation, tariff, or type of respondent was then reported. Results: This review screened 4,341 citations; 290 of these articles qualified for inclusion in the SLR because they reported utility values for one or more of the cardiovascular conditions of interest listed above. Of these 290, the 41 articles that provided head-to-head comparisons of utility methods for CVD were reviewed. In this sub-set, it was found that methodological differences contributed to variation in utility values. Direct methods often yielded higher scores than did indirect methods. Within direct methods, there were no clear trends in head-to-head studies (standard gamble [SG] vs time trade-off); but general population respondents often provided lower scores than did patients with the disease when evaluating the same health states with SG methods. When comparing indirect methods, the EQ-5D typically yielded higher values than the SF-6D, but also showed more sensitivity to differences in health states. Conclusions: When selecting CVD utility values for an economic model, consideration of the utility elicitation method is important, as this review demonstrates that methodology of choice impacts utility values in CVD.","[Betts, Marissa Blieden; Szatkowski, Anna] Evidera, Waltham, MA USA; [Gandra, Shravanthi R.] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Cheng, Lung-I] Takeda Oncol, Cambridge, MA USA; [Toth, Peter P.] CGH Med Ctr, Sterling, IL USA; [Toth, Peter P.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Ciccarone Ctr Prevent Cardiovasc Dis, Baltimore, MD USA",Evidera; Amgen; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Takeda Oncology; Johns Hopkins University,"Betts, MB (通讯作者)，500 Totten Pond Rd, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.",marissa.betts@evidera.com,"Toth, Peter/GMW-6552-2022",,Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),This study was funded by Amgen Inc.,,77,5,5,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Retrospective medical chart review of characteristics, time to progression, level of response, HRU during treatment, and adverse events (AEs). Data collection started on June 1, 2015 and was completed on July 15, 2015. In the 3 months before record abstraction, eligible patients had either disease progression after receiving one of their country's most commonly prescribed regimens or had received the best supportive care and died. Costs were calculated based on HRU and country-specific diagnosis-related group and/or unit reference costs, amongst other standard resources. Results: Physicians provided data for 1,282 patients (387 in the UK, 502 in France, 393 in Italy) who met the inclusion criteria. Mean [median] total healthcare costs associated with a single line of treatment were (sic)51,717 [35,951] in the UK, (sic)37,009 [32,538] for France, and (sic)34,496 [42,342] for Italy, driven largely by anti-myeloma medications costs (contributing 95.0%, 90.0%, and 94.2% of total cost, respectively). During active treatment, the highest costs were associated with lenalidomide- and pomalidomide-based regimens. Mean cost per month was lowest for patients achieving a very good partial response or better. Unscheduled events (i.e. not considered part of routine management, whether or not related to multiple myeloma, such as unscheduled hospitalization, AEs, fractures) accounted for 1-9% of total costs and were highest for bendamustine. Limitations: The use of retrospective data means that clinical practice (e.g. use of medical procedures, evaluation of treatment response) is not standardized across participating countries/centers, and some data (e.g. low-grade AEs) may be incomplete or differently adjudicated/reported. The centers involved may not be fully representative of national practice. Conclusions: Drug costs are the main contributor to total HRU costs associated with multiple myeloma. The duration of active treatment may influence the average total costs, as well as response, associated with a single line of therapy. Improved treatment outcomes, and reductions in unscheduled events and concomitant medication use may, therefore, reduce the overall HRU and related costs of care in multiple myeloma.","[Gonzalez-McQuire, Sebastian; Schoen, Paul; Campioni, Marco] Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland; [Yong, Kwee] UCL, Dept Haematol, London, England; [Leleu, Henri] Publ Hlth Expertise, Paris, France; [Mennini, Francesco S.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Ctr Econ & Int Studies, Fac Econ Econ Evaluat & HTA, Rome, Italy; [Mennini, Francesco S.] Kingston Univ, Inst Leadership & Management Hlth, Surrey, England; [Flinois, Alain; Gazzola, Carlotta; Fink, Leah] Kantar Hlth, Paris, France; [DeCosta, Lucy] Amgen Ltd, Uxbridge, Middx, England",Amgen; AMGEN Europe; University of London; University College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Kingston University; Amgen; Amgen Limited,"Gonzalez-McQuire, S (通讯作者)，Amgen Europe GmbH, Dammstr 23, CH-6300 Zug, Switzerland.",sebgonza@amgen.com,,,Amgen (Europe) GmbH,Amgen (Europe) GmbH(Amgen),This study was funded by Amgen (Europe) GmbH.,,50,16,16,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In the GADOLIN trial, R/R-rituximab patients who received G plus bendamustine (B) followed by G-mono-therapy (G+ B) for up to 2 years had significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients receiving B-monotherapy. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of G+ B vs B-monotherapy for R/R-rituximab FL patients from a US payer perspective. Materials and methods: Patient outcomes were simulated using a 3-state area under the curve model including progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death. This study used R/R-rituximab data from the National LymphoCare Study to extrapolate the GADOLIN trial's refractory FL progression-free and overall survival data to a R/R-rituximab FL population. Drug utilization and adverse events were based on trial data, and costs were based on Medicare reimbursements and drug wholesale acquisition costs in 2016. Utility estimates were derived from published literature. Post-progression treatment costs were based on observed post-progression therapies in GADOLIN. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model uncertainty. Results: G + B resulted in an increase in quality-adjusted life years relative to B-monotherapy of 1.24 (95% CR=0.61-1.87); the incremental total cost was $58,100 (95% CR = $54,500-$61,500). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $47,000 per QALY gained, and, based on probabilistic simulations, there was a 98% probability that G + B was cost-effective at the $100,000 per QALY threshold. Limitations and conclusions: This US-based analysis suggests that treatment with G B compared to B-monotherapy is likely cost-effective in R/R-rituximab FL patients. Modeling a R/R-rituximab population based on a synthesis of GADOLIN and the National LymphoCare Study data introduces uncertainty in the analysis. However, the findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.","[Guzauskas, Gregory F.; Veenstra, David L.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Masaquel, Anthony; Reyes, Carolina; Bernaards, Coen] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Krivasi, Tania] F Hoffmann La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Roche Holding; Genentech; Roche Holding,"Veenstra, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, H375 HSB,Box 357630,1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",veenstra@uw.edu,,"Guzauskas, Gregory/0000-0002-9095-1672","Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","The economic analysis was sponsored by Genentech, Inc.",,28,2,2,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The fruits are usually collected by women and processed into shea kernels and/or handcrafted shea butter for household consumption and sale in national and international markets. The volume of processed shea butter exported from Ghana has almost doubled from under 20,000 metric tons in 2009 to approximately 40,000 metric tons in 2013. The processing methods and technologies used at the microlevel are characterized by high consumption of water, fuelwood, and labor per unit output of crude shea butter. The level of input consumption and the operations performed by local processors have implications for the sustainability of the production process. Based on field interviews with experts and traders as well as on-site input inventory and measurements of consumption levels, this study analyzed the material demands and opportunities for improving production efficiency, marketing, and the livelihoods of the actors in urban and rural areas along the shea supply chain. The analysis goes beyond the shea value chain and applies material flow analysis to a discussion of simple efficiency scenarios for the most resource-consuming stages in the shea processing chain. Practical options for achieving sustainability through reduced material consumption and maintaining the supply capacity of natural capital are also discussed.","[Jasaw, Godfred Seidu] Univ Dev Studies, Fac Planning & Land Management, Wa, Ghana; [Saito, Osamu] United Nations Univ, Inst Adv Study Sustainabil UNU IAS, 5-53-70 Jingumae, Shibuya, Tokyo 1508925, Japan; [Takeuchi, Kazuhiko] UTIAS, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci IR3S, Tokyo, Japan",University for Development Studies; United Nations University,"Jasaw, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Dev Studies, Fac Planning & Land Management, Wa, Ghana.",gjasaw@uds.edu.gh,"Saito, Osamu/AAU-1495-2021; Saito, Osamu/AAH-6091-2020","Saito, Osamu/0000-0002-0697-9593",Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST),Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)),"This study was carried out within the framework of the Enhancing Resilience for Climate and Ecosystem Change: An Integrated Approach in Semi-Arid Africa (CECAR-Africa) project, funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).",,55,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER JAPAN,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,193,214,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_11,0.0,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300011,0

Objective: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of hydrophilic-coated intermittent catheters (HCICs) compared with uncoated catheters (UCs) among individuals with neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NB) due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting: A Canadian public payer perspective based on data from Ontario; including a scenario analysis from the societal perspective. Methods: A previously published Markov decision model was modified to compare the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the two interventions. Three renal function and three urinary tract infection (UTI) health states as well as other catheter-related events were included. Scenario analyses, including utility gain from compact catheter and phthalate free catheter use, were performed. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model. Results: The model predicted that a 50-year-old patient with SCI would gain an additional 0.72 QALYs if HCICs were used instead of UCs at an incremental cost of $48,016, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $66,634/QALY. Moreover, using HCICs could reduce the lifetime number of UTI events by 11%. From the societal perspective, HCICs cost less than UCs, while providing superior outcomes in terms of QALYs, life years gained (LYG), and UTIs. The cost per QALY further decreased when health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) gains associated with compact HCICs or catheters not containing phthalates were included. Conclusion: In general, ICERs in the range of CAD$50-100,000 could be considered cost-effective. The ICERs for the base case and sensitivity analyses suggest that HCICs could be cost-effective. From the societal perspective, HCICs were associated with potential cost savings in our model. The results suggest that reimbursement of HCICs should be considered in these settings.","[Welk, Blayne] Western Univ, Dept Surg & Epidemiol Biostat, London, ON, Canada; [Welk, Blayne] St Josephs Hlth Care, 268 Grosvenor St, London, ON N6A 4V2, Canada; [Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee] HUB, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, St Michaels Hosp, Ctr Excellence Econ Anal Res CLEAR, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee] Canadian Ctr Appl Res Canc Control, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Krassioukov, Andrei] Univ British Columbia, Spinal Cord Program, GF Strong Rehabil Ctr, ICORD, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Torp, Louise Husted] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Elterman, Dean] Toronto Western Hosp, Krembil Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Elterman, Dean] Univ Toronto, Dept Surg, Toronto, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Toronto; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto; Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute; University of Toronto; University of British Columbia; University of Copenhagen; Krembil Research Institute; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; University of Toronto,"Welk, B (通讯作者)，St Josephs Hlth Care, 268 Grosvenor St, London, ON N6A 4V2, Canada.",bkwelk@gmail.com,"Krassioukov, Andrei V/K-3131-2017",,Coloplast A/S,Coloplast A/S,"LHT was employed by Coloplast A/S while modifying the existing Markov model to a Canadian setting.

The model under consideration is the extension made by Cominetti and Correa (2001), for which the only solution method capable of resolving large transit networks is the one proposed by Cepeda et al. (2006). This transit assignment model was recently formulated by the authors as both a variational inequality problem and a fixed point inclusion problem. As a consequence of these results, this paper proposes an algorithm for solving the congested transit assignment problem with strict line capacities. The proposed method consists of using an MSA-based heuristic for finding a solution for the fixed point inclusion formulation. Additionally, it offers the advantage of always obtaining capacity-feasible flows with equal computational performance in cases of moderate congestion and with greater computational performance in cases of highly congested networks. A set of computational tests on realistic small- and large-scale transit networks under various congestion levels are reported, and the characteristics of the proposed method are analyzed.

We tested the VNS with steepest descent, first descent and a mixed of two descent strategies on the MAVRP instances.

Firstly, a bi-level optimization formulation is introduced based on the link-based traffic flow model. The upper level of the formulation minimizes the total system travel time, whereas the lower level captures traffic flow propagation and the user equilibrium constraints. Then the bi-level formulation is relaxed to a linear programming formulation that produces a lower bound of an efficient and fair system state. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the exact solution. It only requires solving one linear program in one iteration. Further, it is shown that the number of iterations is bounded, and the output traffic flow pattern is efficient and fair. Finally, two numerical cases (including a single OD network and a multi-OD network) are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. The results consistently show that the departure rate pattern generated from the algorithm leads to an efficient and fair system state, and the algorithm converges within two iterations across all test scenarios.

It is found that using friends in a social network to assist in last mile delivery greatly reduces delivery costs and total emissions while ensuring speedy and reliable delivery. The proposed new delivery method also mitigates the privacy concerns and not-at-home syndrome that widely exist in last mile delivery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases (January 1, 2009-December 31, 2013) were used to identify PD and probable PD+nOH patients. The first medical or prescription claim suggesting these diagnoses served as the index date. Baseline characteristics and post-index all-cause and fall-related healthcare utilization and costs were compared between patient groups. Results: A total of 17,421 PD and 281 PD+nOH patients were identified. Compared with PD patients, PD+nOH patients were older (77 vs 74 years; p<.0001) and had more comorbidities. Pre- and post-index date, more PD+nOH patients had a medically attended fall than PD patients (25% vs 20% [p=.0159] and 30% vs 21% [p=0.0002], respectively). Fallers in both groups had similar numbers of medically attended falls 12-months pre-index (mean =1.9), but PD+nOH fallers had more falls post-index (2.5 vs 2.0; p=.0176). Compared with PD patients, more PD+nOH patients (all p<.01) had fall-related emergency department (ED) visits (18% vs 10%), hospitalizations (7% vs 3%), and non-office visit outpatient services (15% vs 10%). Adjusted total post-index medical costs for falls ($2,260 vs $1,049; p=.0002) and total all-cause costs ($31,260 vs $20,910; p<.0001) were higher for PD+nOH vs PD patients. Limitations: This study had some limitations. There is no ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for nOH, so a combination of PD and OH diagnoses (with confounding conditions excluded) served as a proxy for an nOH diagnosis. Also, the rate of falls and associated costs in these cohorts might be under-reported because only medically attended falls were evaluated. Conclusions: PD+nOH patients had a higher prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities and a higher rate of medically attended falls than those with PD alone, leading to increased costs of care.","[Francois, Clement; Ziemann, Adam] Lundbeck LLC, Deerfield, IL USA; [Biaggioni, Italo; Shibao, Cyndya] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Clin Pharmacol, Nashville, TN 37212 USA; [Ogbonnaya, Augustina; Shih, Huai-Che; Farrelly, Eileen; Duhig, Amy] Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA","Lundbeck Corporation; Vanderbilt University; AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC","Duhig, A (通讯作者)，Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Suite 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",amy.duhig@xcenda.com,"François, Clément/AAR-3163-2021","Francois, Clement/0000-0003-2278-3352","Lundbeck, LLC; Lundbeck; Xcenda, LLC","Lundbeck, LLC(Lundbeck Corporation); Lundbeck(Lundbeck Corporation); Xcenda, LLC","This study was funded by Lundbeck, LLC.

Decision trees were modeled to analyze cost-effectiveness of alternative treatments that respect preference compared to guidelines in USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at a $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold from patient, provider and societal perspectives. Results: Forgoing colonoscopy dominates colonoscopy from patient, provider, and societal perspectives. Forgoing transfusion and air-fluidized bed are cost-effective from all three perspectives. Palliative care is cost-effective from provider and societal perspectives, but not from the patient perspective. Conclusion: Prioritizing incorporation of patient preferences within guidelines holds good value and should be prioritized when developing new guidelines.","[Padula, William V.; Bridges, John F.

We develop our model with an output distance function, using Bayesian methods of inference organized around Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We illustrate our model with an application in the U.S. airline industry, an industry sector beset with service failures affecting both revenues and costs. We present the service inefficiency results of various US airlines and discuss the determinants of bad outputs in this industry.

In this paper, we explore the optimal pricing strategies of the reward-based crowdfunding creator when substitutes exist. First, considering the characteristics of reward-based crowdfunding, we present four pricing strategies when substitutes exist. Then we propose the optimal pricing strategies to maximize the total profit of the creator under different circumstances facing strategic consumers. Finally, in the consideration of the differences of the valuations of the consumers, we make an equilibrium analysis by comparing the total profits of the four pricing strategies under different values of the substitution coefficient in order to get the optimal pricing strategy under a uniform distribution of the valuations of consumers.","[Chen, Yuting; Liu, Bin] Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Maritime University,"Chen, YT (通讯作者)，Shanghai Maritime Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",chenyuting29@stu.shmtu.edu.cn; liubin@shmtu.edu.cn,,,Shanghai Key Basic Research Program; National Science Foundation of China [71571117],Shanghai Key Basic Research Program; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to the Editors and anonymous referee for their very valuable comments and suggestions, which have significantly helped in improving the quality of this paper.

Its cost-effectiveness in Spain has not been established. Aims: To compare the costs and effects of PP3M compared with once-monthly paliperidone (PP1M) from the payer perspective in Spain. Methods: This study used the recently published trial by Savitz etal. as a core model over 1 year. Additional data were derived from the literature. Costs in 2016 Euros were obtained from official lists and utilities from Osborne etal. The authors conducted both cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses. For the former, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was calculated. For the latter, the outcomes were relapses and hospitalizations avoided. To assure the robustness of the analyses, a series of 1-way and probability sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The expected cost was lower with PP3M (4,780Euro) compared with PP1M (5,244Euro). PP3M had the fewest relapses (0.080 vs 0.161), hospitalizations (0.034 v.s 0.065), and emergency room visits (0.045 v.s 0.096) and the most QALYs (0.677 v.s 0.625). In both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, PP3M dominated PP1M. Sensitivity analyses confirmed base case findings. For the primary analysis (cost-utility), PP3M dominated PP1M in 46.9% of 10,000 simulations and was cost-effective at a threshold of 30,000Euro/QALY gained. Conclusions: PP3M dominated PP1M in all analyses and was, therefore, cost-effective for treating chronic relapsing schizophrenia in Spain. For patients who require long-acting therapy, PP3M appears to be a good alternative anti-psychotic treatment.","[Einarson, Thomas R.; Bereza, Basil G.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Llinares, Ignacio Garcia; Moro, Beatriz Gonzalez Martin] Janssen Cilag SA, Madrid, Spain; [Tedouri, Fadi] Janssen Pharmaceut NV, Beerse, Belgium; [Van Impe, Kristel] Janssen Cilag BV, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Toronto; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson,"Einarson, TR (通讯作者)，Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, 144 Coll St,Room 674, Toronto, ON M5S 3M2, Canada.",t.einarson@rogers.com,,,"Janssen Pharmaceuticals NV, Beerse, Belgium","Janssen Pharmaceuticals NV, Beerse, Belgium","This research was funded by grant sponsor Janssen Pharmaceuticals grant sponsor NV, Beerse, Belgium.",,74,14,15,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study availed itself of the intensive set of route choice data from Smart Card system as well as inverse optimization to calibrate the joint pdf of taste parameters to best signify the user-optimality of observed routes.

The analysis was conducted from a US third-party payer perspective. Methods: A partitioned-survival model was developed using data from patients from the KEYNOTE 010 clinical trial. The model used Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from the trial for patients treated with either pembrolizumab 2mg/kg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) with extrapolation based on fitted parametric functions and long-term registry data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived based on EQ-5D data from KEYNOTE 010 using a time to death approach. Costs of drug acquisition/ administration, adverse event management, and clinical management of advanced NSCLC were included in the model. The base-case analysis used a time horizon of 20 years. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results: Base case results project for PD-L1 positive (TPS >= 50%) patients treated with pembrolizumab a mean survival of 2.25 years. For docetaxel, a mean survival time of 1.07 years was estimated. Expected QALYs were 1.71 and 0.76 for pembrolizumab and docetaxel, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained with pembrolizumab vs docetaxel is $168,619/QALY, which is cost-effective in the US using a threshold of 3-times GDP per capita. Sensitivity analyses showed the results to be robust over plausible values of the majority of inputs. Results were most sensitive to extrapolation of overall survival. Conclusions: Pembrolizumab improves survival, increases QALYs, and can be considered as a cost-effective option compared to docetaxel in PD-L1 positive (TPS >= 50%) pre-treated advanced NSCLC patients in the US.","[Huang, Min; Pellissier, James; Burke, Thomas; Liu, Frank Xiaoqing; Xu, Ruifeng] Merck & Co Inc, Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence, 351 N Sumneytown Pike, N Wales, PA 19454 USA; [Lou, Yanyan] Mayo Clin, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Velcheti, Vamsidhar] Cleveland Clin, Solid Tumor Oncol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",Merck & Company; Mayo Clinic; Cleveland Clinic Foundation,"Huang, M (通讯作者)，Merck & Co Inc, Ctr Observat & Real World Evidence, 351 N Sumneytown Pike, N Wales, PA 19454 USA.",min_huang@merck.com,"xu, rui/GRX-5734-2022",,Merck Co.

Methods: A lifetime partitioned survival model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nilotinib vs dasatinib, which included four health states: CP on treatment, CP post-discontinuation, progressive disease (accelerated phase [AP] or blast crisis [BC]), and death. Time on treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival of nilotinib and dasatinib were estimated using real-world comparative effectiveness data. Parametric survival models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the study period. Drug treatment costs, medical costs, and adverse event costs were obtained from the literature and publicly available databases. Utilities of health states were derived from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, including incremental cost per life-year (LY) gained and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, were estimated comparing nilotinib and dasatinib. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying patient characteristics, cost, and utility inputs. Results: Over a lifetime horizon, nilotinib-treated patients were associated with 11.7 LYs, 9.1 QALYs, and a total cost of $ 1,409,466, while dasatinib-treated patients were associated with 9.5 LYs, 7.3 QALYs, and a total cost of $ 1,422,122. In comparison with dasatinib, nilotinib was associated with better health outcomes (by 2.2 LYs and 1.9 QALYs) and lower total costs (by $ 12,655). Deterministic sensitivity analysis results showed consistent findings in most scenarios. Limitations: In the absence of long-term real-world data, the lifetime projection could not be validated. Conclusions: Compared with dasatinib, second-line nilotinib was associated with better life expectancy, better quality-of-life, and lower costs among patients with Ph_CML-CP who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib.","[Li, Nanxin; Yang, Xi; Fan, Liangyi; Totev, Todor] Anal Grp, 111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Guerin, Annie] Anal Grp, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Chen, Lei; Joseph, George] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Bhattacharyya, Subrata] Novartis Healthcare Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis; Novartis,"Li, NX (通讯作者)，Anal Grp, 111 Huntington Ave,14th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",nick.li@analysisgroup.com,"Joseph, George/JJE-9445-2023; Totev, Todor/AAP-6782-2020; Li, Nanxin/D-9755-2011","Totev, Todor/0000-0003-0253-325X;",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),"Funding for this research was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

Antihypertension therapies guided by single genotypes are clinically more effective and may avert more adverse events than the standard of care of layering anti-hypertensive drug therapies, thus potentially decreasing costs. This study aimed to determine the economic benefits of the implementation of multi-gene panel guided therapies for hypertension from the payer perspective within a 3-year time horizon. Materials and methods: A simulation analysis was conducted for a panel of 10 million insured patients categorized clinically as untreated, treated but uncontrolled, and treated and controlled over a 3-year treatment period. Inputs included research data; empirical data from a 11-gene panel with known functional, heart, blood vessel, and kidney genotypes; and therapy efficacy and safety estimates from literature. Cost estimates were categorized as related to genetic testing, evaluation and management, medication, or adverse events. Results: Multi-gene panel guided therapy yielding savings of $6,256,607,500 for evaluation and management, $908,160,000 for medications, and $37,467,508,716 for adverse events, after accounting for incremental genetic testing costs of $2,355,540,000. This represents total 3-year savings of $42,276,736,216, or a 47% reduction, and 3-year savings of $4,228 and annual savings of $1,409 per covered patient. Conclusions: A precision medicine approach to genetically guided therapy for hypertension patients using a multi-gene panel reduced total 3-year costs by 47%, yielding savings exceeding $42.3 billion in an insured panel of 10 million patients. Importantly, 89% of these savings are generated by averting specific adverse events and, thus, optimizing choice of therapy in function of both safety and efficacy.","[Kelley, Eli F.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Snyder, Eric M.; Snyder, Scott C.; Sprissler, Ryan; Akre, Monica K.] Geneticure Inc, Rochester, MN USA; [Alkhatib, Nimer S.; Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & Pharmaco Econ Res, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Sprissler, Ryan] Univ Arizona Genom Core, Tucson, AZ USA; [Sprissler, Ryan; Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Ctr Appl Genet & Genom Med, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Olson, Thomas P.] Mayo Clin, Coll Med, Rochester, MN USA; [Abraham, Ivo] Univ Arizona, Dept Family & Community Med, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA; [Abraham, Ivo] Matrix45, Tucson, AZ USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; Mayo Clinic; University of Arizona,"Abraham, I (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Coll Pharm, Ctr Hlth Outcomes & PharmacoEcon Res, Drachman Hall B306H,1295 N Martin Ave, Tucson, AZ 85724 USA.",abraham@pharmacy.arizona.edu,"Kelley, Eli/I-6271-2019; Alkhatib, Nimer/GWQ-8515-2022","Alkhatib, Nimer/0000-0001-5071-9257; Kelley, Eli/0000-0001-8337-2253",Geneticure Inc.,Geneticure Inc.,"The study was supported by funds from Geneticure Inc., which has developed multi-gene panels for blood pressure prescribing using pharmacogenetics.

The operation cost at each track will depend on the train model characteristics operating each line, the passenger load on trains and the average train speed. Given the network topology and the passenger mobility patterns, we propose a methodology to determine the best regular timetable, taking into account both, users' and service provider points of view. Since the frequency setting and the passengers assignment are intertwined problems, the proposed procedure solves a succession of interrelated transit assignments and frequency setting models. At each iteration, given a transit assignment, the resultant frequency setting problem turns into a Mixed Integer Non-Linear model which is solved to optimality in a sequential way, both considering the different train models and the passenger load on trains. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a real-size scenario. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Transition matrices are created using theoretical distributions of travel time calibrated with stop-to-stop travel time and dwell time data. The approach captures analytically the bus behavior while still allowing the model to be informed by the unique characteristics of the route, including travel time between stops and passenger demand. This stochastic process model mimics the physical phenomenon of Brownian motion, and it is found that the compounding nature of randomness leads to greater unreliability as the route progresses. Theoretical analysis of routes allows us to demonstrate where problem points may exist on the route and can point to locations where reliability improvements may be more effective. We develop a cost function to capture the values of time of passengers including waiting time due to early and late buses, and lost time at time points. We include operating cost capturing the increased cost of travel time caused by added control, and the improved overtime costs resulting from more consistent service. Using data from automated vehicle location (AVL) and automated passenger count (APC) systems, an operational route in Calgary, Canada is optimized using the developed model and cost function. A heuristic optimization algorithm is developed to consider high-cost stops iteratively which improves the cost function compared with existing configurations and with fewer time points.

However, a general problem in transport modelling is that these variables are subject to measurement errors in transport network models. In this paper we show how to assess the magnitude of the measurement errors in travel time and travel cost by latent variables, in a large-scale travel demand model. The case study for Stockholm commuters shows that assuming multiplicative measurement errors for travel time and cost result in a better fit than additive ones, and that parameter estimates of the choice model are impacted by some of the key modelling assumptions. Moreover, our results suggest that measurement errors in our dataset are larger for the travel cost than for the travel time, and that measurement errors are larger in self-reported travel time than software-calculated travel time for car-driver and car-passenger, and of similar magnitude for public transport. Among self-reported travel times, car-passenger has the largest errors, followed by car-driver and public transport, and for the software-calculated times, public transport exhibits larger errors than car. These errors, if not corrected, lead to biases in measures derived from the models, such as elasticities and values of travel time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Uncertainty is evident at all stages of the project development, as the concept emerges and as it moves through the subsequent assessment and decision processes. This research has investigated and demonstrated a method that quantifies the factors contributing to uncertainty, focussing on the early stages of the project lifecycle. The method used a back-cast scenario to describe a future view of a transport project. The causal relationships between elements of the planning and decision processes that led to the scenarios were discussed in structured interviews with stakeholders, and each conversation was coded using qualitative analysis techniques to identify the active elements of the process. Causality between the elements was explored to evaluate their influences and dependencies with those elements found to be simultaneously both highly influential and highly dependent were identified as those driving uncertainty. The sensitivity of the analytical element of this process to its parameters was also examined to quantify their contribution to the uncertainty in the analysis and to establish robust values for these parameters. The specific scenario presented here was based on a disused railway where several 'studies evaluating its re-opening have resulted in contradictory views on its mode of use and on the achievable benefits. In the scenario, the rail service is re-instated for light rail use in conjunction with a new sustainable urban area anchored on an existing small village. In this case, the results showed that local politics and leadership were the most influential factors in the project while the economic environment, the utility of the proposal, and planning policy contributed most to the uncertainties in the project. Although these results emerged from a specific scenario, the methodology was demonstrated to be a powerful generic tool to identify the elements that create criticalities in the planning and decision process. Therefore, the integrated method has application in other areas of project inception and planning, much wider than in the transport application demonstrated here.

The method combines a set-covering model to assign location demands to stations with a queuing model to measure the related service levels. The key quality of this approach is its capacity in addressing the issues related to uncertainties in bicycle pick-up and return demand in BSS network design decisions. Results of the implementation of a BSS design for Istanbul Technical Universitya;;s Ayazaga Campus show that our approach provides a balanced BSS network by equalizing the mean demand and return rates, which will decrease the need for relocation efforts once the system is put to use.

In item-sharing, members of a sharing community can temporarily rent items such as tools or leisure equipment from one another. In crowdshipping, private drivers offer to execute delivery jobs for other people on trips they would make anyway. Since the peer-to-peer exchange in item-sharing involves repeated, inefficient 'last-mile' transports of small shipments, we investigate here whether the integration of item-sharing and crowdshipping has the potential to facilitate collaborative consumption. To this end, the decision making for an integrated item-sharing and crowdshipping platform is modeled. This platform matches supplies, requests, and planned trips of the community members. We develop mathematical models and heuristics for maximizing the platform's profit and the number of fulfilled requests.

While numerous guidelines for the selection of left-turn phasing have been developed, there is no widely recognized guideline or criterion for the use of left-turn phasing under specific traffic conditions especially for a single left-turn lane. Focusing on the inherent mechanism of the dynamic nature and uncertainty of left-turn queues under different left-turn phasing, this paper develops a left-turn queueing model with uncertain second vacation to analytically evaluate the performance of left turns for different left-turn phasing, which considers various factors including the type of left-turn phasing, signal timing, left-turn volume, opposing through volume, type of left-turn lane, number of opposing through lanes, and number of sneakers, etc. For different left-turn phasing, the left-turn queues formation and dissipation with different characteristics of vacations (i.e., server absences during the red time and uncertain blocked time caused by the opposing through flow during the permitted green time) are formulated, and the queue length distributions of left turns along with the time within one cycle and at an arbitrary time are derived. Furthermore, three sets of left-turn performance measures are obtained: primary queueing measures, fuel-consumption (or emissions) related measures, and safety related measure. On the basis of these performance measures, an analytical evaluation framework for left-turn queues is established, which can provide a more accurate and detailed basis for evaluating and improving the use of left-turn phasing. Model validation indicates that the proposed model can be an effective tool to evaluate the use of left-turn phasing under different traffic conditions. In addition, numerical experiments are also performed to theoretically identify the factors that could affect the performance of left turns and thus help to determine the left-turn phasing selection under different conditions.

Competitors' presence at both endpoint airports and route concentration are two significant deterrents of entry. The role of London Heathrow and the establishment of joint ventures within international alliances also show significant impacts, although the effects vary across different markets. Separating transatlantic markets into new versus existing markets helps disentangling the complex relationships between the OSA and route entry.","[Zhang, Shengrun; Witlox, Frank] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Derudder, Ben; Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Ghent, Belgium; [Fuellhart, Kurt] Shippensburg Univ, Geog & Earth Sci Dept, Shippensburg, PA 17257 USA",Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Ghent University; Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania,"Zhang, SR (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhangshengrun_seg@126.com; ben.derudder@UGent.be; KGFuel@ship.edu; Frank.Witiox@UGent.be,"Derudder, Ben/ABH-5648-2020; Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008; Derudder, Ben/A-1616-2008","Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823; Fuellhart, Kurt/0000-0002-2486-663X; Derudder, Ben/0000-0001-6195-8544","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41701120, 61672002, 71201081]; Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics [NZ2016109]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics),"We would like to thank Prof. Jinfu Zhu, Prof. Weiwei Wu, and Prof. Wendong Yang for data support.

In contrast to the traditional humanitarian logistics literature, we develop a chance-constrained two-stage mean-risk stochastic programming model. This risk-averse model features a mean-risk objective, where the conditional value at-risk (CVaR) is specified as the risk measure, and enforces a joint probabilistic constraint on the feasibility of the second-stage problem concerned with distributing the relief supplies to the affected areas in case of a disaster. To solve this computationally challenging stochastic optimization model, we employ an exact Benders decomposition-based branch and-cut algorithm. We develop three variants of the proposed algorithm by using alternative representations of CVaR We illustrate the application of our model and solution methods on a case study concerning the threat of hurricanes in the Southeastern part of the United States. An extensive computational study provides practical insights about the proposed modeling approach and demonstrates the computational effectiveness of the solution framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: The Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid claims database was used to identify patients with schizophrenia; Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial and Medicaid claims databases were used to identify patients with BD. The analyses included adult patients (>= 18 years) who either began receiving an LAI (no prior LAI therapy) or changed to a different oral antipsychotic (monotherapy). The first day of initiating an LAI or changing to a new oral antipsychotic was the index date. Linear and Cox regression models were conducted to estimate medication adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC]) and time to medication discontinuation (continuous medication gap 60 days), respectively. Models adjusted for patient demographic and clinical characteristics, baseline medication use, and baseline ED or hospitalizations. Results: Patients with schizophrenia (N=5638) who began receiving LAIs had better medication adherence (5% higher adjusted mean adherence) during the 1 year post-index period and were 20% less likely to discontinue their medication during the entire follow-up period than patients who changed to a different oral antipsychotic monotherapy, adjusting for differences between LAI users and oral users. Similarly, patients with BD (N=11,344) who began receiving LAIs also had 5% better medication adherence and were 19% less likely to discontinue their medication than those using oral antipsychotics. Limitations: Clinical differences unmeasurable in this database may have been responsible for the choice of LAI versus oral antipsychotics, and these differences may be responsible for some of the adherence advantages observed. Conclusions: This real-world study suggests that patients with schizophrenia or BD who began receiving LAIs had better medication adherence and lower discontinuation risk than those who changed to a different oral antipsychotic monotherapy.","[Greene, Mallik] Otsuka Pharmaceutical Dev & Commercializat Inc, Princeton, NJ USA; [Yan, Tingjian; Chang, Eunice; Broder, Michael S.] Partnership Hlth Anal Res LLC, Beverly Hills, CA USA; [Hartry, Ann; Touya, Maelys] Lundbeck, Deerfield, IL USA",Otsuka Pharmaceutical,"Greene, M (通讯作者)，Otsuka Pharmaceut Dev & Commercializat Inc, Carnegie Ctr 508, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mallik.greene@otsuka-us.com,,,Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization Inc.; Lundbeck,Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization Inc.(Otsuka Pharmaceutical); Lundbeck(Lundbeck Corporation),This research was supported by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development and Commercialization Inc. and Lundbeck.,,48,123,128,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

As such, agriculture is highly susceptible to climate change, including deteriorating moisture conditions. Aware of their vulnerability to adverse changes in local environments, as a survival strategy, smallholder farmers use their knowledge of the environment to modify the farming and other resource management practices along with their socioeconomic conduct as a whole in the wake of their changing operating circumstances. This chapter argues that such responses, which are borne out of traditional, local, or indigenous knowledge, offer lessons for the formulation of realistic local-level strategies to adapt to climate change to complement systematic scientific models. It draws from case studies in Ghana to explore the prospects of developing such strategies. Based on the case studies, we identified more than 50 actual responses to environmental change, including agrodiverse biological responses that appear particularly appropriate for developing climate change-adaptive models and, possibly, for developing mitigative measures, which farmers recognize as an important need.","[Gyasi, Edwin A.] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Awere, Kwabena Gyekye] Univ Ghana, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Gyasi, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",edwin.gyasi@gmail.com; kawere@ug.edu.gh,,,,,,,52,4,5,2,18,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,291,312,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_16,0.0,,,22,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300016,0

Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness using two different agents for hemostasis (HEMOPATCH vs dry or wet gauze compression or similar SOC) in cardiac surgery from the European hospital perspective. Methods: A literature-based cost-effectiveness model estimating average cost per successful hemostasis event was developed based on the hemostasis efficacy difference (HEMOPATCH=97.6%, SOC=65.8%, p<.001). Additional clinically significant end-points studied in the trial (blood transfusions and surgical revisions) were also analyzed. It was assumed that each surgery utilized two units of HEMOPATCH (dimensions of 4.5x9cm) and two units of SOC. Product acquisition costs for HEMOPATCH and SOC were included along with outcome-related costs derived from the literature and inflation-adjusted to 2017 EUR and GBP. Results are presented for an average hospital with an annual case load of 574 cardiac surgeries. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Considering only product acquisition cost, HEMOPATCH had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of (sic)1,659, (sic)1,519, (sic)1,623, and (sic) 1,725 per hemostasis success when compared to SOC for Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, respectively. However, when considering the cost and potential difference in the frequency of transfusions and revisions compared to SOC, the use of HEMOPATCH was associated with an annual reduction of six revisions and 60 transfusions, improving the ICER to (sic)1,440, (sic)1,222, (sic)1,461, and (sic) 1,592, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated model robustness. Conclusions: This analysis supports the use of HEMOPATCH over SOC in cardiac surgery in European hospitals to improve hemostasis success rates and potential cost offsets from reduced transfusions, complications, and surgical revisions.","[Ikeme, Shelly; Lewis, Kevin M.] Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA; [Weltert, Luca] European Hosp, Rome, Italy; [Bothma, Gerhard; Kuntze, Erik] Baxter Healthcare Corp, Zurich, Switzerland; [Cianciulli, Daniela] Baxter Healthcare Corp, Rome, Italy; [Pay, Nicole; Epstein, Josh] Stratevi, Santa Monica, CA USA",Baxter International Inc,"Ikeme, S (通讯作者)，Baxter Healthcare Corp, One Baxter Pkwy, Deerfield, IL 60015 USA.",shelly_ikeme@baxter.com,,,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,Baxter Healthcare Corporation,This study was funded by Baxter Healthcare Corporation.,,31,7,7,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: A deterministic Markov model evaluated the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained with SSA+TE vs SSA per a third-party US payer perspective. The model reflected clinical practice and resource use estimates based on current standards of care, with utility estimates based on similar symptoms from ulcerative colitis. Treatment efficacy was based on the phase III clinical trial of SSA+TE vs SSA alone [TELESTAR, NCT01677910]. According to TELESTAR, 44% of SSA+TE and 20% of SSA patients responded to therapy after 12 weeks. At each 4-week assessment period, SSA patients not adequately controlled received increasing doses of SSA and SSA+TE patients discontinued TE and moved to SSA only. Drug costs for adequately and not adequately controlled patients were $4,291.75 and $5,890.57 for SSA, respectively, and $9,456.07 and $5,890.57 for SSA+TE, respectively. Results: The base-case analysis demonstrated lifetime QALYs of 1.67 at a cost of $495,125 for the SSA cohort and 2.33 ($590,087) for SSA+TE with an incremental QALY for SSA+TE of 0.66 for an additional $94,962. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $142,545. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated high probability (>99%) of SSA+TE being cost-effective at thresholds for rare diseases and orphan drugs of $300,000-$450,000. Limitations: The recent availability of TE precluded the incorporation of clinical and economic inputs based on real-world practice patterns. The scarcity of epidemiology and utility information for this rare condition required the use of some proxy estimates. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrated TE is a cost-effective treatment option when used on top of standard of care in CSD patients.","[Joish, V.

Materials and methods: The economic burden of kidney disorders was estimated using a prevalence-based approach. Related kidney diseases in patients with kidney disorders (RPWKD) were defined using codes from the tenth International Classification of Disease (E70-E90, F30-F48, F60-F69, F90-F99, K65-K67, N00-N08, N17-N19, and N30-N39). All diseases in patients with kidney disorders (APWKD) were defined as kidney disorders that involved all disease codes. Economic costs were divided into direct costs (medical costs and non-medical costs) and indirect costs (productivity loss because of morbidity and premature mortality). Results: The prevalence of kidney disorders increased from 0.08% (2008) to 0.11% (2011). The total economic burden of RPWKD also substantially increased from $898.9 million (2008) to $1.43 billion (2011). This approximate to 59.4% increase in the economic burden was equal to 0.12% of the Korean gross domestic product. The economic burden of APWKD also increased during the study period: $1.06 billion (2008), $1.23 billion (2009), $1.44 billion (2010), and $1.46 billion (2011).

The results reveal that a shipping company's stakeholder pressure, attitude, and behavioural control directly influence the adoption of sustainable shipping practices, and indirectly influence business performance. Furthermore, stakeholder pressure directly influences attitude, behavioural control, and business performance. This paper contributes to the integration of stakeholder and behavioural theories on sustainable practices. Strategies to improve the adoption of sustainable shipping practices are discussed.","[Yuen, Kum Fai] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Wang, Xueqin; Wong, Yiik Diew; Zhou, Qingji] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Chung Ang University; Nanyang Technological University,"Wang, XQ (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",yuenkf@cau.ac.kr; wang1072@e.ntu.edu.sg; cydwong@ntu.edu.sg; qjzhou@ntu.edu.sg,"Yuen, Kum Fai/K-2994-2019; Zhou, Qingji/AAL-5301-2020; wang, xueqin/Y-3649-2019; WONG, Y.

We present computational results to evaluate the performance of the proposed formulations when solved with a general purpose solver and study the structure of the solutions to each of the robust counterparts.

The control method optimizes the signal timings in adaptive traffic control systems, and takes full advantage of flexible new technologies to incorporate the most up-to-date traffic information, as collected in real time. The definitions, combinations, and sequencing of the cycle structure stages are generated automatically using a procedure for optimizing the signal-timing plans in response to online data from traffic detectors. This new method provides a wider search space and improves the efficiency of the signal-control systems, thus improving the junction performance, minimizing delays, and maximizing capacity in real time. A multi-resolution strategy is proposed for updating the elements of the signal plans cycle-by-cycle and adjusting the current green signal timing second-by-second. The group-based variables and parameters for the proactive global optimization method utilize lane-based predictive traffic-flow information, such as arrival and discharge rates, expressed as the slopes of polygonal delay formulas. Therefore, there is a high degree of flexibility in the tactical identification of the optimal signal plan in response to the real-time predicted traffic information, the objective function of the polygonal delay formula, and the direct differential equations for the adaptive group-based variables. The reactive local signal-control policy, which is formed based on the max-pressure strategy, is developed to locally adjust the current green signal time and to accommodate delicate demand fluctuations second-by-second at the fine-resolution level. The most appropriate cycle-structure for the tactical level of control is identified using a group-based global-optimization procedure that takes advantage of the latest available information. In part II of this study (Lee et al. 2017), the effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated based on the actualized mathematical frameworks, computer simulations, and a case study, using the appropriate computer programs.

The objective is to minimize the total costs incurred to both the highway users and the pavement management agency. We propose a Lagrange multiplier approach together with derivative-free quasi-Newton algorithms to solve the problem for two scenarios: i) with a combined budget constraint for all the treatments; and ii) with one budget constraint for each treatment. The system-level solution approach has the following merits: i) it can be applied to problems with any forms of segment-level models for user and agency costs, deterioration process, and treatment effectiveness, given that the solution to the segment-level problem is available; ii) under the combined budget constraint, it ensures that the optimality gap of the system-level solution is bounded by a term that depends upon the optimality gap of the segment-level solutions; and iii) it exhibits linear complexity with the number of segments. At the segment level, a new maintenance effectiveness model fitted on empirical data is proposed and incorporated into the MR&R optimization program. A greedy heuristic algorithm is developed, which greatly reduces the computation time without compromising the solution quality. Combining the system- and segment-level models and solution algorithms, we examine a batch of numerical cases. The results show considerable cost savings from the incorporation of maintenance, and from jointly optimizing the use of a combined agency budget. A number of managerial insights stemmed from the numerical case studies are discussed, which can help highway agencies formulate more cost-efficient MR&R plans and budget allocation.

The two models are theoretically equivalent under certain assumptions, hence are expected to yield similar results. We use stated preference data to compare the valuation of travel time variability under a structural model where trip-timing preferences are defined in terms of time-dependent utility rates, the slope model, against its reduced-form model. Two choice experiments are used that are identical except one has a fixed departure time while the other allows respondents to choose departure time freely. The empirical results in this paper do not support the theoretical equivalence of the two models as the implied value of travel time variability under the reduced-form model is an order of magnitude larger. This finding, which is robust to various specification tests, is in line with a recent Swedish study by Borjesson, Eliasson and Franklin [Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 46(7), 855-873 (2012)]. Since our data allows a direct comparison of the two approaches, we are able to rule out some potential explanations lined up by past research for the observed discrepancy between the two models.

These models can be used to strategically evaluate technology choices. We study the effect of demand elasticity on the technology choice by analytic and numerical comparison with some fixed demand models. We assume a range of objective functions having as two extrema the maximization of operator's profit and the maximization of social welfare. We show both analytically and numerically that accounting for demand elasticity does not change the conclusions that can be derived by an equivalent fixed demand model. This invariance holds for a broad range of objective functions in the elastic case. The significant difference between the two objective function extrema lies in the proportions of captured demand.

Using new analytical techniques to extract more information from loop detector data, the vqFR from a time of day HOV lane exhibits high v that slowly drops as q increases. This curve arises after binning several million vehicles by q and only considering those bins with q < 1200 vph. A surprising thing happens when further binning the data by the adjacent lane speed (v2): the vqFR expands in to a fan of curves that decrease in magnitude and slope with decreasing v2. Yet each curve in the fan continues to exhibit uncongested trends, ranging from a flat curve consistent with recent editions of the Highway Capacity Manual to downward sloping curves. It is shown that this behavior was not due to the HOV operations per se, the same behavior also arises in the non-HOV period when the lane serves all vehicles and it is also observed at another facility without any HOV restrictions. This dependency on the adjacent lane is absent from most traffic flow theories. Taking a broader view, four different factors appear to limit the speed a driver takes: (i) the roadway geometry, (ii) the posted speed limit, (iii) the vehicle ahead (car following), and (iv) traffic conditions in the adjacent lane. Whichever constraint is most binding determines the driver's speed. While the first three constraints are found in the literature, this work contributes the fourth, as per above. When the speed limit is the most binding constraint the uncongested regime of the vqFR is roughly flat with a near constant speed over a wide range of q. When the roadway geometry is the binding constraint, e.g., due to the lack of speed limits, drivers are able to travel fast enough to be sensitive to the vehicle ahead and exhibit lower v as q increases. Car following is by definition in the congested regime and thus, beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, the present work shows that as the adjacent lane moves slower, the uncongested drivers choose speeds below the speed limit and once more exhibit lower v as q increases. Although the chosen v is below the speed limit, the drivers continue to exhibit behavior consistent with the uncongested regime. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Empty truck trips, caused by a lack of coordination among truckers, are responsible for a significant share of these emissions, and collaboration among truckers is seen as the major opportunity to address this issue. Truck appointment systems (TASs) schedule truck activities and enable collaboration for transportation between terminals and client locations. The aim of this work is to introduce a collaborative planning model to be operated within a TAS and to investigate its impact on emission and cost objectives. Starting with a review of requirements for a TAS with collaboration, an optimization model based on the multiple traveling salesman problem with time windows is developed, leveraging collaboration to reduce costs and emissions. The results for a real-world case demonstrate that the developed approach provides appropriately coordinated truck schedules and effectively reduces truck emissions and costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While the literature for the CCVRP is scarce, this problem has useful applications especially in the area of supplying humanitarian aid after a natural disaster. In this paper, a two-stage adaptive variable neighbourhood search (AVNS) algorithm that incorporates large neighbourhood search (LNS) as a diversification strategy is proposed. When tested on the benchmark data sets, the results show that the proposed AVNS is highly competitive in producing new best known solutions to more than half of the instances. An alternative but related objective that minimises the maximum arrival time (min-max) is also explored in this study demonstrating the flexibility and the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that exploits the min-max objective of the CCVRP in addition to providing extensive computational results for a large number of instances for the min-sum. As a by-product of this study, managerial insights for decision making are also presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: This study included respondents to the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis Registry spring 2015 update survey who were US or Canadian residents, aged 18-65 years and reported having relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), or primary progressive MS (PPMS). The RRMS and SPMS participants were combined to form the relapsing-onset MS (RMS) group and compared with the PPMS group regarding employment status, absenteeism, and disability. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between employment-related outcomes and factors that may affect these relationships. Results: Of the 8004 survey respondents, 5887 (73.6%) were 18-65 years of age. The PPMS group (n=344) had a higher proportion of males and older mean age at the time of the survey and at time of diagnosis than the RMS group (n=4829). Female sex, age, age at diagnosis, cognitive and hand function impairment, fatigue, higher disability levels, >= 3 comorbidities, and a diagnosis of PPMS were associated with not working. After adjustment for disability, the employed PPMS sub-group reported similar levels of absenteeism to the employed RMS sub-group. Limitations: Limitations of the study include self-report of information and the possibility that participants may not fully represent the working-age MS population. Conclusions: In MS, employment status and absenteeism are negatively affected by disability, cognitive impairment, and fatigue. These findings underscore the need for therapies that prevent disability progression and other symptoms that negatively affect productivity in persons with MS to enable them to persist in the workforce.","[Salter, Amber] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Div Biostat, St Louis, MO 63110 USA; [Thomas, Nina] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Tyry, Tuula] St Josephs Hosp, Dign Hlth, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Cutter, Gary] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Marrie, Ruth Ann] Univ Manitoba, Dept Internal Med & Community Hlth Sci, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",Washington University (WUSTL); Roche Holding; Genentech; St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Manitoba,"Salter, A (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Div Biostat, 660 S Euclid Ave, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",amber@wustl.edu,"Cutter, Gary/AAY-5392-2021","Cutter, Gary/0000-0002-8455-980X; Marrie, Ruth Ann/0000-0002-1855-5595","CMSC; Foundation of the CMSC; Genentech, Inc.","CMSC; Foundation of the CMSC; Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","NARCOMS is a project of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC).

This study estimated the expected costs associated with the management of OAB in Canada from a societal perspective by utilizing real-world evidence. Methods: An economic model with monthly cycles and a 1-year time horizon was developed to depict a treatment pathway for a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients with OAB. At model entry, patients receive mirabegron or an antimuscarinic. Patients who do not persist may switch treatment, undergo a minimally invasive procedure, or remain symptomatic (uncontrolled). The model includes direct costs (e.g. physician visits) and indirect costs (e.g. lost productivity). A one-way univariate sensitivity analysis assessed a +/- 20% variation in each of the key model inputs. Results: At 1 year, a greater proportion of patients persisted on treatment with mirabegron compared with antimuscarinics (33% vs 15-23%), and a smaller proportion switched treatment (17% vs 20-22%). The number of healthcare visits (292 vs 299-304), pads used (74,098 vs 77,878-81,669), and work hours lost (4,497 vs 5,372-6,249) were all lower for mirabegron vs antimuscarinics. The estimated total annual cost of treatment per patient with mirabegron was $2,127.46 Canadian dollars (CAD) ($5.82 CAD/day) compared with $2,150.20-$2,496.69 CAD ($5.89-$6.84 CAD/day) for antimuscarinics. The one-way sensitivity analysis indicated the results are robust. Conclusions: Improved persistence observed in routine clinical practice with mirabegron appears to translate into benefits of reduced healthcare resource use, and lower direct and indirect costs of treatment compared with antimuscarinics. Overall, these data suggest that mirabegron may offer clinical and economic benefits for the management of patients with OAB in Canada.","[Hakimi, Zalmai] Astellas Pharma Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands; [Nazir, Jameel] Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd, Chertsey, England; [McCrea, Charles] PAREXEL Access Consulting, London, England; [Berling, Malin] PAREXEL Access Consulting, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fatoye, Francis] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ramos, Barbara] Astellas Pharma Canada, Markham, ON, Canada; [Wagg, Adrian] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Manchester Metropolitan University; Astellas Pharmaceuticals; University of Alberta,"Hakimi, Z (通讯作者)，Astellas Pharma Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands.",zalmai.hakimi@astellas.com,"Wagg, Adrian Stuart/G-5350-2016; Hakimi, Zalmai/AAZ-5620-2021","Wagg, Adrian Stuart/0000-0002-5372-530X;",Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.; Astellas,Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.(Astellas Pharmaceuticals); Astellas(Astellas Pharmaceuticals),This study was sponsored by Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.

Bike sharing is a green transportation mode that makes it possible for people to use shared bikes for travel. Bikes are retrieved and parked at any of the stations within the bike sharing network. One major challenge is that the demand for and supply of bikes are not always matched. Hence, vehicles are used to pick up bikes from surplus stations and transport them to deficit stations to satisfy a particular service level. This operation is called a bike-repositioning problem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid large neighborhood search for solving the problem. Several removal and insertion operators are proposed to diversify and intensify the search. A simple tabu search is further applied to the most promising solutions. The heuristic is evaluated on three sets of instances with up to 518 stations and five vehicles.

This study assessed the impact of changing from a self-expandable (SE) valve to a balloon-expandable (BE) valve on healthcare resource use and procedural costs in a population of inoperable AS patients. Methods: In this retrospective single center study, data for 195 patients who received either an SE or a BE valve between 2010-2014 were collected. Procedural and post-procedural healthcare resource use and cost parameters were determined for the two groups. Results: The study showed that overall procedural time, including time required by medical personnel, was significantly shorter for TAVI using a BE compared with an SE valve. Post-surgery, patients in the BE valve group had significantly shorter hospital stays than the SE valve group, including significantly fewer days spent in the intensive care unit (ICU). Additionally, trends towards reduced 30-day mortality, incidence of new permanent pacemaker implantation, and incidence of blood transfusion were observed in the BE valve group compared with the SE valve group. Finally, total procedural costs were 24% higher in the SE compared with the BE valve group. Limitations: The BE valve data were acquired in a single year, whereas the SE valve data were from a 5-year period. However, a year-by-year analysis of patient characteristics and study outcomes for the SE valve group showed few significant differences over this 5-year period. Conclusions: Overall, changing from an SE to a BE valve for TAVI in patients with severe AS reduced both healthcare resource use and procedure-related costs, while maintaining patient safety. For healthcare providers, this could increase efficiency and capacity within the healthcare system, with the added advantage of reducing costs.","[Klein, Holger] Univ Herzzentrum Freiburg Bad Krozingen, Sudring 15, D-79189 Bad Krozingen, Germany; [Boleckova, Jana] Edwards Lifesci SA, Nyon, Switzerland",University of Freiburg; Universitats Herzzentrum Freiburg; Edwards Lifesciences,"Klein, H (通讯作者)，Univ Herzzentrum Freiburg Bad Krozingen, Sudring 15, D-79189 Bad Krozingen, Germany.",holger.klein@universitaets-herzzentrum.de,,,Edwards Lifesciences,Edwards Lifesciences,The study was funded by Edwards Lifesciences.,,34,2,2,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Patients were followed from first observed clinical presentation with LBP until the age of 100 years or death. The underlying data to populate the model were based on Swedish national and regional registry data on healthcare resource use and sickness insurance in patients presenting with LBP in the Swedish region Vastra Gotaland during 2008-2012. Costs (outpatient healthcare visits, inpatient bed days, pharmaceuticals, productivity loss), EUR 2016, and quality-of-life based on EQ-5D data from the registries and published estimates were summarized over the lifetime of the patients with 3% annual discount. A lost quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was valued at Euro70,000.Results: Mean lifetime total cost was estimated at Euro47,452/patient, of which indirect costs were 57%. Total lifetime economic burden for all patients coming to clinical presentation in Sweden per year was Euro8.8bn. The average LBP patient was estimated to face a loss of 2.7 QALYs over their lifetime compared with the general population. For all patients in Sweden coming to clinical presentation in 1 year this gives 505,407 QALYs lost, valued at Euro35.3bn. Adding the economic burden, the total societal burden amounts to Euro44.1bn.Conclusion: This pathway model shows that most patients with LBP receive conservative care, and a minority consume high-cost healthcare interventions like surgery. The model could be used to see broad economic effects of different patterns of healthcare provision in sub-groups with LBP and to estimate where it is possible to influence these pathways to increase utility for patients and for society.","[Olafsson, Gylfi; Jonsson, Emma; Borgstrom, Fredrik] Quantify Res, Hantverkargatan 8, SE-11221 Stockholm, Sweden; [Olafsson, Gylfi; Borgstrom, Fredrik] Karolinska Inst, LIME MMC, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fritzell, Peter] Capio St Goran, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fritzell, Peter] Futurum Acad, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Hagg, Olle] Spine Ctr Goteborg, Gothenburg, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; Futurum,"Jonsson, E (通讯作者)，Quantify Res, Hantverkargatan 8, SE-11221 Stockholm, Sweden.",emma.jonsson@quantifyresearch.com,,"Fritzell, Peter/0000-0002-2043-6376",Medtronic,Medtronic(Medtronic),This study was sponsored by Medtronic.,,36,17,19,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This burden is attenuated by successful tobacco cessation, including reduced risk of disease and improved productivity. The current study aimed to show the benefits of smoking cessation for work-place productivity and decreased costs associated with loss of work impairment. Materials and methods: The data source was the 2011 Japan National Health and Wellness Survey (n=30,000). Respondents aged 20-64 were used in the analyses (n=23,738) and were categorized into: current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers. Generalized linear models controlling for demographics and health characteristics examined the relationship of smoking status with the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI-GH) endpoints, as well as estimated indirect costs. Results: Current smokers reported the greatest overall work impairment, including absenteeism (i.e. work time missed) and presenteeism (i.e. impairment while at work); however, after controlling for covariates, there were no significant differences between former smokers and never smokers on overall work impairment. Current smokers and former smokers had greater activity impairment (i.e. impairment in daily activities) than never smokers. Current smokers reported the highest indirect costs (i.e. costs associated with work impairment); however, after controlling for covariates, there were no significant differences between former smokers and never smokers on indirect costs. Limitations and conclusions: Smoking exerts a large health and economic burden; however, smoking cessation attenuates this burden. The current study provides important further evidence of this association, with former smokers appearing statistically indistinguishable from never smokers in terms of work productivity loss and associated indirect costs among a large representative sample of Japanese workers. This report highlights the workplace benefits of smoking cessation across productivity markers and cost-savings.","[Suwa, Kiyomi; Yoshikawa, Reiko] Pfizer Japan Inc, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Flores, Natalia M.] Kantar Hlth, Hlth Outcomes Practice, Foster City, CA USA; [Goto, Rei] Keio Univ, Keio Business Sch, Grad Sch Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Vietri, Jeffrey] Kantar Hlth, Hlth Outcomes Practice, Horsham, PA USA; [Igarashi, Ataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Drug Policy & Management, Tokyo, Japan",Pfizer; Keio University; University of Tokyo,"Suwa, K (通讯作者)，Pfizer Japan Inc, Publ Affairs & Policy, Shibuya Ku, 3-22-7 Yoyogi, Tokyo 1518589, Japan.",kiyomi.suwa@pfizer.com,,"Vietri, Jeffrey/0000-0002-5610-3098; igarashi, ataru/0000-0001-6307-6916",Pfizer Inc.; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03508] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This study was funded by Pfizer Inc.,,43,19,19,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The method decomposes the network into separate intersections and treats each intersection in isolation using an extension of the fixed-cycle traffic-light (FCTL) queue. The network effects are modeled by matching the output process of one intersection with the input process of the next (downstream) intersection. This network analysis provides insight into wave phenomena due to vehicles experiencing progressive cascades of green lights and sheds light on platoon forming in case of imperfections.

In this paper, we systematically investigate the distributed optimal control method framework for automatic train regulation of large-scale complex urban metro networks with the transfer coordination constraints. A dynamic train traffic model of metro networks is elaborately developed in the form of the state space equation. In case frequent disturbances happen, a dynamic optimization problem is developed to minimize the timetable and headway deviations for each line of the metro network under the interaction constraints of different lines on the transfer coordination. By regarding each line as a subsystem of the whole network, the optimization problem is formulated to coordinate a number of subsystems coupled by the state constraints. To satisfy the real-time control requirement, according to the dual decomposition technique, a new distributed optimal control method based on the distributed message passing mechanism is designed, which effectively decomposes the original large-scale problem spatially and temporally into multiple small-scale optimization subproblems that can be computed completely in parallel on a single computing platform to speed up the solution procedure, and thereby reduces the computational burden of centralized implementations for the large-scale urban metro networks. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Vehicles in traffic flow are divided into urgent and gentle categories, and the urgent class has the demand of arriving at destination in time, while the gentle class hasn't. It is assumed that the urgent and gentle classes have the same instantaneous speed to simply the mathematical modeling. To validate the proposed traffic model, a Navier-Stokes like model (Zhang, 2003) is further extended just for validating the present model. Numerical simulations based on the present model are carried out to calculate the travel time on a ring road with total length of 80 km and four initially assumed jams. It was found that similar to the effect of initially assumed jams, the on/off ramp flows play significant roles in the formation and evolution of traffic flow patterns. Urgent density fraction propagates at local traffic speed, its temporal evolution and spatial distribution curves have different shapes as compared with that of traffic density and speed. The average travel time increases monotonically with the increase of ring road initial density. Rational management of road operation is necessary. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This condition affects the food crop production potential of the region. This paper examines farmers' responses to climatic and ecological setbacks to enhance food crop production in the Tolon District of Northern Ghana. The study adopted a mixed method data collection appraoch. First, transect walks were undertaken in selected study communities to observe the agroecological landscapes, major agricultural land use types, dominant cropping patterns, and density of farming across the landscape. Secondly, an on-farm management survey was conducted to obtain information on the existing farm management practices and land preparation methods. Thirdly, Focus group discussions were held to determine the extents of adoption of primary farm management practices. The results revealed that current farming practices often involve the complete removal of organic residue in farmlands. This practice hinders plant nutrient retention and limits the buildup of soil organic carbon critical for food crop production. We also found increased incidence of droughts as a major challenge to farming. To boost food production potential, chemical fertilizer is the most valued soil amendment by farmers in Tolon even the though majority of farmers are unable to apply the recommended fertilizer amounts. The above findings suggest that any attempt to boost crop production and improve agroecological resilience to recent threats such as climate change without consideration of the restoration of agroecological integrity will be less sustainable. Policy makers and development agencies can take advantage of the high utilization of new technologies such as mobile phones and radio in such communities to deliver targeted programs to farmers meant to restore agroecological integrity.","[Antwi, Effah Kwabena] UTIAS, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci IR3S, Tokyo, Japan; [Boakye-Danquah, John] Rivers Forest & Life Fdn RFL, POB 12, Enyiresi Aniynam, Ghana; [Gyekye, Kwabena Awere; Barimah, Alex Owusu; Botchwey, Isaac; Ametepe, Richmond] Univ Ghana, Dept Geog & Resource Dev, Legon, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Antwi, EK (通讯作者)，UTIAS, Integrated Res Syst Sustainabil Sci IR3S, Tokyo, Japan.",effah.can@gmail.com; jdboakye@gmail.com; kgawere@yahoo.com; owusuba@yahoo.com; iyke.botchwey@gmail.com; myjobhene@gmail.com,"Boakye-Danquah, John/E-1452-2019",,,,,,50,2,2,1,7,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",2197-7348,,978-981-10-4796-1; 978-981-10-4794-7,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,,2018,,,,,,,265,289,,10.1007/978-981-10-4796-1_15,0.0,,,25,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Ecology; Environmental Studies; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography,BK9QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444861300015,0

We consider an LMTS with multiple passenger types adults, senior citizens, children, and students. The LMTS designer determines the price for the passengers, last-mile service vehicle capacity, and service fleet size (number of vehicles) for each last-mile region to maximize the social welfare generated by the LMTS. The level of last-mile service (in terms of passenger waiting time) is approximated by using a batch arrival, batch service, multi server queueing model. The LMTS designer's optimal decisions and optimal social welfare are obtained by solving a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Our model is implemented in numerical experiments by using real data from Singapore. We show the optimal annual social welfare gained is large. We also analyze a counterpart LMTS in which the LMTS designer sets an identical price for all passenger types. We find that in the absence of price discounts for special groups of passengers, social welfare undergoes almost no change, but the consumer surplus of passengers in special groups suffers significantly.

Materials and methods: This analysis was conducted using a mixed methods approach combining published literature, publicly available data sources, and administrative data, to first identify the materials required to administer these interventions, and then estimate the cost to the hospital of those materials. Medication costs were estimated primarily using the Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), the cost of reusable equipment was obtained from published sources, and costs for disposable supplies were obtained from the US Government Services Administration (GSA) database. Where uncertainty existed about the technique used when administering these interventions, costs were calculated for multiple scenarios reflecting different assumptions. Results: The total cost of materials (i.e. medications, equipment, and supplies) required to provide post-surgical analgesia was $41.88 for sPNB with bupivacaine; $756.57 for cFNB with ropivacaine; $16.38 for periarticular infiltration with bupivacaine, morphine, methylprednisolone, and cefuroxime; $453.84 for continuous epidural analgesia with fentanyl and ropivacaine; $178.94 for IV PCA with morphine; and $319.00 for BLIS. Limitations: This analysis did not consider the cost of healthcare providers required to administer these interventions. In addition, this analysis focused on the cost of materials and, therefore, did not consider aspects of relative efficacy or safety, or how the choice of intervention for post-surgical analgesia might impact outcomes such as length of stay, re-admissions, discharge status, adverse events, or total hospitalization costs. Conclusions: This study provided an estimate of the costs to hospitals for materials required to administer commonly used interventions for post-surgical analgesia after TKA.","[Corman, Shelby] Pharmerit Int, Bethesda, MD USA; [Shah, Nishant] Midwest Anesthesia Partners, Pk Ridge Anesthesiol Associates, Park Ridge, IL USA; [Dagenais, Simon] Pacira Pharmaceut Inc, Parsippany, NJ USA",Pharmerit North America LLC,"Corman, S (通讯作者)，4350 East West Highway Suite 430, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",scorman@pharmerit.com,,"Dagenais, Simon/0000-0003-3062-9312","Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","This study was sponsored by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,49,11,11,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer after December 1, 2013 were identified from two US claims databases; their characteristics were assessed during the 12 months before diagnosis (index date). Testing modalities were analyzed from the index date to end of continuous health plan enrollment or data availability (December 2015), based on combinations of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) procedure codes. Time to BRAF testing was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Costs were analyzed from a payer's perspective. Results: A total of 28,011 patients newly-diagnosed with lung cancer were identified. Of them, 1,260 (4.5%) were tested for BRAF: 3.2% and 4.2% were tested at 6 and 12 months, respectively, after the index date. Compared to non-tested patients, tested patients were younger (58.3 vs 65.3 years; p < .001), had a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index (2.8 vs 2.9; p = .005), and a higher proportion had metastases (70.9% vs 43.4%; p < .001). In 76.0% of cases, BRAF was tested along with KRAS. BRAF was tested using NGS in 6.6% of cases. The average reimbursed amounts for the 10 most common CPT code combinations were $207-$2,074. Using the average costs of individual mutation tests, the total cost of sequential testing comprising KRAS, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF tests was $3,763 ($464, $696, $1,070, $1,127, and $406, respectively), that of NGS was $2,860. Limitations: Claims data did not include BRAF test results. Conclusions: Among patients newly-diagnosed with lung cancer, 4.5% were tested for BRAF. Tested patients were younger and had a lower comorbidity burden, but more advanced disease. While reimbursed amounts varied greatly based on combinations of testing procedures, NGS testing was associated with cost savings compared to sequential testing of individual mutations.","[Dalal, Anand A.; Mutebi, Alex; Culver, Kenneth W.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Guerin, Annie] Anal Grp Inc, 1000 Gauchetiere Ouest,Suite 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada",Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.,"Guerin, A (通讯作者)，Anal Grp Inc, 1000 Gauchetiere Ouest,Suite 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",annie.guerin@analysisgroup.com,,,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),Funding for this research was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,,25,17,17,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The vaccine has been shown to substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the virus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic burden associated with varicella in Argentina prior to vaccine introduction.Methods: This was a multi-center, retrospective chart review study among patients aged 1-12 years with a primary varicella diagnosis in 2009-2014 in Argentina. Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) associated with varicella and its complications, unit costs, and work loss were used to estimate direct and indirect costs. All costs are presented in 2015 United States dollars (USD).Results: One hundred and fifty children with varicella were included (75 outpatients, 75 inpatients), with a mean age of 3.8 (SD=2.4) and 2.9 (SD=2.2) years, respectively. One or more complications were experienced by 28.0% of outpatients and 98.7% of inpatients, the most common being skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, sepsis, cerebellitis, and febrile seizure. HCRU estimates included use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications (58.7% outpatients, 94.7% inpatients), prescription medications (26.7% outpatients, 77.3% inpatients), tests/procedures (13.3% outpatients, 70.7% inpatients), and consultation with allied health professionals (1.3% outpatients, 32.0% inpatients). The average duration of hospital stay was 4.9 (95% CI=4.2-5.7) days, and the average duration of ICU stay was 4.8 (95% CI=1.6-14.1) days. The total combined direct and indirect cost per varicella case was 2947.7 USD (inpatients) and 322.7 USD (outpatients). The overall annual cost of varicella in Argentina for children aged 14 years in 2015 was estimated at 40,054,378.0 USD.Conclusion: The clinical burden of varicella in Argentina was associated with utilization of significant amounts of healthcare resources, resulting in substantial economic costs. These costs should be reduced with the recent implementation of routine vaccination of children.","[Giglio, Norberto] Hosp Ninos Dr Ricardo Gutierrez, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Monsanto, Homero] Merck Sharp & Dohme IA LLC, Carolina, PR USA; [Rampakakis, Emmanouil] JSS Med Res, St Laurent, PQ, Canada; [Yang, H.

Materials and methods: A best-worst scaling case was used to provide a ranking of 26 HIV/AIDS treatment characteristics that were similar to a previous study conducted in Germany. In each choice task, participants were asked to choose the most important and the least important treatment characteristics from a set of five from the master list. Using the Hierarchical Bayes method, relative importance scores were calculated. Sub-group analyses were conducted according to sex, education, source of infection, symptoms, and age. Results: A total of 195 patients fully completed the questionnaire. The three most important characteristics were drug has very high efficacy (relative importance score [RIS] = 10.1), maximum prolongation of life expectancy (RIS = 9.7), and long duration of efficacy (RIS = 7.4). Sub-group analysis showed only three significant (but minor) differences between older and younger people. Conclusion: This study suggests that treatment characteristics regarding efficacy and prolongation of life are particularly important for patients in Colombia. Further investigation on how patients make trade-offs between these important characteristics and incorporating this information in clinical and policy decision-making would be needed to improve adherence with HIV/AIDS medication.","[Hendriks, A.; Wijnen, B.; van Engelen, R.; Evers, S.

Methods: A structural equation model was built to verify the reliability of the evaluation system. This study utilized the Delphi method to obtain the structure and process index data, and used the WHO/HAI standard method for the effect index data to evaluate the NEMP. Six regions were selected for empirical analysis so that suggestions for optimization could be put forward. Results: The structural equation model consisted of three parts: organization structure, executive process, and effect. The factor loading of the three indicators exceeded 0.5, indicating that this model complied with the preliminary fit criteria. In the organizational structure, rules and regulations and resource investment accounted for a large proportion, indicating that they had a great impact on the effect. As for the executive process, the weight of the seven indicators were similar, and they accounted for a large proportion, indicating that each indicator had a non-negligible impact on the effect. The p of all the three hypothesizes was less than .01, especially the p of hypothesis 3 was less than .001, indicating that the structure and process of NEMP affected the accessibility of the essential medicines, and three components of the model were positively correlated. Limitations: Some errors may exist in achieving appropriate expert selection because of potential researcher bias in the Delphi approach. The results from only six provinces in China may not be generalized nationwide. Conclusion: The structural indicators and process indicators have a significant impact on outcome indicators, and they also have correlations. That is, the formulation and implementation of the national drug policy and related supporting measures play an important role in improving the accessibility of essential medicines.","[Xi, Xiaoyu; Chen, Piaopiao; Yang, Fan; Yang, Yifan; Chen, Lili; Mao, Ningying] China Pharmaceut Univ, Res Ctr Natl Drug Policy & Ecosyst, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China Pharmaceutical University,"Mao, NY (通讯作者)，639 Longmian Rd, Nanjing 211198, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",maoningying@cpu.edu.cn,,,,,,,50,3,3,2,29,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This research introduces a dynamic discrete choice model that takes into account the threat's characteristics and the population's expectation of them. The proposed framework is estimated using Stated Preference (SP) evacuation data collected from Louisiana residents. The results indicate that the proposed dynamic discrete choice model outperforms sequential logit, excels in incorporating demographic information of respondents, a key input in policy evaluation, and yields significantly more accurate predictions of the decision and timing to evacuate.

The bi-modal MFD relates the accumulation of cars and buses and the outflow (or circulating flow) in homogeneous (both in the spatial distribution of congestion and the spatial mode mixture) bi-modal traffic networks. We introduce the composition of traffic in the network as a parameter that affects the shape of the bi-modal MFD. A linear parameter varying model with uncertain parameter the vehicle composition approximates the original nonlinear system of aggregated dynamics when it is near the equilibrium point for single- and multi-region cities governed by bi-modal MFDs. This model aims at designing a robust perimeter and boundary flow controller for single- and multi-region networks that guarantees robust regulation and stability, and thus smooth and efficient operations, given that vehicle composition is a slow time-varying parameter. The control gain of the robust controller is calculated off-line using convex optimisation. To evaluate the proposed scheme, an extensive simulation-based study for single and multi-region networks is carried out. To this end, the heterogeneous network of San Francisco where buses and cars share the same infrastructure is partitioned into two homogeneous regions with different modes of composition. The proposed robust control is compared with an optimised pre-timed signal plan and a single-region perimeter control strategy. Results show that the proposed robust control can significantly: (i) reduce the overall congestion in the network; (ii) improve the traffic performance of buses in terms of travel delays and schedule reliability, and; (iii) avoid queues and gridlocks on critical paths of the network.

A set of representative days of operations are used to estimate the long-term environmental impact.

Conventional discrete choice analysis focuses on riskless prospects and does not deal with the scenario where the alternatives that the decision-makers choose from are associated with risk. In this paper, we investigate decision-makers' risk perception and choice behaviour in choice experiments when they are facing several risky prospects. We propose a broad class of cumulative risky weighting functions, upon which a unified cumulative risky weighting function is developed. We show that this unified cumulative risky weighting function includes several existing cumulative risky weighting functions, as special cases. We then develop a multivariate method for choice analysis with risky prospects to account for decision-makers' individual-specific risk perception and the impact of various factors on the value function respectively. We illustrate the developed method using an empirical study on road tolling in Australia. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One of them is the way priorities of different traffic streams (commodities) are managed. This is particularly challenging when flows are treated as continuous. It is common to consider the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule as a baseline for setting priorities; but most practical continuous flow dynamic models do not satisfy FIFO perfectly. This paper examines the difficulties associated with full adherence to network-wide FIFO. We examine six different ways to represent dynamic flow solutions over a network, and for each representation we discuss whether it is sufficient for verifying FIFO, whether the verification process is finite, and whether proving FIFO can be directly implied. Throughout the evaluation eight alternative definitions of FIFO are considered, seven of them are shown to be essentially equivalent, while the last definition is not, and may therefore be considered as weak FIFO. The most promising representation appears to be the one denoted as cohort bundles,while somewhat more abstract than the other representations, supporting this representation directly shows perfect FIFO satisfaction. Further evaluation of this representation remains a subject for future research. In a nutshell, the key conclusion of this analysis is that in order to satisfy perfect network-wide FIFO the number of discretized elements of flow should probably be allowed to grow quickly and unboundedly with model duration, and it cannot be determined a-priori. These insights about the challenges of incorporating FIFO in continuous flow dynamic models, which may be relevant also for other behavior-based priority rules, can help modelers and practitioners set realistic expectations regarding the level of control over priority rules that can be achieved within finite -dimensional continuous flow dynamic models.

The truck carrier then selects bids and coordinates crowdsources' last-leg delivery (first-leg pickup) with its truck operations. The truck carrier's problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program which simultaneously i) selects crowdsources to complete the last-leg delivery (first-leg pickup) between customers and selected points for crowdsource-truck relay; and ii) determines the relay points and truck routes and schedule. To solve the truck carrier problem, we first decompose the problem into a winner determination problem and a simultaneous pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows, and propose a Tabu Search based algorithm to iteratively solve the two subproblems. Numerical results show that this solution approach is able to yield close-to-optimum solutions with much less time than using off-the-shelf solvers. By adopting this new system, truck vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and total cost can be reduced compared to pure-truck delivery. The advantage of the system over pure-truck delivery is sensitive to factors such as penalty for servicing outside customers' desired time windows, truck unit operating cost, time value of crowdsources, and the crowdsource mode.

Secondly, we extend the theory and model to handle a capacity drop, explicitly looking into the handling of both the onset and release of congestion. The final model is still first-order and suitable for general networks. Numerical examples show that it qualitatively improves on the original model due to uniquely featuring complex traffic patterns including stop-and-go waves, with crisp shockwaves between traffic states, as well as acceleration fans.

Train timetables of connecting lines are adjusted in such a way that train arrivals at transfer stations can be well synchronized. This study particularly focuses on the timetable optimization problem in the transitional period (from peak to off-peak hours or vice versa) during which train headway changes and passenger travel demand varies significantly. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is proposed to generate an optimal train timetable and maximize the transfer synchronization events. Secondly, an efficient hybrid optimization algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization and Simulated Annealing (PSO-SA) is designed to obtain near-optimal solutions in an efficient way. Meanwhile, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results of numerical example solved by PSO-SA are compared with a branch-and-bound method and other heuristic algorithms. Finally, a real-world case study based on the Beijing metro network and travel demand is conducted to validate the proposed timetabling model. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of adjusting train timetables and the applicability of the developed approach to real-world metro networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study estimated the cost-utility of alectinib vs ceritinib from a US payer perspective. Methods A cost-utility model was developed using partition survival methods and three health states: progression-free (PF), post-progression (PP), and death. Survival data were derived from the key clinical trials (alectinib: NP28761 & NP28673, ceritinib: ASCEND I and II). Costs included drugs, adverse events, and supportive care. Utilities were based on trial data and the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. Results Treatment with alectinib vs ceritinib resulted in increases of 2.55 months in the PF state, 0.44 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), and $13,868, yielding a mean cost/QALY of $31,180. In the PSA, alectinib had a 96% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. Drivers of model results were drug costs and utilities in the PF health state. The ICER ranged from $10,600-$65,000 per QALY in scenario analyses, including a sub-group analysis limited to patients with prior chemotherapy and crizotinib treatment. Conclusions Treatment with alectinib in ALK+ crizotinib-treated patients increased time progression-free and QALYs vs ceritinib. The marginal cost increase was driven by longer treatment durations with alectinib. This model demonstrates that alectinib may be considered a cost-effective treatment after progression on crizotinib.","[Carlson, J.

One of the forecasting techniques which has proved successful in prediction is GM(1, N). In order to clarify the interaction mechanism of driving variables and improve the accuracy of the model, a new model which is based on the development trend of multiple driving variables, abbreviated as TMGM (1, N), is proposed. Firstly, a new forecast model of the development trend of the driving variables is established in order to make better use of the interaction mechanism of the driving variables. On the basis of that, the new grey model TMGM (1, N) is constructed. Meanwhile, the solution to the model parameters are derived on the least square method. And the time response formula is solved by the convolution integral to make up the defects of the solving method of traditional model GM(1, N). Finally, a real application about the forecast of the total electricity consumption in Jiangsu Province is used to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the TMGM(1, N) model.

Claims data were used for the analyses of direct and indirect cost and Medical Fee Schedule Table for direct cost. Discrete choice experiments were conducted by web-based survey to determine the intangible costs. Another web-based survey was also conducted on premenopausal breast cancer patients with injections of leuprorelin acetate, to calibrate the results of discrete choice experiments.Results: The medical costs saved for having one less injection in pre-menopausal breast cancer patients with leuprorelin acetate injection were JPY 6,183. The productivity loss saving was JPY 1,419. An estimation of intangible costs saved for having one less injection of leuprorelin acetate was JPY 58,430, which included the disbenefit due to pain (JPY 8,535), injection site reactions (JPY 44,051), waiting time (JPY 9,595), and subtracting value in medical consultation (JPY 3,751). The total cost saved for having one less injection was JPY 66,032.Limitations: The respondents from the internet panel provided by a survey company do not necessarily reflect a population of Japanese society.Conclusions: Leuprorelin acetate 6-month depot demonstrates a higher value than leuprorelin acetate 3-month depot through saving medical costs and loss of productivity, as well as intangible costs saved for having one less injection when treating pre-menopausal breast cancer patients. In the costs for treating with leuprorelin acetate, the percentage of intangible costs might not be negligible. The intangible costs will probably be actively evaluated to proceed to patient-centered healthcare in society.","[Goto, Rei] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Uda, Akihito; Hiroi, Shinzo] Takeda Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Japan Global Med Affairs, Tokyo, Japan; [Iwasaki, Kosuke; Takashima, Kenta] Milliman, Tokyo, Japan; [Kurebayashi, Junichi] Kawasaki Med Sch, Dept Breast & Thyroid Surg, Okayama, Japan",Keio University; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Kawasaki Medical School,"Goto, R (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kohoku Ku, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238526, Japan.",reigoto@kbs.keio.ac.jp,,,Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03508] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.,,12,4,5,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Traffic platooning is an important phenomenon that can substantially increase the capacity of roads. This two-part paper presents a new approach to stochastic dynamic modeling for vehicle platoons. In part I, we develop a vehicle platoon model with two interconnected components: a Markov regime-switching stochastic process that is used to model the dynamic behavior of platoon-to-platoon transitions, and a state space model that is employed to describe individual vehicles' dynamic movements within each vehicle platoon. On the basis of the developed stochastic dynamic model, we then develop an algorithm for online platoon recognition. The proposed stochastic dynamic model for vehicle platoons also provides a new approach to vehicle speed filtering for traffic with a platoon structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The grey probability of state stochastic occurrence and the grey probability matrix of state stochastic transition are defined, then, the grey probability distribution of states at each future time is obtained based on the Markov chain transfer prediction method. Time weights are established by solving the optimization model, which is based on variance and time degree. Afterwards, the dynamic risk decision-making matrix is assembled into a static non-risk decision-making matrix. Finally, by means of constructing the optimal and inferior ideal projects, and based on Deng's grey relational analysis, the relative superior membership degree, which is used to measure the degree of each alternative project belonging to the optimal ideal project, can be figured out to rank the alternative projects.

Few studies have examined the effect of MS on patient outcomes in Japan. The study aim was to quantify MS burden in Japan by comparing MS respondents to matched controls on patient outcomes.Materials and methods: Data from seven administrations of the nationally representative Japan National Health and Wellness Survey (2009-2014 and 2016) were used (n=181,423). Respondents self-reporting MS diagnosis were compared with respondents not reporting MS. Matched controls were selected using propensity scores. Respondents with MS and matched controls were compared on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), work productivity and activity impairment, healthcare resource utilization, and costs. Comparisons were made using Chi-square tests or one-way ANOVAs.Results: A total of 96 respondents with MS and 480 matched controls were included in the analyses. MS respondents reported worse mental (44.35 vs 47.51, p<.05), physical (33.11 vs 49.04, p<.001), and role (37.78 vs 47.11, p<.001) component summary scores (minimally important difference is 3.0). Additionally, MS respondents reported decrements on every health profile sub-scale (p<.001) and 5-Level EuroQoL-5 Dimensions outcome (p<.01). MS respondents also reported more healthcare provider visits (13.78 vs 6.13) and hospitalizations (3.02 vs 0.70; both, p<.001), leading to higher direct costs. For work productivity and activity impairment, MS respondents reported more absenteeism (17.50% vs 5.57%), presenteeism (38.11% vs 21.62%), overall work impairment (46.68% vs 25.27%), and activity impairment (46.88% vs 24.90%, all, p<.001), leading to higher indirect costs.Limitations: Japan NHWS data are cross-sectional, and causal relationships cannot be established. Due to the self-reported nature of the data, responses could not be independently verified.Conclusions: Results suggest MS in Japan is associated with poorer HRQoL and greater work and activity impairment, healthcare resource use, and costs. Improved MS management could benefit both patients and society.","[Nohara, Chiyoko] Tokyo Metropolitan Hlth & Med Treatment Corp, Ebara Hosp, Dept Neurol, Higashiyukigaya 4-5-10, Tokyo 1450065, Japan; [Hase, Masakazu] Biogen Japan Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Liebert, Ryan] Kantar Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Wu, Ning] Biogen, Cambridge, MA USA",Tokyo Metropolitan Health & Medical Treatment Corporation; Biogen,"Nohara, C (通讯作者)，Tokyo Metropolitan Hlth & Med Treatment Corp, Ebara Hosp, Dept Neurol, Higashiyukigaya 4-5-10, Tokyo 1450065, Japan.",chiyoko_nohara@tokyo-hmt.jp,,,Biogen,Biogen(Biogen),This study was funded by Biogen.,,31,8,8,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: This observational, non-interventional cohort study identified patients with MCC that were newly-diagnosed between January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014, and whose data were either in the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) or Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits databases. Standard descriptive statistics were used to describe patient demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and healthcare resource use (HRU) and cost. Results: Following MCC diagnosis, most patients in the study population (n = 2,177) received only surgery (34.5%) or surgery and radiotherapy without chemotherapy (22.0%), while 14.5% of patients received none of these treatments; 27.5% of patients received at least one line of chemotherapy as part of their treatment. Mean total healthcare costs per patient per year (PPPY), as well as mean inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs, were significantly greater for patients who received chemotherapy compared with those who received other or no treatments. Higher HRU and mean costs were associated with increasing patient comorbidity burden, ranging from $62,401 PPPY in Deyo Charlson Comorbidity Index level 1 to $109,690 in level >= 3. Limitations: The study used claims databases that were limited to patients who are covered by large employer-sponsored insurance and/or Medicare and did not provide information regarding the rationale for treatment choice or resource use. Conclusions: The choice of treatment is a major factor in determining healthcare costs associated with MCC, with the highest costs in patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients with MCC often exhibit comorbidities, and both HRU and healthcare costs increase significantly with each comorbidity level.","[Kearney, Mairead; Boutmy, Emmanuelle; Bharmal, Murtuza] Merck KGaA, 250 Frankfurter St, Darmstadt, Germany; [Thokagevistk, Katia] Creat Ceut, Paris, France",Merck KGaA,"Bharmal, M (通讯作者)，Merck KGaA, 250 Frankfurter St, Darmstadt, Germany.",murtuza.bharmal@merckgroup.com,,"Boutmy, Emmanuelle/0000-0001-9657-9376","Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany; Pfizer, New York, NY","Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany; Pfizer, New York, NY(Pfizer)","This study was sponsored by an alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer, New York, NY.

Materials and methods: The cost-effectiveness analysis was developed from a third-party payer perspective in the US and was implemented using a partitioned survival model with health states for first-line treatment (progression-free), disease progression with and without subsequent active treatment, and death. Survival analyses of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC from the PEAK head-to-head clinical trial of panitumumab vs bevacizumab were performed to estimate time in the model health states. Additional data from PEAK informed the amount of each drug consumed, duration of therapy, subsequent therapy use, and toxicities related to mCRC treatment. Literature and US public data sources were used to estimate unit costs associated with treatment and duration of subsequent active therapies. Utility weights were calculated from patient-level data from panitumumab trials in the first-, second-, and third-line settings. A life-time perspective was taken with future costs and outcomes discounted at 3% per annum. Scenario, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Compared with bevacizumab, the use of panitumumab resulted in an incremental cost of US $60,286, and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.445, translating into a cost per QALY gained of US $135,391 in favor of panitumumab. Results were sensitive to wastage and dose rounding assumptions modeled. Limitations: Progression-free and overall survival were extrapolated beyond the follow-up of the primary analysis using fitted parametric curves. Costs and quality of life were estimated from multiple and different data sources. Conclusions: The efficacy of panitumumab in extending progression-free and overall survival and improving quality of life makes it a cost-effective option for first-line treatment of patients with wild-type RAS mCRC compared with bevacizumab.","[Graham, Christopher N.; Knox, Hediyyih N.] RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Christodoulopoulou, Alexandra; Hechmati, Guy; Garawin, Tamer] Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Sabatelli, Lorenzo] Amgen GmbH, Zug, Switzerland; [Strickler, John H.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA",Research Triangle Institute; Amgen; Duke University,"Graham, CN (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",cgraham@rti.org,,"Graham, Christopher/0000-0001-8165-7095; Strickler, John/0000-0001-7579-1175",,,,,38,7,7,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This paper proves uniqueness with a milder condition compared to past studies and shows another counterexample to the uniqueness. A unidirectional network, in which any node on any shortest route has a unique node potential, is introduced. Orders of vehicles are determined by this node potential so that, given any two vehicles passing through the same node, the lower potential vehicle arrives at the node before the higher potential vehicle. It is shown that, for a unidirectional network in equilibrium, the link travel times and traffic volumes of congested links are uniquely determined. Moreover, a simple non unidirectional network having multiple equilibria is introduced. This example exhibits importance of unidirectional-network structure to prove uniqueness.

In this study, we attempt to fill the gap by constructing and solving a unifiable multi commodity kinematic wave model. We first construct commodity speed-density relations based on generic generating functions. Then for two commodities we discuss the properties of the unifiable kinematic wave model and analytically solve the Riemann problem with a combination of total and commodity kinematic waves. We propose a unifiable multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model (CTM) with a general junction model for numerical simulations of network traffic flows, which are unifiable but may violate the FIFO principle. We prove that the CTM is well-defined under an extended CFL (Courant et al., 1928) condition. With examples we verify the consistency between the analytical and numerical solutions and demonstrate the convergence of the CTM. We conclude with several follow-up research directions for unifiable multi-commodity kinematic wave models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, for an airline company, some decisions related to codeshare agreements cannot be standalone decisions that do not interact with the airline's flight operation planning decisions including flight scheduling, fleet assignment, aircraft routing and crew scheduling. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature to introduce the idea of codeshare agreements while integrating it with flight scheduling, fleet assignment and aircraft routing while considering propagated delay, deadhead flights and demand uncertainty in an optimization framework. To achieve this, a two-stage stochastic model that integrates flight scheduling, fleet assignment and aircraft routing was developed. Two column generation-based algorithms were developed to solve this highly complex problem and a sensitivity analysis is performed on some parameters.

We find using suitable transformations that only a single network parameter is required to characterize the DUE solution, the freeway to NMFD capacity ratio. We also show that the stability and convergence properties of this system are captured by the constant demand case, which corresponds to an autonomous dynamical system that admits analytical solutions. This solution is characterized by two critical accumulation values that determine if the steady state is in free-flow or gridlock, depending on the initial accumulation. Additionally, we also propose a continuum approximation to account for the spatial evolution of congestion, by including variable trip length and variable NMFD coverage area in the model. It is found that gridlock cannot happen and that the steady-state solution is independent of surface network parameters. These parameters do affect the rate of convergence to the steady-state solution, but convergence rates appear virtually identical when time is expressed in units of the NMFD free-flow travel time.

One obvious disadvantage of such hierarchical planning process is that it often results in poor coordination between the train schedule and the locomotive schedule. This paper focuses on modeling and solving an integrated train timetabling and locomotive assignment problem. To solve this integrated problem, we first construct a three-dimensional state-space-time network in which a state is used to indicate which train a locomotive is serving. We then formulate the problem as a minimum cost multi-commodity network flow problem with incompatible arcs and integer flow restrictions. We present a Lagrangian relaxation heuristic for solving this network flow problem. We conduct a computational study to test the effectiveness of our Lagrangian relaxation heuristic, compare the performance of our heuristic with that of two benchmark solution methods, and report the benefits obtained by integrating train timetabling and locomotive assignment decisions.

In particular, the road segments and the population points to perform assessment activities on are selected based on the value they add to the consecutive response operations. To this end, we develop a bi-objective mathematical model that provides damage information in the affected region by considering both the importance of population centers and road segments on the transportation network through using aerial and ground vehicles (drones and motorcycles). The first objective aims to maximize the total value added by the assessment of the road segments (arcs) whereas the second maximizes the total profit generated by assessing points of interests (nodes). Bi-objectivity of the problem is studied with the E-constraint method. Since obtaining solutions as fast as possible is crucial in the post-disaster condition, heuristic methods are also proposed. To test the mathematical model and the heuristic methods, a data set belonging to Kartal district of Istanbul is used. Computational experiments demonstrate that the use of drones in post-disaster assessment contributes to the assessment of a larger area due to its angular point of view. Also, the proposed heuristic methods not only can find a high-quality approximation of the Pareto front but also mitigates the solution time difficulties of the mathematical model.

However, the cooperative GPDP may not be accepted by all the partners, as the cost of cooperative GPDP may be higher than that of the non-cooperative minimum cost POP. Therefore, a reasonable compensation mechanism is desired to form an acceptable cooperative GPDP, and a fair method of profit distribution, based on the mechanism, is needed to stabilize the cooperation. In this paper, we analyze the situations in which a compensation is needed and develop the lower bound of the compensation. Further, we propose an exact method to calculate the actual compensation and the profit distribution based on cooperative game theory. The proposed exact method can efficiently solve the largest scale instance in Li & Lim benchmarks, i.e., pdptw1000-LR1_10_1 with 1,054 customers and 19,306 products. The proposed compensation and profit distribution mechanism based on cooperative game theory is also applied to a real-world GPDP and achieve satisfactory performance.

With advances in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, CAV trajectories not only provide more information than existing infrastructure-based detection systems, but also can be controlled to further improve mobility and sustainability. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize vehicle trajectories and traffic signals in a unified framework at isolated signalized intersections in a CAV environment. A new planning horizon strategy is applied to conduct the optimization. All vehicle movements such as left-turning, right turning and through are considered. Phase sequences, green start and duration of each phase, and cycle lengths are optimized together with vehicle lane-changing behaviors and vehicle arrival times for delay minimization. Vehicles are split into platoons and are guaranteed to pass through the intersection at desired speeds and avoid stops at stop bars. Exact vehicle trajectories are determined based on optimized vehicle arrival times. For the trajectory planning of platoon leading vehicles, an optimal control model is implemented to minimize fuel consumption/emission. For following vehicles in a platoon, Newell's car following model is applied. Simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed control method over vehicle-actuated control in terms of intersection capacity, vehicle delays, and CO2 emissions. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to show the potential benefits of a short minimum green duration as well as the impacts of no-changing zones on the optimality of the proposed model.

The EVFS&TP problem aims to maximize the profit of one-way carsharing operators by determining the electric vehicle fleet size, trip pricing, and strategies of vehicle relocation and personnel assignment subject to the elastic demand for the one-way carsharing services. A mixed-integer nonlinear and nonconvex programming model is first built for the EVFS&TP problem. By exploiting the unique structure of the original built model, a mixed-integer convex programming model is subsequently developed.

In such scenarios, assuming that network arcs exist in a finite number of states with different delay functions with different probabilities, a marginal cost pricing scheme that leads to a socially optimal outcome is proposed. The suggested framework makes the behavioral assumption that travelers do not just choose paths but follow routing policies that respond to en route information. Specifically, it is assumed that travelers are fully-rational and that they compute the optimal online shortest path assuming full reset. However, such policies may involve cycling, which is unrealistic in practice.

This potentially induces passengers to book the ticket well in advance in order to obtain a lower fare ticket, and later adjust their ticket when they are sure about trip scheduling. This is especially true in flexible refund markets where ticket cancellation and exchange behavior has been recognized as having major impacts on revenues. In this paper, we propose an inter-temporal choice model of ticket cancellation and exchange for railway passengers where customers are assumed to be forward looking agents. A dynamic discrete choice model (DDCM) is applied to predict the timing in which ticket exchange or cancellation occurs in response to fare and trip schedule uncertainty. The problem is formulated as an optimal stopping problem, and a two steps look-ahead policy is adopted to approximate the dynamic programming problem. The approach is applied to real ticket reservation data for intercity railway trips. Estimations results indicate that the DDCM provides more intuitive results when compared to multinomial logit (MNL) models. In addition, validation results show that DDCM has better prediction capability than MNL. The approach developed here in the context of exchange and refund policies for railway revenue management can be extended and applied to other industries that operate under flexible refund policies.","[Cirillo, Cinzia] Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3250 Kim Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Bastin, Fabian] Univ Montreal, Dept Informat & Rech Operat, Pavillon Andre Aisenstadt, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Hetrakul, Pratt] Lead Mkt Sci Facebook, Bangkok Metropolitan Area, Bangkok, Thailand",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Universite de Montreal; Facebook Inc,"Cirillo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 3250 Kim Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",ccirillo@umd.edu; bastin@iro.umontreal.ca,,"Cirillo, Cinzia/0000-0002-5167-0413",,,,,32,12,14,2,42,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1366-5545,,,TRANSPORT RES E-LOG,Transp.

The additive contributions of nasal polyposis (NP) and revision surgery to 1-year costs were a primary focus. Materials and methods: Adults (aged 18-64 years) undergoing ESS for CRS in 2012-2015 were identified within the Blue Health Intelligence database and used to estimate revision rates. Patients with +/- 1 year of enrollment around the index ESS were used to estimate 1-year healthcare expenditures. Revision ESS rates were evaluated via Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. Disease-related healthcare and pharmacy expenditures were modeled with generalized linear regression to assess the impact of baseline patient characteristics. Results: A total of 86,052 patients underwent ESS for CRS (43.5 +/- 12.4 years; 49.3% male), and a sub-set of 23,542 patients were available for 1-year healthcare expenditure analysis (44.0 +/- 12.1 years; 50.0% male). Revision ESS rates within 1 year were 3.5% in the CRSwNP cohort and 1.6% in the CRSsNP cohort. NP, deviated septum, gender, and region were statistically significant predictors of revision surgery. Mean 1-year treatment expenditures, including the index ESS, were $8,824 for CRSsNP and $11,166 for CRSwNP patients without revision ESS. CRSwNP doubled the risk of revision surgery in the first year after ESS compared with CRSsNP and cost 24% more in the absence of a second procedure. Revision ESS within the first year increased mean 1-year expenditures by $11,150 and $13,139 for CRSsNP and CRSwNP, respectively. Limitations: The primary limitation was the limited length of follow-up available for estimating revision ESS rates. Conclusions: In a large commercially insured US population, disease-related expenditures for patients having ESS for CRS are substantial, as are the additive impacts of NP and revision surgery.","[Hunter, Tina D.] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, Biostat & Hlth Outcomes Res, Covington, LA USA; [DeConde, Adam S.] Univ Calif San Diego, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Manes, R.

Methods: This study developed a decision analytic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of four screening algorithms for the detection of active HCV infections among asymptomatic individuals with an unknown HCV status in a context of high (>5%) HCV prevalence. Three algorithms started with a serological test for antibodies (AB) followed by a nucleic acid test for HCV-RNA (RNA), the HCVAg (AG) assay, or both. An additional single marker screening strategy with AG was added to the analysis. By the example of the Republic of Georgia, strategies were compared in terms of total costs for screening and diagnosis of an active infection from a health system perspective. Results: Replacing RNA with AG for confirmation of positive AB identified fewer active infections (-110 per 100,000 screened subjects) at significantly reduced total costs (-$2.74 per screened) and costs per diagnosed infection (-$44). Adding a subsequent RNA confirmatory test on AG negative results captured at least the same rate compared to the standard (AB followed by RNA) at still reduced costs (-$1.16 per subject screened, -$22 per case detected). Utilizing AG as the frontline test revealed the highest detection rate (97.9%) at the highest costs (+$3.80 per subject, +$323 per case detected vs standard). Conclusion: A combined pattern of HCV AB screening followed by sequential confirmation with AG and RNA on AG negatives would provide equal or better diagnostic performance at lower cost over a broad range of scenarios. Potential long-term consequences of screening strategies to patients and society have to be considered, since the latency period for HCV to develop into severe liver disease is long.","[Juelicher, Paul] Abbott Diagnost, Int Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Med Affairs, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Galli, Claudio] Abbott Diagnost, Med Sci Liaison Europe, Rome, Italy",,"Jülicher, P (通讯作者)，Abbott, Med Affairs, Int Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Max Planck Ring 2, D-65205 Wiesbaden, Germany.",paul.juelicher@abbott.com,"Galli, Claudio/IWM-5402-2023","Julicher, Paul/0000-0002-6606-1020",,,,,42,20,22,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The aim of the present study was to illustrate the use of a rebate table to improve the transparency and utility of published budget impact analyses in the US by modeling ranges of hypothetical rebates for two comparators. Worked examples were conducted to illustrate the budgetary implications of using insulin degludec (IDeg) relative to insulin glargine (IGlar) U100 in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Methods: A short-term (1-year) budget impact model was developed to evaluate the costs of switching to IDeg from IGlar in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes on basal-bolus and basal-only insulin, respectively. The analysis used insulin dose and hypoglycemia data from recent randomized trials, data on the prevalence of diabetes, and estimates of the proportion of patients using each insulin regimen. The model was configured to run multiple rebate scenarios to generate a rebate table in a hypothetical 1 million member commercial plan. Results: Relative to IGlar, IDeg resulted in reductions in non-severe and severe hypoglycemia incidence and costs both in patients with type 1 and patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin acquisition costs were higher, and respective rebates of 7.3% and 10.6% were required for IDeg to break-even with IGlar at the full list price. Incremental per member per month IDeg costs without a rebate were USD 0.04 in type 1 diabetes and USD 0.80 in type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Using IDeg instead of IGlar at list price could result in a modest increase in costs when considering insulin and hypoglycemia costs alone, but modest incremental rebates with IDeg would result in cost neutrality relative to IGlar. In addition, IDeg would result in reduced incidence of severe and non-severe hypoglycemia.","[Lane, Wendy S.] Mt Diabet & Endocrine Ctr, Asheville, NC USA; [Weatherall, James] Novo Nordisk Inc, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Gundgaard, Jens] Novo Nordisk AS, Soborg, Denmark; [Pollock, Richard F.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun, Basel, Switzerland",Novo Nordisk; Novo Nordisk,"Pollock, RF (通讯作者)，Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun GmbH, Baumleingasse 20, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland.",pollock@ossianconsulting.com,,"Pollock, Richard/0000-0002-9873-7507",Novo Nordisk Inc.,Novo Nordisk Inc.(Novo Nordisk),This study was supported by funding from Novo Nordisk Inc.,,32,5,5,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

From a US societal perspective, this analysis models the clinical efficacy and estimates the value-based price (VBP) for erenumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. Methods: A Markov health state transition model was developed to estimate the incremental costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and value-based price range for erenumab in migraine prevention. The model comprises on preventive treatment, off preventive treatment, and death health states across a 10-year time horizon. The evaluation compared erenumab to no preventive treatment in episodic and chronic migraine patients that have failed at least one preventive therapy. Therapeutic benefits are based on estimated changes in monthly migraine days (MMD) from erenumab pivotal clinical trials and a network meta-analysis of migraine studies. Utilities were estimated using previously published mapping algorithms. A VBP analysis was performed to identify maximum erenumab annual prices at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 per QALY. Estimates of VBP under different scenarios such as choice of different comparators, assumptions around inclusion of placebo effect, and exclusion of work productivity losses were also generated. Results: Erenumab resulted in incremental QALYs of 0.185 vs supportive care (SC) and estimated cost offsets due to reduced MMD of $8,482 over 10 years, with an average duration of treatment of 2.01 years. The estimated VBP at WTP thresholds of $100,000-$200,000 for erenumab compared to SC ranged from $14,238-$23,998. VBP estimates including the placebo effect and excluding work productivity ranged from $7,445-$13,809; increasing to $12,151-$18,589 with onabotulinumtoxinA as a comparator in chronic migraine. Conclusion: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC.","[Lipton, Richard B.] Albert Einstein Coll Med, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Van Etten 3C12, Bronx, NY 10461 USA; [Brennan, Alan] Univ Sheffield, ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Palmer, Stephen] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Hatswell, Anthony J.] Delta Hat Ltd, Nottingham, England; [Porter, Joshua K.; Villa, Guillermo] Amgen Europe GmbH, Econ Modeling Ctr Excellence, Global Hlth Econ, Zug, Switzerland; [Sapra, Sandhya; Shah, Neel] Amgen Inc, Global Hlth Econ, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 USA; [Tepper, Stewart] Dartmouth Hitchcock Med Ctr, Geisel Sch Med Dartmouth, Headache Ctr, Dept Neurol, 1 Med Ctr Dr, Lebanon, NH 03766 USA; [Dodick, David] Mayo Clin, Scottsdale, AZ USA",Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; University of Sheffield; University of York - UK; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen; Dartmouth College; Mayo Clinic; Mayo Clinic Phoenix,"Lipton, RB (通讯作者)，Albert Einstein Coll Med, 1300 Morris Pk Ave,Van Etten 3C12, Bronx, NY 10461 USA.",richard.lipton@einstein.yu.edu,"Lipton, Richard B/B-5060-2011; Lipton, Richard Bruce/AAY-2818-2021; Brennan, Alan/B-4459-2009","Brennan, Alan/0000-0002-1025-312X; Hatswell, Anthony/0000-0003-1129-326X",Amgen Inc.,Amgen Inc.(Amgen),The study was funded by Amgen Inc.,,45,36,36,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: The translation process included forward and backward translations, and a linguistic validation. Patients aged 18 years with histological confirmation of cancer, diagnosed with BM, life expectancy 6 months, and fluency in German were eligible for this study (enrolled consecutively in 33 outpatient centers in Germany). Patients were given the German version of BOMET-QoL-10, together with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BM22 questionnaires at inclusion, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after inclusion. A debriefing questionnaire was administered at inclusion to determine patient acceptability and understanding. Results: Data include 364 patients with BM (median age=68 years; females = 71.7%). The BOMET-QoL-10 is brief and clear (median completion time = 5 minutes; >90% of patients completed the questionnaire without assistance). The BOMET-QoL-10 forms only one overall scale.

BOMET-QoL-10 exhibits high internal consistency and reproducibility (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91; intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.76). BOMET-QoL-10 showed significant correlations (range = 0.69-0.79) both with EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BM22 within the functioning (physical, social, interference) and symptom (fatigue, pain) scales, displayed significant sensitivity to change in EORTC QLQ-BM22 scores, and proved the potential ability to detect change in HRQoL in patients with different disease status. Limitations: There was a high proportion of females in this study, which might represent a limitation. Conclusions: The German version of BOMET-QoL-10 is a valid, reliable, brief, and clear instrument able to measure HRQoL in patients with BM.","[Marschner, Norbert] Outpatient Ctr Interdisciplinary Oncol & Hematol, Wirthstr 11c, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Wilke, Jochen] Specialized Med Practice Hematol & Internal Oncol, Furth, Germany; [Reschke, Daniel] Outpatient Ctr Oncol Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany; [Kaiser, Florian] VK&K Studien GbR, Landshut, Germany; [Schmoor, Claudia] Univ Freiburg, Fac Med, Clin Trials Unit, Freiburg, Germany; [Schmoor, Claudia] Univ Freiburg, Med Ctr, Freiburg, Germany; [Grugel, Renate; Boller, Emil] iOMEDICO, Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Freiburg, Germany; [Boller, Emil] CERES GmbH Evaluat & Res, Lorrach, Germany",University of Freiburg; University of Freiburg; iOMEDICO AG,"Marschner, N (通讯作者)，Outpatient Ctr Interdisciplinary Oncol & Hematol, Wirthstr 11c, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",manuskript@onkologie-freiburg.de,,,"Amgen GmbH, Germany","Amgen GmbH, Germany(Amgen)","This project received financial support from Amgen GmbH, Germany.",,35,0,0,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A passenger rail agency negotiates with the host freight railroad to determine train schedules and the associated payment. The objective on the passenger side is to maximize utility, i.e., revenue minus costs of passenger train operations, passenger schedule delay and en-route delay; the freight side minimizes the costs of train departure delay, en-route delay, loss of demand, and track maintenance. Bargaining in both complete and incomplete information settings are considered; the latter arises because the freight railroad may withhold its private cost information. With complete information, we find that the equilibrium payments proposed by the passenger rail agency and the host freight railroad will each be invariant to who initiates the payment bargaining, although the actual payment does depend on who is the initiator. The equilibrium schedule maximizes system welfare. With incomplete information, the passenger rail agency may choose between pooling and separating equilibrium strategies while proposing a payment, depending on its prior belief about the cost type of the freight railroad; whereas the host freight railroad will adopt strategies that do not reveal its cost type. To identify equilibrium schedules, a pooling equilibrium is constructed along with conditions for the existence of equilibrium schedules. We further conduct numerical experiments to obtain additional policy-relevant insights. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

SBT setting has critical impacts on airlines' operating cost and on-time performance. Air carriers regularly update their SBTs to respond to changing operating conditions and evolving business strategies. Most existing studies have focused on investigating the impact of SBT on on-time performance or predicting SBT based on historical performance and market characteristics. However, the dynamics of adjusting SBT, which may allow deeper understanding about the trade-offs airlines make between SBT and on-time performance, have been rarely studied. In this paper, we assume that SBT adjustment choices reveal preferences. Basecton airlines' practice in setting SBT, hypothetical SBT scenarios and their corresponding on-time performance profiles are re-constructed to mimic the situations faced by airline schedulers. This enables us to infer how airlines trade-off between SBT, on-time arrivals, and earliness. By using correlated mixed logit models, we find that our five study airlines are willing to increase SBT from 0.38 to 0.54 min to increase on-time performance by 1%. We also find that both on-time performance and early arrival are valued by airlines, but the former is considerably more valuable. The estimated models can also be used to predict airlines' SBT adjustments in response to changes in operational performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The trip-based approach for a road network defined as a reservoir characterizes the internal traffic states by a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) in speed while individualizing all vehicle travel distances. This paper first investigates distances to park for on-street parking based on real data in Lyon (France) and stochastic numerical experiments. An updated formulation compared to the existing literature is proposed for the relation between such distances and the parking occupancy. This new formulation is then incorporated into an event-based numerical scheme that solves the trip-based MFD model. The complete framework is able to account for different vehicle categories with respect to their parking strategies and to finely tune the related travel distances. Finally, the capabilities of the full framework are illustrated based on three different scenarios. The first two correspond to strategies with static and dynamic (reactive) switch of the demand from on- to off-street parking. While being very classical, they permit to demonstrate that the proposed model reacts as expected in such cases. The third scenario assesses the effect of a smart-parking technology that informs the users when a free parking spot is available on one of the downstream links at each intersection. In such a case, the model permits to estimate the benefit for the equipped users but also the impacts on all other vehicle categories. The three scenarios highlight that the proposed framework is versatile and can quickly provide a first assessment with a low calibration burden of different parking strategies or policies.

We demonstrate that, unlike flow based approaches, our formulation is more easily extended to handle certain families of constraints, such as train unit maintenance restrictions. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked on several real-life instances provided by the suburban railway operator in Copenhagen, DSB S-tog. When used in combination with a lower bound method taken from the literature we show that near-optimal solutions to this rescheduling problem can be found within a few seconds. Furthermore, we show that the proposed methodology can be used, with minor modification, on a tactical planning level, where it produces near optimal rolling stock schedules in minutes of CPU time.

First, interval grey number is applied to represent the performance state as well as the conditional probability, which can avoid the loss of important reliability information. Second, the intervals of reliability characteristic parameters such as fault rate and posterior probability are obtained with Bayesian network inference and grey global optimization algorithm. Afterwards, vulnerable components and probabilities of possible states can be identified by using comparison rules of interval grey numbers, which is conducive to reliability analysis and fault diagnosis of complex system.

Medicaid claims records from 2003-2005 from 42 states and D.C. were linked with county-level data from the Area Resource File and findings from a state Medicaid policy survey. Patient-level fixed-effects regression models examined the impact of increases in generic copayments and generic/brand copayment differentials on monthly use of anti-psychotic (overall and by generic/brand status) and other non-antipsychotic medications. Medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes in sub-groups of patients with these comorbidities were also examined.Results: Prescription copayment changes had a statistically significant but small impact on anti-psychotic use. For instance, for every $1 increase in the minimum or generic copayment per prescription, there was a reduction of 1.4 anti-psychotic drug fills per 100 patient months (relative reduction=1.9%). The generic/brand copayment differential increases also had a minimal impact in changing utilization of first-generation (generic) and second-generation (brand) anti-psychotics. Effects of copayment changes on non-anti-psychotic medication use were substantially higher; for each $1 generic copayment increase, there was a reduction of 23 non-anti-psychotic drug fills per 100 patient months (relative reduction=10.1%). Similarly, for each $1 increase in the generic/brand copayment differential, there was a reduction of 15 non-anti-psychotic drug fills (relative reduction=5.6%). Reductions in the number of prescriptions filled for antidiabetics, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering agents were 4-11-fold higher than corresponding reductions for anti-psychotics.Limitations: Because federal law requires pharmacists to fill medications for Medicaid patients regardless of the ability to pay, these results may under-estimate the true impact of copayment increases.Conclusions: Medicaid prescription copayment increases resulted in only a minimal decline in anti-psychotic medication use, but much larger reductions in use of other medications, particularly cardiometabolic medications.","[Doshi, Jalpa A.; Li, Pengxiang] Univ Penn, Dept Med, Blockley Hall,423 Guardian Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Doshi, Jalpa A.; Li, Pengxiang] Univ Penn, Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Desai, Sunita] NYU, Sch Med, Div Hlth Care Delivery Sci, Dept Populat Hlth, New York, NY USA; [Desai, Sunita] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Marcus, Steven C.] Univ Penn, Sch Social Policy & Practice, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; New York University; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Doshi, JA; Li, PX (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Med, Blockley Hall,423 Guardian Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jdoshi@mail.med.upenn.edu,,,National Institute of Mental Health [R01-MH080976]; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [1-R01-HS018389-01],National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),This study was supported by grant R01-MH080976 from the National Institute of Mental Health and 1-R01-HS018389-01 from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.,,45,9,9,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Materials and methods: An individual patient simulation model was developed that assesses the impact of treatments on disease based on clinical trial data and real-world evidence. Treatment strategies included sequences starting with etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, or abatacept. Each of these treatment strategies was compared with cDMARDs. Incremental cost, incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each treatment sequence relative to cDMARDs. The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was determined using a US willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY. Results: For the base-case scenario, bDMARD treatment sequences were associated with greater treatment benefit (i.e. more QALYs), lower lost productivity costs, and greater treatment-related costs than cDMARDs. The expected ICERs for bDMARD sequences ranged from similar to$126,000 to $140,000 per QALY gained, which is below the US-specific WTP. Alternative scenarios examining the effects of homogeneous patients, dose increases, increased costs of hospitalization for severely physically impaired patients, and a lower baseline Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index score resulted in similar ICERs.

The recent enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act in the United States reduces statutory entry barriers to the discovery, development, testing, and licensing of drugs and medical devices. Drug and device makers also see the burdensome and time-consuming requirements of the Food and Drug Administration's approval process as key barriers to lowering the costs of their products, considering it takes a decade of research amounting to $ 1 billion just to bring a single drug to the market. Along with novel opportunities for medical product innovation and faster treatment of diseases, the expedited approval process carries with it contentious challenges involving the safety, efficacy and value of drugs and devices. The ensuing trade-offs and unintended consequences of such a regulatory game-changer bring to the fore one of the most enduring debates between medicine and economics: Whether -or to what extent -cost and efficiency factors affect clinical inquiry into possible solutions to human illnesses. The practical and theoretical contributions of pharmacoeconomics should enlighten contemporary and future issues and discussions surrounding the implementation of this landmark legislation.
