We use a bivariate probit with sample selection model to account for a potential selection bias that arises because online usage is only observed for Internet users. Our results show that, controlling for income, employment influences online adoption and usage, and we find evidence of a digital divide in adoption and usage by education and age among the labor force. Employed individuals are more likely to have accessed the Internet and used it more frequently than the unemployed and for different activities. However, conditional on adoption, they do not use the Internet for more personal activities. These findings suggest that firms promote and subsidize Internet access, but this sponsored access does not translate into more personal use.","[Campos, Raquel] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Arrazola, Maria; de Hevia, Jose] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fundamentos Anal Econ, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain",University of Kent; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"de Hevia, J (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fundamentos Anal Econ, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",jose.dehevia@urjc.es,"de Hevia, Jose/AAP-8798-2021; Arrazola, María/AAP-8781-2021","de Hevia, Jose/0000-0002-8730-6269; Arrazola, María/0000-0002-4407-9510",,,,,36,7,9,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Given the growing importance of methodological aspects in this discussion, this article addresses the differences of approach to economic theory between the fathers of the two most important strands in post Keynesian economics. We thus focus on Keynes's criticism of Kalecki's theory of the business cycle and the tensions between Keynes's logical approach and Kaleki's formal modeling. We show that in criticizing Kalecki's theory, Keynes made use of the same methodological criticism (based on detecting logical fallacies in reasoning) he had employed to attack both the classical theory and contemporary pseudo-mathematical models. After illustrating these fundamental differences between Keynes and Kalecki about the proper way of doing economics, we draw some conclusions on the possible future evolution of post Keynesian economics.","[Carabelli, Anna Maria] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dipartimento Studi Econ & Impresa, Vercelli, Italy; [Cedrini, Mario Aldo] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Econ & Stat Cognetti Martiis, Turin, Italy",University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; University of Turin,"Carabelli, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dipartimento Studi Econ & Impresa, Vercelli, Italy.",,,"Cedrini, Mario Aldo/0000-0003-1059-4458",,,,,90,5,6,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

It is shown that weakly increasing binary relations on finite lattices fail to disentangle infinite supermodularity from quasisupermodularity and supermodularity. Moreover, for a complete preorder, the mild requirement of strict increasingness is shown to imply the existence of infinitely supermodular representations.","[Chateauneuf, Alain] Paris Sch Econ, IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Chateauneuf, Alain; Vergopoulos, Vassili] Univ Paris 01, Paris, France; [Vergopoulos, Vassili] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Zhang, Jianbo] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",Paris School of Economics; IPAG Business School; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; University of Kansas,,jbzhang@ku.edu,,,"Department of Economics, University of Kansas","Department of Economics, University of Kansas","We would like to thank Bernard Cornet and Bernard Monjardet for helpful discussions and suggestions.

In an optimal control framework, I make the following assumptions: The firm sets the dynamic pricing and product innovation policies; product innovation raises quality, which drives production cost, and consumers are sensitive to price and quality. I derive a rule of price-quality relationship that stresses the influence of quality on price through the effects of cost (positive), sales (negative), and markup (positive). This article shows that, while maximizing profit and despite a quality and cost increases, the firm may decrease product prices because of the possibility of generating more sales as a result of combining better quality with lower price. This sales effect solves the puzzle of a negative price-quality relationship. More generally, the sales effect mitigates the ability of price to convey information about quality.","[Chenavaz, Regis] CNRS, AMSE, KEDGE Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Chenavaz, Regis] EHESS, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13288 Marseille, France",Kedge Business School; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Chenavaz, R (通讯作者)，CNRS, AMSE, KEDGE Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13288 Marseille, France.;Chenavaz, R (通讯作者)，EHESS, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13288 Marseille, France.",regis.chenavaz@kedgebs.com,"Chenavaz, Régis Y./T-1210-2017","Chenavaz, Régis Y./0000-0002-5911-2045",,,,,43,20,21,5,31,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Buying a product with a socially responsible label, and donating to a charity are similarly motivated actions. While there is an extensive literature on the economics of charitable giving that examines motivations to donate as well as on the impacts of labelling on consumer demand, there is little overlap between the two literatures. We bridge these two literatures by investigating whether consumers have heterogeneous motivations for paying a premium. Through a laboratory experiment that auctions coffee with hypothetical socially responsible labels that put different weights on in-kind versus cash transfers, we find that those consumers who prefer an in-kind transfer (paternalistic altruists) are willing to pay a 52.5% price premium over standard coffee. Those who prefer that most of the premium is paid as cash (strong altruists) are willing to pay a 42.5% premium. Finally, those who are indifferent to how the premium is spent by the recipient (warm-glow givers) are willing to pay only a 19.2% premium. We discuss the implications of our results and future research directions.","[Chiu, Leslie J.

Responses to funding liquidity shocks for both banks' lending volumes and loan rates, to households and corporates, are analysed in a panel VAR framework. We thereby distinguish banks by country, extent of Eurosystem borrowing, bank size and capitalization. The results show that shocks in the securities and interbank markets have significant effects on loan rates and credit supply, particularly of banks in stressed countries of the periphery. The results also suggest that central bank liquidity has mitigated this effect on lending volumes. Lending to nonfinancial corporations is more sensitive to wholesale funding shocks than lending to households. Lending volumes of large banks that are typically more dependent on wholesale funding and banks with large exposure to sovereign bonds show stronger responses to wholesale funding shocks.","[de Haan, Leo; van den End, Jan Willem] De Nederlandsche Bank, Econ & Res Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Vermeulen, Philip] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; European Central Bank,"van den End, JW (通讯作者)，De Nederlandsche Bank, Econ & Res Div, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",w.a.van.den.end@dnb.nl,"Vermeulen, Philip/AAE-7596-2020","Vermeulen, Philip/0000-0003-2693-8075; van den End, J.W./0000-0003-3580-5127",,,,,23,9,10,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We include in the relationship the effect of labour market institutions as well as age and gender effects. Our empirical analysis is based on 20 OECD countries over the period 1985-2013. We find that the share of temporary workers (which includes a high and rising share of young workers) played a crucial role in explaining changes in the Okun coefficient (the impact of the output gap on the unemployment rate) over time. The Okun coefficient is not only different for young, prime-age and older workers but also it decreases with age. From a policy perspective, it follows that an increase in economic growth will not only have the desired outcome of reducing the overall unemployment rate but it will also have the distributional effect of lowering youth unemployment.","[Dixon, Robert; van Ours, Jan C.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Lim, G.

This paper establishes procedures that define the conditions under which the database used for scenario analysis in this extended framework assures the existence of an economically feasible solution. We provide a criterion for structural feasibility, the property established by the Hawkins-Simon condition for the basic input-output model, and introduce a criterion for scale feasibility. The logic underlying the tests is illustrated by numerical examples based on the Rectangular Choice-of-Technology model and database. These procedures can be particularly useful for incorporating engineering and other technical sources of information into multi-regional input-output databases; they can also provide substantial underlying detail about individual technologies, sectors, and factors of production for both feasible and infeasible scenarios.","[Duchin, Faye] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA; [Levine, Stephen H.] Tufts Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Tufts University,"Duchin, F (通讯作者)，Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY 12180 USA.",duchin@rpi.edu,,,National Science Foundation [CNH 10-612],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This work was supported by National Science Foundation (Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH 10-612)).,,31,8,9,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We evaluate expanding window, one-step-ahead forecasts indirectly for the G-7 countries on the basis of real GDP growth rate forecasts. We find that correlated innovations affect real GDP growth rate forecasts positively, while allowing for structural breaks works for some countries but not for all. In the face of uncertainty, the evidence supports that in making forecasts of trends and output gap policy-makers should focus on allowing for the correlation of shocks as an order of priority higher than unknown structural breaks.","[Dungey, Mardi; Jacobs, Jan P.

These networks face threats ranging from natural disasters to human attacks. As networks are pervasive, the investments needed to protect them are very large; this motivates the study of targeted defense. What are the key nodes to defend to maximize functionality of the network? What are the incentives of individual nodes to protect themselves in a networked environment and how do these incentives correspond to collective welfare? We first provide a characterization of optimal attack and defense in terms of two classical concepts in graph theory: separators and transversals. This characterization permits a systematic study of the intensity of conflict (the resources spent on attack and defense) and helps us identify a new class of networkswindmill graphsthat minimize conflict. We then study security choices by individual nodes. Our analysis identifies the externalities and shows that the welfare costs of decentralized defense in networks can be very large.","[Dziubinski, Marcin] Warsaw Univ, Inst Informat, Fac Math Informat & Mech, Warsaw, Poland; [Goyal, Sanjeev] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England; [Goyal, Sanjeev] Univ Cambridge, Christs Coll, Cambridge, England",University of Warsaw; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Dziubinski, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ, Inst Informat, Fac Math Informat & Mech, Warsaw, Poland.",m.dziubinski@mimuw.edu.pl; sg472@cam.ac.uk,,"Dziubinski, Marcin/0000-0003-1756-2424",European Research Area Complexity Net; Strategic Resilience of Networks project; European Union from the Regional Development Fund; Keynes Fellowship; Cambridge INET Institute,European Research Area Complexity Net; Strategic Resilience of Networks project; European Union from the Regional Development Fund; Keynes Fellowship; Cambridge INET Institute,"We thank the co-editor and three anonymous referees for comments that have greatly helped improve the exposition of the paper.

To identify time varying lead-lag relationships across various frequencies in economic time series, recent studies have used phase difference on the basis of a continuous wavelet transform. However, the extant literature includes several conflicting interpretations of phase difference. In this study, we extensively discuss wavelet phase difference, determine its most plausible interpretation, and thus attempt to address gaps in the existing literature. Consequently, this study suggests that some lead-lag results of previous works have been driven by incorrect interpretations of wavelet phase difference. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet the body of evidence that has accumulated about the nature of the relationship is equivocal. A commonly identified reason for the diverse and contradictory results is measurement issues pertaining to both concepts of interest. This article aims to review alternative operationalisations and measurement approaches for the CSR and CFP concepts that have been deployed in empirical literature concerned with the CSR-CFP relationship. Several findings emanate from our study. First, CSR operationalisations in empirical literature range from multidimensional to one-dimensional. Second, CSR measurement approaches include reputation indices, content analyses, questionnaire-based surveys and one-dimensional measures, whereas CFP measurement approaches include accounting-based measures, market-based measures and combined measures. Third, no CSR measurement approach is without drawbacks. In addition to approach specific drawbacks, two problems inherent in most approaches are researcher subjectivity and selection bias that may influence the nature of CSR-CFP relationship detected in empirical literature. Finally, potential pathways to remedy these drawbacks are suggested.","[Galant, Adriana] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia; [Cadez, Simon] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula; University of Ljubljana,"Galant, A (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",agalant@unipu.hr,"Cadez, Simon/L-6307-2014; Galant, Adriana/R-9592-2019","Galant, Adriana/0000-0002-0129-8369",,,,,84,174,206,15,84,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The results show that all tax forms have a negative impact on economic growth. Personal income taxes proved to have the highest negative impact on economic growth, followed by corporate income taxes and property taxes, which had the least negative impact.

First, the paper investigates the causes of risk and methods for managing it based on previous studies of trade risk and trade risk management. Second, the paper analyses the types and forms of trade risk for exporting companies and investigate the relationship between actual trade risks and perceptions of trade risk. Third, the paper establishes a measurement device for trade risk management and export performance based on previous studies. Fourth, the paper derives the concepts based on the accumulated details to establish a research model and verifies a cause and effect relationship. Fifth, the paper analyses what kind of effect the perception of trade risk exerts on trade risk management. And sixth, the paper analyses the effect of the method of trade risk management on the export performance of exporting companies to shed light on the utility of trade risk management. Design/methodology/approach - The purpose in this research is to analyse the effects of trade risk management on the export performance of exporting companies. The authors have conducted a review of previous studies about trade risk, trade risk management, and the outcomes thereof. Based on that review, the authors have established a research model, derived hypotheses, and used statistical methods to verify those hypotheses. Findings - First, the authors analysed the methods of settling payments, transaction terms, the transportation environment, and experience in trade claims and found that they influenced the perceived level of trade risk. Second, exporting companies' prior perception of trade risk determines which methods of trade riskmanagement are suitable. Third, the analysis of the methods of trade risk management and export performance found that financial performance was influenced more than non-financial performance by trade risk management. Originality/value - The authors determined whether trade risk management effectively counters the losses incurred as a result of the trade risks faced by exporting countries. The authors used an empirical statistical analysis to comprehensively analyse appropriate trade risk management and export performance.

The absence of risk management at companies and in regional governance aggravate the negative impact of risks on the results of economic development both at the microeconomic and mesoeconomic (regional) levels. A search for ways of economic risk prevention at the corporate level can be considered ineffective if the possibility of overcoming typical risks that pose a threat to many companies and emerge on the regional scale is ignored. Regional risks, including economic, environmental and social ones are a complex phenomenon that requires systematic examination by regional governments. In terms of risk emergence and analysis of the risk system of a regional economy, the management of a complex system of risks can incorporate risks borne by the financial system that forms the backbone of any economic system.

In this review, we build on this with an economic framework that has heterogeneous predictions regarding the potential benefit for children of married parents. We propose that the gains due to marriage from a child's perspective depend on a mother's own level of resources, the additional net resources that her partner brings, and the outcome-specific returns to resources. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics are consistent with the heterogeneous predictions of this framework. In terms of high school completion or avoiding poverty at age 25, the so-called marriage premium for children is highest for children of mothers with high school degrees and mothers in their early to mid-20s. For the more advanced outcomes of college completion or high income at age 25, the marriage premium monotonically increases with observed maternal age and education.","[Kearney, Melissa S.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Levine, Phillip B.] Wellesley Coll, Dept Econ, Wellesley, MA 02481 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Wellesley College,"Kearney, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",kearney@econ.umd.edu; plevine@wellesley.edu,,,"Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,41,10,13,0,4,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4609-6,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

Design/methodology/approach - To analyze the effects of applying alternative discounting method in the cost-benefit analysis, this paper uses the hyperbolic discount method and HM-Treasury's method (Britain), as well as the traditional exponential discount method. Also, this study uses benefit and cost data from the actual feasibility test of the Free Trade Zone development project in Korea, to obtain better policy implication. Findings - For the case of long-term analysis, using the exponential discounting method in the benefit-cost analysis could not give us balanced analytic results, because it discounts too much on future generation's benefits. In contrast, if we use the hyperbolic discounting method, we could obtain better balanced results since it can control the generational effects. This paper also finds that for the results to be valid, the analysis period must be expanded long enough (a minimum of 100 years). Originality/value - The major findings of this paper confirm the results of previous studies regarding long-term benefit-cost analysis. Also, the result of this paper is properly compatible with the findings of behavioral economics, such as the time inconsistency of preferences. However, no research has been done with the proper length of analytic periods for using hyperbolic discounting yet. To examine this matter, this paper performs benefit-cost analysis with actual data from the feasibility studies in Korea. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study to find the proper length of analytic periods that can be compatible with the hyperbolic discount method.","[Kim, Sang Kyum] Dankook Univ, Econ, Yongin, South Korea",Dankook University,"Kim, SK (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Econ, Yongin, South Korea.",iamskkim@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We concentrate on methodological aspects and provide an at-hand comparison of the two approaches. Our main conclusion is that, unlike in the case of DSGE, the development of ABMs is impeded by the lack of a baseline, reference specification. The development of such would result in synergy between the research agendas of individual researchers. However it may be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain one since in the ABM method decision or policy functions constitute degrees of freedom and a reference specification would have to abstract from pinning them down. Therefore, even with such a specification available, it can be impossible to produce a high-level theory stylized predictions, which would be qualitatively robust over the discretionary implementations of particular mechanisms within the model. An issue of whether the assumptions of the DSGE paradigm reflect an optimal trade-off between the robustness of the predictions and the flexibility in the specification remains at this time undecided. We believe this question will be answered when commonly available computational technology will allow for full rationality within the ABM framework, which, in principle, is possible.","[Koloch, Grzegorz; Kaminski, Bogumil; Zbikowski, Mateusz; Antosiewicz, Marek] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Decis Anal & Support, Inst Econometr, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Koloch, G (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Decis Anal & Support, Inst Econometr, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Kamiński, Bogumił/AAF-5417-2020","Kamiński, Bogumił/0000-0002-0678-282X; Koloch, Grzegorz/0000-0001-5506-2864; Antosiewicz, Marek/0000-0003-3035-8591",National Science Centre [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/02120],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",We acknowledge that this research was supported by National Science Centre grant No DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/02120.,,57,1,1,0,3,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

We found out that by applying the first order stochastic dominance we obtain similar results as in the case of 1/n strategy - there is neither significant reduction of the number of preselected stocks nor the difference in return, maximum drawdown or Sharpe ratio. For higher order stochastic dominances there is a significant reduction of preselected stocks quantities and the reduction is greater for larger dataset.

This paper extends tax theory by modeling information reporting as an additional enforcement instrument that allows a tax authority to acquire signals about taxpayers' income. The paper rigorously characterizes the optimal strategy to maximize tax revenue when enforcement resources are limited. It determines the optimal allocation of resources between audits and information reporting, which is governed by how effectively the signals facilitate audit targeting. The model demonstrates that the value of information repotting declines with audit coverage because of the corresponding decline in the value of audit targeting. The optimal level of information reporting is an inverse U-shaped function of the budget allocated to enforcement, while the optimal audit coverage always increases with the budget. This finding implies that at some point it may not be optimal to expand information reporting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

By conducting a comprehensive investigation of the effects of shocks to liquidity constraints on the firm's optimal investment, financing and dividend policies, our model highlights the importance of liquidity management and extends the liquidity management approach to hedge liquidity default risk. We find that being concerned about liquidity default risk will significantly change a firm's behaviours, including those related to investment and the optimal capital structure. A firm that is concerned about its liquidity default risk will become more cautious: it will choose to delay investment and have higher leverage when internal liquidity is very low, but choose earlier investment and lower leverage when liquidity is high enough. The dividends policy can alleviate risks from both the external market and internal project volatility and provides an alternative explanation for the 'smooth dividends policy puzzle' commonly reported in empirical research.","[Liu, Bo] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Xu, Qing; Zhang, Shunchen] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jinqiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai Key Lab Financial Informat Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, B (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.;Xu, Q; Zhang, SC (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.;Yang, JQ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Shanghai Key Lab Financial Informat Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",Liub@uestc.edu.cn; xuqing1228@163.com; yang.jinqiang@mail.shufe.edu.cn; zhangshunchen2013@163.com,"zhang, xueying/JMB-7808-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373036, 71573033]; Science and Technology Support Program of Sichuan Province [2013GZ0116]; Postgraduate Students Innovation Foundation of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [CXJJ-2013-325, CXJJ-2014-308]; Natural Science Foundation of China [71202007, 71522008]; Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [2016110241]; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China [151086]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Support Program of Sichuan Province; Postgraduate Students Innovation Foundation of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovative Research Team of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China,"Bo Liu acknowledges the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [#71373036] and [#71573033] and the Science and Technology Support Program of Sichuan Province [#2013GZ0116].

The existence of a significant tail interdependence implies that investors are unable to hedge the risk across the real-estate and stock markets when they are extremely volatile. Therefore, when there exist extreme returns between the two markets in the PIGS countries, both continuous negative impacts imply that instability in the real-estate market drives instability in the stock market and vice versa.

The main goal of the present study is to test the presence of a non-linear - Armey Curve type - relationship between the government size and economic growth and also to find an optimal level of public spending which maximizes economic growth. Our results reveal the occurrence of a significant cointegration of public spending and economic growth for all considered countries and show that the current share of public spending within the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exceeds the optimal level calculated for the three countries for which the Armey-type phenomenon occurs. Also, the results suggest that the optimal percentage of governmental spending varies between 37 % and 41 % and the present level is higher than the optimal level for Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. The outstripping of the optimal level may conclude to the idea that the weight of public sector should be slightly decreased in these countries since the public sector is not able to efficiently cope with its resources. Based on the study results, the weight of public expenditure should be reduced while the efficiency of public spending programs should be increased.","[Lupu, Dan; Asandului, Mircea] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Carol I 22, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Lupu, D (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Carol I 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",danlupu20052000@yahoo.com; asmircea@yahoo.com,"Asandului, Mircea/A-2845-2017; Lupu, Dan/K-1608-2018; Lupu, Dan/ABG-6418-2021","Lupu, Dan/0000-0003-1626-2059","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0291]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0291.",,39,11,12,1,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

First, Islamic equity investors naively chasing recently highly performing funds only incidentally benefit from mutual fund momentum strategies. Second, fund managers may be able to benefit from a contrary dumb money' effect found among Islamic equity fund investors in that they appear most concerned with only very poor performance in determining the flow of funds.

First, it compares the various types of information asymmetries resulting from the production, allocation, and utilization of health insurance. Second, it reviews the literature on adverse selection, moral hazard, and risk mitigation against which salient ACA reforms are analyzed. In contrasting conventional moral hazard from an alternative theory of welfare maximization, it suggests that healthcare (over)utilization cannot necessarily be considered wasteful, even if it ends up costing insurers more on a short-term basis. Costs and savings attributable to healthcare spending under the ACA will vary between the consumer, insurer, and regulator-subsidizer. Despite the ambiguities surrounding definitions of health, the challenge of containing inefficient moral hazard, and encouraging its desirable counterpart, lies in the tradeoffs that arise between consumer access to affordable and quality healthcare and the market competitiveness of health insurers. The new Trump administration will have to address these tradeoffs in repealing and replacing the ACA, particularly in light of escalating insurance premiums and deductibles, narrower provider networks, and technical implementation issues.","[Mendoza, Roger Lee] Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, Business, New Castle, DE 19720 USA",Wilmington University,"Mendoza, RL (通讯作者)，Wilmington Univ, Sch Business, Business, New Castle, DE 19720 USA.",,"Mendoza, Roger Lee/AAX-2110-2020",,,,,,64,2,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Simultaneously, innovation and its constituent elements allow increasing growth in a sustainable way. This paper analyses the impact of the most important constituent elements of innovation found in literature on immigration of highly skilled workers. In order to do that, we performed a cluster analysis of 182 countries (OECD and non-OECD members), which are net exporters of highly skilled immigrants, and 25 receiving countries members of the OECD. It includes a detailed discussion of results by world regions including examples of specific programmes and policies for each variable of the study. Overall, our results confirm that the attraction of international talent is related to both the constituent elements of innovation and the level of economic growth. In this regard, countries like the U.S., Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom are among the main destinations of highly skilled immigrants of any region of origin due to the implementation of policies that favor the development of innovation. However, access restrictions for highly skilled workers would limit the effects of those policies. Therefore, in the design of strategies for attracting talent, the qualification of such workers should take precedence over their country of origin, thus encouraging greater innovation activities among those highly skilled immigrants.","[Miranda-Martel, Maria Jose; Arteaga-Ortiz, Jesus] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Campus Tafira,Edificio Dept Empresariales, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain; [Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Granada Univ, Campus Cartuja, Granada 18071, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; University of Granada,"Miranda-Martel, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Campus Tafira,Edificio Dept Empresariales, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",mariajose.miranda@ulpgc.es; amihi@ugr.es; jesus.arteaga@ulpgc.es,"García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021; Miranda-Martel, Maria Jose/N-4293-2017; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906; Miranda-Martel, Maria Jose/0000-0001-5661-9935",,,,,51,2,2,0,38,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Understanding the role of the investment climate in generating firm productivity has received extensive attention by policymakers and economists in many countries. The article studies the effect of different dimensions of the investment climate on firm productivity. Using a large dataset of Vietnamese manufacturing firms, the article finds that deficiencies in the investment climate are prejudicial to firm productivity and competition. Furthermore, in examining the effect of corruption in association with the quality of the business environment, the study also investigates the possibility that corruption may compensate firms for a bad investment climate or at least may neutralize the negative impact of inefficient government regulations. In other words, corruption acts as speed money' to improve the efficacy of the provision of public services or provides leeway for entrepreneurs to bypass the inefficient regulations. This situation, however, is extremely harmful to the economy in the long run because it distorts the market and erodes the incentives for productive investments. Developing countries therefore need to put much more effort into institutional reforms, especially fighting corruption and efficiency in the provision of public goods and services.","[Nguyen Ba Trung] Univ Da Nang, Dept Econ, 704 Phan Dinh Phung, Kon Tum City 580000, Vietnam; [Kaizoji, Taise] Int Christian Univ, Grad Sch Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan",University of Danang; International Christian University,"Trung, NB (通讯作者)，Univ Da Nang, Dept Econ, 704 Phan Dinh Phung, Kon Tum City 580000, Vietnam.",trungnguyenudn@gmail.com,"Nguyen, Trung/ABC-1147-2020","Nguyen, Trung/0000-0001-9962-6676","JSPS KAKENHI [2538404, 2628089]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K01270] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 2538404, 2628089.",,59,8,8,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Since then, China has registered an increase in the reception of material flows that are extracted in other parts of the world. This dynamic is evident since the 1990s, when the behaviour of the Chinese economy, in terms of its metabolism, started to resemble that of the countries from the centre of the economic system, as it became a net material importer. All of this, linked to its demographic dynamics, presents some unsustainable trends that seem to endure at the expense of the sustainability of other territories. In this paper we present an analysis of the metabolism of the Chinese economy by pursuing a dual purpose: on the one hand, to corroborate the evolution of the Chinese economic structure from a productive to an acquisitive model in physical terms; on the other, to ascertain the effects that economic activity has on the environment.","[Perez Laguela, Elena] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Lagüela, EP (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",eplaguela@ucm.es,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,3,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

This paper describes recent efforts at SIPRI that have succeeded in extending these consistent series for most countries back to at least the 1960s, and in some cases to 1949. It describes the underlying difficulties involved in collecting military expenditure data and ensuring consistent series, the sources used in the reconstruction of the long data-set, the methodological choices made, and the results of the exercise. Overall, consistent constant price data series have been extended back as far as 1957 for half of the countries covered by the SIPRI database that existed at the time. Europe and the Americas generally have the best data coverage. One of the biggest problems with the extended data-set is the extensive use of estimates to splice together overlapping, but disagreeing series for the same country, adjusting the older series upwards or downwards by an appropriate ratio to give greater consistency with the later series. A number of case studies are investigated where parallel series exist for countries, suggesting that this approach may in some cases involve significant margins for error.","[Perlo-Freeman, Sam] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, SIPRI, Stockholm, Sweden; [Perlo-Freeman, Sam] Tufts Univ, World Peace Fdn, Fletcher Sch, Boston, MA 02111 USA",Tufts University,"Perlo-Freeman, S (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, SIPRI, Stockholm, Sweden.;Perlo-Freeman, S (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, World Peace Fdn, Fletcher Sch, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",Samuel.Perlo_Freeman@tufts.edu,,,,,,,8,11,12,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

However, most countries are failing in their innovative activities, and their innovative performance is below that of the EU average. Therefore, the European Commission annually publishes its Innovation Union Scoreboard, which provides a comparative assessment of the EU member states' research and innovation performance. The countries are divided into four groups according to their innovation performance: innovation leaders, strong innovators, moderate innovators, and modest innovators. In this paper, we have selected countries whose innovation performance was close to, below, or well below that of the EU average in 2015, and we have performed microeconomic analysis of the situation in these countries' firms to analyse the conditions of their innovation environment and uncover barriers to their innovation activities. We analysed firms in the manufacturing industries in Slovenia (a strong innovator), Croatia (a moderate innovator), and Romania (a modest innovator) by using original multiple regression models and data from the 2010-2012 Community Innovation Survey. The results demonstrate the different backgrounds for innovation in each country. In Romania, there is a lack of both a satisfactory environment for innovation and sufficient capacity for absorbing public funds; investment into innovation-related activities is also absent. In Croatia, the innovation potential has not been fully exploited. However, we show that the appropriate targeting of innovation determinants (e.g., collaboration with different partners or public financing) could lead to the creation of synergies and spillover effects that would be able to support their innovative activities and strengthen the country's competitiveness. There is a completely different situation in Slovenia. Firms there effectively utilize the various determinants of innovation activities, and these determinants have strong influence when utilized on their own. On the other hand, results also show that certain significant combinations of determinants of innovation activities are missing in Slovenia. In conclusion, we have proposed practical implications for policy makers that would be able to support innovative activities and help each country to improve its innovation ranking.","[Prokop, Viktor; Stejskal, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, CZ-53210 Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Prokop, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, CZ-53210 Pardubice, Czech Republic.",viktor.prokop@upce.cz; jan.stejskal@upce.cz,"Prokop, Viktor/ABG-1835-2022; Stejskal, Jan/S-7591-2017","Stejskal, Jan/0000-0003-3015-8274; Prokop, Viktor/0000-0001-6313-395X",,,,,56,43,43,0,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using commercial buildings in the state of New York, multinomial logit and nested logit models demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between the characteristics of commercial buildings (such as square footage, lot size, and years built) and green certification. More interestingly, if a commercial building is occupied by its owner, likelihood of green certification is actually smaller. This finding not only confirms that ongoing energy savings are heavily discounted when deciding whether to incur the upfront cost of green certification, but also suggests that the rental premium enjoyed by green buildings is likely greater in terms of present value than the expected operating cost savings. Another explanation could be that investor owners must operate in a competitive market for tenants while owner-occupiers do not operate in that competitive market, so they do not need to obtain green certificates to attract tenants. Consequently for policymakers, building owners that plan to rent out their commercial property space should be the early targets to promote green certification.","[Qiu, Yueming (Lucy)] Arizona State Univ, Technol Entrepreneurship & Management Program, Sutton Hall 340M,6049 S Backus Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Su, Xin] Remin Univ China, Dept Enterprise Management, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yi David] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Banking & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",Arizona State University; Renmin University of China; University of International Business & Economics,"Qiu, YM (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Technol Entrepreneurship & Management Program, Sutton Hall 340M,6049 S Backus Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",yueming.qiu@asu.edu,"Su, Xin/GMX-2317-2022; Su, Xin/HMP-0471-2023","Su, Xin/0000-0003-3425-9734; Su, Xin/0000-0003-3425-9734","Arizona State University; National Science Foundation [1509077]; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1509077] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Arizona State University; National Science Foundation; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))",This work was supported by the Arizona State University; National Science Foundation: [Grant Number 1509077].,,35,12,13,5,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It develops a general equilibrium trade model with one of two countries having a comparative advantage in a sector whose production is characterized by (i) rapid, anticipated demand growth and (ii) large upfront R & D costs. International funding of the accruing R &D costs generates capital inflows in the R&D stage, which are balanced by subsequent outflows. Importantly, sector-level growth does not generate growth differentials between countries, typically regarded as rationales of global imbalances. Additionally, it is shown that a trade surplus can coincide with appreciations of the real exchange rate. I argue that Switzerland's trade surplus, which was driven to record heights during 2010-2014 by pharmaceutical exports, exemplifies this mechanism. Calibrating the model to Swiss trade flows underpins this argument.","[Saure, Philip] Swiss Natl Bank, Int Policy Anal, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB),"Sauré, P (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Int Policy Anal, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Saure, Philip/0000-0002-9923-2965",,,,,58,2,2,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

Its key elements are downward nominal wage rigidity, a Taylor-type interest rate feedback rule, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and a confidence shock. Absent a change in policy, the model predicts that low inflation and high unemployment become chronic. With capital accumulation, the model predicts, in addition, an investment slump. The paper identifies a New Fisherian effect, whereby raising the nominal interest rate to its intended target for an extended period of time can boost inflationary expectations and thereby foster employment.","[Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie; Uribe, Martin] Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie] CEPR, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Schmitt-Grohe, Stephanie; Uribe, Martin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Columbia University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Schmitt-Grohé, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Econ, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Schmitt-Grohé, S (通讯作者)，CEPR, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Schmitt-Grohé, S (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ss3501@columbia.edu; martin.uribe@columbia.edu,,,,,,,20,64,73,0,13,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

Their recruitment strategies affect not only the hiring rate but also job destruction rate as more interviews increase the chances of finding the right worker for the job; a link mostly overlooked in the literature. I model this recruitment behavior and investigate the effects of labor market policies on unemployment. These policies change the value of hiring the right worker, altering firms' incentives to conduct interviews. Policies further affect job creation and destruction when firms adapt their recruitment strategies. Net effect of a policy on unemployment depends on the magnitude of change in job creation versus destruction. Qualitative analysis reveals that the effect of a policy on unemployment is mostly weakened with the introduction of firms' recruitment behavior to the model. Firing taxes still increase unemployment, albeit at a lower rate. The effect of hiring subsidies on unemployment is even reversed: Unemployment increases with hiring subsidies if firms adapt. Minimum wage and unemployment insurance policies are also analyzed.","[Sengul, Gonul] Istanbul Sch Cent Banking, Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Atlihan Sokak 30, TR-34726 Istanbul, Turkey",Ministry of National Education - Turkey,"Sengul, G (通讯作者)，Istanbul Sch Cent Banking, Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Atlihan Sokak 30, TR-34726 Istanbul, Turkey.",Gonul.Sengul@tcmb.gov.tr,"Sengul, Gonul/AAD-6858-2019","Sengul, Gonul/0000-0002-0872-9459",,,,,39,3,4,0,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Lobbying regulations in the US and at the EU level and their development are subsequently discussed in more detail. Second, the paper asks whether a common definition of lobbying may be found and what is its value for academic research. Third, anti-corruption legislation in European countries is subjected to comparative analysis with the aim to find links between legal regulations and transparent lobbying. The core of the paper features a juxtaposition of corruption levels and adopted legal regulations. The cases of France, Estonia, Poland, and Latvia are highlighted as different approaches that are supposed to achieve the same goal. Finally, the results of the analysis indicate that there indeed may be a common core of lobbying regulations which improves the quality of the anti-corruption legal framework at the national level; however, the significance of details of such regulations and their complementarity cannot be overstated. To develop these standards further and offer them to real-world practitioners should be the next step in this research agenda.","[Simral, Vit] Univ Hradec Kralove, Philosoph Fac, Dept Polit Sci, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Simral, V (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Philosoph Fac, Dept Polit Sci, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.",vit.simral@uhk.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,456,465,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500051,0

An important lesson from the crisis has been that price stability is not a sufficient condition for financial stability, so an operational framework for financial stability is being sought. Mainstream macroeconomic policy has chosen the option of creating a new economic policy toolkit of macroprudential measures.

Extracurricular activities were such as participation of students in the faculty competitions, Slovak competitions for students, international competitions for students and taking some of the first three or five places, Student personality of the year and participation in a special programme aimed at talented students. The research was conducted in Slovakia on a sample of university students. Personality traits were measured using Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10). While previous studies, which were focused predominantly on grades, found a positive link to conscientiousness, the findings of this research are that success in extracurricular activities is positively linked to openness to experience. Students with a high degree of openness to experience are curious, broad in interests and more open to experience extraordinary activities. This fact seems to be more important to success in various competitions than conscientiousness that influences the grades.","[Sudzina, Frantisek] Aalborg Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Business & Management, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Olexova, Cecilia] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ, Dept Management, Tajovskeho 13, Kosice 04031, Slovakia",Aalborg University; University of Presov; University of Economics Bratislava,"Sudzina, F (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Business & Management, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen, Denmark.",sudzina@business.aau.dk; cecilia.olexova@euke.sk,"Olexova, Cecilia/AAE-7849-2020","Olexova, Cecilia/0000-0003-2154-9564",,,,,16,0,0,0,11,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,145,152,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500016,0

Under this framework to complement Cruz Ake's (2017) work, we perform a traditional cointegration analysis to assess the impact of the long -run components of the biofuel demand. We find a significative statistical consistency in the three cointegration equations from a six-equation system. Moreover, we find two volatility regimes of the biofuel consumption, wich is also consistent with the empirical evidence from Cruz Ake's (2017) paper. Although Cruz Ake (2017) contributes to the current discussion on the subject matter, it remains to consider, more carefully, other essential issues that invitied us to a deeper academic debate: 1) the distribution of innovations that drives the biofuel consumption and its price may not be Student's t nor a Generalize Extreme Value (GEv) distribution; 2) the stochastic process that guides the biofuels consumption and its price may not be stable over time, and 3) the cointegration analysis may be done by assuming fractional cointegration. Finally, it is worth noticing that Cruz Ake's (2017) paper may be extended in different ways such as: 1) the long-run sustainability of the biofuels consumption; 2) the effect of the agricultural foods and fuel prices volatilities on the economic welfare, and 3) the effect of changes in agricultural foods and energy prices on poor people. Needless to say, all the above stated points encourage to a wider and deeper debate.","[Venegas Martinez, Francisco] IPN, Escuela Super Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ortiz Arango, Francisco] Univ Panamericana, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresari, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico,"Martínez, FV (通讯作者)，IPN, Escuela Super Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",fvenegas1111@yahoo.com.mx,"ARANGO, FRANCISCO ORTIZ/H-6543-2017; Venegas-Martínez, Francisco/AAH-2212-2021","ARANGO, FRANCISCO ORTIZ/0000-0003-2707-4459; Venegas-Martínez, Francisco/0000-0003-1157-0298",,,,,14,0,0,1,7,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

As a result of processing quantitative data, we have found out that the respondents prioritize general cultural and personal mental and psychological factors in formation of youth's attitude to parenting.

We argue that the previous exclusion of inequality explains part of this puzzle. We model current investment as a function of investors' beliefs about future tax rates, which are conditioned by the constraints on the Executive in setting tax rates and expropriating tax revenues. In democracies, where tax rates reflect the preferences of the median voter, investment declines with rising inequality. In autocracies, investor beliefs about future tax rates reflect the relative power of Elites compared to the Executive. As inequality rises, the increased resources available to Elites constrains the Executive's ability to expropriate more tax revenues. The heterogeneous determinants of investor beliefs can explain the observed pattern of investment across regime types. We first test our predictions at the macro-level with cross-country data. We then test the behavioral underpinnings of our model with a novel laboratory experiment showing how inequality affects individual-level investment behavior dependent upon regime type. Results from both types of analyses show that when inequality is taken into account autocracies can generate similar levels of investment to democracies.","[Akoz, Kemal Kivanc; Jensen, Jeffrey] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, POB 903, New York, NY 10276 USA; [Barber, Benjamin] IE Business Sch, Alvarez Baena 4, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Zenker, Christina] Zayed Univ, POB 144534, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",IE University; Zayed University,"Barber, B (通讯作者)，IE Business Sch, Alvarez Baena 4, Madrid 28006, Spain.",kka227@nyu.edu; benjamin.barber@ie.edu; jeffrey.jensen@nyu.edu; christina.zenker@zu.ac.ae,"Benjamin, Barber/M-1083-2016; Akoz, Kemal Kivanc/AAG-1125-2019","Barber IV, Benjamin/0000-0001-6388-1464",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) [ECO2016-77205-P],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),Research Reported in this paper was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Grant no.

Second, there is no long-run trade-off between the deviation of unemployment from the natural rate and inflation. Both propositions have been challenged. The paper reviews the arguments and the macro and micro evidence against each. It concludes that, in each case, the evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive.

Before students arrived on campus, we randomly assigned them to all-female, all-male, and coed classes, and thereby avoid the selection issues present in earlier studies on single-sex education of students in primary and secondary school. We find that 1 h a week of single-sex classes benefits women: females score a quarter of standard deviation better overall and are 7.7% more likely to pass their first year course. Furthermore, women assigned to all-females classes in their first year are roughly 57% less likely to drop out of university and are 61% more likely to get a top ranked degree under the UK system. There is evidence that single-sex classes cause women to adopt behaviors associated with better academic outcomes, such as attending more classes and doing optional assignments. However, these behavioral changes cannot explain much of the all-female effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, examined is the role of a distinctive type of diasporic organization that positions itself as an intermediary facilitating young diasporic Armenians' travel to and volunteering in the country that is promoted as their ancestral homeland. The organizations in question display some ambivalence towards engaging with the Armenian state itself, largely bypassing the latter's political and bureaucratic structures. Rather, these organizations operate in a grey zone, an intermediate area between state actors, international organizations, and local community agencies, offering a model of decentralized transnational activism. Using three distinct examples of organizations of this type, the article shows that, while promoting broadly similar types of activity, these organizations create a diversity of ideological frameworks of diasporic mobilization and constructions of the homeland. The article, furthermore, contrasts these with the Armenian state's own modes of rooting the diaspora. The article concludes that the politics of rooting through transnational engagement between Armenian diasporic communities and the Republic of Armenia is likely to remain plural and decentralized, given the disparate nature of the Armenian diaspora as well as the relative weakness of the Armenian state.","[Darieva, Tsypylma] Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOIS Berlin, Berlin, Germany",,"Darieva, T (通讯作者)，Ctr East European & Int Studies ZOIS Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",tsypylma.darieva@zois-berlin.de,,,,,,,55,0,0,0,3,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

The test is given by the ratio, lambda, of the unconditional to the conditional correlation coefficient between markets. We demonstrate analytically that the test statistic is robust to heteroscedasticity due to conditional market volatility, to the impact of omitted variables (particularly important in the event that shocks may be transmitted between any two markets via a third 'intermediate' market) and to the impact of endogeneity between markets. Size and power characteristics of the test are strong. An application to the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998, the subprime crisis of 2007 and the European crisis of 2009 demonstrates its empirical tractability.

It adds to existing research on national movie markets, by highlighting the relevance of differences in culture, institutions, language, and consumption habits for movie success. Three groups of success factors are distinguished: distribution related (e.g. budget, franchise), brand and star effects (e.g. top actors or directors), and evaluation sources (e.g. critics and audience rating). We add novel region-specific variables like seasonality, time span between the world and local release, attendance of international stars at Russian movie premieres, and title adaptation to Russian culture. The results indicate that budget, franchise, employment of popular actors and directors, electronic word of mouth and audience ratings exert a significantly positive influence on Russian box office success. However, we find significantly negative effects for international critics and, interestingly, the adaption of movie titles. The main contributions of our study are (i) success factors vary between countries with different cultures, (ii) region-specific factors matter, and consequently (iii) results from one market (e.g. the US) cannot easily be generalised.","[Gaenssle, Sophia; Budzinski, Oliver] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Inst Econ, Ilmenau, Germany; [Budzinski, Oliver] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Inst Media & Mobile Commun, Ilmenau, Germany; [Astakhova, Daria] CROSSMEDIA GmbH, Dusseldorf, Germany",Technische Universitat Ilmenau; Technische Universitat Ilmenau,"Gaenssle, S (通讯作者)，Ilmenau Univ Technol, Inst Econ, Ilmenau, Germany.",sophia.gaenssle@tu-ilmenau.de,"Gaenssle, Sophia/AAA-2838-2021","Gaenssle, Sophia/0000-0003-1283-3862",,,,,64,11,11,3,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

We examine a Neo-Classical economy and provide the conditions for policy arrangements to successfully stabilize the economy when agents have either rational or adaptive expectations. For a contemporaneous-data monetary policy rule, the monetarist solution is unique and stationary under a passive fiscal/active monetary policy regime if monetary policy appropriately incorporates expectational heterogeneity. In contrast, the active fiscal/passive monetary policy regime's fiscalist solution is prone to explosiveness due to empirically plausible expectational heterogeneity. Nevertheless, this can be a well-defined, rather orthodox equilibrium. For operational monetary policy rules, only the results for the fiscalist solution prevail.

Using a Bayesian VAR, we investigate the macroeconomic impact of shocks to asset purchase announcements and assess changes in their effectiveness based on sub-sample analysis. The results suggest that the early asset purchase programmes had significant positive macroeconomic effects, while those of the subsequent ones were weaker and in part not significantly different from zero. The reduced effectiveness seems to reflect in part better anticipation of asset purchase programmes over time, since we find significant positive macroeconomic effects when we consider shocks to survey expectations of the Federal Reserve's last asset purchase programme.

This is a crucial question for those who think about the sources of economic growth and especially for those who think about policies and institutions to promote innovation. The answer lies in part with the structure of the existing system of production and the array of assets that an innovation would displace, especially on the extent of complementarity and modularity in that structure. But it also depends on institutions. This paper argues for the centrality of decision rights to the process of innovation. Especially if it takes place in a systemic, non-modular way, innovation may require unified decision rights, often implying integrated control of complementary stages of production, in order to overcome the dynamic transaction costs of change. But the processes of subdivision, differentiation, and learning - the processes of fission, forking, and fine tuning - may also require changes in decision rights in order to overcome dynamic transaction costs. I illustrate these points with a case study of three generations of an American family of inventor-entrepreneurs in electricity and electronics.","[Langlois, Richard N.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Langlois, Richard N.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Inst & Polit Econ Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Connecticut; University of Witwatersrand,"Langlois, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Langlois, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Inst & Polit Econ Grp, Johannesburg, South Africa.",Richard.Langlois@UConn.edu,,,,,,,63,5,5,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The value of commitment is calculated as the difference in this welfare across commitment regimes of which there are at least six. Inspired by Bilbie (2014) we show how by means of selecting the optimal level of a single parameter in the setup of several so-called discretionary targeting regimes (price-targeting, speed-limit, etc.) one can produce optimal inertia identical to that of the Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) global commitment. Combining the targeting regimes with the commitment regime, we are left with three levels of commitment. Deriving welfare analytically as a function of all permissible parameters, rather the standard practice of calculating welfare based on a single or handful of parameter sets, we can measure the gain that would occur from jumping to higher commitment levels over all permissible sets. We also compare welfare surfaces with parameter combinations we have sampled. Result: depending on parameter selection the gains from optimal inertia may be high or low. Our sample of parameters actually used in the literature puts many near the high end, a few not. We find no parameter sets where a switch from no- to high-commitment would imply low or negligible gains. A side-effect of the analysis is that the optimal inertia regimes reduce nominal and real interest rate variance even when interest stability is not an objective of the central bank. We include Taylor-type rules that satisfy the requirements of each commitment level. Conceptually, the results indicate that at least in the benchmark NKM long-time questions such as whether price- or inflation-targeting is preferable are off point. The pertinent question is: in what commitment regime does the central bank find itself in?","[Marest, Luc; Thurston, Thom] CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Thurston, Thom] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Thurston, T (通讯作者)，CUNY, Queens Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.;Thurston, T (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA.",tthurston@gc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,35,0,1,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

It features two types of households and two types of intermediate firms, with savers being employed exclusively by capital-intensive producers and spenders by labor-intensive producers. Following a monetary or a fiscal expansion, consumption inequality decreases temporary: policy shocks generate higher benefits for hand-to-mouth households through increases in their labor income, outweighing the direct savings consumption substitution effects for the optimizing households. The reduction in consumption inequality is higher the more complementary sectoral intermediate goods are, that is when a more balanced composition of the two sectoral goods is required for final good production. As compared to a single-firm model, in our two-firm, two-household model the effects on relative consumption are attenuated; this suggests a potential overestimation of redistributive effects in homogeneous-firm models.","[Nalban, Valeriu] Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania",,"Nalban, V (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Romania, Bucharest, Romania.",Valeriu.Nalban@bnro.ro,,,,,,,25,0,0,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

Because of the new economic and monetary conditions, the effectiveness of conventional monetary tools has been questioned. Purpose of the article: Designed models examine the consequences of unconventional monetary policy for macroeconomic variables, monetary variables and interest rates in the euro area. Particular attention is paid to the response of the price level, represented by HICP, to various monetary policy innovations. Except a shock in credit multiplier and asset purchase programme (APP), also the effectiveness of a conventional monetary tool, such as main refinancing operation (MRO) interest rate, is inspected. Methods: Use has been made of impulse responses from structural VAR models to analyze a large sample that covers the time horizon of 1999 to 2016. Several econometric tests are performed to provide a profound analysis. The conclusions from baseline models are verified in multiple robustness check models, which are specified under alternative conditions. Findings & Value added: It has been found that, in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, conventional monetary instruments are effective in the short-run. In the long-run, unconventional monetary policy has a greater potential to stabilize the economy than the traditional interest rate transmission channel. The conclusions from the baseline models are verified in multiple robustness check models, which are specified under alternative conditions.","[Pazicky, Martin] Comenius Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Pazicky, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Dept Econ, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",martin.pazicky@fm.uniba.sk,"Pažický, Martin/AAY-8142-2021; Pažický, Martin/AAC-9976-2019","Pažický, Martin/0000-0002-1239-0144;",,,,,26,9,9,2,10,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

To structure the discussion, a conceptual distinction is made between three types of financial fraud: false financial disclosures, financial scams, and financial mis-selling. The findings of the literature review highlight a number of recent developments that scholars think have facilitated the occurrence of financial fraud, including (1) the development of new fundamental conflicts of interest and perverse incentive structures in the financial industry; (2) an influx of unsophisticated, gullible participants in the financial marketplace; (3) the increasing complexity involved in financial market transactions as a result of rapid technological, legal, and financial innovation and an ever-widening menu of financial products; (4) an increase in the use of justified secrecy in the form of a mystification of trading models adopted by fund managers.","[Reurink, Arjan] Max Planck Inst Gesell Forsch, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Reurink, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Gesell Forsch, Cologne, Germany.",reurink@mpifg.de,,"Reurink, Arjan/0000-0002-2267-9603",,,,,149,38,48,32,277,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Focusing on Jordan, an Arab country where gender inequality and emigration rates are high, this paper exploits unique data in which detailed information on female empowerment allows us to construct several measures of social norms in Jordan on the role of women, female freedom of mobility, and female decision-making power. Controlling for both emigration and return migration selections, we find that women with a returnee family member are more likely to bear traditional gender norms than women in households with no migration experience. Further analysis shows that results are driven by returnees from more conservative Arab countries, suggesting a transfer of conservative norms from destinations with highly traditional gender roles. We also show the implications of our results beyond perceptions for several economic and development outcomes, such as female labour force participation, education and fertility.","[Tuccio, Michele] Univ Paris 09, UMR DIAL, IRD, LEDa,Ctr Populat Change, Paris, France; [Wahba, Jackline] Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Dept, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa; University of Southampton,"Wahba, J (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Sch Social Sci, Econ Dept, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",michele.tuccio@ird.fr; j.wahba@soton.ac.uk,,"Wahba, Jackline/0000-0002-0002-3443",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Simone Bertoli, Raj Chowdury, Amelie Constant, Corrado Giulietti, Martin Guzi, Maryam Naghsh Nejad, Mariola Pytlikova, Hillel Rapoport, Ibrahim Sirkeci, and Yves Zenou for helpful discussion.

Our framework features within-cohort heterogeneity of endowments and heterogeneity of preferences. We allow for population aging and gradual decline in TFP growth. We show four main results. First, increasing longevity translates to substantial increases in aggregate consumption inequality and wealth inequality. Second, a pension system reform from a defined benefit to a defined contribution works to reinforce consumption inequality and reduce wealth inequality. Third, minimum pension benefits are able to partially counteract an increase in inequality introduced by the defined contribution system, at a fiscal cost. Fourth the minimum pension benefit guarantee mostly addresses the sources of inequality which stem from differentiated endowments rather than those which stem from heterogeneous preferences.","[Tyrowicz, Joanna; Makarski, Krzysztof; Bielecki, Marcin] FAME GRAPE, Warsaw, Poland; [Tyrowicz, Joanna] IAAEU, Trier, Germany; [Tyrowicz, Joanna; Bielecki, Marcin] Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland; [Tyrowicz, Joanna] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Makarski, Krzysztof] Warsaw Sch Econ, Warsaw, Poland; [Makarski, Krzysztof; Bielecki, Marcin] Natl Bank Poland, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Warsaw School of Economics; Narodowy Bank Polski,"Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，FAME GRAPE, Warsaw, Poland.;Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，IAAEU, Trier, Germany.;Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.;Tyrowicz, J (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",j.tyrowicz@uw.edu.pl; k.makarski@grape.org.pl; mbielecki@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Makarski, Krzysztof/G-2245-2014; Tyrowicz, Joanna/I-3270-2019; Bielecki, Marcin/ABA-8932-2020","Makarski, Krzysztof/0000-0003-2452-6560; Tyrowicz, Joanna/0000-0002-5928-332X; Bielecki, Marcin/0000-0002-1228-1095",National Science Centre [UMO-2012/01/D/HS4/04039]; National Science Center [UMO-2014/15/G/HS4/04638],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland); National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)","The authors thank two anonymous referees for thorough and well-spirited comments.

We focus on the formal sector and find evidence for a consistent gender wage gap, with the price of skills being the main contributor. In contrast, labour market discrimination does not have a crucial influence. Some gender equality gained by the distribution of skills can be explained by the rise in women's education and women's participation in specific industries, occupations and the growing private sector.","[Vu, Tien M.] Asian Growth Res Inst, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Vu, Tien M.] Osaka Univ, Osaka, Japan; [Yamada, Hiroyuki] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Osaka University; Keio University,"Vu, TM (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Otemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",vu@agi.or.jp,"Vu, Tien Manh/K-5380-2012; Yamada, Hiroyuki/Q-3464-2019","Vu, Tien Manh/0000-0002-2251-0795;","Asian Growth Research Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H01950, 18K12784]; Keio Gijuku Academic Development Funds; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Centre at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950, 18K12784] Funding Source: KAKEN","Asian Growth Research Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Keio Gijuku Academic Development Funds; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Centre at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Asian Growth Research Institute, Grant/Award Number: Research Project; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 15H01950, 18K12784; Keio Gijuku Academic Development Funds; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Centre at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University",,33,11,11,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

But how can countries make this a reality in the face of a limited budget and an aging population? Since 2008, China has been rolling out an ambitious reform program, which aims to achieve affordable health insurance coverage for all Chinese citizens. Under this reform program, Chinese living in rural areas are eligible to enroll in a subsidized scheme called the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS). Using a three stage game model involving a government, a private fund manager and population, we explore the impact of population aging on NCMS. Our model highlights the role of government regulation and subsidy in ensuring operation efficiency of the system. We show that at optimality the government sets the operating framework for the fund manager to constrain the potential for monopoly profits. The Government subsidizes the scheme to prevent an adverse selection death spiral. However, the effectiveness of the subsidy in achieving this goal is moderated by the age structure of the population. Our model gives insights into the strengths of the NCMS framework and also can be used to support decisions about resource allocation and understand how scheme dynamics may unfold as the Chinese population ages further.","[Zhou, Wenhui] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Yanfang] Henan Univ, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Sch Business, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Morton, Alec] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Luo, Feng] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Business, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology; Henan University; University of Strathclyde; City University of Hong Kong,"Zheng, YF (通讯作者)，Henan Univ, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Sch Business, Kaifeng 475001, Henan, Peoples R China.",whzhou@scut.edu.cn; annie0605@foxmail.com; alec.morton@strath.ac.uk; fengluo3-c@my.cityu.edu.hk,"Zhou, Wenhui/AAL-8470-2021","Zhou, Wenhui/0000-0003-2216-8878; Morton, Alec/0000-0003-3803-8517","National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC: 71731006, 71571070, 71790615, 71431006]; GDHVPS; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2015A030311032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); GDHVPS; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"The authors greatly appreciate the comments of the editor and the referees, which were very helpful in improving the paper.

Our empirical results suggested that a negative correlation between defense and health spending persists over the entire period of 1941-2013 in the very long-run (over 16 years cycle), but there is a change in correlation between defense and health spending in the short-run (2-4 years cycle), medium-run (4-8 years cycle), and long-run (8-16 years cycle) during the same period. In particular, there appears to have been a trade-off relationship between defense and health spending during the ex-Korean War period, but there was a complementary relationship between defense and health spending during the post-Korean War period. The crowding-out effect of health spending on defense spending during the period when the Affordable Care Act was put into effect relies on the strength of the positive correlation in the long-run (8-16 years cycle) and negative correlation in the short-run (2-4 years cycle) and very long-run (over 16 years cycle).","[Chen, Wen-Yi; Liang, Yai-Wun] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Yu-Hui] Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Nantou, Taiwan",National Taichung University of Science & Technology; Nan Kai University Technology,"Lin, YH (通讯作者)，Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Nantou, Taiwan.",lin2138@nkut.edu.tw,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This paper explores the effect of industry relatedness on new firm survival in China by using a firm-level dataset for the 1999-2008 period. Based on survival models, it contributes to the ongoing debate by pointing out that new firms that are highly related to local industries have a lower failure rate, and the effect of industry relatedness is inflected by regional institutions and firm attributes. Industry relatedness occurs more effectively in the market-oriented regions but less effectively in regions with strong economic and political incentives of local governments.","[Guo, Qi] Nankai Univ, Coll Econ & Social Dev, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shengjun; He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Lincoln Inst Ctr Urban Dev & Land Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Qi] Nankai Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr China Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University; Peking University; Peking University; Nankai University,"He, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Lincoln Inst Ctr Urban Dev & Land Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Guo, Qi/HHM-6602-2022; Zhu, Shengjun/AAD-3723-2020","Guo, Qi/0000-0003-2594-8634",,,,,60,6,7,3,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,NOV 2,2018,30.0,6,,,,,735,754,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1443253,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW9IO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447298700002,0

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamic linkages and volatility transmission mechanisms between Chinese and African stock markets in recent years while highlighting the relative importance of Chinese capital flows and investments. We utilise dynamic forecasting models including Bayesian VAR and BEKK GARCH to estimate both price and volatility behaviours of Chinese and 15 selected African stock markets. Our empirical results indicate strong evidence of spillover effects in terms of both price movement and volatility behaviour, implying that Chinese and African stock markets are showing signs of integration. For price movement, bidirectional feedback relationships between Chinese and most of the African stock markets are observed, suggesting that both Chinese and African stock markets could influence each other. China has been building a strong African partnership and, therefore, increasing its trade and investment influences in the region. Examining volatility transmissions, at least one spillover effect (shock and/or volatility) from China to most of the African stock markets is reported. This suggests that the Chinese stock market now plays an influential role across African stock markets given that it has major investments in 46 out of 54 countries. Our findings show important portfolio management implications as a surge in Chinese investments provide new portfolio diversification opportunities for international investors. Policy-wise, we believe further market-oriented reforms and carefully designed and long-term development policies are required to boost capacity for development and achieve sustainable trade and growth.

There is extensive research on the subject, where each city is treated symmetrically in terms of the cost of transactions with other cities. Recent developments in network theory facilitate the examination of an asymmetric transport network. In a scale-free network, the chance of observing extremes in network connections becomes higher than the Gaussian distribution predicts and, therefore, it explains the emergence of large clusters. The city-size distribution shares the same pattern. This paper decodes how accessibility of a city to other cities on the transportation network can boost its local economy and explains the city-size distribution as a result of its underlying transportation network structure.

We find more equilibrium choices in the sequential version than in the simultaneous version of the game and we highlight the importance of attentional measures. Indeed, depending on the treatment, equilibrium behavior is 30 to 80 percentage points higher for subjects who look at all the payoffs necessary to compute the Nash equilibrium and for those who look at payoffs in the order predicted by the sequential elimination of dominated strategies than for subjects who do not. Finally, the sequence of lookups reveals that subjects have an easier time finding the player with a dominant strategy in the sequential timing than in the simultaneous timing.

To answer this, I use data from rural India to show that exogenous increases in agricultural productivity - caused by abnormally high levels of precipitation - lead to an increase in the labor share of the non-agricultural sector. I further show that the non-tradable sector expands significantly when agricultural output increases. This evidence is consistent with increasing agricultural output causing increased demand for local non-tradables, which in turn increases the non-agricultural labor share.","[Emerick, Kyle] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Emerick, K (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, 8 Upper Campus Rd, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",kyle.emerick@tufts.edu,,,Institute for Economic Development at Boston University,Institute for Economic Development at Boston University,"I am grateful for support from the Institute for Economic Development at Boston University, where I was hosted as a visiting scholar while part of this research was carried out.",,47,46,60,3,49,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

The elasticity of growth to changes in either size of the real or financial sector is higher under balanced sectoral growth. We also show that rapid and unbridled credit growth comes at a huge cost to economic growth with consequences stemming from financing of risky and unsustainable investments coupled with superfluous consumption fueling inflation.

In this paper, firstly patterns of trade specialization of products at two-digit level of Harmonized System will be analyzed in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Vietnam. Revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index and Lafay Index (LFI) are the main proxies measuring trade specialization to be calculated in this research. Afterwards we investigate the impact of specialization on the export of products in a gravity model during 1996-2011 for the whole sample and for each country separately. In order words, it is tested whether or not ASEAN export patterns are explained by Ricardian CA theory. To control for available endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, and fixed effects problems we use robust two-step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique. Results of the GMM estimation suggest that specialization measured by both indices has significant positive impact on the export of products only in Philippines and Malaysia, which emphasizes on the applicability of Ricardian CA theory in these two countries.","[Karimi, Mohammad Sharif] Razi Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, Kermanshah, Iran; [Malekshahian, Mehran] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ Sci, Serdang, Malaysia",Razi University; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Karimi, MS (通讯作者)，Razi Univ, Dept Econ, Fac Social Sci, Kermanshah, Iran.",s.karimi@razi.ac.ir; mehranmalek-shahian@yahoo.com,"Karimi, Mohammad Sharif/AAA-5137-2022","Karimi, Mohammad Sharif/0000-0002-5967-6756",,,,,46,1,1,0,11,WUHAN UNIV JOURNALS PRESS,WUHAN,"DONGHU RD, 155, WUHAN, HUBEI 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",1529-7373,,,ANN ECON FINANC,Ann.

Estimated elasticities are larger in the top 1% of the income distribution but are also positive and statistically significant for other income groups. Previous time series studies of tax returns data have found little evidence for income responses to taxes outside the top of the income distribution. The different results in this article arise because of additional efforts to account for dynamics, expectations, and especially the endogeneity of tax policy decisions. Marginal rate cuts lead to increases in real GDP and declines in unemployment. There is also evidence that the responses are to marginal tax rates rather than average tax rates. Counterfactual tax cuts targeting the top 1% alone are estimated to have short-run positive effects on economic activity and incomes outside of the top 1%, but to increase inequality in pretax incomes. Cuts for taxpayers outside of the top 1% also lead to increases in incomes and economic activity, but with a longer delay.","[Mertens, Karel] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; Columbia Univ, Ctr Econ Policy Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Columbia University,"Mertens, K (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Dallas, TX 75201 USA.",,"Olea, Jose L.

(2012), in which the stock return has constant volatility and the investor has a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function, into more general settings where the volatility of the stock return is stochastic and with jumps, and the investor has recursive preferences. The recursive preferences help us to separately find that the higher the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and the relative risk aversion (RRA), the higher the equity and variance risk premiums. In equilibrium, risk premiums are determined by the diffusive and jump risks from the stock return and its volatility innovation. The empirical analysis documents that the production-based equilibrium model in a cost-free economy can explain well the equity premium puzzle and the term structure of the variance risk premium (VRP).

In this paper, we estimate switching costs in the Medicare Part D market with aggregate market share data using standard discrete choice models for differentiated products. We consider various modelling assumptions: myopic and forward-looking consumers, and with and without random coefficients. Both myopic and forward-looking consumer models with no random coefficients yield switching cost estimates that closely match the actual average switching frequency, with implied dollar-valued switching costs of $1600 to $2000. We find the inclusion of random coefficients to the myopic consumer model results in smaller estimates of switching costs, but only at the expense of the model's fit to the switching frequency. The estimated welfare losses from switching frictions are large, but they are smaller under the forward-looking consumer model, amounting to around $500 per enrollee annually, compared to over $1000 under the myopic model.

To that end, we develop a dynamic stochastic quantitative model of sovereign default featuring fiscal policy, endogenous financial aid and risk-averse foreign lenders. After calibrating the model, we feed output shocks into the model to show that it captures some of the most salient features of the fiscal and debt situation in Argentina during the 1998-2002. This underscores the economic nature of the decision to default and the role that official aid could have taken in avoiding such an event. In effect, given the economic challenges endured by Argentina, a full-fledged default took place. In addition, we discuss a number of policy implications associated with financial aid programs aimed at preventing sovereign default episodes.","[Cuadra, Gabriel; Ramos-Francia, Manuel; Garcia-Verdu, Santiago] Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,"Garcia-Verdu, S (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",sgarciav@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Besides electricity price forecasting, we check for the impact of early day-ahead (DA) EXAA prices on intraday forecasts. Another novelty of this paper is the complementary discussion of economic benefits. A precise estimation is worthless if it cannot be utilized. We elaborate possible trading decisions based upon our forecasting scheme and analyze their monetary effects.

We consider three integration regimes: a benchmark regime in which the North opens its capital market globally, but labor markets remain closed between North and South; a regime in which both capital and labor markets are opened; and a regime in which the capital market of the North as well as its labor market are both closed. Further, we consider alternative scenarios for the growth rate of total factor productivity in the North. A general equilibrium model with overlapping generations is constructed for the purpose. Overlapping generations allow for a gradual catch-up in the education levels of Northern workers. The best outcome with respect to total output derives from the regime in which both capital and labor markets are opened. However, this openness comes at the cost an initial sharp drop in output for the North as labor flows south. We conclude that to balance overall output gains against worsening disparity between North and South, liberalization of the labor market should proceed gradually. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Contrary to the conclusions reached by both positions in the aforementioned debate, the paper's econometric results suggest that, while financial assets inflation is not innocuous, its eventual incorporation in the monetary policy rule would trigger an excessive adjustment of the (interest rate) policy instrument and, thereby, a potential macroeconomic instability.","[Muller Duran, Nancy] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Durán, NM (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",nan.muller@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,1,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

The empirical evidence in favor of such a relationship is limited, the so-called Backus and Smith puzzle. In this paper, we extend the analysis to allow for nonlinear dynamics and volatility changes across exchange rate regimes. Our findings suggest that long-run relationships in line with standard international business cycle models do exist for many Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Further, Monte Carlo experiments illustrate that the nonlinear models can generate the Backus and Smith and the exchange rate disconnect puzzles. In this paper, we also contribute to the nonlinear real exchange rate literature by establishing a theoretical relationship between volatility and persistence. In accordance with the theoretical results, our empirical findings suggest that the increase in volatility in the post-Bretton Woods era is associated with relatively fast mean reversion of the real rate toward its equilibrium value.","[Pavlidis, Efthymios G.; Paya, Ivan; Peel, David A.] Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Paya, I (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Management Sch, Dept Econ, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",i.paya@lancaster.ac.uk,"; Paya, Ivan/K-4059-2012","Pavlidis, Efthymios/0000-0002-4892-1955; Paya, Ivan/0000-0002-2857-057X; Peel, David/0000-0001-5281-2041",,,,,29,0,0,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In the case of deterministic demand and constant marginal cost, reducing a price cap yields increased total output, consumer welfare, and total welfare, results consistent with those for oligopoly markets with a fixed number of firms. With deterministic demand and increasing marginal cost, these comparative static results may be fully reversed, and a welfare-improving cap may not exist. Recent results in the literature show that for a fixed number of firms, if demand is stochastic and marginal cost is constant, then lowering a price cap may either increase or decrease output and welfare (locally); however, a welfare-improving price cap does exist. In contrast to these recent results, we show that a welfare-improving cap may not exist if entry is endogenous. However, within this stochastic demand environment we show that certain restrictions on the curvature of demand are sufficient to ensure the existence of a welfare-improving cap when entry is endogenous.","[Reynolds, Stanley S.] Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Rietzke, David] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Dept Econ, Lancaster, England",University of Arizona; Lancaster University,"Reynolds, SS (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Dept Econ, Eller Coll Management, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",reynolds@eller.arizona.edu; d.rietzke@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Rietzke, David/0000-0002-8108-1396",,,,,17,12,13,1,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Using a variation of 'better response' strategies, IEL agents quickly learn to play Nash equilibrium strategies and their dynamic behavior is like that of humans subjects. In this paper we study whether IEL can also explain behavior in games with gains from coordination. We focus on the simplest such game: the 2 person repeated Battle of Sexes game. In laboratory experiments, two patterns of behavior often emerge: players either converge rapidly to one of the stage game Nash equilibria and stay there or learn to coordinate their actions and alternate between the two Nash equilibria every other round. We show that IEL explains this behavior if the human subjects are truly in the dark and do not know or believe they know their opponent's payoffs. To explain the behavior when agents are not in the dark, we need to modify the basic IEL model and allow some agents to begin with a good idea about how to play. We show that if the proportion of inspired agents with good ideas is chosen judiciously, the behavior of IEL agents looks remarkably similar to that of human subjects in laboratory experiments.","[Arifovic, Jasmina] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Ledyard, John] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Simon Fraser University; California Institute of Technology,"Arifovic, J (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",arifovic@sfu.ca; jledyard@caltech.edu,,,CIGI-INET Grant [5553]; Moore Foundation [1158],CIGI-INET Grant; Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation),"We thank Sarah Deretic, Kevin James, Brian Merlob and Heng Sok for their excellent research assistance.

We document that income, education, geographical location and the type of space heating system are important factors driving the adoption of solar water heaters. Analyzing the energy consumption of households, we find that total household energy consumption is reduced by around 13% when a solar water heater is present. Relating their presence to housing market outcomes, we document that the perceived value of owner-occupied homes increases by 6%, and find a three percent rent premium in the rental housing market.

Using data of unlisted companies, we examine to what extent the ownership structure has a significant impact on firm's performance. When estimating the determinants of Tobin's q, we find that the ownership structure has a significant influence on the performance of each unlisted company. However, the impact was totally different between companies with good performance and bad performance. In particular, the increase in the shareholding ratio of a specific individual or a parent company worked positively for companies with good performance, but it worked negatively for companies with poor performance. The results suggest that the distorted governance structure in unlisted companies, which had worked well during the bubble economy, may have significantly restricted their recovery under prolonged recession in Japan.","[Fukuda, Shin-ichi] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Kasuya, Munehisa] Meisei Univ, Hino, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakajima, Jouchi] Bank Japan, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo; Meisei University; Bank of Japan,"Kasuya, M (通讯作者)，Meisei Univ, Hino, Tokyo, Japan.",sfukuda@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp; munehisa.kasuya@meisei-u.ac.jp; jouchi.nakajima@bis.org,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019",,JSPS Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects; JSPS KAKENHI Grant [26285044]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26285044] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS Bilateral Open Partnership Joint Research Projects; JSPS KAKENHI Grant(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official views of the Bank of Japan.

Our results show that increases in oil prices greatly spurred innovation in biofuels. The elasticity of the number of patent families in biofuels with respect to oil prices is greater than 1, and holds both at the country and at the firm level. We find that the effect cannot be caused by the contagion of oil prices to cereal prices, an important input for biofuels. Similarly, we find that the effect is very specific: no such effect is found substituting oil prices with electricity prices, or substituting biofuel patents with biotechnology or environment-related patents. Delving into applicants' sectors suggests that specialized biofuel firms were less responsive to oil price variations than diversified firms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The process of SOEs' reform is analysed with reference to corporatization, restructuring, privatization and liberalization policies. Drawing on theoretical and empirical evidence, the paper explores the impact of these reforms on the ownership, governance and public mission of SOEs, also addressing their current social and economic role. The hypothesis of a paradigm shift' is tested within the changing context of government intervention, market structure, management relationships, public service and control and accountability of SOEs. The case studies include 15 major enterprises in key economic-industrial and utility sectors.

The approach provides a detailed investigation of the consequences on economic growth following changes in countries' supply chains. We apply the method to data from Brazil and other countries. The results suggest that the substitution of imported for national inputs is a key factor in SDA, assuming that the impact of technological change is underestimated if this substitution is not taken into account. The findings also show that the substitution of imported inputs is essential to understanding the Brazilian growth path in the 2000s. The positive impact of export growth on total output was offset by the increase in imported inputs, especially in highly technological sectors. The results in Brazil stand in contrast with those in Korea, China, and Germany, where high-tech sectors benefited the most from the substitution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our study is a partial replication of Combes & Ebeke (2011), who first investigated this issue using data for the period of 1975 to 2004 and found that international migrants' remittances reduce household consumption volatility in developing countries. We improve their study by using more recent data, additional control variables, and by investigating the long run and the short run implications of international remittances in developing countries. Our results show that the volatility of household consumption can significantly be reduced by international migrants' remittances. The robustness checks reinforce the stabilising impact of migrants' remittances on consumption volatility in developing countries. Since overall consumption is an integral part of household welfare, the findings of this study highlight that international migrants' remittances may indeed contribute significantly to households' welfare by reducing the volatility of consumption in remittance receiving developing countries both in the short and long run.

I develop a new theoretical and empirical framework to analyze the accumulation of capital in its productive and unproductive forms. I also develop a methodology to compute Marxist categories predicated on the idea that the production of knowledge and information is an unproductive activity that relies on the creation of knowledge-rents. In particular, I provide new empirical estimates to uncover the shifting balance between productive and unproductive forms of accumulation. The accumulation pattern observed during the 1947-79 phase that prioritized productive accumulation gave way after the 1980s to a contrasting pattern prioritizing unproductive accumulation. Unproductive activity has been growing at a fast pace in terms of incomes, fixed assets and employment. Among all forms of unproductive activity, my approach places special attention on how the production of knowledge and information has constituted a rising share of total unproductive income and capital stock. Additionally, productive stagnation and rapid unproductive accumulation have been related to greater exploitation of productive workers and to widening income inequality.","[Rotta, Tomas N.] Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England; [Rotta, Tomas N.] Univ Greenwich, Greenwich Polit Econ Res Ctr, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England",University of Greenwich; University of Greenwich,"Rotta, TN (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Dept Int Business & Econ, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.;Rotta, TN (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Greenwich Polit Econ Res Ctr, Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.",tomasrotta@gmail.com,,"Rotta, Tomas/0000-0002-5304-9890",,,,,51,11,13,4,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

A two-sector new-Keynesian model is developed in which the sectors are connected through factor demand linkages. Moreover, they differ in price stickiness. We obtain two important results: first, the presence of factor demand linkages causes amplification effects in resource mis-allocation and, hence, the concern for price stability becomes relatively more important.

This work has identified conditions under which an SBC elicitation is incentive compatible, and empirical evidence lends support to the predictive power of the theory. Nevertheless, researchers and practitioners commonly use alternative elicitation formats, and defend their design choices based on efficiency and other criteria. In this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify conditions under which alternative elicitation formats are incentive compatible, using as examples open ended (OE) and payment card (PC) question formats. We then implement theory-informed value elicitations in the context of a flood control policy for New York City. We fail to reject convergent validity in mean willingness to pay when comparing the theory-driven OE format with SBC, but reject convergent validity between the theory-driven PC and SBC formats. As an informative counterfactual, we find that a standard OE elicitation congruent with prior work leads to significantly lower values and a lower proportion of respondents who view the elicitation as consequential.

To acquire the dominant advantage, firms as a whole can strategically undertake either quality upgrades through R&D or cost saving through the channels of market penetration-foreign direct investment (FDI) or offshoring. In an infinite-horizon game, the uses of mixing moving-up and moving-out strategies in high-tech and medium-tech industries generate product cycles. Furthermore, in low-tech industries, FDI is a strongly dominant strategy for the industry leaders and followers. Under certain conditions, firms leapfrog over each other and product cycles thus emerge.","[Zou, Yuxiang] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Econ, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tai-Liang] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Chen, TL (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yuxiang.zou@zuel.edu.cn; tailiang.znuel@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,2,2,2,20,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

In order to evaluate these effects we consider robust estimates of TFP through a GMM approach where we account for the diverse innovation strategies carried out by firms (intramural only, external only or both). Using data for Spanish manufacturing firms drawn from the Encuesta de Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE), over the period 1991-2014, our results suggest that inhouse R&D and external R&D are complementary strategies only for large firms in high tech sectors. For the rest of firms, both strategies turn out to be substitutive. Further, R&D strategies only offer a TFP premium to exporters. We find no positive synergies between in-house and external R&D for large exporters, while for small exporters both strategies are substitutes.","[Anon Higon, Dolores; Manez, Juan A.; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain; [Anon Higon, Dolores; Manez, Juan A.; Sanchis-Llopis, Juan A.] Univ Valencia, ERICES, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Máñez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, Valencia, Spain.;Máñez, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, ERICES, Valencia, Spain.",jamc@uv.es,"Manez, Juan/K-6780-2014; Añón Higón, Dolores/I-1305-2012; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./K-8923-2014","Manez, Juan/0000-0003-1105-0815; Añón Higón, Dolores/0000-0003-2468-9490; Sanchis Llopis, Juan A./0000-0001-9664-4668","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2017-86793-R, ECO2014-55745-R]; Generalitat Valenciana [PROMETEOII/2014/054]",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF)),The authors acknowledge financial support from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Grants ECO2017-86793-R and ECO2014-55745-R) and from Generalitat Valenciana (Grant PROMETEOII/2014/054).

This generates a potential role for public old-age pension systems to spread economic and demographic shocks among different generations. This paper evaluates how different systems smooth and propagate shocks to productivity, fertility, mortality and migration in a realistic OLG model. We use reductions in the variance of wealth equivalents to measure performance, starting with the existing U.S. system as a unifying framework, in which we vary how much taxes and benefits adjust, and which we then compare to the existing German and Swedish systems. We find that system design and shock type are key factors. The German system and the benefit-adjustment-only U.S. system best smooth productivity shocks, which are by far the most important shocks. Overall, the German system performs best, while the Swedish system, which includes a buffer stock to relax annual budget constraints, performs rather poorly. Focusing on the U.S. system, reliance solely on tax adjustment fares best for mortality and migration shocks, while equal reliance on tax and benefit adjustments is best for fertility shocks.

For this purpose, we exploit variation in the regional treatment intensity, assuming that the stronger a minimum wage 'bites' into the regional wage distribution, the stronger the regional labour market will be affected. In contrast to previous studies, we construct two regional bite indicators based upon detailed individual wage data from the Structure of Earnings Survey (SES) 2014 and combine it with administrative information on regional employment. Moreover, using the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we are able to affirm the absence of anticipation effects and verify the assumption of a common trend in wages before the reform. In sum, we find only moderate negative effects on overall employment of about 140,000 (0.4%) jobs, which are mainly driven by a sharp decline of marginal employment (Mini-jobs'), while we do not find pronounced significant effects for regular employment in most specifications.

When debt is low, tax policy is countercyclical, in the sense that the government responds to low output by setting a low tax rate. Above a threshold level of debt, however, optimal tax policy becomes procyclical. This creates the possibility of self-fulfilling crises (fiscal policy traps), in which output is low because households expect high taxes, and the government sets high taxes because output is low. Our model suggests why highly indebted governments might implement procyclical tax policy even without facing high sovereign risk premia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In terms of Australian state and territory legal regimes, mining royalties accrue to state governments and not to the Local Government Areas (LGAs) in which mining occurs, despite the fact that mining imposes heavy localised costs, especially on local public infrastructure. There is thus a disjunction between the spatial incidence of the benefits and costs of mining, sometimes termed the 'resource-return mismatch', especially since mining predominantly takes place in regional, rural and remote areas whereas the bulk of mining royalties are expended in metropolitan centres. Situating our empirical analysis in the institutional milieu of Queensland local government over the period 2011 to 2015, we examine the relationship between the number of mining assessments and per capita operating expenditure of local authorities at the level of LGAs. We find that mining imposes significant costs on local government and there is thus a mismatch between the costs and revenues associated with mining at the local level. We offer various possible remedial policy measures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As an alternative to the reduction of compound lotteries axiom of expected utility, I also test the compound independence axiom that can be employed by several decision theories. While the non-parametric test does not reject the compound independence axiom, I do not find support for evaluation of compound lotteries by the compound independence axiom through rank dependent utility that was used to motivate the axiom. The reduction of compound lotteries axiom is tested by two methods used in the literature. The validity of the axiom depends on the particular method used. While binary choices support the validity of the reduction axiom, there is no evidence of evaluation of compound lotteries through the axiom. Furthermore, out-of-sample predictions indicate that expected value is the best predictor of elicited certainty equivalents of compound lotteries. Interestingly, expected utility is the best predictor of elicited certainty equivalents for simple lotteries. The results suggest that subjects follow different mechanisms when evaluating compound lotteries as compared to simple ones.","[Hajimoladarvish, Narges] Alzahra Univ, Fac Social Sci & Econ, Tehran, Iran",Alzahra University,"Hajimoladarvish, N (通讯作者)，Alzahra Univ, Fac Social Sci & Econ, Tehran, Iran.",nargesdarwish@gmail.com,"Hajimoladarvish, Narges/AAK-2888-2020","Hajimoladarvish, Narges/0000-0002-9499-352X",Department of Economics of University of Leicester,Department of Economics of University of Leicester,"I am sincerely thankful to David Rojo-Arjona for his continuous suggestions and criticism that has improved this paper substantially.

Up to now, nations have adopted minimal policies to slow climate change. Moreover, there has been no major improvement in emissions trends as of the latest data. The current study uses the updated DICE model to develop new projections of trends and impacts of alternative climate policies. It also presents a new set of estimates of the uncertainties about future climate change and compares the results with those of other integrated assessment models. The study confirms past estimates of likely rapid climate change over the next century if major climate-change policies are not taken.

NYSE- and NASDAQ-listed securities trade and report on various markets, and in this paper, we examine odd-lot activity in these venues. We also look at odd-lot trading on December 9, 2013, when odd-lot trades began reporting to the consolidated public tapes. We find a small increase in odd-lot trading occurring after odd-lot trades are reported to the consolidated tape, which is inconsistent with the belief that some odd-lot trades are larger trades broken up to avoid reporting to the consolidated tape. Odd-lot trades have disproportionately high cumulative price changes relative to the level of odd-lot trading. We also find a positive relation between odd-lot order imbalance and returns.

We refer to these episodes as stagnation traps, because they consist in the joint occurrence of a liquidity and a growth trap. In a stagnation trap, the central bank is unable to restore full employment because weak growth depresses aggregate demand and pushes the policy rate against the zero lower bound, while growth is weak because low aggregate demand results in low profits, limiting firms' investment in innovation. Aggressive policies aiming at restoring growth, such as subsidies to investment, can successfully lead the economy out of a stagnation trap by generating a regime shift in agents' growth expectations.","[Benigno, Gianluca] London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England; [Benigno, Gianluca] CFM, Paris, France; [Fornaro, Luca] Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Fornaro, Luca] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Barcelona School of Economics; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Benigno, G (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, CEPR, London, England.;Benigno, G (通讯作者)，CFM, Paris, France.",,"Fornaro, Luca/L-2744-2014",,"ESRC British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship [ES/I024174/1]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-23192]; Fondation Banque de France Research Grant; CERCAProgramme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2015-0563]; European Central Bank; ESRC [ES/R009295/1, ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI","ESRC British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Fondation Banque de France Research Grant; CERCAProgramme/Generalitat de Catalunya; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, through the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government); European Central Bank; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We thank the Editor, Gita Gopinath, four anonymous referees, Philippe Aghion, Pierpaolo Benigno, Javier Bianchi, Seonghoon Cho, Roger Farmer, Andrea Ferrero, Jordi Gali, Jang-Ting Guo, Bob Hall, Chad Jones, Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Robert Kollmann, Tommaso Monacelli, Jaume Ventura, Alwyn Young, and participants at several seminars and conferences for useful comments.

Relaxing the free entry assumption and using Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) finds the vacancy creation process is less than infinitely elastic. Because a recession-leading job separation shock then causes vacancies to fall as unemployment increases, the ad hoc restriction to zero job separation shocks (to generate Beveridge curve dynamics) becomes redundant. In contrast to standard arguments, the calibrated model finds the job separation process drives unemployment volatility over the cycle.","[Coles, Melvyn G.] Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Kelishomi, Ali Moghaddasi] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Essex; University of Warwick,"Coles, MG (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Econ, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",mcole@essex.ac.uk; a.moghaddasi@warwick.ac.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/I037628/1],UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Coles acknowledges research funding by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), award reference ES/I037628/1.

To solve a discrete problem with n states and n choices, the algorithm requires at most nlog(2)(n)+5n objective function evaluations. In contrast, existing methods for nonconcave problems require n(2) evaluations in the worst case. For concave problems, the solution technique can be combined with a method exploiting concavity to reduce evaluations to 14n+2log(2)(n). A version of the algorithm exploiting monotonicity in two-state variables allows for even more efficient solutions. The algorithm can also be efficiently employed in a common class of problems that do not have monotone policies, including problems with many state and choice variables. In the sovereign default model of Arellano (2008) and in the real business cycle model, the algorithm reduces run times by an order of magnitude for moderate grid sizes and orders of magnitude for larger ones. Sufficient conditions for monotonicity and code are provided.","[Gordon, Grey; Qiu, Shi] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Gordon, G (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",greygordon@gmail.com; shiqiu@indiana.edu,,,,,,,36,1,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

I show that these new facts can be well explained by a standard structural representation of a frictional labor market, a life-cycle version of the job ladder model, in combination with a simple human capital process. Furthermore, I identify endogenous search effort, risk aversion and wealth accumulation, and skill loss in unemployment as key model features that interact with the labor market friction to jointly reconcile the evidence.

A time cost of information arises due to competition - through the expected adverse price movements due to others' trades - causing traders to rush to trade on weak information.

When shared diagnostic capacity is rationed based on reports of symptoms, the decision to report symptoms or not creates a trade-off. On the one hand, rigorous testing of one's locality allows the health agency in that locality to make an informed disease control decision. On the other hand, reducing the availability of diagnostic capacity for the other localities increases the probability that the disease will spread from an untested area where the disease is not controlled in the absence of more evidence of an outbreak. Symptoms are over-reported (respectively, reported truthfully, or under-reported) when the cost of disease control is sufficiently small (respectively, in some intermediate range, or sufficiently large). The rates of reporting suspicions decrease as the cost of disease control increases because the localities remain exposed more often and the health agencies prefer to reduce the risk of disease transmission by letting other agencies become informed. If the disease incidence decreases or infectiousness increases, symptoms are reported less frequently. If the precision of private signals increases, the extent of over-reporting of symptoms may increase. For different values of the parameters it can be socially optimal to subsidize or tax requests for additional investigations and confirmatory testing.","[Saak, Alexander E.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K ST NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Hennessy, David A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Michigan State University,"Saak, AE (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K ST NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",asaak@cgiar.org; hennes64@anr.msu.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

I seek to unpack the trust-organization nexus, focusing on the role of employers' inferences about employees' trustworthiness. Integrating extant literatures, I posit that employers use group membership-and specific grouplevel traits-as an observable signal concerning individual employees' trustworthiness and decide how much autonomy to grant to employees that have similar observable individual-level qualities but belong to different, easily recognizable social groups. Empirical analysis of job autonomy differentials between groups of migrants with different ethnonational identities reveals systematic patterns of variation that cannot be explained on the basis of observable employee traits alone. Hence, the evidence strongly supports the signalling value of group membership, demonstrating an important real-world feature of trust governing workplace organization.","[van Hoorn, Andre] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Hoorn, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",A.van.Hoorn@fm.ru.nl,,"van Hoorn, Andre/0000-0001-8443-3169",,,,,49,1,2,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Low-skill (high-skill) automation corresponds to tasks performed by low-skill (high-skill) labor being taken over by capital. Automation displaces the type of labor it directly affects, depressing its wage. Through ripple effects, automation also affects the real wage of other workers. Counteracting these forces, automation creates a positive productivity effect, pushing up the price of all factors. Because capital adjusts to keep the interest rate constant, the productivity effect dominates in the long run.

In this paper, we propose a stock market model in which participation depends upon an attractiveness measure related to the market activity and the fundamental value of the market. A market maker adjusts the stock price with respect to the current endogenous excess market demand which, in turn, depends on the demands of the different types of agents populating the economy.

Using a unique dataset which allows us to observe the worldwide activities of a large panel of multinational firms, we test how limitations of interest tax deductibility, so-called thin-capitalization rules, and regulations of transfer pricing by the host country affect investment and employment of foreign subsidiaries. The results indicate that introducing a typical thin-capitalization rule or making it more tight exerts significant adverse effects on FDI and employment in high-tax countries. Moreover, in countries that impose thin-capitalization rules, the tax-rate sensitivity of FDI is increased. Regulations of transfer pricing, however, are not found to exert significant effects on FDI or employment.","[Buettner, Thiess] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Buettner, Thiess] CESifo, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Overesch, Michael] Univ Cologne, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany; [Wamser, Georg] Univ Tubingen, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Wamser, Georg] CESifo, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Ifo Institut; University of Cologne; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut,"Buettner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.;Buettner, T (通讯作者)，CESifo, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",thiess.buettner@fau.de; overesch@wiso.uni-koeln.de; georg.wamser@uni-tuebingen.de,"Overesch, Michael/AAZ-6573-2021","Overesch, Michael/0000-0002-1531-0357; Buettner, Thiess/0000-0001-7490-0122",German Science Foundation (DFG),German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank seminar participants at the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, at CESifo, Munich, and at the Free University of Berlin, for helpful comments.

We systematically explore the role of international capital mobility and the portfolio balance channel in terms of macroeconomic (in) stability when the government follows a commonly-adopted interest-rate feedback rule. In a one-traded-good model, the steady-state equilibrium, in general, is locally determinate; international capital mobility stabilizes the economy against business cycle fluctuations under a simple interest-rate feedback rule. In a two-good (traded and non-traded goods) model, the relationship between equilibrium (in) determinacy and the aggressiveness of interest rate rules is not monotonic, and crucially depends on households' portfolio preferences. These results suggest that a unified interest rate rule can end up with very different consequences of macroeconomic (in) stability in an open economy from those in a closed economy.","[Chang, Wen-ya; Tsai, Hsueh-fang] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Juin-jen] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Lin, Hsieh-yu] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",Fu Jen Catholic University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chang, JJ (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.",jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022","Lin, Hsieh-Yu/0000-0002-9193-564X",National Science Council,"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We thank two anonymous referees as well as Been-Lon Chen, Jang-Ting Guo, Ching-Chong Lai, and Ping Wang for their helpful suggestions and insightful comments on an earlier version of this paper, whose inputs have led to a much improved paper.

Total lifetime labour supply, however, decreases by 3.4 months, because the positive effect of delayed retirement on labour supply is cancelled out by a reduction in working hours in the years before full retirement. The impact of gradual retirement schemes is, however, heterogeneous across groups of workers. Workers in bad health who gain access to gradual retirement postpone their retirement by 1.7 months more than workers in good health. This suggests that introduction of gradual retirement alleviates, to a certain extent, the health-related burden that employees in poor health may experience in carrying out their work. Nevertheless, introduction of gradual retirement reduces the total labour supply of both groups of workers. Financial incentives, either in terms of changing pension income or the price of leisure, also affect expected retirement age, but the impact of these financial incentives does not differ with the possibility of gradual retirement. Finally, we find that gradual retirement is not a preferred option among workers, as the large majority prefers full retirement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Which one occurs depends on the composition of the populations and how critical the choice is for different types of individuals.

We apply stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to estimate the efficiency and calculate profit and cost efficiency with and without taking credit losses into consideration. In terms of cost efficiency, banks are nearly homogeneous and improved their efficiency after the crisis. Banks, however, are extremely heterogeneous in terms of profit efficiency. During the crisis, a gradual improvement could be observed across the sector after the initial downturn. Since the operating conditions of the household and the corporate credit markets are different, we estimated the intensity of competition separately for both the markets. While the Lerner index showed strong market power in the household credit market, the corporate credit market was characterised by intense competition. Regarding efficiency, various models often resulted in different conclusions, especially in the case of cost efficiency. Therefore we recommend that the regulatory decision-making process should always consider the results of several models. Moreover, the Lerner indices demonstrate that it might be important to use disaggregated models when modelling the features of credit markets.","[Hosszu, Zsuzsanna; Dancsik, Balint] MNB, Budapest, Hungary; [Hosszu, Zsuzsanna] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Hosszu, Z (通讯作者)，MNB, Budapest, Hungary.;Hosszu, Z (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.",hosszuzs@mnb.hu; dancsikb@mnb.hu,,,,,,,37,3,5,0,14,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We find that in recent turbulent times, formation of inflation expectations by professional forecasters has displayed less inertia with the increased role of the perceived inflation target. Despite its slightly negative trend observed recently, the perceived target has remained broadly consistent with the ECB's announced inflation target. The direct impact of ECB inflation projections on expectations is minor, but growing marginally. However, inflation expectations remain consistent with the views and preferences of the ECB, which suggests effective management of expectations. Our results have implications for the conduct of ECB monetary policy, emphasising the need to monitor risks for price stability and expectations' de-anchoring in the context of complex models of their formation and for macroeconomic modelling, stressing the need to analyse monetary policy communication and changes in expectation formation over time.","[Lyziak, Tomasz] Narodowy Bank Polski, Ul Swietokrzyska 11-21, PL-00919 Warsaw, Poland; [Paloviita, Maritta] Bank Finland, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Narodowy Bank Polski; Bank of Finland,"Paloviita, M (通讯作者)，Bank Finland, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",Tomasz.Lyziak@nbp.pl; Maritta.Paloviita@bof.fi,,"Lyziak, Tomasz/0000-0002-0488-4259",,,,,51,10,10,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Some have shifted to low-income countries, while other have been permanently lost due the introduction of labor-saving technologies. Concurrently, many comparatively low-wage jobs have been created in services, for example in fast food and retailing. This paper uses a dynamic panel of 27 high and middle income countries from 1991 to 2014 to estimate the effects of declining industrial employment shares on income inequality. The analysis shows that industrial employment is significantly negatively associated with income inequality. Additionally, the results suggest that it is the middle-earners that have borne the largest burden in terms of inequality increases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Economic instruments play a fundamental role to increase the participation of the landowners in renewable energy schemes. A discrete choice experiment was conducted using a mail survey to 268 private forest landowners from the Andalusia region (southern Spain). The aim was to examine forest landowners' willingness to implement afforestation schemes considering short rotation plantations based on woody energy crops (eucalyptus, paulownia and poplar) and traditional tree species (holm oak and pine). Results show that afforestation with holm oak is the preferred alternative followed by woody energy crops. According to the experiment results, the participation of about half of the Andalusian forest owners in a woody energy crops scheme would imply a public expenditure in incentives for this land use change of 265 million of euros, i.e. an unrealistic figure given the current institutional framework for renewables in Europe. Finally, it is shown that compensations to forest landowners are affected by the payment timeframe and that the discount rate implicitly used by landowners exceeds the 4% rate commonly used in forest economics literature.

Impulse responses are obtained using a state-dependent model with direct projections, in which multipliers depend on the state of credit markets. Identification of the effects of fiscal stimulus and austerity measures is achieved by distinguishing between unanticipated increases and decreases in government spending. The empirical results imply that the financial environment matters. Expansionary fiscal policies are associated with large multipliers during credit bust episodes, and spending increases likewise foster economic growth in periods of rapid credit expansion, albeit to a lesser extent. In contrast, the output effect of contractionary fiscal policies is never statistically different from zero. Regime-specific multipliers of the individual components of GDP and the unemployment rate suggest that reductions in public expenditure should help constrain the economy during unsustainable credit booms, whereas spending increases in financial recessions should facilitate the repair of private sector balance sheets in order to revive market confidence and boost economic recovery.","[Tamas Borsi, Mihaly] Univ Ramon Llull, IQS Sch Management, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull; Institut Quimic de Sarria,"Borsi, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Ramon Llull, IQS Sch Management, Via Augusta 390, Barcelona 08017, Spain.",mihaly.borsi@iqs.edu,"Borsi, Mihaly/J-2050-2019","Borsi, Mihaly/0000-0001-7569-6207",,,,,59,5,8,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

An ordered probit model, which is designed to model the choice between discrete alternatives, was preferred for the econometric analysis. Our results highlight the fact that knowledge-based workers perceived significantly higher job satisfaction than less-knowledge-based workers. Evidence suggests that financial (only satisfaction with social benefits provided by firm) and non-financial (work organisation, labour relations and skills and training) job dimensions are the most important determinants of knowledge-based workers satisfaction in Spain.

Transaction costs and collective action theories are used to characterize disturbances and responses. Disturbances are characterized by looking at the uncertainty they generate, their frequency, the distance of the transacting partners they affect, and their impact on asset-specific transactions. Responses are assessed based on the collective action tasks they involve and classified into coordination and cooperation responses. A qualitative comparative analysis confirms two pathways that are sufficient for the emergence of cooperation responses. The first path is congruent with transaction costs theory, and points to disturbances that are frequent and asset specific; the second path supports relational theory, and points to disturbances that emerge progressively from within the system. Other patterns include the tendency of irrigation associations to delegate to external entities when disturbances are external and occur frequently; and the adaptation of existing institutions when the disturbances are internal and progressive.","[Villamayor-Tomas, Sergio] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Villamayor-Tomas, S (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Inst Environm Sci & Technol ICTA, Barcelona, Spain.",villamayortomas@gmail.com,,,,,,,52,13,14,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Currently, digitalization seems to favor female labor force, since women face on average lower risk of being replaced by machines, as compared to men. Women's often superior social skills represent a comparative advantage in the digital age, and this is particularly so when social skills are complemented with higher education and advanced digital literacy.

World Trade Organization members included subsidies in a key renewable resource sector (fisheries) in the Doha round of trade negotiations, which subsequently stalled. This paper develops a simple model to show why prospects for a deal on fisheries subsidies may be difficult. Typically international spillover effects create incentives among exporters to negotiate reductions in subsidies: one country's subsidy worsens other exporters' terms of trade. These incentives may not exist in fisheries for 3 reasons. First, open access fishery supply curves are backward bending and so if fisheries are depleted, subsidies raise prices (by reducing sustainable harvesting) and improve other exporters' terms of trade. Second, ecological constraints put an upper bound on sustainable harvesting. This means that subsidies that increase employment may have no effect on output and hence generate no international spillover effects if resources are well managed. And third, even if governments were compelled to reduce fishery subsidies, there may be no spillover benefits to trading partners because of policy substitution: governments would be motivated to weaken other regulations targeting the fish sector.

The level of disaggregation we consider is the highest available and is unprecedented in the empirical literature. More specifically, public consumption and public investment are decomposed into various subcategories, which are measured at the levels of the federal (defence and non-defence), and state and local governments. For each subcategory, we estimate a structural vector autoregression that identifies public spending shocks through the conditional heteroskedasticity of the structural disturbances, thus relaxing the identifying restrictions commonly used in the literature. Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in the effects of public spending shocks on output both across subcategories and government levels. Shocks to spending on durables and structures are found to have the largest and most persistent effect on aggregate output, with a peak multiplier that exceeds 1. Our results also suggest that there is little association between the size of a given category of public expenditures and the magnitude of its effect on output.","[Bouakez, Hafedh; Normandin, Michel] HEC Montreal, Dept Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Larocque, Denis] HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Normandin, M (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Appl Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",michel.normandin@hec.ca,,,SSHRC; FRQSC; HEC Montreal,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); FRQSC(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC)); HEC Montreal,"Financial support from SSHRC, FRQSC and HEC Montreal is gratefully acknowledged.

Imported inputs are an important source of technology inflows. Previous research on the implications of imported inputs overlooked their potential effect on the demand for managing the new incoming knowledge. Adopting the case of India, this paper presents a first empirical attempt to fill this gap. Using detailed firm-level data that uniquely distinguishes between the compensations of managers and non-managers, and exploiting the exogenous nature of India's Eight-Plan trade reform, we investigate the potential causal link between input-trade liberalization and the demand for managers relative to non-managers. We find that a decrease in input tariffs increases the relative demand for managers, primarily in domestic firms that use the imported inputs to produce intermediate goods. Specifically, a 10% drop in input tariffs induces, on average, a 1-1.5% increase in the compensation share of managers, manifested via increases in both their number as well as average wages and bonuses. These patterns are: (i) observed across the firms' size distribution; (ii) applicable for both exporting and non-exporting firms; (iii) stronger in family-run firms that operate under flexible labor market regulations; (iv) relatively more dominant in the short-run. In addition, we show that unlike changes in input tariffs, import competition does not affect the relative demand for managers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper demonstrates a new margin of adjustment, namely, provision of trade credit. A simple model predicts that an increase in competitive pressures will lead exporters to provide trade credit and lower prices and that the price adjustment will be attenuated by trade credit provision. These predictions are tested in the context of an exogenous shock, the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), a quota system governing trade in textiles and clothing until the end-2004. The analysis focuses on Turkey which was not subject to quotas in the EU and thus faced an increase in competition after the quotas on China had been removed. The results suggest that in the post-MFA period Turkish exports of products with binding MFA quotas prior to the shock saw an increase in the provision of trade credit and a drop in prices relative to the other products. There is also evidence that provision of trade credit generated a dampening effect on the price response to the increase in competition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, if there is uncertainty on a potential violator's guilt, judges' and juries' willingness to impose punishment may decrease in its magnitude. Thus, increasing the magnitude of punishment may backfire, when the reduced punishment probability is anticipated by potential violators. Based on a theoretical model, our paper is the first to analyze the interdependency of violation and punishment behavior in a laboratory experiment, and to contrast it to the standard partial equilibrium perspective on deterrence that considers the punishment probability to be independent of the fine size. Varying both the magnitude of fines and the degree of uncertainty shows that, in case of legal uncertainty, the deterrent effect of higher fines is far less pronounced than if the punishment probability was exogenous.

Some of this is due to a selection effect: the most productive producers self-select into importing because only they can overcome the fixed costs of developing trade relationships with foreign input suppliers. Some of this is due to a technology effect: any given producer would have higher variable profits from operating the technology using imported intermediate goods. To account for the roles of these theoretical mechanisms, we develop a simple model of a competitive small open economy in which heterogeneous firms endogenously decide whether to use imported intermediate goods. The technology that uses imported intermediate goods is superior but requires a higher fixed cost of operating.

A seller offers a menu of bundles before a consumer learns his willingness to pay, and the consumer experiences gain-loss utility with reference to his prior (rational) expectations about contingent consumption. With binary consumer types, the seller finds it optimal to abandon screening under an intermediate range of loss aversion if the low willingness-to-pay consumer is sufficiently likely. We also identify sufficient conditions under which partial or full pooling dominates screening with a continuum of types. Our predictions are consistent with several observed practices of price discrimination.","[Hahn, Jong-Hee; Kim, Sang-Hyun] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Kim, Jinwoo; Lee, Jihong] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Yonsei University; Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",hahnjh@yonsei.ac.kr; jikim72@snu.ac.kr; sang.kim@yonsei.ac.kr; jihonglee@snu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Sang-Hyun/0000-0001-6171-5382",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5A2A03065638]; Institute of Economic Research of Seoul National University,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Institute of Economic Research of Seoul National University,This paper was previously circulated under the title Screening Loss Averse Consumers.

We find a positive relationship between the fWHR of the governor and the level of repression in his region.

Despite charging lower prices, firms in larger marketplaces earn higher profits. Under free entry, all firms cluster in one marketplace provided that search frictions are large enough.

Using cluster analysis, we determine the general similarities and differences among the analysed countries and show several broadly different groupings that roughly, but not exclusively follow the divide speculated in some previous studies.

We apply recent methodological advances in the estimation of production functions together with information on prices and quantities to estimate physical productivity, markups, marginal costs and proxies for product quality. Using a propensity score reweighting estimator, we find that acquisitions are associated with increases in quantities and markups and lower marginal costs on average. These changes are most pronounced if acquirers are located in technologically advanced countries. We also provide evidence that the quality of products increases while quality-adjusted prices fall upon acquisitions.

If, however, lagged endogenous variables are needed as control variables in the one-step method, then the conditions for validity of the two methods are the same.","Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University,"Stock, JH (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",james_stock@harvard.edu,,,,,,,62,172,207,6,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

We access a rarely studied U.S. bank-level regulatory dataset to assess at a quarterly frequency how changes in the U.S. Federal funds rate (before the crisis) and quantitative easing (after the onset of the crisis) affect changes in cross-border claims by U.S. banks across countries, maturities and sectors, and also affect changes in claims by their foreign affiliates. We find robust evidence consistent with the existence of a potent global bank lending channel. In response to changes in U.S. monetary conditions, U.S. banks strongly adjust their cross-border claims in both the pre- and post-crisis period. However, we also find that U.S. bank affiliate claims respond mainly to host country monetary conditions.

For research purposes, 32 attributes of destination competitiveness were rated with two parallel five-point Likert type scales - one by which tourists rated the importance of the attribute and the other by which they expressed their satisfaction with the same. A total of 378 validly completed questionnaires were collected and served as a basis for data analysis. By using a factor analysis, the most important destination competitiveness factors were extracted. Based on this factor solution, Importance-Performance Analysis (I.P.A.) was performed. Using I.P.A., this article examines the efficiency of the resources allocation based on isolated factors, and the possibility of creating management strategies to improve the competitiveness of this destination. The results of this study indicate that the factors of food and environment are of primary importance for tourists when choosing this tourism destination. Research results will be of great importance for tourism managers in the destination, as well as for authorities of local governments in the district, to better understand strengths and weaknesses of identified competitiveness factors and utilise them as a starting point for tourism development.","[Djeri, Lukrecija; Stamenkovic, Predrag; Blesic, Ivana; Ivkov, Milan] Univ Novi Sad, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Fac Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia; [Milicevic, Snezana] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Hotel Management & Tourism, Vrnjacka Banja, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Kragujevac,"Stamenkovic, P (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Dept Geog Tourism & Hotel Management, Fac Sci, Novi Sad, Serbia.",stamenkovic.predrag@vpsle.edu.rs,"Blešić, Ivana/AAO-7662-2020; Milićević, Snežana/J-6395-2018","Blešić, Ivana/0000-0003-2534-3280; Milićević, Snežana/0000-0002-1972-9585; Ivkov, Milan/0000-0002-0180-2051",,,,,56,14,14,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

From a theoretical point of view, such linkages at the macroeconomic level may root in between-firm as well as within-firm linkages and originate from information spillovers across or within firms in exploring unknown markets, and vertical linkages between production plants across different locations within the firm. We use data on the universe of German multinational enterprises (MNEs) to empirically explore how marginal investments at one foreign affiliate depend on investments at other affiliates within the same MNE. The empirical approach employs two channels or modes of cross-affiliate interdependence: mere geography (capturing horizontal linkages through correlated learning and horizontal competition within the firm) and input-output relationships within or across industries (which capture vertical linkages). Adding to earlier findings at the aggregate level, we find evidence of a significant interdependence of investments within the firm. In the firm-level data at hand, vertical linkages appear to be more important than horizontal ones. Investments at one location tend to stimulate investments at other locations of the same MNE, particularly if input linkages are strong. The opposite seems to be true for output linkages. Beyond vertical linkages, mere geographic proximity matters only to a minor extent. This suggests that evidence of linkages through geographic closeness at aggregate data levels accrue mainly to reasons of vertical linkages within networks of affiliates.

We theoretically and experimentally investigate one version of whistle-blowing incentive: leniency programs aimed at curbing anticompetitive activities by firms, by reducing the punishment faced by a cartel member who reports the cartel's behavior. The theoretical model captures the two important effects of whistle-blowing incentives: the direct effect, a reduction in the stability of cartels, and the counterproductive indirect effect, an increase in the incentives to form cartels in the first place by lowering the cost of exiting them. As these point in opposite directions, the net theoretical effect is indeterminate. Our laboratory experiment compares two leniency programsfull immunity from fines and partial immunityagainst a baseline with no whistle-blowing incentives in place. We find evidence of the direct effect but not the indirect effect, and thus both programs reduce the extent of price fixing and the damage associated with it.","[Feltovich, Nick] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Hamaguchi, Yasuyo] Nagoya City Univ, Fac Econ, Nagoya, Aichi 4678501, Japan",Monash University; Nagoya City University,"Feltovich, N (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",nicholas.feltovich@monash.edu; yhamagu@econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp,,"Feltovich, Nick/0000-0002-9385-7833",United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21730231]; Nomura Foundation for Social Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21730231] Funding Source: KAKEN,"United Kingdom's Office of Fair Trading; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Nomura Foundation for Social Science; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Some of this research took place while Feltovich was at University of Aberdeen.

In this paper, we consider whether it would be more growth-enhancing for euro area countries to, instead, use capital income tax cuts. To address this issue, we focus on the open-economy dimension and make simplifying assumptions concerning the completeness of insurance markets. Using a DSGE model calibrated for France within the euro area, we show that the increase in output resulting from tax cuts on capital income would indeed be higher than the increase in output resulting from tax cuts on labour, both in the short and long run. Importantly, the strong response of output to capital income tax cuts appears to be partly explained by the particularly high level of capital income taxes in France. Moreover, such tax cuts would be less efficient if they were expected to be only temporary. Finally, we illustrate our main points through a recent fiscal package implemented in France, which combines labour and capital income tax cuts. After briefly assessing this package, we find that investment and real output would have been more strongly boosted in the medium run if this package had been focused to a larger extent on reductions in capital income taxes.","[Font, Barbara Castelletti; Clerc, Pierrick; Lemoine, Matthieu] Banque France, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Clerc, P (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",Barbara.CastellettiFont@banque-france.fr; Pierrick.Clerc@live.fr; Matthieu.Lemoine@banque-france.fr,,,,,,,25,4,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We develop a simple election model where (i) reforms are costly for voters and politicians and these costs increase with the extent of policy change, and (ii) politicians differ in their ability to carry out reforms efficiently. We identify a so-called Reform Dilemma, which manifests itself in two variants. From a static perspective, low-reform-ability politicians are elected when political parties are polarized, who then impose high costs on citizens for each reform step. This property of elections arises as low reform ability is a substitute for policy commitment. From a dynamic perspective, incumbents may choose socially undesirable policies to align the social need for reform with their own reform ability and are thus re-elected regardless of their reform ability.","[Gersbach, Hans; Tejada, Oriol] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Gersbach, Hans] CEPR, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, CER ETH Ctr Econ Res, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.;Gersbach, H (通讯作者)，CEPR, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",hgersbach@ethz.ch; toriol@ethz.ch,,"Tejada, Oriol/0000-0002-4819-0259",,,,,54,3,3,1,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

We analyze its potential impact on the world, including both insiders and outsiders of the agreement, using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under imperfect competition. In our simulation, TTIP consists of reductions of tariffs, non tariff barriers and barriers to FDI. Our results show that the FDI component, which has often been neglected in previous studies, would contribute to nearly half of the overall impact of TTIP for the US and nearly one third for the EU. Insiders would heavily benefit from TTIP, whereas, it would be slightly negative for outsiders (Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Other Advanced Countries), except for the big Asian economies (China, Japan and India), which would remain unaffected. The slightly negative effects would turn into positive with an inclusive TTIP (i.e., one avoiding third country discriminating rules and standards). An inclusive TTIP would benefit both insiders, who would gain more than with the standard TTIP, and outsiders, who would be better off than without the TTIP. Welfare, GDP, wages, as well as aggregate imports and exports of the world economy would clearly increase following either a modest or ambitious I TIP agreement. Our results suggest that policy makers should resume TTIP negotiations and try to strike an inclusive and ambitious deal.","[Latorre, Maria C.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Estudios Estadist, Avda Puerta Hierro S-N,Ciudad Univ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Yonezawa, Hidemichi] ETH, Zurich, Switzerland",Complutense University of Madrid; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Latorre, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Estudios Estadist, Avda Puerta Hierro S-N,Ciudad Univ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",nununozla@ucm.es; hyonezaw@ethz.ch,"Yonezawa, Hidemichi/ADE-5543-2022; Latorre, Maria C./AAF-9316-2022; Latorre, Maria C./AFK-2004-2022","Latorre, Maria C./0000-0001-8741-1897; Latorre, Maria C./0000-0001-8741-1897; Yonezawa, Hidemichi/0000-0002-9658-7226",Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-78422-R]; International Development (CID) at the Harvard Kennedy School; Real Colegio Complutense,Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); International Development (CID) at the Harvard Kennedy School; Real Colegio Complutense,"Maria C.

The results indicate that more foreign direct investment, weaker exchange rates, and other factors deepen the electronics value chain in ASEAN countries. The findings also indicate that, since 2001, price competition between China and ASEAN in labor-intensive goods has abated. Intermediate goods are now more important for ASEAN's labor-intensive exports and China is the leading supplier of these goods. Thus supply chains are playing a greater role in driving ASEAN's exports. The paper concludes by considering how Southeast Asian countries can promote the slicing up of the value chain.

To test this hypothesis, we evaluate the effects of Mainland-Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) on Macau's real GDP growth rate and its volatility, as well as the costs of exposure to the anti-corruption campaign from mainland China using a counterfactual analysis. Counterfactuals of Macau are constructed by exploiting the inter-dependence among different economic entities and the optimal control group is selected with a leave-n,-out cross-validation method. Our results support the hypothesis. CEPA raised the annual real GDP growth rate of Macau by 20.76% from 2004 to 2007, meanwhile it increased the volatility of real GDP growth rate by 35%, and the anti-corruption campaign reduced the annual real GDP growth rate by 17.54% from 2013 to 2016. Our findings imply that free trade could be a double-edged sword for a small and highly specialized economy and the gains of free trade can be enlarged by reducing its vulnerability.","[Yin, Hua] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Shanghai Dev, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Du, Zaichao] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, 555 Liutai Ave, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lin] Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp, 700 Montreal Rd, Montreal, ON K1A 0P7, Canada",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp, 700 Montreal Rd, Montreal, ON K1A 0P7, Canada.",yin.hua@mail.shufe.edu.cn; duzc@swufe.edu.cn; zhanglin2161@icloud.com,"Du, Zaichao/HCJ-0350-2022",,,,,,34,8,8,4,24,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

These countries pursue open door policies. Most of the foreign revenues of the region stem from oil and gas exports. Thus, how to manage the production and exports of fossil resources is of great importance. This study aims to analyse the effects of quality of democracy, government size, and the degree of openness in explaining depletion of reserves between 1985 and 2015. After testing for panel unit root and co-integration, a panel data model was estimated considering random effects. The results indicate that democratisation and political stability causes higher depletion of oil. In addition, government size affects depletion in a non-linear form, so that oil production is maximised, when government expenditure accounts for nearly 14% of GDP, on average. Furthermore, trade openness positively impacts on the oil depletion. In this case study, higher oil depletion follows strengthening democratic foundations, resizing the public sector, expanding politico-economic ties with trade partners, and applying the modern technology in the upstream oil industries.","[Agheli, Lotfali] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Econ Res Inst, Tehran, Iran",Tarbiat Modares University,"Agheli, L (通讯作者)，Tarbiat Modares Univ, Econ Res Inst, Tehran, Iran.",aghelik@modares.ac.ir,"Agheli, Lotfali/AAS-7727-2020","Agheli, Lotfali/0000-0003-1043-346X",Tarbiat Modares University,Tarbiat Modares University,"I am very grateful to Tarbiat Modares University for supporting this research by providing access to web, scientific journals and databases.",,32,1,1,0,6,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Capital accumulation changes bureaucratic quality through occupational choice in two cases. In the first case, the bureaucratic quality improves through economic development, and, in the second case, bureaucratic quality worsens or remains low. In both cases, good quality of bureaucracy cannot be realized without economic development. Workers and bureaucrats earn a higher income under a low-quality bureaucracy. A change in quality from low to high expands income inequality between unskilled and skilled individuals and contracts inequality among skilled individuals.","[Akimoto, Kiyoka] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Akimoto, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",sge001ak@student.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17J05419] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,24,1,1,3,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

We study allocations of resources which are immune from envy when comparisons take place between coalitions. The model allows negligible and non-negligible traders, partially informed about the true state of nature at the time of consumption, to exchange any number, possibly infinite, of commodities. Our analysis is based on the Aubin approach to coalitions and cooperation. Namely, on a notion of cooperation allowing traders to take part in one or more coalitions simultaneously, employing only shares of their endowments (participation rates). We introduce and study in detail the notion of coalition fairness with participation rates (or Aubin c-fairness) and show that flexibility in cooperation permits to recover the failure of fairness properties of equilibrium allocations. Our results provide applications to several market outcomes (ex-post core, fine core, ex-post competitive equilibria, rational expectations equilibria) and emphasize the consequences of the convexification effect due to participation rates for models with large traders and infinitely many commodities.","[Basile, Achille; Graziano, Maria Gabriella; Tarantino, Ciro] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Via Cintia, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Graziano, Maria Gabriella] CSEF, Via Cintia, I-80126 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Basile, A (通讯作者)，Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Via Cintia, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",basile@unina.it; mgrazian@unina.it; ctarant@unina.it,,"TARANTINO, Ciro/0000-0002-5691-0770; BASILE, Achille/0000-0002-0264-7743",PRIN Robust decision making in markets and organization [20103S5RN3],PRIN Robust decision making in markets and organization,"The authors thank seminar participants in the SWET conference (Paris, July 2015), in the 15th SAET conference (Cambridge, July 2015) and in the XXV EWGET (Glasgow, June 2016) for helpful comments.

First, product partition model-K-means (PPM-KM) model is used to detect change points in the oil price sequence. Next, we apply a time-varying transition probability Markov regime switching (TVTP-MRS) model to identify the regime-switching characteristic. Then, we use Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to filtrate main determinants at each regime. Finally, the time-varying parameter structure time series model (TVP-STSM) is used to decompose the oil sequence, capture the time-variation of coefficients in volatile upward regime, and forecast the crude oil price. Compared with some other competing models and benchmark model of ARIMA, the newly proposed method shows superior forecasting ability in four statistical tests. Besides, we make scenario prediction on WTI crude oil price to examine the implementation effect of OPEC cut-off agreement at the end of 2016. OPEC production and U.S. shale oil production are used as two scenario variables, and the WTI price is forecasted fluctuating around 50 dollar/barrel based on three scenario prediction. We conclude that WTI crude oil price would take a shock upstream tendency in the short-term but the rising scope would not be large. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using twinning as a natural experiment, we do not find evidence on the negative effects of fertility on parental labor supply. By contrast, we find that the twinning-induced increase in fertility significantly enhances the coresidence of grandparents in rural China.

In contrast to the conventional twin deficit hypothesis between the current account, which comprises many items out of governments' scope of maneuvering, and the budget deficit, we track the causal link between Egypt's merchandise trade deficit and the budget deficit. We begin first by examining the conventional twin deficit hypothesis using a VAR model, which implies short run reverse causation running from the current account deficit to the budget deficit. Second, as cointegration exists between the budget deficit and the merchandise trade deficit, we run a multivariate VECM model which refutes the twin deficit hypothesis in favor of the current account targeting hypothesis. In policy terms, ameliorating Egypt's trade balance would ultimately improve its fiscal balance as well. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Using an overlapping generations model tailored to the Australian economy, we examine immediate and gradual eliminations of the existing fiscal deficit with (i) temporary income tax hikes, (ii) temporary consumption tax hikes and (iii) temporary transfer payment cuts. The simulation results indicate that all three fiscal measures result in favourable long-run macroeconomic and welfare outcomes, but have adverse consequences in the short run that are particularly severe under the immediate fiscal consolidation plan. Moreover, our results show that cutting transfer payments leads to the worst welfare outcome for all generations currently alive. Increasing the consumption tax rate results in smaller welfare losses, but compared to raising income taxes, the current poor households pay much larger welfare costs. The adverse effects on wellbeing of current generations highlight political constraints when implementing a fiscal consolidation p lan. However, after compensating current generations for all welfare losses, there is still an overall efficiency gain. This implies possibilities to devise a fiscal consolidation plan supported by a compensation scheme to improve wellbeing of future generations.","[Kudrna, George] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res CEPAR, 223 Anzac Parade, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia; [Chung Tran] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian National University,"Kudrna, G (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res CEPAR, 223 Anzac Parade, Kensington, NSW 2033, Australia.",g.kudma@unsw.edu.au,,"Tran, Chung/0000-0001-8252-469X; Kudrna, George/0000-0002-7553-0618",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR) [CE110001029],Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR)(Australian Research Council),"We would like to thank Alan Woodland and John Piggott and participants of the Treasury and CEPAR Joint Workshop on Fiscal Policy Modelling, the Sydney Macroeconomic Reading Group Workshop and the 2nd Workshop of the Australasian Macroeconomic Society (WAMS) 2015 held at the University of New South Wales for comments and feedback.

The standard Shapley value is modified so that losing bidders do not make or receive any payments. The new rule, called the balanced winner contribution (BWC) rule, satisfies a variation of Myerson's balanced contribution property. The payment rule is fair in the sense that, with respect to reported values, the members of every pair of traders make equal contributions to each other's share of the gains from trade. BWC payments can be used in single-item auctions and more complex auctions and exchanges with multiple items and package bidding. A series of examples is presented to illustrate how the BWC rule works and how the payments compare to those based on competitive prices, the core, and the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism.

Financial development is measured by six individual indicators and by a comprehensive indicator obtained through the PCA method. We also account for regional heterogeneity by dividing our sample into three regions: eastern region, central region, and western region. We underline our findings in three aspects. First, financial development measured by most individual indicators (m2, credit, revenue of the insurance industry, and stock market value) and the comprehensive one has a significantly negative impact on economic growth. Second, energy consumption can significantly contribute to economic growth in all regions, while no feedback effect is found except in the western region. This result is further supported by the Granger causality tests. Last, financial development in the sense of m2, credit, stock turnover, and the comprehensive indicator can significantly lessen energy consumption in all regions. But this inhibitory effect is found to be largest in the western region, followed by the eastern region, and be smallest in the central region. The Granger causality tests confirm further the existence of heterogeneity across regions. A bidirectional Granger causality between the two variables is found in the eastern region, a unidirectional Granger causality running from energy consumption to financial development is identified in the central region, and no significant causal relationship shows up in the western region. Our findings provide valuable policy implications for China heading for a green economic growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, every year a sizable fraction of workers switch occupations without changing firms. Employees in large firms can sample from a larger selection and across firm mobility is replaced by within firm mobility. Bringing together within and across firm reallocation along with labor market frictions, naturally accounts for the observed differences in worker flows and wages across firms of different sizes.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the new program using a data set consisting of 1,411 of China's western and central counties from 2000 to 2010. It combines the propensity score matching method with the difference-in-differences approach, which helps to avoid selection bias and track the policy impact on variables of interest at each time point. It is found that the non-western local governments tended to manipulate data on income and output growth to maintain the special transfer payments disbursed exclusively to the National Poor Counties. It is also shown that the program failed to improve the infrastructure and sanitary conditions in general.","[Qin, Cong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chong, Terence Tai Leung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chong, Terence Tai Leung] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Lau Chor Tak Inst Global Econ & Finance, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chong, Terence Tai Leung] Nanjing Univ, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Nanjing University,"Chong, TTL (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chong2064@cuhk.edu.hk,,"Chong, Terence Tai Leung/0000-0001-6866-9382",,,,,37,10,11,0,53,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The competiveness of banks is assessed from customers' perspective, highlighting the main factors that influence them in choosing a particular bank. Purpose of the article: The paper aims to assess the determinants influencing bank's competitive ability from customers' perspective by indicating the level of their influence. The following objectives are set: to distinguish the determinants influencing commercial bank's competitive ability, to prepare a methodology for the assessment of factors, to evaluate the importance of the factors using expert evaluation method based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. Methods: A questionnaire was prepared for the experts in order to collect the data; fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was implemented for processing the data. Findings & Value added: The research was conducted in Latvia and Lithuania at the be-ginning of 2017. The results showed that the most important factor for bank's competitive ability in both - Lithuania and Latvia - is customers' trust. Reliability of the bank (both in Latvia and Lithuania) and the privileges of loyal customers (only in Latvia) have gained experts' attention as well. The proposed model of bank's competitive ability allows to evaluate the level of bank's competitiveness effectively, which would help the bank to plan its activities successfully and attract new customers in order to take the leading position in the market.","[Skvarciany, Viktorija; Jureviciene, Daiva] Vinius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Iljins, Juris; Gaile-Sarkane, Enna] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Riga Technical University,"Skvarciany, V (通讯作者)，Vinius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",viktorija.skvarciany@vgtu.lt,"Skvarciany, Viktorija/K-7419-2019; Skvarciany, Viktorija/P-7584-2016","Skvarciany, Viktorija/0000-0001-8022-4124; Skvarciany, Viktorija/0000-0001-8022-4124; Jureviciene, Daiva/0000-0002-0039-6290",,,,,53,13,13,1,22,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The meta-dataset consists of 1661 observations retrieved from 120 papers published over the period 2000-2014. While the role of study design and method-specific characteristics of primary studies is evaluated, the focus concerns regulation in banking. The results are fourfold. First, parametric methods always yield lower levels of banking efficiency than non-parametric studies. Second, banking efficiency is higher in studies using the value-added approach rather than the intermediation method. Third, efficiency scores also depend on the journal's ranking and on the number of observations and variables used in the primary papers. Finally, regulation matters: primary papers focusing on countries with a liberalized banking industry provide higher values for efficiency scores.","[Aiello, Francesco] Univ Calabria, Commenda Di Rende, Italy; [Bonanno, Graziella] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy",University of Calabria; Sapienza University Rome,"Aiello, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Commenda Di Rende, Italy.",f.aiello@unical.it,"Aiello, Francesco/J-1252-2014; Bonanno, Graziella/ABC-1414-2021","Aiello, Francesco/0000-0001-7533-4927; Bonanno, Graziella/0000-0003-4322-332X",,,,,186,33,33,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The related policy decisions are primarily made by teams. In contrast, economic models of global public goods typically assume a single rational decision maker. We use a laboratory experiment to compare team decisions to the decisions of individuals in a finitely repeated public goods game with and without a costly punishment option. Teams of three participants coordinate on decisions either by majority or unanimity rule. We find that, in the absence of a punishment option, teams deciding by the unanimity rule contribute slightly more than individuals. With the punishment option, unanimity teams choose significantly lower levels of punishment and exhibit anti-social punishment less frequently than individuals. A possible explanation is the elimination of extreme preferences for punishment through the coordination process in teams.","[Auerswald, Heike; Thum, Marcel] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Schmidt, Carsten] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Torsvik, Gaute] Univ Oslo, Fac Social Sci, Postboks 1095 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Mannheim; University of Oslo,"Thum, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Business & Econ, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",marcel.thum@tu-dresden.de,,"Thum, Marcel/0000-0002-5071-7849",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LA1106A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Financial support from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Grant no. 01LA1106A) is gratefully acknowledged.,,39,7,8,1,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We empirically investigate whether speculative activity in Chinese futures markets for agricultural commodities destabilizes futures returns. To capture speculative activity a speculation and a hedging ratio are used. Applying GARCH models we first analyse the influence of both ratios on the conditional volatility of eight heavily traded Chinese futures contracts. Additionally, VAR models in conjunction with Granger causality tests, impulse-response analyses and variance decompositions are used to obtain insight into the lead-lag relationship between speculative activity and returns volatility. For most of the commodities, we find a positive influence of the speculation ratio on conditional volatility. The results relying on the hedging ratio are inconclusive. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Origin and destination countries are characterized by substantial differences in incomes, political rights and cultures. Incentives as well as costs shape the decision to migrate. One powerful dynamic effect is that diasporas increase migration, mainly because they lower the cost of migration. Diasporas assist the next wave of migrants by overcoming the high cost of the emigration, in particular when the origin country is far away and poor. The interaction between the diaspora and cultural distance is also significant. Diasporas in culturally distant countries appear to be particularly useful in overcoming the cost of migration. We interpret this as evidence that culturally distant diasporas are less likely to integrate and maintain closer links with their country of origin, while diasporas from culturally similar countries are more likely to integrate and thus be less useful to potential new migrants.","[Collier, Paul] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England; [Collier, Paul] Ctr Study African Econ, Oxford, England; [Hoeffler, Anke] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Hoeffler, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Ctr Study African Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",anke.hoeffler@economics.ox.ac.uk,,"Hoeffler, Anke/0000-0002-0684-6096",European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [290752],European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),"We would like to thank the anonymous referee, Michel Beine, Simone Bertoli, Stephen Fisher and Mariola Pytlikova for comments on an earlier draft and David Hendry and Jennifer Castle for help with Oxmetrics.

In contrast, reducing the VAT rate on digital newspapers has the opposite effects; it increases prices and leads to lower sales. This is not true for ebooks, but a low-tax policy is still ineffective if the aim is to reduce prices.

The results confirm the presence of a long-run association between tourism receipts (% of GDP), exchange rate, capital per worker and output per worker. The regression results show a 1% increase in tourism receipts results in a 0.03 and 0.06% increase in output per worker in the short-run and long-run, respectively. A unidirectional causality is noted from tourism to output per worker; from exchange rate to output per worker and capital per worker; and from output to capital, in per worker terms. Finally, we note that although structural breaks periods have negative association with economic growth, they are not statistically significant.","[Stauvermann, Peter Josef] Changwon Natl Univ, Dept Global Business & Econ, Gyeongnam 9, Sarim Dong 641773, Changwon, South Korea; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ South Pacific, Sch Accounting & Finance, Laucala Campus,Laucala Bay Rd,Suva Private Bag, Suva, Fiji; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ Bolton, Bolton Business Sch, Deane Rd, Bolton BL3 5AB, England; [Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh] Univ Leicester, Leicester Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Kumar, Nikeel N.] Univ Fiji, Sch Econ, Lautoka, Fiji",Changwon National University; University of the South Pacific; University of Bolton; University of Leicester; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Kumar, RR (通讯作者)，Univ South Pacific, Sch Accounting & Finance, Laucala Campus,Laucala Bay Rd,Suva Private Bag, Suva, Fiji.;Kumar, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Bolton, Bolton Business Sch, Deane Rd, Bolton BL3 5AB, England.;Kumar, RR (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Leicester Sch Management, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",pstauvermann@t-online.de; kumar_RN@usp.ac.fj; jawad.kazmi5@gmail.com; nikeelk@unifiji.ac.fj,"Stauvermann, Peter Josef/I-3470-2019; Kumar, Nikeel/AAR-6344-2021; Kumar, Ronald/AAK-7991-2020; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/H-4968-2015; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/D-1986-2019; Kumar, Nikeel/AAS-9818-2021","Stauvermann, Peter Josef/0000-0001-7011-2209; Kumar, Nikeel/0000-0001-5950-1027; Kumar, Ronald Ravinesh/0000-0001-9658-4896; Shahzad, Syed Jawad Hussain/0000-0003-3511-6057; Kumar, Nikeel/0000-0001-5950-1027",Changwon National University,Changwon National University,Peter J.

The analysis draws on input-output data from the WIOD project, and in the panel analysed (13 manufacturing industries, 40 countries, 1995-2009) we account for up to 96 % of the international trade in manufacturing inputs. Being particularly interested in the wage effects of offshoring to low-wage countries (LWC), we use precise LWC classifications (varying across industries and time) to decompose overall offshoring by source country. We use a decomposition of the conventional offshoring measure in order to capture its pure international component, which is further instrumented using a gravity-based strategy. According to the estimation results, the negative impact of offshoring on wages mainly concerns low and medium skilled workers. However, in terms of magnitude, the downward pressure on domestic wages exhibited by offshoring to LWC is relatively small.","[Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna; Parteka, Aleksandra] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Wolszczak-Derlacz, J (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",jwo@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Parteka, Aleksandra/AAN-5881-2020; Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/O-4433-2018","Parteka, Aleksandra/0000-0003-1149-6614; Wolszczak-Derlacz, Joanna/0000-0002-3392-5267","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland [DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/02134]","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland","The research has been conducted within the project financed by the National Science Centre (NCN), Poland (decision number DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/02134).

Our paper follows Laubach and Williams (2003) seminal research on natural interest rate. Since the low interest rate environment has become a reality, are we stuck in a secular stagnation world or is just a phase of the financial cycle? We have estimated the dynamics of the Natural Interest rate (NIR) for the Romanian economy between 2004 and 2016. We have found out that the official monetary policy rate was mostly close to the natural rate of interest. The results show that until 2010 the NIR was lower than the monetary policy rate explaining why the output grew faster than its potential value. When the real interest rate is below its equilibrium value, there are upward pressures on inflation. We have estimated the equilibrium interest rate at 3.8%, with two percentages higher than the official monetary policy rate (1.75%). Our estimate of the equilibrium interest rate after 2010 was higher than the official policy rate. In this way, some inflationary pressures may be explained. The results may also suggest that the Central Bank should have raised faster the interest rate. In addition to the inflationary pressure, we also showed that the steady decline of the NIR after the financial crisis of 2009 coincided with an increase in the trend growth of the potential output. Since NIR is unobservable, the uncertainty around the natural rate is large and our results confirm similar findings from the economic literature.","[Acatrinei, Marius] Financial Supervisory Author, Inapoi, Finland; [Armeanu, Dan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania; [Dobrota, Carmen Elena] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Acatrinei, M (通讯作者)，Financial Supervisory Author, Inapoi, Finland.",marius.acatrinei@gmail.com; darmeanu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

In the last years, an increasing number of non-financial firms from emerging economies started to implement a holistic framework for risk management. However, little is known about the impact of ERM adoption on firm value in emerging markets. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effects of ERM implementation on the firm value in different economic environments. The empirical research of this study is conducted using econometric software EViews and panel data techniques. Employing a sample of Romanian listed firms for the pre-crisis period (2001-2007), it has been found that ERM adoption is associated with higher firm values, indicated by a Tobin's Q premium of roughly 46.5 %. Also, it has been found a positive and statistically significant relationship between size and leverage, on one hand, and firm value, on the other hand. Extending the sample over the financial crisis period (2001-2011), it has been found that ERM does not affect firm value in any significant manner. These findings lend support for the recent pressure on firms to adopt more integrated and comprehensive risk management systems.","[Anton, Sorin Gabriel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Carol 1 Ave 22, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Anton, SG (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Carol 1 Ave 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",sorin.anton@uaic.ro,"Anton, Sorin/P-5613-2014","Anton, Sorin/0000-0001-7124-9274",,,,,34,25,28,2,47,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Among literature related to fiscal policy in financial crises, Fernandez-Villaverde (2010) suggests that the fiscal policy multiplier increases in a financial crisis through the Fisher effect. However, we should note that the author simply compared the multiplier computed in the standard new Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) with that in the DSGE with financial accelerator settings. As the financial accelerator is considered effective during both financial crises and normal financial conditions, the author's comparison should be considered insignificant for showing a greater multiplier in the financial crisis. In this study, to make the exact comparison, we first estimate parameters regarding the Fisher effect under each regime separately and then compute and compare the estimated fiscal multipliers using these 2 estimates in the same DSGE model. Using Japanese financial data that provide enough observations under the good and bad regimes of financial conditions, we find that fiscal multipliers are smaller in the bad regime than in the good regime.","[Ashihara, Ayato; Kameda, Keigo] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Policy Studies, 2-1 Gakuen, Sanda, Hyogo 6691337, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Kameda, K (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Policy Studies, 2-1 Gakuen, Sanda, Hyogo 6691337, Japan.",kameda@kwansei.ac.jp,"Kameda, Keigo/GLQ-9269-2022","KAMEDA, Keigo/0000-0002-7668-1602","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16H03637]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25380381, 16H03637] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) [16H03637].,,6,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

With rising greener customer expectations and increasingly stringent environmental regulations, green supply chains are now viewed as another competitive weapon. Green supply chains are characterized by higher complexity and turbulence. Green supply chain flexibility can aid organizations function in this complex and uncertain environment, yet investigation into this area is very limited. This paper aims contribute to this field by investigating green supply chain flexibility achievement through information systems. This paper introduces a green supply chain flexibility matrix framework. Given the large data needs, as described in the matrix, a novel probability evaluation methodology that can help predict rankings of projects and programs is introduced. The methodology extends a TOPSIS based three-parameter interval grey number (TpGN) approach by incorporating neighborhood rough set theory (RST) to evaluate IS programs' green flexibility support capability. The results of this methodology are more objective and effective for two reasons. (1) The results are predictive rankings based on probability degree instead of the fixed deterministic ranks. (2) Neighborhood rough set theory used in this study can limit loss of information when compared to rough set theory, yet still simplify extensive data sets.

This paper aims to assess the impact on external competitiveness of an expansionary capital stock policy that could contribute to reduce the trade balance asymmetries within the EU and help European exporters to recover their competitive role in international markets. A policy action to increase capital stock accumulation through investment in selected European countries could generate a double dividend: increasing both price and nonprice competitiveness, so stimulating their competitive position as exporters, and consolidating the growth path of EU economy. The analysis employs a bilateral trade model built at INFORUM with several distinguishing characteristics: a comprehensive bilateral data set, econometric estimation of key parameters, and emphasis on sectoral details. Our findings show that a capital stock increase is effective in narrowing trade imbalances within EU.

However, despite the necessity to respect rate parity, many hotels do not apply this requirement. Therefore, the authors have attempted to assess this phenomenon in the Polish hospitality market. The aim of the study was to determine the scope of applying rate parity by Polish hotels and using the price discrimination in a variety of direct and indirect channels of electronic distribution. The purpose was to state how the restriction to respect rate parity by the hotels affects the possibility of using price differentiation. The research material involved prices available on-line across various distribution channels. The research methods were based on a critical analysis of literature and on the observation of the prices on the websites of 311 hotels and e-intermediaries. The collected data were analyzed statistically by means of SPSS software. The relationships between the characteristics of the hotels (the category and belonging to a chain) and the variables were determined. The analysis indicates that the necessity of applying rate parity paradoxically often leads to using price differentiation and rate fences by the hotels. Among the hotels applying rate parity (i.e. the same standard room rate as in other distribution channels) as many as 61% of enterprises use rate fences (mainly non-physical transaction features) in order to improve the competitiveness of their prices in relation to other distribution channels.","[Bieluszko, Katarzyna; Marciszewska, Barbara] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Bieluszko, K (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",,"Marciszewska, Barbara/X-8540-2018","Marciszewska, Barbara/0000-0002-7952-889X",,,,,61,4,5,0,11,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The imperialism of economics is increasingly approaching traditional academic fields of history, psychology, and sociology. However, the article concludes that sociology's public reputation may have declined, while simultaneously economics is shifting its attention to the social dimension of economic behavior and moving toward the other social sciences; a process which has been coined social-scienciation. The argument is that those developments can also be seen as chances to upgrade the social sciences around economics. The described process also aligns with recent talk about a need for interdisciplinary studies when this article adopts a different take on the issues of interdisciplinarity and embeddedness.","[Boegenhold, Dieter] Alpen Adria Univ, Fac Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Boegenhold, Dieter] Dept Sociol, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Boegenhold, Dieter] Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship Innovat & Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Bögenhold, D (通讯作者)，Alpen Adria Univ, Fac Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria.;Bögenhold, D (通讯作者)，Dept Sociol, Klagenfurt, Austria.;Bögenhold, D (通讯作者)，Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship Innovat & Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria.",,"Bögenhold, Dieter/J-7750-2012","Bögenhold, Dieter/0000-0003-2893-3534",,,,,75,8,9,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

An examination of institutional quality over 30years indicates that countries with low-quality institutions have improved their institutional quality, which demonstrates that poor countries are not stuck with low-quality institutions.

The suggested model is based on a multi-criteria building assessment including seven requirements. The calculations conducted using the suggested model enable us to define the costs and scope of renovation taken to ensure the assumed building condition or, by assuming various rates paid to the renovation reserve, to define the period in which the above-mentioned goals may be achieved.","[Bucon, Robert; Tomczak, Michal] Lublin Univ Technol, Dept Construct Project Engn, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture, Nadbystrzycka 38 D, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland",Lublin University of Technology,"Bucon, R (通讯作者)，Lublin Univ Technol, Dept Construct Project Engn, Fac Civil Engn & Architecture, Nadbystrzycka 38 D, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.",r.bucon@pollub.pl,"Tomczak, Michał/C-1185-2017","Tomczak, Michał/0000-0002-3743-0122; Bucon, Robert/0000-0002-9397-639X",Ministry of Science and Higher Education [S/63/2015],"Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The studies have been financed from statutory funds allocated by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (S/63/2015).,,31,13,13,3,10,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

From the viewpoint of dynamic productivity performance, the paper finds that the main reason for the negative growth of IC packaging and testing companies and IC design companies came from a backward movement in technical change, but the main reason for the negative growth of IC manufacturing companies derived from a decline in pure technical efficiency.","[Chiu, Ching-Ren] Univ Taipei, Dept Recreat & Sports Management, 101,Sec 2,Zhongcheng Rd, Taipei, Taiwan; [Fang, Chen-Ling] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Finance & Cooperat Management, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsang, Seng-Su] Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Business Adm, 43,Sec 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chen, Yi-Fen] Chihlee Univ Technol, Dept Finance, 313,Sec 1,Wunhua Rd, New Taipei, Taiwan",University of Taipei; National Taipei University; National Taiwan University of Science & Technology,"Fang, CL (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Finance & Cooperat Management, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei, Taiwan.",faling@totalbb.net.tw,"chiu, ching-ren/GWV-7250-2022",,Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) [NSC 103-2410-H-346-006],"Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Taiwan) under contract NSC 103-2410-H-346-006.

We then estimate the parameters of an ideas production function, and find parameter estimates consistent with technology fields being fished out if not continually restocked by the discovery of novel connections between technological components. We use the ideas production function to estimate the number of new patent applications induced by each patent granted between 1926 and 2001, and show this number has trended downward since the 1940s.","[Clancy, Matthew S.] USDA, Econ Res Serv, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Clancy, MS (通讯作者)，USDA, Econ Res Serv, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",matthew.clancy@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,42,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Through these policies, the U.S. government attempts to stimulate employment, especially in the manufacturing sector, by favoring U.S. contractors for public sector projects (Buy American regulations) and by insisting that these contractors themselves favor domestic suppliers of inputs such as steel (Buy America regulations). We refer to these policies collectively as Buy America(n). Enforcement of the policies is via complex legalistic processes and often contractors to the U.S. government adopt a cautious approach by favoring U.S. suppliers even when this may not be strictly legally required. In these circumstances, it is not possible to provide a definitive model-based quantification of the effects of Buy America(n). Nevertheless, as demonstrated in this paper, a detailed CGE analysis can give valuable guidance concerning the efficacy of these policies. In an illustrative simulation we find that scrapping Buy-America(n) would reduce U.S. employment in manufacturing but boost employment in the rest of the economy with a net gain of about 300 thousand jobs. Even in the manufacturing sector, there would be many winning industries including those producing machinery and other high-tech products. Employment would increase in 50 out of 51 states and 430 out of 436 congressional districts.","[Dixon, Peter B.; Rimmer, Maureen T.; Waschik, Robert G.] Victoria Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Victoria University,"Dixon, PB (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Ctr Policy Studies, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",peter.dixon@vu.edu.au,,"Waschik, Robert/0000-0001-9306-1803; Rimmer, Maureen/0000-0002-7477-4565",Canadian Embassy in Washington DC,Canadian Embassy in Washington DC,"We thank the Canadian Embassy in Washington DC for financial support.

To do that, our work analyses the main magnitudes provided by the WIOD and the associated Multiregional input-output model. First, we study the evolution of key variables such as output, value added, trade, and capital, and the structural changes observed for these variables. On the basis of this first analysis, we go deeper into the identification of drivers of income generation by way of an MRIO-SDA.

This prevents them from capturing time variation in the parameters of equilibrium asset pricing models. These problems are addressed by combining innovative procedures which allow for testing of multiple break dates on fund-specific parameters along with cross-section bootstraps that remain valid in the presence of time-varying parameters. We find that substantial proportion - 8% - of the estimated versions of the asset pricing model have significant changes in their parameters. The effects of this time variation on the cross-section distribution of the risk-adjusted performance measure are significant and substantially increase centiles of the right tail of this distribution when compared to those produced without time-varying parameters. Our evidence regarding the lack of actively managed US equity mutual funds that generate excess returns is significantly weaker than those of Fama and French but our results do not overturn their pessimistic conclusion regarding the lack of skilled managers. We do find, unlike Fama and French, that managers generating negative returns are just unlucky but have no skill.","[Ercolani, Marco G.; Pouliot, William; Ercolani, Joanne S.] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Pouliot, William] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Pouliot, W (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",w.pouliot@bham.ac.uk,"Ercolani, Marco/AAJ-8116-2020","Ercolani, Marco/0000-0002-0085-6664",,,,,31,3,3,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, we compare exogenously given labour market institutions; i.e., right-to-manage (RTM) and sequential efficient bargaining (SEB). We show that the conventional wisdom, which states that firms always prefer RTM, no longer holds. In fact, when unions are adequately wage aggressive and have strong enough bargaining power, firms may prefer SEB negotiations; however, firms switch their preference to RTM when unions are very strong. Moreover, we show that a conflict of interest between the parties may emerge when unions are sufficiently employment oriented as well as sufficiently wage aggressive and not too strong or too weak in bargaining. Second, we analyse the endogenous choice of the bargaining agenda. We show that a rich plethora of equilibria may occur and new situations of conflict/agreement of interests between the bargaining parties arise in particular when unions are sufficiently wage-aggressive.","[Fanti, Luciano] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy; [Buccella, Domenico] Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland",University of Pisa; Kozminski University,"Buccella, D (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Warsaw, Poland.",buccella@kozminski.edu.pl,"Buccella, Domenico/F-8981-2019","Buccella, Domenico/0000-0002-9594-0630",,,,,26,3,3,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We identify four phases of financialization: the first from the 1900s to 1933 (early financialization), the second from 1933 to 1940 (transitory phase), the third between 1945 and 1973 (de-financialization), and the fourth period picks up from the early 1970s and leads to the Great Recession (complex financialization). Our findings indicate that the main features of the current phase of financialization were already in place in the first period. We closely examine institutions within these distinct financial regimes and focus on the relative size of the financial sector, the respective regulation regime of each period, the intensity of the shareholder value orientation, as well as the level of financial innovations implemented. Although financialization is a recent term, the process is far from novel.

This distinction seems to be appealing for regulators. During the last decades, public utilities such as water and electricity have witnessed a wave of regulatory reforms aimed at improving efficiency through incentive regulation. Most of these regulation schemes use benchmarking, namely measuring companies' efficiency and rewarding them accordingly. Focusing on electricity distribution, we sketch a theoretical model to show that an imperfectly informed regulator may not disentangle the two parts of the cost efficiency. Therefore, the regulator may fail to set optimal efficiency targets, which also undermines quality. We then provide evidence on the presence of persistent and transient efficiency using data on 28 New Zealand electricity distribution companies between 2000 and 2011. First, we estimate a total cost function by means of traditional stochastic frontier models for panel data. These come up with an estimation of the persistent part or the transient part of the cost efficiency. Finally, we use the more recent generalized true random effects model that allows for the simultaneous estimation of both transient and persistent efficiency. We also find some evidence that persistent efficiency is associated to higher quality, and wrong efficiency targets are associated to lower quality compliance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We study how this return migration affected the employment chances and earnings of Albanians who never migrated. We find positive effects on the wages of low-skilled non-migrants and overall positive effects on employment. The gains partially offset the sharp drop in remittances in the observed period. An important part of the employment gains are concentrated in the agricultural sector, where most return migrants engage in self-employment and entrepreneurship.

No date has yet been set for the introduction of the euro. The situation may, however, arise where it will be desirable to introduce the euro as soon as possible. It would therefore be advisable to enter ERM II even without a set date for the introduction of the euro (a so-called technical entry to ERM II; the Danish scenario for entry). However, participation in the ERM II mechanism means fixing the exchange rate, which is associated with the risk of speculative attacks. The aim of this paper is to assess the experiences of those countries, whose currencies have been in ERM II for a longer period of time. The currency exchange rates of Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were stable at the time of their participation in ERM II, even in the crisis years of 2007-2009. The exchange rate stability criterion would be met in its hypothetical assessment. The key condition for this stability is the conviction of the participants in the foreign exchange markets with regard to the determination of the central bank to keep the exchange rate within ERM II and sufficiently high foreign exchange reserves of the central bank.","[Helisek, Mojmir] Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Helísek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",mojmir.helisek@vsfs.cz,"Helisek, Mojmir/AAA-9165-2021","Helisek, Mojmir/0000-0001-5839-8240",Czech Science Foundation [16-21506S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The paper has been prepared under the project New Sources of Systemic Risk in the Financial Markets, supported by the Czech Science Foundation (No. 16-21506S, 2016-2018) and using institutional support for the long-term conceptual development of the research organization University of Finance and Administration.",,21,3,3,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,139,149,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200016,0

In this paper, I argue that much of this criticism misses the point: it assumes that economics is about explaining human behavior when in fact, since Adam Smith, economists have been more interested in explaining patterns that emerge from social interaction. While some minimal account of human behavior is needed for explaining such phenomena, a full-fledged psychological or neurobiological theory of individual behavior might not be. The more pressing yet under-researched challenge for economic models is to arrive at an adequate description of social interaction processes that connect individual choices on the micro-level and robust patterns on the macro-level.","[Herfeld, Catherine] Univ Zurich, Inst Philosophy, Inst Sociol, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Herfeld, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Philosophy, Inst Sociol, Zurich, Switzerland.",c.s.herfeld@gmail.com,,,Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),This work was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation.,,94,12,14,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

J,"Ji, S; Yoo, J",,,,"Ji, Seongtae; Yoo, JeongHo",,,A study on the changes of agricultural import structure according to implementation of FTAs in South Korea,JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,FTA; Gravity model; Agricultural trade; Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML); Trade creation; Trade diversion,TRADE DIVERSION; CREATION; GRAVITY,"Purpose - South Korea has signed and implemented 15 free trade agreements (FTAs) with 52 countries. More than 80 percent of imports of agricultural products came from FTA partner countries in 2015. We can say that South Korea entered the era of an opening in agricultural import sector. It means that FTA is an important factor in causing changes in agricultural imports. As a result of the implementation of the FTA, tariff cuts and other changes in trade conditions could lead to an increase in imports of agricultural products from FTA partner country or diversity of partners. South Korea has implemented 15 FTAs so far, each with a different period of implementation, different scale of trade, and different major trade items. This means that each FTA will have a different size and type of impact on the changes in the import structure. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyze how the FTA actually affected agricultural imports and what type of impact each FTA had. Especially, the authors focused on the effects of trade creation and diversion to analyze the patterns of structural changes in the import of agricultural products according to the implementation of FTAs. Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors analyzed both trade creation and trade diversion effect through the poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood method based on the previous research gravity model of Magee (2008, p. 353) and Yang and Martinez-Zarzoso (2014, p. 144). The biggest improvement compared to the standard gravity model is that all variables such as GDP, population, and distance are removed. This model cannot be regarded as a gravity model because the basic parameters of gravity model such as GDP, population, distance are excluded, but it can be said that the fixed effect variables replace the basic parameter of the gravity model. Findings - According to the analysis, the authors found that the effects of trade creation were apparent in the early stages of FTA implementation before 2011 and the effect of the trade transition was seen in the mid-FTA transition period after 2011. The authors also clarified the pattern of structural changes in the agricultural imports of each FTAs. It is shown that the change in agricultural import structures was more apparent in major FTAs like the Korea-ASEAN, Korea-EU, and Korea-US FTA. In other words, the effects of trade creation and trade diversion in these FTAs were found to be statistically significant. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are as follows. First, as multiple FTAs are implemented simultaneously, the effects of individual FTA can be offset. Second, the FTA effect of each item was not reflected, because it was analyzed based on the amount of imports by country. Third, the effect of the trade between the partners was not reflected. Therefore, future studies need to add or supplement these limitations. Practical implications - This paper demonstrated through an empirical analysis that the FTA directly affects changes in agricultural import structure. And it proved that the period of FTA implementation, items imported from FTA partner countries, and the size of imports affected the structure of agricultural imports. Of course, changes in the domestic consumption patterns, changes in the supply and demand, conditions of quarantine inspection, and preference of importers are also factors that affect the structure of agricultural imports. It is expected that the effect of trade creation and the effect of trade diversion in agricultural import will be more significant when tariff rates are further decreased due to FTA implementation and domestic demand of agricultural product rises as a result of an economic recovery. As the FTA directly affects changes in agricultural imports, it should be carefully dealt with when signing a new FTA or improving the existing ones. And appropriate measures should be taken to minimize damages to the domestic agricultural sector due to changes in the import structure of agricultural products. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need to do research what kinds of effect occurred after FTA implementation in the agricultural sector. An empirical analysis was conducted on the effects of trade creation and diversion of agricultural products, based on the actual results of bilateral trade between the 50 major importers of agricultural products, including the 30 FTA partner countries.","[Ji, Seongtae; Yoo, JeongHo] Korea Rural Econ Inst, Naju, South Korea",,"Ji, S (通讯作者)，Korea Rural Econ Inst, Naju, South Korea.",dongsimjst@krei.re.kr,,,,,,,14,4,4,0,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Stimulated by these developments, there has been rapid progress in data and methods for measuring GVC linkages. The macro approach to measuring GVCs connects national input-output tables across borders by using bilateral trade data to construct global input-output tables. These tables have been applied to measure trade in value added, the length of and location of producers in GVCs, and price linkages across countries. The micro approach uses firm-level data to document firms' input sourcing decisions, how import and export participation are linked, and how multinational firms organize their production networks. In this review, I evaluate progress in these two approaches, highlighting points of contact between them and areas that demand further work. I argue that further convergence between these approaches can strengthen both, yielding a more complete empirical portrait of GVCs.","[Johnson, Robert C.] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Johnson, Robert C.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Johnson, RC (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Johnson, RC (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",robert.c.johnson@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,,107,98,101,27,146,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

In particular, our study applies the popular and powerful statistical methods such as Gaussian copula partial correlations and Gaussian copula marginal regression. We find evidence of significant dependence for all considered pairs, except for the Mexican peso-Brent.

One of its symptoms is the lack of interest of a growing group of citizens on public affairs, which is reflected in long-term declining voter turnout. However, every election (the public service) in the Czech Republic is relatively costly. The aim of the paper is to create and broaden the view of the perceptions of the election not only as a social problem of the choice theory but also of the cost of the society itself. Motives for people should be, therefore, using their legal rights and to participation not only in order to determine the future direction of the territorial unit in which they live but also to use the public services offered to them by the country. Only then these services can be evaluated as effective and meaningful. Paper deals with the analysis of elections' costs and its trends. There are analysed most significant cost items and, on the basis of these, the performance indicators (especially number of eligible voters and number of electoral districts and a scope of competence) illustrate the cost inefficiency of public service provision (election), which is paradoxically higher for territorial self-governing units that should realize a higher degree of economies of scale.","[Kral, Martin] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Král, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.",martin.kral.2@uhk.cz,,,"Investment evaluation within concept Industry 4.0 at Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic [2103]","Investment evaluation within concept Industry 4.0 at Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic","This paper is supported by specific project No. 2103 Investment evaluation within concept Industry 4.0 at Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.",,17,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,166,173,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200019,0

A private firm may have lower production costs and can potentially provide a performance benchmark for a public firm. A public firm may offer higher-quality service and can reveal the production cost of the private firm to the regulator. However, this paper shows that public-private mixed delivery does not always dominate public delivery or private delivery. Mixed delivery is optimal only when (i) the cost uncertainty of the private firm is large, (ii) the managerial incentive problem of the public firm is large, and (iii) the performances of the public and private firms are highly correlated.","[Kwon, Illoong; Park, Sangin] Seoul Natl Univ, GSPA, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Kwon, I (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, GSPA, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2018,85.0,337,,,,,75,91,,10.1111/ecca.12203,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FP0CU,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417267600003,0

It is well known that in such a model the folk theorem holds when the monitoring cost is on the order of magnitude of the stage payoff. We analyze high frequency games in which the monitoring cost is small but still significantly higher than the stage payoff. We characterize the limit set of public perfect equilibrium payoffs as the monitoring cost tends to 0. It turns out that this set is typically a strict subset of the set of feasible and individually rational payoffs. In particular, there might be efficient and individually rational payoffs that cannot be sustained in equilibrium. We also make an interesting connection between games with costly monitoring and games played between long-lived and short-lived players. Finally, we show that the limit set of public perfect equilibrium payoffs coincides with the limit set of Nash equilibrium payoffs. This implies that our characterization applies also to sequential equilibria.","[Lehrer, Ehud; Solan, Eilon] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Lehrer, Ehud] INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France",Tel Aviv University; INSEAD Business School,"Lehrer, E (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Math Sci, Tel Aviv, Israel.;Lehrer, E (通讯作者)，INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France.",lehrer@post.tau.ac.il; eilons@post.tau.ac.il,,,"Google Inter-University Center for Electronic Markets and Auctions; Israel Science Foundation [963/15, 212/09, 323/13]",Google Inter-University Center for Electronic Markets and Auctions; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"This research was supported in part by the Google Inter-University Center for Electronic Markets and Auctions.

Electric vehicles are more expensive in comparison to traditional vehicles, countries lack necessary infrastructures, consumers may need additional information about the benefits of eco-friendly cars, etc. The above-mentioned and other weighty reasons force national and local authorities to think about the implementation of financial and non financial electric vehicle promotion measures. The experience of other countries and cities is extremely valuable as it helps to form the trends and exploit the benefits of the best practice. Previous studies consider the impact of the measures of electric vehicle usage promotion in insufficient detail.

In contrast to the literature, we find that UP may yield higher quality than third-degree price discrimination (PD). This occurs when the demand dispersion between markets is sufficiently decreasing with quality. A simple test for a higher quality under UP is to check whether an increase in quality reduces the price differential between markets under PD. In this case, a higher quality under UP is an effective substitute for PD to extract consumer surplus. When the demand dispersion is small enough, a higher quality under UP increases social welfare relative to PD.","[Matteucci, Giorgio; Reverberi, Pierfrancesco] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Ingn Informat Automat & Gest Antonio, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Reverberi, P (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Ingn Informat Automat & Gest Antonio, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",reverberi@dis.uniroma1.it,,"matteucci, giorgio/0000-0002-5811-599X",Sapienza Universita di Roma - Ricerca Scientifica,Sapienza Universita di Roma - Ricerca Scientifica,We thank Professor Fong and two anonymous reviewers for very helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier version of this paper.

This article uses new data from Zimbabwe to investigate money demand under hyperinflation using an autoregressive distributed-lag model for the period 1980-2008. The results produce plausible convergence rates and long-run elasticities, indicating that real-money balances are cointegrated with the inflation rate and signifying an equilibrium relationship between the two series. Evidence is also presented suggesting prices were driven by increases in the money supply rather than by changes in price setting behaviour. The article uses the estimated elasticity on the inflation variable to calculate the maximum level of seigniorage revenue that could be raised in the economy. Actual seigniorage levels increased dramatically after 2000, with inflation eventually exceeding the rate required to maximize this revenue stream.

Due to search frictions, workers earn rents from employment. All workers agree on which jobs are, in this sense, more desirable and slowly climb the job ladder through job-to-job quits. Occasionally, negative shocks throw them off the ladder and back into unemployment. We review a recent body of theory and empirical evidence on labor market turnover through the lens of the job ladder. We focus on the critical role that the job ladder plays in transmitting aggregate shocks, through the pace and direction of employment reallocation, to economic activity and wages and in shaping business cycles more generally. The main evidence concerns worker transitions, both through nonemployment and from job to job, between firms of different sizes, ages, productivity levels, and wage premiums, as well as the resulting earnings growth. Poaching by firms up the ladder is the main engine of reallocation, which shuts down in recessions.","[Moscarini, Giuseppe] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Postel-Vinay, Fabien] UCL, Dept Econ, London WC1H 0AX, England",Yale University; University of London; University College London,"Moscarini, G (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",giuseppe.moscarini@yale.edu; f.postel-vinay@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,14,15,0,7,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4610-2,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

His community was engaged in the construction works of roads and bridges, nourishment to the patients, and benevolence to the poor and the suffered. From the management perspectives, Gyouki carried the ball by himself, but organised his projects which were supported by voluntary associations. It was a project based enterprise of men and women, but also assisted by the craftsmen's groups of Korean descent.","[Nakamaki, Hirochika] Suita City Museum, Suita, Osaka, Japan",,"Nakamaki, H (通讯作者)，Suita City Museum, Suita, Osaka, Japan.",h-nakama@rk9.so-net.ne.jp,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

In order to match the observed business cycle facts, the models were enriched with various nominal and real rigidities. In this paper we assess the importance of DSGE frictions from the perspective of forecasting accuracy. Our main finding establishes that not all these mechanisms are necessary: different frictions are identified to be relevant for certain variables and forecast horizons, but not for others. The baseline model featuring all frictions is found to be dominated by its restricted versions. The models with constant capital utilization rate and with reduced habits in preferences improve forecasting accuracy for GDP and consumption. This result is at variance with previous literature, where variable capital utilization and strong habits were found useful for fitting the data. We confirm sticky prices and sticky wages to be important rigidities, since the models with flexible prices and wages are inferior at predicting nominal variables. Altogether, our results suggest that policy-makers need a rich forecasting platform in order to take fully-informed decisions.","[Nalban, Valeriu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Nalban, V (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",valeriu.nalban@fin.ase.ro,,,,,,,25,8,8,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The period analysed is 1995-2014. The methodology is based on System GMM estimator of Arellano-Bover and Blundell-Bond for dynamic panel data. Empirical findings suggest that only variables such as voice and accountability and government effectiveness have a significant positive impact on economic growth rates of the analysed countries. In the presence of control variables, i.e. trade and government final consumption, results are robust.

The Portuguese case is particularly well suited to study this issue: all students must take standardized national exams at specific grades. Moreover, the available dataset tracks the performance of students over time. Therefore, we are able to measure the impact of students' retention on their subsequent academic performance since we can control for each student's initial level of ability at the moment of retention. We use a propensity score matching approach, in which retained and promoted 4th grade students are matched according to their socioeconomic characteristics and the scores obtained in national exams. To address potentially remaining endogeneity biases, we also use the culture of retention at school level as an instrumental variable. The results suggest that in some situations retentions may have on average a positive impact on future achievement. However, in the cases where statistically significant impacts are found, the estimated magnitudes are relatively small. Our results are relevant for countries with high retention rates that are considering alternative educational policies to promote students' achievement.","[Nunes, Luis Catela; Reis, Ana Balcao; Seabra, Carmo] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Nunes, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",lcnunes@novasbe.pt,"; Catela Nunes, Luis/G-1989-2011","Balcao Reis, Ana/0000-0003-0962-4605; Catela Nunes, Luis/0000-0001-8115-6223",,,,,16,11,16,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Firstly, we estimate OLS regressions to analyse this relationship. Our empirical results show that there is a positive relationship between firms' characteristics and export activity. Secondly, quantile regressions are performed in order to observe whether there are any heterogeneous effects along the conditional distribution of the two measures of export activity. The quantile regressions reveal the existence of heterogeneous effects and nonlinearities among firms' characteristics and both export intensity and market scope. Moreover, the quantile analysis also shows that, for some cases, the effects of firms' characteristics on export intensity and market scope differ greatly.","[Orts, Vicente; Marti, Josep] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Orts, V (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Castellon De La Plana, Spain.",orts@uji.es; arnauj@uji.es,"Orts, Vicente/K-5921-2014","Orts, Vicente/0000-0003-1708-9868",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-58975-P]; Universitat Jaume I [UJI-B2016-53],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Universitat Jaume I,Authors would like to thank for the financial support from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (ECO2014-58975-P) and Universitat Jaume I (UJI-B2016-53).,,50,1,1,0,2,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,2340-4264,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The empirical results confirm that there is a significant long-run relationship among the variables. In addition, our results, based on OLS, DOLS and FMOLS, show that increasing trade intensity between Australia and China has a significant and positive impact on their stock market correlations. The Global Financial Crisis also contributed for their stock market interdependence. Our results therefore suggest that the bilateral trade relations between Australia and China have brought their stock markets together over time. The findings of this study offer significant policy and practical implications. The policymakers need to be aware of the economic changes in those countries as they will immediately reflect on their stock market performance and relationship.

With this in mind, this paper investigates the relationship between monetary policy and housing market activity using a relatively new method for identifying monetary shocks. More specifically, a monetary policy shock is identified by explicitly imposing sign restrictions on impulse response vectors. The extra information from sign restrictions is important for new insights regarding the transmission of monetary policy to the housing sector notably, the results indicate that residential investment is less sensitive to a contractionary shock than standard estimates with recursive restrictions. Given that the response of the housing sector using sign restrictions is smaller than other work using standard identification methods, the work indicates that further research is needed to examine whether other sectors of the economy may be less sensitive to monetary policy than previously thought.","[Ume, Ejindu] Miami Univ, 800 E High St,FSB 2054, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Ume, E (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, 800 E High St,FSB 2054, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",umee@miamioh.edu,,,,,,,26,15,16,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

When realising the research objective, a logistic regression model was applied - both with and without interaction effects. The study has shown that the financial behaviours of men and women differ significantly. Men more frequently use the products and services available on the financial market such as, for instance, a debit card, or invest funds in shares or bonds. They are also more willing to take risks. However, as has been shown in the study, gender is not the only important variable influencing financial decisions. Equally important are age, social and professional status, education, or place of residence. This indicates that analysing behaviours on the financial market based solely on one variable may not be appropriate.","[Walczak, Damian] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Pienkowska-Kamieniecka, Sylwia] Univ Warmia Mazury, Oczapowskiego Str 4, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; University of Warmia & Mazury,"Walczak, D (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",dwalczak@umk.pl; sylwia.pienkowska@uwm.edu.pl,"Pieńkowska-Kamieniecka, Sylwia/L-3598-2017; PIEŃKOWSKA-KAMIENIECKA, SYLWIA/ABC-1740-2021; Walczak, Damian/K-1331-2014","PIEŃKOWSKA-KAMIENIECKA, SYLWIA/0000-0002-5818-2658; Walczak, Damian/0000-0002-2986-9928",,,,,46,20,22,7,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

To begin, I discuss the legal and political framework for social entrepreneurship in China, followed by an overview of the sector's characteristics, including age, size, social issues emphasized, leader characteristics, and the role of women.

A Structural Vector Autoregression model is applied to study the impacts of monetary policy shocks and housing demand shocks on various housing markets across China. We also investigate the role of house prices in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The results reveal that in first-tier cities, raising interest rates has a stronger negative effect on house prices. Also, as house prices decrease in first-tier cities, private consumption declines sharply. There is a stronger role of housing markets in the transmission of monetary policy shocks in these cities. Our findings indicate that interest rate adjustment could effectively curb spikes in housing prices in the first-tier cities, but the impact of such adjustments on household consumption must also be considered.","[Wu, Lili] China Univ Petr, Sch Business & Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bian, Yang] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Banking & Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",China University of Petroleum; University of International Business & Economics,"Wu, LL (通讯作者)，China Univ Petr, 18 Fuxue Rd, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",wull@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023",,,,,,6,20,21,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

To investigate this question theoretically, this paper develops a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with two period lived heterogenous agents, monopolistically competitive firms and sticky prices. In the model financial uncertainty is measured by the volatility of stock prices and this volatility results from the stochastic irrational beliefs of nonsophisticated agents about the future performance of the stock. An increase in the stock price volatility decreases aggregate demand and generates a significant contraction in output. The model contributes to the literature by modeling financial market volatility in a general equilibrium framework, establishing its causal impact on real variables, highlighting the mechanisms through which the impact works, and providing estimates of its magnitude.","[Yildirim-Karaman, Secil] Istanbul Altinbas Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Altinbas University,"Yildirim-Karaman, S (通讯作者)，Istanbul Altinbas Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",secil.yildirim@altinbas.edu.tr,"Yıldırım, Seçil/AAA-6894-2022",,TUBITAK under the 2214/A International Research Fellowship Programme,TUBITAK under the 2214/A International Research Fellowship Programme(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"I am grateful to Refet Gurkaynak for his extensive academic guidance and encouragement.

The pace of this learning process is directly determined by the gain parameter. We document and evaluate gain calibrations for a broad range of model specifications with macroeconomic data, also developing alternative approaches to the endogenous determination of time-varying gains in real-time. Our key findings are that learning gains are higher for inflation than for output growth and interest rates, and that calibrations to match survey forecasts are lower than those derived according to forecasting performance, suggesting some degree of bounded rationality in the speed with which agents update their beliefs.

Based on the information given by these owners and managers, the survey makes a complete characterization of several firm characteristics, provides complete information on the extent of informality as well as its effects on various economic outcomes of these firms. The cross-sectional econometric analysis we conduct using the survey data shows that there is an inverted-U relationship between a specific measure of informality and growth expectations of firms.

Since the new system was applied to large establishments first, one could analyze the effects using a difference-in-differences estimation method. This study finds that the system change increases boys' hours of self-study and decreases their alcohol use (reduced-form estimates). The channel is fathers' increased knowledge of their children's whereabouts and the children's decreased conflict with their parents.

The article makes four contributions to the existing literature on macro-level migration flows. First, use of census data allows us to test and compare the effect on migration of climatic factors prior to migration. Second, we introduce relevant meteorological indicators of climate variability, to measure the frequency, duration, and magnitude of drought and excess precipitation based on the Standardized Precipitation Index. Third, we estimate the total effect (direct and indirect effects) of climate variability on bilateral migration rates. Fourth, we examine three possible channels through which climate variability might induce migration: average income, agriculture, and urbanization. The estimation results show that drought frequency in the origin state increases inter-state migration in India. This effect is stronger in agricultural states, and in such states the magnitude of drought also increases inter-state migration significantly. Drought frequency has the strongest effect on rural-rural inter-state migration.

As the popularity of streaming music increases producers will adjust their production to focus on the non-durable channel. We identify conditions under which the changes in music delivery will encourage musicians to release fewer songs, but at a higher quality, leading to market deepening and increased engagement. This change will complete the unbundling process in music production making the traditional bundled album of little importance. This tendency toward unbundling for individual musicians depends on a robust bundle from a delivery platform to provide value for consumer subscriptions. Beyond a model of consumer utility and producer profit, we analyze the most played songs of the large streaming music platform, Spotify, and compare those results to traditional album sales using Nielsen data.","[Hiller, R.

The conventional explanation is that chains generate economies of scale in costs. Alternatively, the structure of chains may enhance demand by helping firms develop reputations, among other reasons. I quantify the value of these explanations empirically with a large, detailed data set on the hotel industry, combining a reduced-form analysis of revenues with a structural estimation of firm costs. Revenue analysis shows substantial evidence of a large chain premium. Cost estimation shows that after accounting for unobserved heterogeneity, chain-affiliated firms receive no cost advantage relative to independent firms.","[Hollenbeck, Brett] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Hollenbeck, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",brett.hollenbeck@gmail.com,"Hollenbeck, Brett/P-9142-2018","Hollenbeck, Brett/0000-0001-9848-9366",,,,,49,18,22,3,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

We simulate the losses of capital and labor from the disaster with a nuclear power plant shutdown and then conduct policy experiments of the recovery of Taiwan's three major industries by subsidizing their output or capital use. We find that the semiconductor and electronic equipment sectors could recover with the aid of subsidies. In contrast, the recovery of the chemical sector would be crucially dependent on the availability of nuclear power. This is because the chemical sector is heavily dependent on petroleum products as inputs and thus susceptible to fuel price rises, induced by a fuel demand increase following the shutdown of a nuclear power plant.

By employing the inverse optimal-tax method, we calculate the political weights across the income distribution for each political party. We find that all Dutch political parties give a higher political weight to middle incomes than to the poor. Moreover, the political weights of the rich are close to zero. Furthermore, we detect a strong political status quo bias as the political weights of all political parties hardly deviate from the weights implied by the pre-existing tax system. We argue that political-economy considerations are key in understanding these results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The model of household specialization and division of labor introduced by Becker posits that when forming households, couples will exploit the gains from trade by having one spouse specialize in market work while the other specializes in household work. Given the historical advantage of men in the labor market, the model predicts specialization by gender and therefore an earnings advantage for married men and an earnings disadvantage for married women. Is this model of specialization useful for understanding the evolution of the gender gap across generations of women? And what about children? Academic papers have shown that wages of mothers are significantly lower than those of non-mothers with similar human capital characteristics. We do not attempt to build a structural model here, but rather document how changing associations between marriage and earnings, and between children and earnings, have contributed to the gender gap in an accounting sense.","[Juhn, Chinhui] Univ Houston, Econ, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Juhn, Chinhui] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [McCue, Kristin] US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Juhn, C (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Econ, Houston, TX 77004 USA.;Juhn, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",cjuhn@uh.edu; Kristin.McCue@census.gov,,,,,,,61,62,80,4,120,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

What have been the effects? Proponents typically emphasize the contribution of family policies to the goals of gender equity and child development, enabling women to combine careers and motherhood, and altering social norms regarding gender roles. Opponents often warn that family policies may become a long-term hindrance to women's careers because of the loss of work experience and the higher costs to employers that hire women of childbearing age. We draw lessons from existing work and our own analysis on the effects of parental leave and other interventions aimed at aiding families. We present country- and micro-level evidence on the effects of family policy on gender outcomes, focusing on female employment, gender gaps in earnings, and fertility. Most estimates range from negligible to a small positive impact. But the verdict is far more positive for the beneficial impact of spending on early education and childcare.","[Olivetti, Claudia] Boston Coll, Econ, Boston, MA USA; [Olivetti, Claudia] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Petrongolo, Barbara] Queen Mary Univ London, Econ, London, England; [Petrongolo, Barbara] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Labour Econ Programme, London, England; [Petrongolo, Barbara] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",Boston College; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Olivetti, C (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Econ, Boston, MA USA.;Olivetti, C (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",claudia.olivetti@bc.edu; b.petrongolo@qmul.ac.uk,,,UK Commission for Employment and Skills; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Commission for Employment and Skills; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We wish to thank Claudia Goldin and the editors of this journal for valuable comments and suggestions, and Marco Ghiani and Xirong Lin for excellent research assistance.

It analyses the impact of regulation, such as the intensity of employment protection, and evaluates whether trade unions and minimum wage institutions play a role in the relationship between all measures and the labor share. The labor income share has experienced a declining trend since the mid 1970s in most advanced economies, and the existing literature found little if no correlation of this decline to general labor market characteristics. However, the present paper finds that some institutions are correlated to the downward trend, depending on the welfare system adopted, and that welfare and employment protection counteract the decline. Moreover, many countries saw an upsurge in their labor share after the burst of the financial crisis. Evidence of whether the effect of the policies weakened or reinforced the labor share after 2007 is reported.","[Parisi, Maria Laura] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Parisi, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",marialaura.parisi@unibs.it,"Parisi, Maria Laura/H-9904-2014; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Parisi, Maria Laura/0000-0002-7072-3664;",,,,,46,7,7,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

Results from an input distance function approach deliver several important findings. First, the average inefficiency level is estimated to be around 18% although inefficiency varies significantly between the three farming systems. Second, the synchronized system of growing coffee and the other industry crops is found to be the most efficient farming system. Third, coffee mono-cropping is less efficient than synchronized systems due to the presence of economies of scope between coffee and industrial crops. Fourth, the least efficient system is segregated cultivation of coffee and rice. Food insecurity is seen as a primary reason for coffee farmers diversifying into rice. These findings provide empirical evidence of agronomic benefits being derived from synchronized systems, and which are translated into higher productive efficiency. Policy options promoting synchronized farming systems may therefore enhance both economic and agronomic benefits. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Three price series were selected: ( 1) the Nord Pool market clearing price, (2) western Denmark's area spot price (DK1), and (3) Finland's (FI) area spot price. Data were drawn for the 16 years, 2000-2015. Linear regression was used. The results showed that changes in the energy sources used to supply electricity had varying impacts, showing that average annual prices were affected more when there was a decrease in nuclear production levels rather than an increase. This study highlights the fact that unilateral decisions made by an individual country in an integrated market can have large consequences on other nations' wholesale electricity prices.

The analysis is conducted in a DSGE model with loan and bond markets, each featuring financial frictions. This allows for a wide set of financial shocks and transmission mechanisms and can be calibrated to match the bond-to-bank finance ratio featured in the US financial system. Overall, we find that monetary policy that reacts to credit growth, a form of the so-called leaning against the wind, improves the ability of the central bank to achieve its mandate in the wake of financial shocks. The specific policy implications depend partly on the origin and the persistence of the financial shock, but overall not on the assignment of a mandate for financial stability in the central bank's objective function.

Such indices have been externally validated in a number of contexts. Nevertheless, we show that they often fail an internal validity test, that is, ranking individuals with rural assets below individuals with no assets at all. We consider from first principles what sort of indexes might make sense, given the predominantly dummy variable nature of asset schedules. We show that there is, in fact, a way to construct an asset index which does not violate some basic principles and which also has the virtue that it can be used to construct asset inequality measures. However, there is a need to pay careful attention to the components of the index. We show this with South African data.","[Wittenberg, Martin; Leibbrandt, Murray] Univ Cape Town, 3-48-2 Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Wittenberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, 3-48-2 Sch Econ Bldg,Middle Campus, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",Martin.Wittenberg@uct.ac.za,"Leibbrandt, Murray/E-1645-2018; Wittenberg, Martin/J-3146-2013","Leibbrandt, Murray/0000-0003-0829-8844; Wittenberg, Martin/0000-0002-1946-8186",,,,,20,39,45,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The models can trace the characteristics of inflow FDI performance in nonlinearity, heterogeneity, and persistence. Empirical results show that the inward FDI performance and its persistence for the ten OECD countries during 1996-2010 are nonlinear and vary with time and across countries, depending on the proxies in different regimes. The threshold values for the term spread and debt ratio are 2.51 and 64.9847%, respectively. Moderately enhancing the term spread and the debt ratio is helpful to exclude specific exogenous disturbance on FDI inflows and stabilize the persistence of FDI inflow performance. However, debt issuance causes a transitorily volatile effect on the persistence (i.e., a negative persistence effect) more easily than monetary policy.","[Wu, Po-Chin] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Jui] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Business, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University; Chung Yuan Christian University,"Wu, PC (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",pochin@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Our overall GMM estimations indicate that we fail to find any evidence that investment incentives positively affect anyone of our macroeconomic variables. While investment incentives do not increase the employment growth and total factor productivity growth significantly, they significantly reduce the growth rate of value added per work hour and capital stock per work hour.

Input-output techniques are applied to Brazilian national accounts and present a picture of the potential role of different sectors in the recovery of the economy. Considering the country's economic performance at the time, post-2008 economic policies adopted in Brazil are discussed, with emphasis given on the tax break policy, inserted into a broader policy scope. Results show that industrial sectors have stronger linkages in terms of production and employment maintenance in the economy but have been losing ground in the productive structure. Among them, there is evidence in favour of supporting more some sectors, such as the automobile and the construction industries, rather than others, such as white goods appliances and furniture, but especially the need of recovering industrial development as a whole for sustained economic growth.

This trend has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty but it has also sharply increased local, regional, and global pollution levels. We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation. Overall, it seems that China is on track to improve its environmental performance in the years ahead.","[Zheng, Siqi] MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zheng, Siqi] Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kahn, Matthew E.] Univ Southern Calif, Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Kahn, Matthew E.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Tsinghua University; University of Southern California; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Zheng, SQ (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Zheng, SQ (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhengsiqi@gmail.com; kahnme@usc.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71625004, 71273154, 71322307, 71533004]; national key research & development (R&D) plan of China [2016YFC0502804]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); national key research & development (R&D) plan of China,"Xiaonan Zhang provided excellent research assistance.

The goal of this paper is to study the effects of wealth redistribution from rich to poor households on consumption and output in the short run. We first demonstrate analytically how the direction and size of the output effects of such interventions depend on labor supply decisions. We then show that in a standard incomplete-markets model extended to allow for nominal rigidities and parametrized to match the U.S. wealth distribution, wealth redistribution does lead to a temporary boom in consumption but a far smaller increase in output. Our results suggest substantial value in empirical research uncovering the distribution of marginal propensities to work in the population.","[Athreya, Kartik; Schwartzman, Felipe] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Richmond, VA 23219 USA; [Owens, Andrew] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond; University of Rochester,"Athreya, K (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.",kartik.athreya@rich.frb.org; aowens12@ur.rochester.edu; felipe.schwartzman@rich.frb.org,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

Sometimes, it is possible to identify one or more equations which are able to determine a subset of endogenous variables priory and independently of the other equations and of the value taken by the remaining variables of the system. The first group of equations and variables are thus said to causally determine the remaining variables. In Pasinetti's works, this notion of causality has often been emphasized as a formal property having the burden of conveying a profound economic meaning. In this paper, we will go through those works of Pasinetti where the notion of causality plays a central role, with the purpose of contextualizing it within the econometric debate of the Sixties, enucleate its economic meaning and show its connections with other fields of the modern classical approach.","[Bellino, Enrico] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy; [Nerozzi, Sebastiano] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Palermo,"Bellino, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Fac Econ & Giurisprudenza, Piacenza, Italy.",enrico.bellino@unicatt.it,,,Italian Ministry for University Research (MIUR) [2009NXTCP9_006],"Italian Ministry for University Research (MIUR)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, and Universita degli studi di Palermo, respectively.

We assume that agents form their beliefs about the fundamental value through an imitative process, considering the relative ability shown by optimists and pessimists in guessing the realized stock price. We also introduce an endogenous switching mechanism, allowing agents to switch to the other group of speculators if they performed better in terms of relative profits. Moreover, the stock price is determined by a nonlinear mechanism. We study, via analytical and numerical tools, the stability of the unique steady state, its bifurcations and the emergence of complex behaviors, with possible multistability phenomena. To quantify the global propensity to optimism/pessimism of the market, we introduce an index, depending on pessimists' and optimists' beliefs and shares, thanks to which we are able to show that the occurrence of the waves of optimism and pessimism are due to the joint effect of imitation and switching mechanism. Finally, we perform a statistical analysis of a stochastically perturbed version of the model, which high lights fat tails and excess volatility in the returns distributions, as well as bubbles and crashes for stock prices, in agreement with the empirical literature.","[Cavalli, F.] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Math Sci Math Finance & Econometr, Via Necchi 9, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Naimzada, A.] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, U6 Bldg,Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Pireddu, M.] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Math & Applicat, U5 Bldg,Via Cozzi 55, I-20125 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Pireddu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Math & Applicat, U5 Bldg,Via Cozzi 55, I-20125 Milan, Italy.",fausto.cavalli@unicatt.it; ahmad.naimzada@unimib.it; marina.pireddu@unimib.it,,,,,,,43,8,8,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In contrast, modeling voters' evolving beliefs about an unknown income dynamic process shows a slow and polarizing shift toward redistributive preferences. Simulation using fitted income dynamics suggests that this imperfect information perspective accounts for Latin America's right-to-left political shift, and offers additional insights about political dynamics in the face of economic polarization.","[Morrow, John] Birkbeck Univ London, CEP, London, England; [Morrow, John] Birkbeck Univ London, CEPR, London, England; [Carter, Michael R.] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carter, Michael R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; Birkbeck University London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of London; Birkbeck University London; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Morrow, J (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, CEP, London, England.;Morrow, J (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, CEPR, London, England.",morrow1@hushmail.com; mrcarter@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

To achieve this aim, it traces the transition of mainstream economics from a Newtonian inspired empirical science to a Hobbesian inspired mathematical deductivism. Classical Political Economy was self-consciously Newtonian on the basis of its search for empirically grounded real world forces. Amongst its many scientific achievements, this led to a focus on the way that labour is organized in capitalist societies. The pioneering marginalist's also assumed the mantle of Newton, however their scientific procedures were far more Hobbesian than Newtonian. Without ever acknowledging it, Marginalism draws heavily on a variant of Hobbesian state of nature theory adopted for the allocation of scarce resources. Homo Economicus is the modern equivalent of Hobbesian man, set to solve an optimization problem. By severing Newton's mathematics from his scientific method, the early marginalist's successfully packaged a version of utilitarian metaphysics as rigorous scientific progress. This allowed an extant version of pro-capitalist ideology to become the standard bearer for mainstream economics.","[O'Boyle, Brian] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, St Angelas Coll Sligo, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"O'Boyle, B (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Galway, St Angelas Coll Sligo, Galway, Ireland.",boboyle@stangelas.nuigalway.ie,,,,,,,58,0,0,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using the national panel data from 2000 to 2015, based on the error correction model and import-intensity-adjusted demand model, our results show that the slowdown of China's trade growth in 2012-2015 was mainly a result of cyclical factors. Using 2000-2015 industry-level data, we also find that the structure of trade goods had an inhibitory effect on the import slowdown but a positive effect on the export slowdown. Trade protectionism had an adverse effect on the trade growth slowdown. The global value chain participation marginally contributed to the slowdown in trade growth. Therefore, the impacts of structural factors on trade growth slowdown cannot be ignored, and related policies should receive greater attention from policy-makers.","[Qian, Xuefeng; Liu, Zhao; Pan, Ying] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Qian, XF (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xfqian@126.com; liuzhao_06@126.com; panying08@126.com,,,Zhongnan University of Economics and Law: The New Normal of the Economy and China's New International Competition Advantage [31501710801],Zhongnan University of Economics and Law: The New Normal of the Economy and China's New International Competition Advantage,This research is supported by a project of the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law: The New Normal of the Economy and China's New International Competition Advantage (Grant No. 31501710801).,,28,7,9,2,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2017,25.0,6,,,,,65,83,,10.1111/cwe.12221,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FM8VN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415369600004,0

Top income earners are modeled as managers who operate a span of control technology as in Rosen (1982). Managers are heterogeneous across talent, which is both effort-augmenting and total-factor-productivity improving. The latter gives rise to a positive scale-of-operations effect. A tax formula for optimal taxes is derived linking optimal marginal tax rates to preferences and technology parameters. We show how to quantify the model using readily available firm-level data. Our benchmark calibration focuses on the US. Our results suggest that optimal top taxes are roughly in line with the current statutory rates and, thus, are significantly lower than what previous optimal taxation studies that ignore the scale-of-operations effect have shown.

In our setting, the optimal contest design in terms of maximizing the probability that at least one innovator is successful depends on the probability of successful innovation, given that innovation is feasible.

A reduced-form approach that captures the dynamic effects of Brexit on productivity more than triples these losses and implies a decline in average income per capita of between 6.3% and 9.4%, partly via falls in foreign investment.

I present a dynamic stochastic model of the labor market that integrates two main features: search frictions and trade unions. Because of search frictions, each job match yields an economic surplus that is shared between the worker and the firm. Therefore, I can decompose the volatility of wages into two components: the volatility of the match surplus and the volatility of the worker share of the surplus. Starting from the unions' objective function, I show that under collective wage bargaining, the worker share is endogenous and counter-cyclical. Consequently, when the economy is hit by a shock, the dynamics of the worker share partially counteract the dynamics of the match surplus, and this mechanism delivers endogenous wage rigidity. The model thus offers new insights into two business cycle features: the union wage premium fluctuates counter-cyclically, and employment is more cyclical but less persistent when wages are collectively bargained.","[Morin, Annaig] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Morin, A (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, Porcelaenshaven 16A, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",amo.eco@cbs.dk,,,Department of Economics at Bocconi University; Department of Economics at Lyon II University,Department of Economics at Bocconi University; Department of Economics at Lyon II University,"I am grateful to Alberto Alesina, Christian Bauer, Tito Boeri, Mickael Burda, Vincenzo Cuciniello, Szabolcs Deak, Matthias Doepke, Maja Ferjancic, Christian Haefke, Claudio Lucifora, Nicola Pavoni, Salvador Ortigueira, Alain Sand, Martin Schneider, Antonella Trigari, Francesco Zanetti, and seminar participants at Bocconi university, GATE-Lyon II University, the 2010 European Workshop in Macroeconomics, WIEM 2010, AFSE 2010, ISNE 2010, ASSET 2010, RES 2011, IAB Workshop 2011, ERA 2011, and 2016 Africa Meeting of the Econometric Society for their very useful comments.

This patchwork approach raises concerns about emissions leakage from uncapped sources that may or may not face other forms of regulation. The potential for such leakage may be particularly keen within the electricity sector where market and political boundaries are not perfectly aligned or when emissions regulations differ by fuel source or by vintage of the electricity generator. In this paper we use simulation modeling to explore options for using emissions allowance value as a production incentive to reduce leakage to uncapped generators due to vintage differentiated regulation within the context of US EPA's Clean Power Plan. We show that updating allocation based on electricity production to covered emitting generators can reduce emissions leakage by 70 percent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the study estimates P-star model using the alternative measures of money such as simple sum and Divisia M3, to examine the relevance of aggregation theoretic monetary aggregates in explaining inflation. The empirical results indicate that P-star model with real money gap has an edge over traditional Phillips curve approach in forecasting inflation. More importantly, we found that the P-star model estimated with Divisia real money gap performs better than its simple sum counterpart.

To illustrate the method, it is applied to a simple neo-Kaleckian model of euro area business cycle fluctuations including endogenous fiscal and monetary policy as well as endogenous wage formation. The estimated model parameters are broadly in line with the literature. To evaluate the empirical performance, we compare its marginal likelihoods and impulse-response functions to those of a corresponding Bayesian vector autoregression model after relaxing the theory-implied cross-coefficient restrictions as well as a benchmark dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. The results suggest that both outperform the neo-Kaleckian model. In particular, we identify misspecification problems in the fiscal and monetary policy transmission mechanisms. Future research should be directed at improving the empirical fit of models in the post-Keynesian tradition and the current paper provides useful tools for doing so.","[Schoder, Christian] New Sch Social Res, 6 East 16th St, New York, NY 10010 USA",The New School,"Schoder, C (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, 6 East 16th St, New York, NY 10010 USA.",schoderc@newschool.edu,,,Hans Bockler Foundation,Hans Bockler Foundation,Finally financial support by the Hans Bockler Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

In addition to pumped storage, it considers double-structure buffering, demand management, Norwegian hydro-dam buffering and international diversification via grid expansion. If Germany operated in autarchy and tried to handle the volatility of wind-solar production without using stores while replacing all nuclear and fossil fuel in power production, on average 61%, and at the margin 94%, of wind-solar production would have to be wasted, given the current level of other renewables. To avoid any waste, the wind-solar market share in an autarchic solution must not be expanded to more than 30%. By using Norway's hydro plants the share could be expanded to 36%. If Norway were to build all the pumped storage plants the ESTORAGE study deems feasible, Germany's wind-solar market share could be expanded by another 24 percentage points to about 60%, which corresponds to 48% of the combined German and Norwegian markets. Additionally expanding the market to Switzerland, Austria and Denmark and building the maximal number of pumped stores would increase the combined wind-solar market share for all five countries to nearly 50%.

By detecting one endogenous break point in the raw series, we identify two clusters: one in 2008 and another in 2014, due to the financial crisis and the structural low oil prices linked to changing fundamentals, respectively. Also, the U.S. Henry Hub gas seems to be associated with the stock market volatility indexes, contrary to the European NBP gas, which is linked to the Brent. Besides, regarding the volatility behaviors of our series, the four energy variables violate their thresholds at similar moments, and the stock market VIX and VSTOXX exhibit logically similarities. Co-movements are detectable as well between the VIX and crude oil series, when investigating the volatility extracted from the GARCH model. In addition, the Block-DCC estimates provide ample evidence of similarities in the correlation dynamics between the crude oil and stock volatility series. It should be noted that the modeling framework proposed in this paper represents a useful tool for the study of cross-market contagion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with a cultural influence, this impact is also found after the monasteries were dissolved in the 1530s.

With rising information overload and reduced decision-making time, touchpoints have gained additional importance by yielding customer loyalty. Yet, the existing digital marketing tools have failed to keep pace with these trends. Companies are lacking a simple framework that focuses on a digital marketing strategy built around touchpoints and customer loyalty. This is especially relevant for B2B companies, which due to their specifics are more dependent on customers and less flexible in adapting of new digital trends. Purpose of the article: A B2B business strategy tailored to digital trends demands a reevaluation of prior understanding of a product portfolio, a company's internal and external environment. The purpose of the article is to present a framework that helps to undertake the necessary changes and enables the connections with industry. Methods: The suggested model has been drawn from the literature review and extended based on the findings of a multiple case study of Austrian Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) industry companies. The fieldwork was conducted in early 2017. Findings & Value added: Aspiring to follow trends in digital marketing and to help B2B companies to adapt their strategy to ongoing changes in company-to-customer communication, a new framework has been developed. The framework aims to increase customer loyalty and focuses on channels/ touchpoints, assets, skills, audience and customer journey. The model could be beneficial for Chief Marketing Officers (CMO) and other C-levels by offering a simple and reliable tool for improving a company's position in the digital marketplace. Moreover, it enables continuous adjustment of an already existing business strategy.","[Bakhtieva, Elina] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Bakhtieva, E (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",bakhtieva@fame.utb.cz,"Bakhtieva, Elina/AAC-9780-2021","Bakhtieva, Elina/0000-0002-8176-2319",Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University [IGA/FaME/2016/007],Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University,This work was supported by the Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University under the project no.

Reforms that increase the retirement age have an expansionary effect on output, but a small (and oftentimes) negative effect on the net foreign asset position. In contrast, reforms that cut pension benefits improve the net foreign asset position but reduce output.

We present the results of a macroeconomics laboratory experiment that investigates the effects of alternative rationing schemes on economic stability. Participants play the role of worker-consumers who interact in labor and output markets. All output, which yields a reward to participants, must be produced through costly labor. Automated firms hire workers to produce output so long as there is sufficient demand for all production. In every period either output or labor hours are rationed. Random queue, equitable, and priority (i.e., property rights) rationing schemes are compared. Production volatility is the lowest under a priority rationing rule and is significantly higher under a scheme that allocates the scarce resource through a random queue. Production converges toward the steady state under a priority rule, but can diverge to significantly lower levels under a random queue or equitable rule where there is the opportunity for and perception of free-riding. At the individual level, rationing in the output market leads consumer-workers to supply less labor in subsequent periods. A model of myopic decision-making is developed to rationalize the results.","[Fenig, Guidon] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, 9 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada; [Petersen, Luba] Simon Fraser Univ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; Simon Fraser University,"Petersen, L (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",g.fenig@usask.ca; lubap@sfu.ca,,"Fenig, Guidon/0000-0001-8886-4986",Sury Initiative for Global Finance and International Risk Management; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Sury Initiative for Global Finance and International Risk Management; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We have benefited from the insightful comments of Katherine Anderson, David Freeman, Catherine Eckel, George Evans, Chloe Gibbs, Brit Grosskopf, Erik Kimbrough, Corrine Low, Charles Noussair, Rosemary Prentice, Alexandra van Geen, two anonymous referees as well as seminar and conference participants at University of British Columbia, University of Saskatchewan, the 2014 Canadian Economic Association Meetings, the 2015 Barcelona GSE Summer Forum in Theoretical and Experimental Macroeconomics, and the 2016 North American Economic Science Association.

The most widely used population counts are of hukou registrations from each province, prefecture, county, or city rather than of the people living in each place and generating local gross domestic product. Over 220 million people have left their place of registration, while almost none had when reforms began, creating time-varying errors in estimates of per capita income of subnational units. We survey empirical articles in blue ribbon journals, in development journals, and in regional and urban economics journals that use China's subnational data. Over 80% of articles use these data erroneously; most commonly the wrong population or employment counts are used to measure the size of subnational units, and per capita data are calculated with the wrong denominator for how variables are interpreted. We provide examples of errors from each group of journals, and a critical test of one highly cited study. Specifically, we show that if hukou registrations are erroneously used to measure the local population, following existing practice, conclusions about driving forces for urban area expansion are reversed.

This separation allows the investigation of, for example, how various parameter constellations affect the scope for multiple symmetric or asymmetric equilibria, or how the equilibrium set depends on the nature of the strategies. The approach is particularly helpful in applications because (i) it allows the complexity of the uniqueness problem to be reduced to a two-player game, (ii) boundary conditions are less critical compared to standard procedures, and (iii) best replies need not be everywhere differentiable. The usefulness of the separation approach is illustrated with several examples, including an application to asymmetric games and to a two-dimensional price-information game.","[Hefti, Andreas] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hefti, Andreas] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Sch Management & Law, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Hefti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland.;Hefti, A (通讯作者)，Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Sch Management & Law, Zurich, Switzerland.",andhefti@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,28,29,0,5,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

The vehicle is a dynamic general equilibrium model that incorporates two types of agents (capitalists and workers) and imperfectly competitive product and labor markets.

A key message is that, although it makes sense that workers are skeptical to a partial liberalization of the labor market only, they should welcome a comprehensive liberalization plan that includes both labor and product markets.

We address this question by using unique data from the Swedish soccer league where co-payment for police were introduced for some clubs only. The difference-in-differences analysis shows that co-payments increased private guards by 40% and suggests a reduction of unruly behavior by 20%. The results are consistent with our model, where co payments alleviate under-provision in efforts by organizers to combat problems such as hooliganism due to externalities and free-riding on police services. The model also sheds light on the critique that co-payments could lead financially constrained organizers to provide less security. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the first period he chooses either alternative and experiences a payoff as a result of his choice.

We model John's second period choice with a response function, i.e., a mapping from obtained payoffs to the probability of choosing the same alternative in the second period. We first provide results on (i) how the shape of the response function affects both expected payoffs and exposure to risk, and (ii) what standard models of choice under uncertainty would predict about the shape of the response function. We then run an experiment to elicit subjects' response functions, empirically characterize the heterogeneity across subjects with a mixture model, and illustrate how payoffs vary across response function types.

The model gives rise to boom-bust cycles that temporarily delink stock prices from fundamentals and quantitatively replicates many asset-pricing moments.

Overall, we find evidence for the joint dynamics of our variables as drivers of the imbalances and provide further evidence for different hypotheses of Global Imbalances. The results suggest that shocks to US' real GDP, real stock prices and the oil price are of particular importance for international trade balances and may thus be interpreted as support for parts of the global saving glut hypothesis as well as the international wealth channel.","[Bettendorf, Timo] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Bettendorf, T (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",Timo.Bettendorf@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,40,15,18,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

But the wage bill is also a crucial element of aggregate demand. Hence it could be that more flexible and fluid labour markets, while allowing for faster inter-firm reallocation of labour, may also render the whole economic system more fragile, more prone to recession, and more volatile. In this work, we investigate some conditions under which such a conjecture applies. The paper presents an agent-based model that investigates the effects of two archetypes of capitalism - in terms of regimes of labour governance defined by the mechanisms of wage determination, firing, labour protection and productivity gains sharing - upon (i) labour market regularities and (ii) macroeconomic dynamics (long-term rates of growth, GDP fluctuations, unemployment rates, inequality, etc.). The model is built upon the Keynes meets Schumpeter family of models (Dosi et al., 2010), explicitly incorporating different microfounded labour market regimes. Our results show that seemingly more rigid labour markets and labour relations are conducive to coordination successes leading to higher and smoother growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, the application of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) - an extension of the GLM - for estimation of the loss reserves is shown. Since the GLMM allows incorporating a random effect instead of several fixed effects corresponding to the accident years.as in case of the GLM, volatility of the prediction is reduced. This allows more flexible risk valuation, which is a crucial element of risk management and capital allocation practices of non-life insurers.

It addresses the question of whether behavior in virtual environments is a valuable source of empirical evidence for economists. A typology of virtual reality experiments based on the difference between low-immersive (LIVE) and high-immersive virtual environments (HIVE) is proposed. It is argued that virtual reality experiments are framed field experiments, which allow testing the effect of contextual cues on economic behavior under the strict control of the experimenter. This feature enhances replicability and attenuates the context-free illusion that represents an important limitation of the standard laboratory approach in economics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The analyses also delve more deeply into the effect of ASEAN trading link establishment on the short-term interdependency. By applying three-dimensional continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on daily returns of stock markets for the period 2009 to 2016, the interdependence level and lag-lead relationship among ASEAN trading link participants are estimated. The degree of interdependence in ASEAN stock markets is found to be stronger in the short term, especially following particular external shocks. A Variational Modes Decomposition (VMD)based copula estimation shows that the effect of economic shock - in our case, ASEAN trading link establishment - on the stock markets' level of comovement is only temporary and will progressively diminish within approximately two years. Only Indonesia and Malaysia display strong fundamental linkages between each other. Both the CWT and Copula methods consistently show that Vietnam (Indonesia) has the lowest (highest) interdependence with the rest of ASEAN trading link participants, as opposed to previous empirical evidence obtained from conventional methods. Investors who want to construct optimal portfolios and policymakers who aim to make effective macroeconomic policies should take these findings into account.","[Jiang, Yonghong; Nie, He] Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yonghong; Nie, He] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yonghong] Wisconsin Univ, Econ Dept, Eau Claire, WI 54701 USA; [Monginsidi, Joe Yohanes] Jinan Univ, Int Sch, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Monginsidi, Joe Yohanes] Univ Edinburgh, Business Sch, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland",Jinan University; Jinan University; Jinan University; University of Edinburgh,"Monginsidi, JY (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Int Sch, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Monginsidi, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Business Sch, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.",monginsidi@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,66,67,1,57,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Green growth is seen as a practical tool for achieving the timeless objective, which is sustainable development. In the paper, a particular attention is put on the following question: what kind of relationship occurs between green growth, green economy and sustainable development. The author analyses the purpose of simultaneous functioning of the three green ideas.The added value of this paper is a presentation of the author's model of GG-GE-SD relations and a new approach to defining the phenomenon of green growth. It is concluded that co-existence of the trio green economy green growth- sustainable development is reasonable due to the complementary and synergistic nature of correlations between these concepts.","[Kasztelan, Armand] Univ Life Sci Lublin, Fac Agrobioengn, Dept Econ & Agribusiness, Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland",University of Life Sciences in Lublin,"Kasztelan, A (通讯作者)，Univ Life Sci Lublin, Fac Agrobioengn, Dept Econ & Agribusiness, Akad 13, PL-20950 Lublin, Poland.",armand.kasztelan@up.lublin.pl,"KASZTELAN, ARMAND/T-3982-2018","KASZTELAN, ARMAND/0000-0002-1947-9846",,,,,40,82,82,10,110,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

Underlying this result is the existence of predictable mean reversion in credit-market conditions. When credit risk is aggressively priced, spreads subsequently widen. The timing of this widening is, in turn, closely tied to the onset of a contraction in economic activity. Exploring the mechanism, we find that buoyant credit-market sentiment in year t - 2 also forecasts a change in the composition of external finance: net debt issuance falls in year t, while net equity issuance increases, consistent with the reversal in credit-market conditions leading to an inward shift in credit supply. Unlike much of the current literature on the role of financial frictions in macroeconomics, this article suggests that investor sentiment in credit markets can be an important driver of economic fluctuations.","[Lopez-Salido, David] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"López-Salido, D (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",,"Zakrajsek, Egon/R-7053-2019; PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Stein, Jeremy/AAA-4003-2019",,,,,,72,105,131,4,70,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Focusing on the situation wherein the weighted sum of social welfare and quantity is adopted as its delegation contract within the public firm, we investigate the situation wherein the managerial delegation contract of the public firm is determined by maximizing social welfare, which is equal to the objective function of its owner, and the managerial delegation contract of the private firm is determined by bargaining over the content of the managerial delegation contract between its owner and manager. This paper clarifies that the equilibrium market structure depends on the bargaining power of the manager within the private firm. More concretely, when the bargaining power is sufficiently low, no equilibrium market structure exists. Furthermore, when the bargaining power is moderate (sufficiently high), the game wherein the public firm chooses a quantity contract and the private firm chooses a price contract and (both firms choose price contracts) becomes the unique equilibrium market structure.","[Nakamura, Yasuhiko] Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-2 Misaki Cho, Tokyo 1018360, Japan",Nihon University,"Nakamura, Y (通讯作者)，Nihon Univ, Coll Econ, Chiyoda Ku, 1-3-2 Misaki Cho, Tokyo 1018360, Japan.",yasuhiko.r.nakamura@gmail.com,,,"Inamori Foundation; Seimeikai Foundation; KAKENHI [16K03665]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H03624, 16K03665] Funding Source: KAKEN","Inamori Foundation; Seimeikai Foundation; KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

In these settings, the decision-maker principal seeks advice from managers, who instruct expert frontline workers to acquire information. Given unverifiable information quality and private-valued agents, moral hazard and adverse selection arise with workers and managers, respectively. Pairing extremely passionate workers with moderately skeptical managers alleviates both problems; however, the degree of managerial skepticism must be finely tuned: too little skepticism fails to improve workers' incentives, while too much skepticism destroys workers' incentives altogether.

We set up a life-cycle model in which individuals are subject to physiological aging, calibrate it with data from gerontology, and compare behavior and outcomes of adapting and non-adapting individuals. While adaptation generally increases lifetime utility (by about 2 percent), its impact on health behavior and longevity depends crucially on whether individuals are aware of their adaptive behavior, i.e. whether they adapt in a naive or sophisticated way. We also compute the QALY change implied by health shocks and discuss whether and how adaptation influences results and the desirability of positive health innovations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed approach aims at the proper selection of portfolios, in a way that for every covariance matrix estimate included in the analysis, the calculated portfolio variance remains as close to the corresponding individual minimum value, as possible. To accomplish this, we formulate a mixed integer non-linear program with quadratic constraints. With respect to practical underlying concerns, investment policy constraints regarding the portfolio structure are also taken into consideration. The validity of the proposed approach is verified through extensive out-of-sample empirical testing in the EuroStoxx 50, the S&P 100, the S&P 500, as well as a well-diversified investment universe of ETFs. We report consistent generation of stable out-of-sample returns, which are in most cases superior to those of the worst-case scenario. Moreover, we provide strong evidence that the proposed robust model assists in selective asset picking and systematic avoidance of excessive losses.","[Xidonas, Panos] ESSCA Grande Ecole, Angers, France; [Hassapis, Christis] Univ Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Soulis, John] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Samitas, Aristeidis] Univ Aegean, Mitilini, Greece",ESSCA School of Management; University of Cyprus; Imperial College London; University of Aegean,"Xidonas, P (通讯作者)，ESSCA Grande Ecole, Angers, France.",panos.xidonas@essca.fr,"; Hassapis, Christis/S-1287-2017","Xidonas, Panos/0000-0003-3325-1474; Hassapis, Christis/0000-0002-7808-270X",,,,,40,18,19,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Our main goal is to identify key factors affecting the external imbalances. This assessment of the cause of external imbalances will help us understand what has to be changed in European economies to recover the external balances going forward. We estimated a panel VAR model over the period 1999 to 2014 for a sample of 11 European countries that were split into two groups: advanced and emerging. The obtained results show that the real effective exchange rate has a negative effect on the current account balance in both groups of countries, although the effect is more pronounced in emerging than in advanced countries. Other variables such as the budget balance, economic growth, and output gap affect current account balance positively in advanced countries and negatively in emerging countries. Economic activity captured by output gap explains the highest portion of current account variations in emerging countries. In advanced countries, in addition to economic activity, the real exchange rate also plays a prominent role in current account imbalances.","[Cota, Boris; Bogdan, Zeljko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon & Econ Dev, Zagreb, Croatia; [Erjavec, Natasa] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Erjavec, N (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Zagreb, Croatia.",nerjavec@efzg.hr,"Erjavec, Nataša/AAD-4565-2020; Cota, Boris/HZL-2919-2023","Erjavec, Nataša/0000-0002-0943-2198; Bogdan, Zeljko/0000-0002-0497-4959; Cota, Boris/0000-0001-7352-5893",,,,,21,4,4,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We focus on uncovering new empirical evidence about the establishment of CIs, whether they are related to natural resources, and the extent to which the establishment of new CIs and Chinese foreign aid flows affect one another. Whereas Chinese aid flows do indeed appear to be empirically associated with African countries' natural resources, the evidence we report suggests that CIs are established based on a distinct set of motives. We find that CIs, Chinese foreign aid flows to Africa and natural resources have joint predictive power on the subsequent year's Chinese FDI outflows. CIs are not, however, positively associated with the subsequent year's aid flows. And aid flows are not positively associated with the subsequent year's expected number of CIs. We interpret this as evidence that CIs reflect an economically significant expression of Chinese soft power. The goals underlying the expression of this soft power are not subsumed by natural resource seeking and are not easily compressed to a single dimension. The data show that CIs and aid flows are not positive predictors of each other and are not subsumed (i.e., made to disappear) by the inclusion of controls for natural resources. Thus, the presence of a CI reveals independent, novel, and economically significant information about future trade flows that cannot be explained away by differences in resources or other control variables commonly found in empirical models of trade flows. The empirical evidence suggests that CIs are indeed an effective instrument for increasing China's soft power but that this soft power is not motivated solely (if at all) by resource seeking.

In this paper we maintain a different view, that the financial crisis and the ensuing real crisis have roots in the strong increase in income inequality that has been taking place in the Western world in the last thirty years or so. This has created an all around aggregate demand deficiency crisis that has strongly reduced prospects and opportunities for investments in productive capacities and shifted resources toward other uses, thus feeding a perverse relation between the productive and the non-productive assets of the economy. In this context the way out of the crisis is re-establishing the right distributive conditions, which cannot be obtained by a policy aimed at relieving the weight of private or public debts but calls for a redistribution through taxes on the incomes of non-productive sectors, a fine tuning that should prevent excessive taxations transforming positive into negative effects.","[Amendola, Mario; Patriarca, Fabrizio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Gaffard, Jean-Luc] OFCE Sci Po, Skema Business Sch, OFCE 60 Rue Dostoievski, F-06902 Valbonne, France; [Gaffard, Jean-Luc] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, OFCE 60 Rue Dostoievski, F-06902 Valbonne, France",Sapienza University Rome; SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Cote d'Azur,"Patriarca, F (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",jeanluc.gaffard@sciencespo.fr; fapatri@hotmail.com,"Patriarca, Fabrizioa/AAZ-9890-2020","Patriarca, Fabrizio/0000-0002-3840-492X",,,,,38,2,2,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The more common before-tax 401(k) contribution is tax-deductible in the contribution year, but both principal and investment earnings are taxed upon withdrawal. Using administrative data from eleven companies that added a Roth contribution option to their existing 401(k) plan between 2006 and 2010, we find no evidence that total 401(k) contribution rates differ between employees hired before versus after Roth introduction, which implies that take-home pay declines and the amount of retirement consumption being purchased by 401(k) contributions increases after Roth introduction. We reject several neoclassical explanations for our null finding.

We use detailed firm-level data for Flanders, the largest region in Belgium, to evaluate whether its program raises firms' propensity to start exporting outside the EU single market. We find robust evidence for such an effect by relying on the selection-on-observables assumption which we implement using various estimators. We address a likely upward bias due to self-selection into support using two strategies: (i) focus on sub-samples of firms where endogenous selection into treatment is less likely, and (ii) use firms that receive the weakest form of support as controls for firms receiving more extensive support. The effects remain positive and statistically significant, but are smaller in magnitude and in the second case estimated much less precisely. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a model with heterogeneous producers and underdeveloped domestic financial markets, we explain the joint dynamics of total factor productivity (TFP) and capital flows. When a large-scale economic reform removes preexisting idiosyncratic distortions in a small open economy, its TFP rises, driven by efficient reallocation of economic resources. At the same time, because of the domestic financial frictions, saving rates surge but investment rates respond only with a lag, resulting in capital outflows. The dynamics of TFP, capital flows, and idiosyncratic distortions in the model are consistent with what is observed during growth acceleration episodes, which often follow large-scale economic reforms.","[Buera, Francisco J.] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, 230 South La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Shin, Yongseok] Washington Univ St Louis, CB 1208,1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Shin, Yongseok] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Shin, Yongseok] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Buera, FJ (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, 230 South La Salle St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",francisco.buera@chi.frb.org; yshin@wustl.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-0820318, SES-0946647]; Kauffman Foundation [20090598]; Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty at the University of Chicago",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Kauffman Foundation; Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty at the University of Chicago,We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science Foundation (grants SES-0820318 and SES-0946647) and the Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty at the University of Chicago.

An Analysis for Spain and the Biggest European Economies,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,sustainability; economic development; renewable energy; non-renewable energy,UNIT-ROOT TESTS; PANEL-DATA; TIME-SERIES; ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; ERROR-CORRECTION; CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIP; NONRENEWABLE ENERGY; GROWTH; COINTEGRATION; GDP,"Background: This paper assesses the sustainability of the Spanish economic development model for the period 1980-2010. Moreover, we carry out a comparative analysis with the biggest European economies: France, Germany, Italy and United Kingdom. Methods: In order to achieve the aim of this paper, co-integration techniques have been applied. Through these techniques, we have analyzed the long-term relationship between consumption of renewable and non-renewable and economic development and pollution during the period 1980-2010. After a selection process, for Spain we have used to measure growth the GDP and the Gross Capital Formation; to measure development, the Index of Human Development and Social Capital; for pollution, the emissions of CO2 and consumption of renewable energy in the electricity system and oil consumption for the consumption of renewable and non-renewable, respectively. Secondly, we have compared the results obtained for the Spanish economy with the four biggest economies in the European Union: Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Given the availability of data for these countries Gross Capital Formation and Human Development Index have been excluded from the analysis. Results: First, a positive impact of consumption of renewable and renewable energy on growth and development is found for the five countries under study, with a greater impact of non-renewable energy. For the three countries for which the data for CO2 emissions are available (Spain, France and the UK), it is observed that the reducing effect of renewable energy on CO2 emissions is less than the polluting effect of non-renewable energy. Second, for Spain, Germany and France, the data point out a feedback process between the consumption of non-renewable and growth and development, which is not observed with the consumption of renewable energy. Conclusions: In order to reconcile the objective of growth with the reduction of pollution, more moderate growth rates are required. The growth model of the countries analyzed stimulates consumption of non-renewable energy, but not renewable. This result points out the requirement of designing policies that encourage the substitution of non-renewable energy by renewable energy.","[Caraballo Pou, Maria Angeles] Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Seville, Spain; [Garcia Simon, Juana Maria] Junta Andalucia, Gabinete Anal Macroecon, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Pou, MAC (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Seville, Spain.",mcaraba@us.es; juanam.garcia.simon@juntadeandalucia.es,"Caraballo, M.

We develop a two-country behavioral macroeconomic model where the synchronization of the business cycle is produced endogenously. The main channel of synchronization occurs through a propagation of animal spirits, i.e. waves of optimism and pessimism that become correlated internationally. We find that this propagation occurs with relatively low levels of trade integration. We do not need a correlation of exogenous shocks to generate synchronization.

The empirical analysis shows that the intervention was successful as insider weights and insider hysteresis effects were reduced, and that the system of coordinated wage bargaining was re-established.

The buyer's arrival date is the first date at which contracting is feasible and is his private information. To induce immediate participation, the buyer is granted positive expected rents even if his value at arrival is the lowest possible. The buyer is punished for arriving late; i.e., he expects to earn less of the surplus. Optimal allocations for a late arriver are also further distorted below first-best levels. Conditions are provided under which allocations converge to the efficient ones long enough after contracting, and this convergence occurs irrespective of the time the contract is initially agreed (put differently, the so-called principle of vanishing distortions introduced by Battaglini (2005) continues to apply irrespective of the buyer's arrival date).

Using an annual data set of 120 countries over the period 1960-2014, the results show that fiscal multipliers are larger in advanced economies, when public debt is low, at a high level of financial development, in a financial crisis, and during business cycle downturns. Contrary to conventional wisdom, fiscal multipliers are not necessarily smaller in countries that are relatively open to trade and capital flows and operating under flexible exchange rate regimes. The relationship between the size of fiscal multipliers and the three dimensions of openness-trade openness, capital mobility, and exchange rate flexibility-hinges on the response of the real exchange rate and the domestic monetary policy pursued.","[Koh, Wee Chian] Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, CAMA, JG Crawford Bldg, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Koh, Wee Chian] Ctr Strateg Policy Studies, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei",Australian National University,"Koh, WC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Coll Asia & Pacific, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, CAMA, JG Crawford Bldg, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.;Koh, WC (通讯作者)，Ctr Strateg Policy Studies, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.",wc.koh@anu.edu.au,,"Koh, Wee Chian/0000-0001-8710-5427","Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam","Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam","This work was supported by the Centre for Strategic and Policy Studies, Brunei Darussalam.",,52,18,19,2,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

At risk neutrality and low levels of worker risk aversion effort falls with higher taxes, whereas with sufficiently high risk aversion effort increases with tax rises. In the former, firms respond to higher taxes by reducing the wage spread and increasing it in the latter. It sheds light on why top earners' income has risen with tax reductions over the last five decades.

We found that risk tolerant workers were more likely to be entrepreneurs than risk averse workers by about 5 percentage points, or about 20 percent of the proportion of entrepreneurs in the labour force. The results imply that not all entrepreneurs in Indonesia are pushed into the sector; some actively take risks and seek innovations.","[Sohn, Kitae] Konkuk Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Konkuk University,"Sohn, K (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05029, South Korea.",ksohn@konkuk.ac.kr,,,,,,,53,13,13,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

While most evaluations of municipal mergers have focused on the efficiency of local public goods provision, it is rare in the literature to explore how such mergers promote economic growth in a developing country context. This research investigates the economic consequences of a policy experiment of city-county mergers (che xian she qu) in China during the period 2000-2004. Using comprehensive datasets at city, county and firm levels, we present evidence that the merger significantly increases local economic development, and the magnitude of the effect depends on local endowments related to agglomeration forces. The results are robust to a number of different model specifications. We further verify that improved transport infrastructure and urban agglomeration economies after merger are potential contributors to the positive merger effects.","[Tang, Wei] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

The outcome variable may be continuous, discrete, or a mixture of both, while the instrumental variable can take binary values. First, we study the case where the model includes a selection equation for the binary endogenous regressor. We establish point identification of the individual treatment effects and the structural function when the latter is continuous and strictly monotone in the latent variable. The key to our results is the identification of a so-called counterfactual mapping that links each outcome of the dependent variable with its counterfactual. Second, we extend our identification argument when there is no selection equation. Last, we generalize our identification results to the case where the outcome variable has a probability mass in its distribution such as when the outcome variable is censored or binary.","[Vuong, Quang] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Xu, Haiqing] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA",New York University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Vuong, Q (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",qvuong@nyu.edu; h.xu@austin.utexas.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES 1148149]; UT Austin,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); UT Austin,"A previous version of this paper was circulated under the title Identification of nonseparable models with a binary endogenous regressor.

Universities can either be domestic or foreign, and payoffs for the student differ between them. The presence of these foreign universities can potentially increase effortand so human capitalby providing more incentive to study. However, they can also lead to brain drain as students could be more likely to emigrate upon graduation relative to those who attend a domestic university.

However, diversification cannot be truly achieved if we continue to ignore additional dimensions of risk, namely skewness and kurtosis. This study incorporates higher moments of risk to form a mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis based framework for portfolio optimisation. Inclusion of higher moments in optimisation framework acknowledges the risk of asymmetric returns and fat-tail risk and can help investors in formulating optimal portfolios of stocks which can be significantly divergent from the ones they obtain through the Markowitz mean-variance optimisation. Our results confirm the presence of tradeoff between returns and additional dimensions of risk in Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) and strongly suggest including them in the optimisation framework to avoid sub-optimal decisions and to curtail exposure towards higher moments of risks.","[Naqvi, Bushra] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan; [Mirza, Nawazish] SP Jain Sch Global Management, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Naqvi, Waqar Azeem] Univ Sargodha, Dept Commerce, Lahore Campus, Lahore, Pakistan; [Rizvi, S.

To address this issue, we employ weekly productivity and administrative data obtained from the customer service centre of an insurance company. We find evidence that performance feedback given each Monday morning about past team production and individual rank position within teams influences current individual productivity. The effect of rank position is strongest when bonuses depend on team performance. Overall, our findings suggest that team dynamics may alleviate the free-rider problem often associated with team bonuses, where it is essential that team leaders provide information about individual and team performance in previous periods.","[Aakvik, Arild] Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Fosswinckelsg 14, N-5020 Bergen, Norway; [Hansen, Frank] Norges Bank, Oslo, Norway; [Torsvik, Gaute] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Bergen; Norges Bank; University of Oslo,"Aakvik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Econ, Fosswinckelsg 14, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.",arild.aakvik@econ.uib.no,,,University of Bergen,University of Bergen,We are grateful to Karl Ove Aarbu for providing the data and giving helpful comments.

In principle, the economic difficulties faced by the Spanish youth during the last recession would have hampered a normal emancipation pace. However, we find that the proportion living away from parents among those aged 18-40 has not decreased but increased from 44 % during the boom (2005-2008) to 46 % during the bust (2009-2013). A simple decomposition reveals that this is mainly driven by the substantial rise in the emancipation rate among the full-time employed workers during the bust. To explain this change we discuss several factors such as macroeconomic conditions, rental subsidy policy, higher labor mobility, selection bias, reverse causation, time-lag in adjustment and secular trend.","[Ahn, Namkee; Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Ahn, N (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Avda Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",namkee.ahn@unican.es; sanchezv@unican.es,"Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/H-2543-2015","Sanchez-Marcos, Virginia/0000-0001-9260-4327",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO-2012-35820],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

In this paper, I examine if removing this cap can solve Social Security's future budgetary problems. I find that when this cap is removed, benefits need to decline by less than 4% to keep Social Security solvent, compared to by almost 12% when the cap is held fixed at its current level. Households for whom the cap expires respond by working and saving less, which reduces labor supply, capital stock, and output, and also reverses some of the initial expansion in Social Security's revenues. Elimination of the cap alters the pattern of redistribution implicit in Social Security, and also imposes larger distortions on labor supply and saving, which reduces overall welfare.","[Bagchi, Shantanu] Towson Univ, Dept Econ, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA",University System of Maryland; Towson University,"Bagchi, S (通讯作者)，Towson Univ, Dept Econ, 8000 York Rd, Towson, MD 21252 USA.",sbagchi@towson.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,31,5,6,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6116,1935-1690,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

More than any other integration process in the world, the ASEAN case is singled out as a counter-model for the EU. The ASEAN model is thereby associated with features such as: low levels of institutionalization, pragmatism, bottom-up or de facto regionalization, regional production platforms, and so on. The positive features of this 'model' are often emphasized; however, in recent years there have also been calls for deepening the institutionalization of ASEAN, including from the ADB. The purpose of our paper is double: On the one hand, we present a long-term meta-analysis of available indicators in order to compare more accurately the ASEAN experience with other integration experiences worldwide, and complement (and test) the mostly qualitative approaches in the comparative literature. This should allow to better identify convergences and divergences between ASEAN and other integration processes. On the other hand, by comparing ASEAN with benchmark cases, we shed new light on the potential for further deepening the economic integration process in Southeast Asia. The latter comparison is complemented with gravity-type model estimations to assess the potential for further developing intra-ASEAN trade. It is shown that ASEAN's export space is expanding faster than the world average and that there is still space for ASEAN countries to further develop the role of its intra-regional trade. ASEAN can further improve the region's competitiveness by reducing the non-tariff barriers and technical barriers, trade facilitation, strengthening regional value chains, facilitating factor mobility and enhancing regional cooperation.","[Chen, Lurong] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Cuyvers, Ludo] Univ Antwerp, Ctr ASEAN Studies, Antwerp, Belgium; [Cuyvers, Ludo] North West Univ, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [de Lombaerde, Philippe] Neoma Business Sch, Paris, France",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia; University of Antwerp; North West University - South Africa,"Cuyvers, L (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Ctr ASEAN Studies, Antwerp, Belgium.;Cuyvers, L (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Potchefstroom Campus, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",Lurong.chen@eria.org; ludo.cuyvers@uantwerpen.be; philippe.de-lombaerde@neoma-bs.fr,"Cuyvers, Ludo/ABE-2557-2020","De Lombaerde, Philippe/0000-0002-6546-6771",,,,,54,3,3,5,30,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We simulate the outcomes of competition in and for the market using a differentiated-products oligopoly model allowing for inter- and intra-modal competition in a long distance passenger market. Specifically we first calibrate the model using data describing high speed lines in France and show that the incumbent railway operator's strategy does not simply boil down to a short-term profit maximization (e.g. because of existing regulation or limit-pricing strategy). This yields two important results when simulating competition. First, whether it is for or in the market, the opening to competition does not guarantee a decrease in prices in favor of passengers. Second, the effects of opening up to competition for the market are relatively predictable and potentially positive, while those of opening up to competition in the market remain very uncertain.","[Ivaldi, Marc] CEPR, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Ivaldi, Marc] CESifo, Toulouse, France; [Cherbonnier, Frederic] Toulouse Sch Econ & Sci Po, Toulouse, France; [Muller-Vibes, Catherine] Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, France; [Van Der Straeten, Karine] CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Van Der Straeten, Karine] Inst Adv Study Toulouse, Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Ivaldi, M (通讯作者)，CEPR, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France.;Ivaldi, M (通讯作者)，CESifo, Toulouse, France.",marc.ivaldi@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,31,7,7,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

To empirically assess these three forces, I estimate a dynamic oligopoly model using a unique panel data set of hard disk drive manufacturers.

Using the original demand system introduced by Bowley (The Mathematical Groundwork of Economics, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1924) as a reference, we argue that this alternative model does not capture a consumer's taste for variety. Moreover, we demonstrate that positive values for the parameter which represents cross-price effects in the alternative demand system corresponds to the regime of complementary products in the original Bowley model. As a consequence, for increasing values of this parametermeant to capture increasing competition in the usual senseprices do not converge towards marginal costs and profits do not vanish. Finally, we study a duopoly with international transfer pricing and demonstrate that conflicting policy conclusions are derived depending on which of the models is used to capture demand.","[Kopel, Michael; Ressi, Anna] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria; [Lambertini, Luca] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy",University of Graz; University of Bologna,"Kopel, M (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria.",,"Kopel, Michael/AAF-1301-2020","LAMBERTINI, LUCA/0000-0001-6353-4753",EU COST Action [IS1104],EU COST Action(European Union (EU)European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"Financial support for this research has been provided by EU COST Action IS1104, 'The EU in the new economic complex geography: models, tools and policy evaluation'.",,28,3,3,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

This paper attempts to remedy that failing. Drawing from Aristotle, Hume, Rawls, and recent psychological research, it argues that an ethics code grounded in our moral intuitions, suitably refined and tested by reason, is essential for a code to be workable and widely accepted. The intuitions most relevant to banking are those arising from common social practices-namely, mutual promising, game-playing, persuasion, and guardianship. The norms behind mutual promising underpin the entire industry, while those of the other practices inform ethics in trading, sales, and asset management, respectively. The paper then spells out in detail some of those norms; examines the roles that 'playing by the rules', helping competitors, sincerity, bias, disclosure, competence, conflicts of interest, and other factors play in their specification; and discusses the circumstances in which the operation of these social-practice-based ethical norms are tempered by compassion.","[Mass, Robert] Goldman Sachs Int, London, England",,"Mass, R (通讯作者)，Goldman Sachs Int, London, England.",robert.mass@gs.com,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,,,,,24,2,3,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

This model is equivalent to a long-term equilibrium in electricity and renewable energy certificate (REC) markets under perfect competition. We consider different scenarios of demand growth, resource eligibility (e.g., large hydropower), and transmission system configuration. Our numerical results indicate that the sole characteristics of the available renewable resources in the country and reductions in technology costs will provide sufficient economic incentives for private investors to supply a fraction of renewables larger than 70% for a broad range of scenarios, meaning that the proposed target will likely remain a symbolic government effort. Increasing transmission capacity between the northern and central interconnected systems could reduce total system cost by $400 million per year and increase the equilibrium share of non conventional renewable energy (NCRE) in the system from 45% to 52%, without the need for any additional policy incentive. Surprisingly, imposing a 70% of NCRE by 2050 results in a REC price lower than the noncompliance fine used for the current target of 20% of NCRE by 2025, the latter of which represents the country's maximum willingness to pay for the attributes of electricity supplied from NCRE resources.

Not only is there currently a debate over the best policy instrument, it is also discussed whether the renewable energy production should be expanded centralized at locations with the highest production potential or decentralized close to load. It is yet not fully understood what influences the spatial distribution of renewable energy installation. 1 assess the effect of subsidy scheme and market design on the spatial distribution of wind energy installations by comparing (a) feed-in tariffs versus market premiums and (b) uniform versus nodal pricing. The analysis is based on theoretical considerations and using a six-node test model that reflects the consumption and renewable resource distribution in several countries and regions. The institutional setting has great influence on the spatial distribution and resulting system costs. With uniform pricing, a market premium only leads to a more decentralized expansion of renewable energy production than a tariff when sites share similar wind conditions. Spatially more distributed expansion of wind power performs better in terms of total costs and share of wind power in final demand when networks are restricted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

() with two distinctive features: (i) buyers have heterogenous preferences and their willingness to pay is private information and (ii) sellers become financially distressed if they cannot sell for too long. A unique steady-state equilibrium exists and it is characterized by predatory buying. Specifically, during periods where sellers are more likely to become distressed (e.g. during economic crises, financial turmoils, etc.) buyers become more selective and hold off purchasing despite the abundance of distressed sales and low prices. This reluctance triggers the number of distressed sellers to grow even further and forces them for additional price cuts.","[Selcuk, Cemil] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Selcuk, C (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",,,"Selcuk, Cemil/0000-0002-2267-604X",,,,,26,0,0,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Tests for reverse causality within a panel Granger framework reveal a uni-directional causality of corruption with the first variable, but a bi-directional one with the second. These findings suggest that a limitation in the supply of high-denomination banknotes, inter alia, could be a tool to fight corruption, and bring to the fore the important role of payment systems, extending an earlier study by Goel and Mehrotra (2012).

We show that the trends in household income inequality are largely driven by changes in wage inequality. Given the detailed nature of our series we show that measurement issues and breaks in the series need to be dealt with in order to draw robust conclusions from the data. Most standard inequality measures show that wage inequality has increased over the period. Nevertheless the choice of measure matters, because there are different trends in different parts of the distribution. It appears that the distribution below the median has become more compressed, while the top of the wage distribution has moved away from the median. The inequality in the labour market translates into even higher inequality in society given that high earners tend to live together with other high earners while low wage individuals often end up sharing their incomes with the unemployed. Furthermore there are many South Africans with access to no wage income. Given the trends analysed here it is not surprising that overall inequality in South Africa has not come down or has even increased since the end of apartheid.","[Wittenberg, Martin] Univ Cape Town, SALDRU, DataFirst, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Wittenberg, Martin] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Cape Town,"Wittenberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, SALDRU, DataFirst, Rondebosch, South Africa.;Wittenberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Rondebosch, South Africa.",martin.wittenberg@uct.ac.za,"Wittenberg, Martin/J-3146-2013","Wittenberg, Martin/0000-0002-1946-8186","Redi3x3 project on Employment/Unemployment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth; University of Cape Town","Redi3x3 project on Employment/Unemployment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth; University of Cape Town","This paper draws on and extends work reported on in two working papers, Wittenberg and Pirouz (2013) and Wittenberg (2014).

Using the UK Labor Force Survey, the authors estimate the causal effect of national minimum wage (NMW) increases on the probability of job entry and job exit by means of a non-parametric Bayesian modelling approach known as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). The application of this methodology has the important advantage that it does not require ad-hoc assumptions about model fitting, number of covariates and how they interact. They find that the NMW exerts a positive and significant impact on both the probability of job entry and job exit. Although the magnitude of the effect on job entry is higher, the overall effect of NMW is ambiguous as there are many more employed workers. The causal effect of NMW is higher for young workers and in periods of high unemployment and they have a stronger impact on job entry decisions. No significant interactions were found with gender and qualifications.","[Cabras, Stefano] Univ Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; [Cabras, Stefano] Univ Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Fidrmuc, Jan] Charles Univ Prague, IES, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fidrmuc, Jan] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Sassari, Sassari, Italy; [de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, CRENoS, Madrid, Spain; [de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, CRENoS, Madrid, Spain; [de Dios Tena, Juan] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Inst Flores Lemus, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of Cagliari; Brunel University; Charles University Prague; Ifo Institut; University of Liverpool; University of Sassari; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Fidrmuc, J (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, London, England.;Fidrmuc, J (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, IES, Prague, Czech Republic.;Fidrmuc, J (通讯作者)，CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany.",Jan.Fidrmuc@brunel.ac.uk,"Tena, J.D/AAF-3763-2021; Cabras, Stefano/AAA-2477-2019; Fidrmuc, Jan/AAL-3954-2021; Fidrmuc, Jan/AFL-8367-2022","Tena, J.D/0000-0003-3018-2442; Cabras, Stefano/0000-0001-6690-8378; Fidrmuc, Jan/0000-0002-3350-7276",,,,,28,0,0,0,12,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 29,2017,11.0,,,,,,,,201715.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-15,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EW1TR,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402277300001,0

This paper addresses this issue by quantifying the impacts of additional education expenditure using an endogenous growth overlapping generations model applied to the Canadian economy. Simulation results show that tax-financed increases in education expenditure lead to sustainable productivity gains when external effects of human capital are accounted for. In addition, growth effects of gradual increases in investments in education suggest the existence of a significant scope for public policy. However, welfare gains may not be evenly distributed across generations. Cohorts entering the workforce just after the policy shocks would bear a larger share of the financing costs, while future cohorts enjoy higher earnings and welfare. The results suggest that the specification of households' preferences may also play an important role in the assessment of education policy. (C) 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling.

This framework comprises 21 country/region-specific models, estimated over the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1, and accounts for not only direct exposures of countries to El Nino shocks but also indirect effects through third-markets. We contribute to the climate-macroeconomy literature by exploiting exogenous variation in El Nino weather events over time, and their impact on different regions cross-sectionally, to causatively identify the effects of El Nino shocks (direct and total) on growth, inflation, energy and non-fuel commodity prices. The results show that there are considerable hetero-geneities in the responses of different countries to El Nino shocks. While Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Nifio shock, for other countries (including the United States and European region), an El Nifio occurrence has a growth-enhancing effect. Furthermore, most countries in our sample experience short-run inflationary pressures as both energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase. Given these findings, macroeconomic policy formulation should take into consideration the likelihood and effects of El Nifio weather episodes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a multinary group identification model where memberships to three or more groups are simultaneously determined based on individual opinions on who belong to what groups. Our main axiom requires that membership to each group, say the group of J's, should depend only on the opinions on who is a J and who is not (that is, independently of the opinions on who is a K or an L). This shares the spirit of Arrow's independence of irrelevant alternatives and, therefore, is termed independence of irrelevant opinions. Our investigation of multinary group identification and the independence axiom reports a somewhat different message from the celebrated impossibility result by Arrow (1951). We show that the independence axiom, together with symmetry and non-degeneracy, implies the liberal rule (each person self-determines her own membership). This characterization provides a theoretical foundation for the self-identification method commonly used for racial or ethnic classifications.","[Cho, Wonki Jo; Ju, Biung-Ghi] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University,"Cho, WJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",chowonki@korea.ac.kr; bgju@snu.ac.kr,,"Cho, Wonki/0000-0002-7651-8784",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2016S1A3A2924944]; Institute of Economic Research (Center for Distributive Justice) at Seoul National University,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Institute of Economic Research (Center for Distributive Justice) at Seoul National University,"We thank the editor and two anonymous referees for comments that greatly improved the earlier version of this paper.

Chen and Micali bypassed this impossibility by slightly enlarging the strategy spaces, yet assuming knowledge of the maximum value a player may have for a copy of the good, and the ability of imposing high fines on the players. For unrestricted combinatorial auctions, efficiency in collusion-resilient dominant strategies has remained open, with or without the above two assumptions. We fully generalize the notion of a collusion-resilient dominant strategy mechanism by allowing for arbitrary strategy spaces; construct one such mechanism for multi-unit auctions, without relying on the above two assumptions; and prove that no such mechanism exists for unrestricted combinatorial auctions, with or without any additional assumptions. Our results hold when the mechanism does not know who colludes with whom, and players in the same coalition can perfectly coordinate their strategies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

A novelty of the paper is to jointly estimate home productivity and the elasticity of substitution between market goods and home hours, which is accomplished through structural estimation based on income-decile level data. With a high elasticity of substitution and a slower growth rate of productivity in the home sector relative to the market sector, the model can produce key data patterns of time allocation in both the cross sections and time series. Quantitatively, relative productivity can account for 32% of the variation in market hours and 18% of the variation in home hours. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides new evidence of the causal effect of child quantity on child quality by exploiting regional differences in the enforcement intensity of China's one-child policy (OCP) as an exogenous source of variation in family size. Using the percentage of current mothers of primary childbearing age who gave a higher order birth in 1981, we construct a quantitative indicator of the extent of local violation of the OCP, referred to as the excess fertility rate (EFR). We then use regional differences in EFRs, net differences in pre-existing fertility preferences and socio-economic characteristics, to proxy for regional differences in OCP enforcement intensity. Using micro data from the Chinese Population Censuses, we find that prefectures with stricter enforcement of the OCP have experienced larger declines in family size and also greater improvements in children's education. Despite the evident trade-off between family size and child quality in China, our quantitative estimates suggest that China's OCP makes only a modest contribution to the development of its human capital.

In particular, he criticizes the theory of third best (see Section 3 below). This paper explains our agreements and differences and reaches the following conclusions. First, several arguments provided do not invalidate the theory of third best, at least if correctly interpreted and applied. We may have useful piecemeal welfare policies after all, if appropriately used. Second, I did not and do not attempt to refute the general result of second-best theory; both the second-best and third-best theories remain valid, if properly interpreted. Third, the usefulness of some general results (properly interpreted and used) and the importance of additional information (if available) on specific context need not be an either-or choice (Section 1). Finally, the third-best theory is not completely non-context specific; the distinction between cases of Informational Poverty and Scarcity itself depends on the context. However, it also provides some general guides useful for making piecemeal policies in different contexts (Sections 3 and 4).","[Ng, Yew-Kwang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Ng, YK (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",ykng@ntu.edu.sg,"Ng, Yew-Kwang/AAM-1664-2021","Ng, Yew-Kwang/0000-0001-5669-9883",,,,,15,3,4,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Our results provide new evidence that fiscal decentralisation led to a significant increase in community spending on social infrastructure (health and education) in communities which observed strict adherence to customary laws and had a tradition of local democracy. We argue that investment in transport and communication facilitates exchange with outsiders and improves the outside options of community members, thus making it more difficult to sustain intra-community cooperation. Consequently, communities which enjoy a high level of cooperation in collective activities benefit less from investing in transport and communication and are more inclined to invest in social infrastructure.

Theoretically, though, the effect could be positive or negative, and empirical evidence has supported both cases. Previous studies, however, have ignored the fact that physicians face risk from industry oversight groups like state-level medical licensing boards in addition to civil litigation risk. This article addresses this omission by incorporating previously unused data on punishments by oversight groups against physicians, known as adverse actions, along with malpractice payments data to study state-level health care spending. My analysis suggests that, contrary to conventional wisdom, spending does not rise in response to increased risk. An increase in adverse actions of 16 (the year-to-year average) is associated with statistically significant, annual decreases in state spending on hospital care of approximately $22 million, and on prescription drugs of nearly $10 million. Malpractice payments are estimated to have smaller, statistically insignificant effects.","[Barkowski, Scott] Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA",Clemson University,"Barkowski, S (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, John E Walker Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA.",sbarkow@clemson.edu,"Barkowski, Scott/AGQ-6673-2022","Barkowski, Scott/0000-0003-2906-6858",,,,,55,1,1,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

For the final valuation standards it could be recommended to use minimum of two methods of valuation or one of the two in detailed analysed models.","[Hrdy, Milan; Duchackova, Eva] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Hrdy, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague, Czech Republic.",hrdy@vse.cz; duchack@vse.cz,,,Faculty of Finance and Accounting University of Economics in Prague [IP 100040],Faculty of Finance and Accounting University of Economics in Prague,"This paper was prepared with the institutional support of the Faculty of Finance and Accounting University of Economics in Prague, Grant No. IP 100040.",,20,0,0,1,20,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The impact of different collateral constraint assumptions,ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial crises; Credit externalities; Bailouts; Macroprudential policies,BANKING CRISES; EQUILIBRIUM; ECONOMY; CYCLES,"The literature on small open-economy models with collateral constraints has provided the theoretical grounds for macroprudential regulations. This paper examines a subsidy on debt during a crisis as a form of bailout in comparison with prudential capital controls. We show that the policy prescription on bailouts differs substantially between the timing assumptions of the collateral constraint of households. If borrowing is constrained by the value of assets that households have purchased before they borrow, the bailout is neutral, suggesting that prudential capital controls are preferable. If, on the other hand, households collateralize their assets that they purchase at the same time as their borrowing, the bailout replicates the unconstrained allocation without collateral constraint and outperforms prudential capital controls. Even in the latter case, however, our numerical experiments suggest that such bailouts restoring the unconstrained allocation may not be implementable in terms of its size and frequency.","[Katagiri, Mitsuru; Kato, Ryo] Bank Japan, Tokyo, Japan; [Tsuruga, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan; [Tsuruga, Takayuki] Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Tsuruga, Takayuki] Govt Japan, Cabinet Off, Tokyo, Japan",Bank of Japan; Kyoto University,"Tsuruga, T (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kyoto, Japan.;Tsuruga, T (通讯作者)，Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Tsuruga, T (通讯作者)，Govt Japan, Cabinet Off, Tokyo, Japan.",takayuki.tsuruga.n5i@cao.go.jp,"Kato, Ryo/A-8207-2009; Katagiri, Mitsuru/JCO-4641-2023; Tsuruga, Takayuki/S-2151-2019","Tsuruga, Takayuki/0000-0002-8177-2330; Kato, Ryo/0000-0002-3819-394X","Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H05728, 15H05729] Funding Source: KAKEN","Kyoto University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank Gianluca Benigno, Timothy Kam, Takashi Kamihigashi, Timothy Kehoe, Shigeto Kitano, Keiichiro Kobayashi, Teruyoshi Kobayashi, Cesaire Meh, Eric R.

Women who leave school in an economic downturn experience better sleep quality, although the effect emerges over time.

This study investigates the impact on employment chances of a relatively light and inexpensive intervention. In a field experiment in a public employment office in Flanders, a random selection of clients were invited for a mandatory information session in the first month of the unemployment spell, while the control group were invited after four months of unemployment.

We also see differences in the economic returns to English between urban and rural residents and between rural-urban migrants and urban locals.

In equilibrium, the firms behave as if they were price takers, leading to the competitive outcome (but positive profits). Given the unique result for the short-run competition, we are able to investigate the firms' ex ante capital investment decisions.

J,"Freedman, J",,,,"Freedman, Judith",,,Tax and Brexit,OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Brexit; corporation tax; state aid; value add tax; tax incentives; tax avoidance,,"It has been suggested that Brexit creates opportunities for the UK to become a tax haven with low rates of tax and new tax incentives. The opportunities created should not be exaggerated. On the one hand, some of the actions now being mooted, such as the further reduction of corporation tax, could have been taken regardless of the decision to leave the EU. On the other hand, the UK has played a leading role in formulating the OECD's action points to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). Moving too far away from this programme would be contrary to stated government policy to counteract aggressive tax avoidance and would be seen as reneging on agreements with the global tax community. The UK's extensive network of bi-lateral double taxation agreements could be placed in jeopardy by changes seen to be out of line with international norms, nor would such changes be conducive to the making of new international trade agreements. Most forms of Brexit would remove some constraints on the making of tax policy in the UK, enabling the government to introduce new exemptions and reliefs without the restrictions currently imposed by VAT directives, the requirement to satisfy the four freedoms, or the state aid regime. But this removal of restrictions on the freedom to make tax policy could lead to a temptation to respond to pressure groups and make rapid changes to the tax system that might well turn out to be ill-advised. Brexit offers some opportunities but also dangers. Any tax changes made need to be part of long-term and principled planning for the tax system as a whole, and tax incentives and reliefs should not be seen as quick fixes.","[Freedman, Judith] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Freedman, Judith] Oxford Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Freedman, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Freedman, J (通讯作者)，Oxford Ctr Business Taxat, Oxford, England.",judith.freedman@law.ox.ac.uk,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023",,,,,,38,5,5,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Still, in the 6 months since the referendum, there has been little discernible impact on macroeconomic variables beyond a fall in the value of the pound, and the economics profession has been criticized for being overly gloomy in its predictions. This article offers some immediate reflections on the state of the economy in the run-up to the vote, on the forecasts of economists during the campaign, and on the changes to policy since. The lack of an immediate recession has been taken as evidence that the economics was wrong, but it is not evidence that leaving the EU will be economically harmless. Despite fiscal and monetary loosening most forecasters still expect growth to be slower than otherwise over the medium term. The vote and debate around it does offer some challenges for economics and we conclude with five lessons for the profession.","[Johnson, Paul; Mitchell, Ian] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Johnson, P (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",paul_j@ifs.org.uk; ian_m@ifs.org.uk,,,ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,22,7,7,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We run a field experiment to measure the impact of augmenting the CF model with a direct CF training on the diffusion of a new technology. All villages have CFs and access the same extension network. In treatment villages, CFs additionally receive a three-day, central training on the new technology. We track information transmission through two nodes of the extension network: from extension agents to CFs, and from CFs to other farmers. Directly training CFs leads to a large, statistically significant increase in adoption among CFs.

However, hedging the latter in arbitrary proportions might be more effective under some conditions. The paper constructs optimal hedging strategies for both scenarios during the periods of relatively stable and volatile oil prices observed in recent years. Minimization of downside risk (LPM2) and variance are used as alternative hedging objectives. The joint distribution of spot and futures price log returns is modeled using a kernel copula method. The hedging performance of the constructed strategies is compared using hedging effectiveness, expected profit, and expected shortfall. The results show that allowing for arbitrary proportions in the sizes of futures positions generally achieves a better hedging performance. The advantage becomes particularly important during periods characterized by greater variation of the cross-dependence between the price log returns of individual commodities. In addition, using LPM2 as a hedging criterion can help hedgers to better track downside risk as well as lead to higher expected profit and lower expected shortfall. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It takes advantage of a new and unique longitudinal dataset of virtually all Russian companies whose shares were traded in the RTS/MICEX/MOEX over 1998-2014. The analysis highlights a number of strong trends in the evolution of boards of directors, such as a declining participation of insider directors and an increasing participation of foreign and female directors. It also shows that board characteristics are linked to company performance (market-to-book ratio, Tobin's Q ROE and ROA), suggesting that boards of directors play a non-trivial role in corporate governance in Russia. Testing for structural breaks in the relationship between board composition and firm performance provides some evidence of the changing role of corporate boards over time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional use of abstract context in experimental economics is commonly viewed as a way to achieve experimental control. However, there are some advantages to using context framed instructions, such as employer and worker instead of player 1 and player 2. Meaningful context can enhance understanding of an environment and reduce confusion among participants, particularly when a task requires sophisticated reasoning, and hence may yield responses of better quality. In emotionally-charged research questions, such as pollution or bribes, contextual instructions may affect behavior in the experiment, but this effect may be appropriate as it relates to the research question. Our review of the evidence from the literature indicates that in the great majority of cases meaningful language is either useful or produces no change in behavior. Nevertheless, a few important considerations are worth keeping in mind when using rich context. Finally, we see the choice of context as being an expansion of the experimenter's toolkit and a factor to consider in experimental design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Tax incentives encouraging the use of clean energy sources, by discouraging the use of fossil fuel, produce a sizeable reallocation of emissions across sectors and are found to be expansionary.

The foreign country intervenes in support of the group that draws the largest gains from trade, since such a group is willing to concede most in trade agreements. But interventions are more than offset by the domestic political system, which supports in power the group that concedes least (economic nationalism). I allow for geopolitical competition between the main trade partner and a second foreign country as well as for domestic ideological preferences over the two and look at how geopolitical competition interacts with the economic mechanism described above.

Agents differ in income, probability of becoming dependent and of receiving family help, and amount of family help received. Social insurance redistributes across income and risk levels, while private insurance is actuarially fair. The income-to-dependency probability ratio of agents determines whether they prefer social or private insurance. Family support crowds out the demand for both social and, especially, private insurance, as strong prospects of family help drive the demand for private insurance to zero. The availability of private insurance decreases the demand for social insurance but need not decrease its majority-chosen level.

Part of this neglect emanates for inadequate conceptions of the nature of law itself. Spontaneous conceptions of law and property rights that down-play the role of the state are criticized here, because they typically assume relatively small numbers of agents and underplay the complexity and uncertainty in developed capitalist systems. In developed capitalist economies, law is sustained through interaction between private agents, courts and the legislative apparatus. Law is also a key institution for overcoming contracting uncertainties. It is furthermore a part of the power structure of society, and a major means by which power is exercised. This argument is illustrated by considering institutions such as property and the firm. Complex systems of law have played a crucial role in capitalist development and are also vital for developing economies. (C) 2016 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.

We focus on relative concerns in the form of conspicuous consumption and introduce them into a standard economic geography model a la Krugman. We show that the level of social integration within the suburban areas of cities and the level of economic integration across cities are crucial in determining the city sizes. An interesting case arises with moderate trade costs when relatively small shares of income are devoted to the consumption of the differentiated good: if classes of workers are segregated (as in homogenous suburban areas), relative concerns tend to generate dispersed, medium-size cities; when workers of different classes socially interact, relative concerns contribute to foster socially integrated megalopolises.

The literature suggests that the biased income health effect obtained with macro data can be a result of the aggregation of individual concave income functions on average health. This aggregation problem is analysed in detail, and a bias-correcting method is proposed to overcome it. The results with new model alternatives show that they correct the income effects on average health in the right direction; that is, they produce smaller parameter estimates than biased models. Augmenting the results with the quantile regression approach, which is sensitive to health differences between countries, indicates that the poorest countries' income gradient is still much larger than that of rich countries. However, the median life expectancy effect of the log of GDP per capita across the countries decreased during the sample decennials. The results for income inequality measured with the Gini coefficient indicate that the effects of inequality on health are still significant in the poorest countries but non-significant among rich countries after the year 2000. We argue that the proposed bias-correcting method retains the interest in macro health modelling and offers new model alternatives in other contexts.","[Linden, Mikael; Ray, Devdatta] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Hlth & Social Management Hlth Econ, Kuopio Campus,POB 162, Kuopio 70211, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Linden, M (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Hlth & Social Management Hlth Econ, Kuopio Campus,POB 162, Kuopio 70211, Finland.",mika.linden@uef.fi,,,,,,,43,19,22,1,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Sceptics, however, see that liberalization engenders economic instability and banking crises, and impedes growth. Bank efficiency and productivity, following liberalization, is extensively examined. Nonetheless, the core issue of bankers' self-motivation remains implicitly assumed and unaddressed. Does liberalization self-motivate bankers and increase their efforts and productivity? This paper models bank productivity from this perspective and evaluates what proportion of banks' total factor productivity is accounted for by the self-motivated productivity of bankers. We provide a micro-founded framework for the analyses of bankers' optimal level of effort and effort-driven productivity. Our model also captures banks' unit input-output prices, optimal wages, bank spread and the overall cost of bank services measures that are important in evaluating reform policies. We assess the financial liberalization of Nepal as a test case and find that (i) bankers' efforts and productivity have notably improved in Nepal, although banking services have become costly, and (ii) bank spread has moderately declined in recent years. Our approach is parametric which differs from DEA, hence complements the literature. We hope this analytical framework will be useful to evaluate reform episodes elsewhere.","[Luintel, Kul B.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Selim, Sheikh] Univ Westminster, London, England; [Bajracharya, Pushkar] Tribhuvan Univ, Kirtipur, Nepal",Cardiff University; University of Westminster; Tribhuvan University,"Luintel, KB (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",LuintelK@cardiff.ac.uk; selims@westminster.ac.uk; pushkarb2000@gmail.com,,"Selim, Sheikh/0000-0002-7931-092X",,,,,44,2,2,0,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

An analysis of Denmark and Germany,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity price volatility; Time-series model; Wind power; Solar power; Nord Pool; EEX,WIND POWER; MARKET INTEGRATION; IMPACT,"Although variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies with zero marginal costs decrease electricity prices, the literature is inconclusive about how the resulting shift in the supply curves impacts price volatility. Because the flexibility to respond to high peak and low off-peak prices is crucial for demand-response applications and may compensate for the losses of conventional generators caused by lower average prices, there is a need to understand how the penetration of VRE affects volatility. In this paper, we build distributed lag models with Danish and German data to estimate the impact of VRE generation on electricity price volatility. We find that in Denmark wind power decreases the daily volatility of prices by flattening the hourly price profile, but in Germany it increases the volatility because it has a stronger impact on off-peak prices. Our analysis suggests that access to flexible generation capacity and wind power generation patterns contribute to these differing impacts. Meanwhile, solar power decreases price volatility in Germany. By contrast, the weekly volatility of prices increases in both areas due to the intermittency of VRE. Thus, policy measures for facilitating the integration of VRE should be tailored to such region-specific patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In two field experiments, we attempt to exogenously manipulate sources of social influence in the workplace. This environment allows the use of administrative data to map participants' hierarchies in a network, and their approximate proximity to each-other socially. In our first experiment, participants are sent an email by the CEO asking them to donate a day's salary to charity. When this email is personalised, being addressed to Dear John rather than Dear Colleague, donations significantly increase. In the second experiment, we provide some participants with information about the proportion of their colleagues who have already donated. In this case, the social norm is not to donate (only 7.5% have donated). We find no negative effects of this information on future donations, and that for some, high-ranking groups, the effect is (perhaps counterintuitively) positive. We suggest that relationships within the workplace a concern for status relative to the CEO, or for the firm's reputation may explain these results.

By using panel data for Belgian graduates, we consider the role of unobserved worker heterogeneity. Random measurement error in both types of mismatches is accounted for by adopting instrumental variable techniques. We consistently find that overeducated individuals without field of study mismatch earn less than adequately educated workers with a similar educational background. However, for individuals who are working outside their field of study, such a wage penalty is not always observed once accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and random measurement error.

Using a panel framework covering 46 countries over the period 1996-2012, we first find some suggestive evidence that the elasticity of real manufacturing exports to the real effective exchange rate (REER) has decreased over time. We then examine whether the formation of supply chains has affected this elasticity using different measures of GVC integration. Intuitively, as countries are more integrated in global production processes, a currency depreciation only improves competitiveness of a fraction of the value of final good exports. In line with this intuition, we find evidence that GVC participation reduces the REER elasticity of manufacturing exports by 22 percent, on average.","[Ruta, Michele] World Bank, 1818 H St, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Ahmed, Swarnali; Appendino, Maximiliano] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",The World Bank; International Monetary Fund,"Ruta, M (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",mruta@worldbank.org,,,,,,,30,38,39,0,29,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We advance that pre-colonial institutions survived to our days thanks to the existence of largely self-governed Amerindian communities in rural Latin America. Amerindians groups with more advanced institutional capacity would have been able to organize and defend their interests in front of national governments; leading to better development outcomes for themselves and for the population at large.

Depending on the political costs and the extent of unemployment, they might choose between a decrease in the proportion of accepted applications, a decrease in the level of benefits, or some combination of the two. This paper is motivated by this concern, weaving together the intensive literature on the determinants of welfare caseloads and the fundamentals of public choice theory applied to the design of welfare programs. The paper is based on data from the minimum income program of Catalonia's government (PIRMI). We use autoregressive distributed lag models to find that the generosity of the program is clearly predictive of the receipt of benefits even in contexts of high and growing unemployment rates.

A semi-structural estimation approach is employed based on a dynamic model of monopsonistic competition. The empirical analysis relies on a linked employer-employee data set which allows to control for observed heterogeneity both on the worker and on the firm side. The results show important differences in monopsonistic competition among low-wage industries: While retailing, the hotel and restaurant industry as well as agriculture can be described as monopsonistic labour markets, this is not true for other services and manufacturing of food products. From a policy point of view, the introduction of a uniform minimum wage may therefore lead to different employment reactions in industries with a similar minimum wage bite.","[Frings, Hanna] RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Frings, Hanna] IZA, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany",IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Frings, H (通讯作者)，RWI, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.;Frings, H (通讯作者)，IZA, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",frings@rwi-essen.de,,"Bachmann, Ronald/0000-0001-7675-5272",,,,,45,9,12,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

MSMEs originated in ASEAN tend to internationalize through, among others, direct/indirect exports, licensing, franchisings, and contract manufacturing with MNEs. The main objective of the article is to indicate the role of MSMEs in the ASEAN region, that established economic community in the end of 2015 with a single market and production base, major drivers of MSMEs' internationalization, as well as challenges to MSMEs' internationalization.","[Bobowski, Sebastian] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Bobowski, S (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",sebastian.bobowski@ue.wroc.pl,"Bobowski, Sebastian SB/Q-3884-2018",,,,,,9,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,143,152,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300014,0

We calibrate the model by reference to the risk of earthquakes, floods and storms in developing countries. We find that the countries most vulnerable to these risks would find it optimal to use CAT bonds for insurance if the cost of issuing these bonds were significantly smaller than it is in the data. The welfare gains from CAT bonds range from small to substantial depending on how insurance affects the country's external borrowing constraint. The option of using CAT bonds may bring a welfare gain of several percentage points of annual consumption by enhancing the country's ability to borrow. These large gains disappear if the country can opportunistically default on its external debt.","[Borensztein, Eduardo; Cavallo, Eduardo] Inter Amer Dev Bank, 1300 New York Ave NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Jeanne, Olivier] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Jeanne, Olivier] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Jeanne, Olivier] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jeanne, Olivier] CEPR, London, England",Inter-American Development Bank; Johns Hopkins University; Peterson Institute for International Economics; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Jeanne, O (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, 3400 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",Borensztein@iadb.org; Cavalloe@iadb.org; ojeanne@jhu.edu,,,,,,,40,11,13,2,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

One point of view suggests that organizational innovation impacts performance only, while the other suggests that it impacts technical innovation and firm performance. We use the framework of Crepon-Duguet-Mairesse (CDM) to control for endogeneity; we also use two different measures for organizational innovation. Our contributions to the literature are: the CDM framework in this context is novel; prior research either did not/could not control for endogeneity whereas the CDM framework mitigates this. To discriminate between the direct and indirect approach, we implemented AIC and BIC tests. We find that for the innovation equations in all cases and regardless of which organizational innovation variable is used the direct model is preferable. In contrast, for the productivity equations, we find that in all cases the indirect model is preferable. Thus we do not have a definitive statistical test for which model is superior.

The aim is to highlight the main risk factors in order to pay higher attention to the prevention and control of the disease. Ongoing dramatic increase in the number of people with cognitive impairment will put high demands on health and social care in the Czech Republic. Population aging and the increase of elderly persons aged 80+ evoked a need to address this issue, since age is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, dementia and severe cognitive impairment. Currently there has been little attention paid to statistical methods and approaches that may contribute to early identification of dementia and cognitive disorders. In this research logistic regression helps to explain important variables associated with severe cognitive impairment in the Czech Republic.","[Csefalvaiova, Kornelia] Univ Econ, Dept Demog, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cséfalvaiová, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Demog, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kornelia.csefalvaiova@vse.cz,,,"Internal Grant Agency of University of Economics, Prague [35/2017]","Internal Grant Agency of University of Economics, Prague","This article was supported by the Internal Grant Agency of University of Economics, Prague, No.: 35/2017 under the title Demographic models in software R.",,12,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,245,252,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300024,0

Lack of confidence in the government's labour is driving a large proportion of the electoral register to support new emergent political parties. This article models and analyses Spanish citizens' electoral behaviour in what were the last Spanish General Elections (2015). The proposed compartmental model is based on a system of six different equations. Transition coefficients are quantified according to economic, demographic, psychological and sociological factors. After obtaining the initial data from previous general elections and by sampling new voters' intentions, the expected electoral support was computed and analysed.

The purpose of this study stems out of the current debate related to the EU budget reform, where tax-based own-resources are required to replace the current system of own resources of the EU budget. The novelty of this research arises from the evaluation of a hypothetical EU lump-sum tax as a future replacement of GNI and VAT-based EU budget own sources. The aim of this paper is to analyze the potential of a lump-sum tax as a source of future EU funding. We consider lump-sum tax as an EU per capita charge applicable to all citizens of 28 EU member states. In order to assess the lump-sum tax potential we simulate five different lump-sum tax rates and compare the obtained yield to current EU own resources. The results of the research show that a charge per capita in the EU does not have the capacity to fully replace GNI or VAT-based EU own resources. Therefore, we consider the EU per capita charge as a form of complementary source to fund the EU own budget, with no real potential to fully replace the current EU own resources.","[Dobranschi, Marian; Nerudova, Danuse; Solilova, Veronika] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1-613 00, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Dobranschi, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Zemedelska 1-613 00, Brno, Czech Republic.",marian.dobranschi@mendelu.cz; danuse.nerudova@mendelu.cz; veronika.solilova@mendelu.cz,"Dobranschi, Marian/V-6136-2018; Solilova, Veronika/U-1720-2017; Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012","Dobranschi, Marian/0000-0002-5642-0341; Solilova, Veronika/0000-0002-9122-539X; Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107",,,,,35,0,0,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We account for the potential endogeneity of supplementary private hospital insurance purchases and calculate moral hazard based on a difference-of-means estimator. We decompose the moral hazard estimate into a diversion component that is due to an insurance-induced substitution away from public patient care towards private patient care, and an expansion component that measures a pure insurance-induced increase in the propensity to seek private patient care. Our results suggest that on average, private hospital insurance causes a sizable and significant increase in the likelihood of hospital admission as a private patient. However, there is little evidence of an expansion effect; the treatment effect of private hospital insurance on private patient care is driven almost entirely by the substitution away from public patient care towards private patient care. We discuss the implications for policies that aim to expand supplementary private insurance coverage for the purpose of reducing excess demand on the public healthcare system.","[Eldridge, Damien S.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Onur, Ilke] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Velamuri, Malathi] Chennai Math Inst H1, Siruseri, Kelambakkam, India",Australian National University; University of South Australia; Chennai Mathematical Institute,"Onur, I (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",ilke.onur@unisa.edu.au,"Eldridge, Damien Sean/AAB-9071-2022; Onur, Ilke/F-3868-2013","Eldridge, Damien Sean/0000-0002-2599-5732; Onur, Ilke/0000-0001-5082-6298",La Trobe University,La Trobe University,"The authors are grateful to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for allowing us access to the data used in this article, and to Cagatay Koc for comments and suggestions.

However, most of the bubble periods are short-lived, reflecting the market's ability to quickly respond to price deviations unjustified by fundamentals. The longest bubble period occurred in mid-2014, corresponding to a period of relatively low trading volume.

The size of the market power sacrifice was greater when small banks competed against numerous banks within their local markets and particularly substantial when they were outnumbered mostly by large commercial banks.","[Filip, Dariusz] UKSW, Dept Finance, Warsaw, Poland; [Jackowicz, Krzysztof; Kozlowski, Lukasz] Kozminski Univ, Dept Banking Insurance & Risk, Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Jackowicz, K (通讯作者)，Kozminski Univ, Dept Banking Insurance & Risk, Warsaw, Poland.",kjtrist@kozminski.edu.pl,"Kozłowski, Łukasz/I-6015-2015","Kozłowski, Łukasz/0000-0002-2887-9067; Filip, Dariusz/0000-0002-6905-1004; Jackowicz, Krzysztof/0000-0002-9891-530X",Narodowe Centrum Nauki [2014/13/B/HS4/00209],"Narodowe Centrum Nauki(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work was supported by Narodowe Centrum Nauki: [2014/13/B/HS4/00209].,,60,10,11,2,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

J,"Fronczek, M",,,,"Fronczek, Malgorzata",,,IMPORT PENETRATION RATE IN VIEW OF A NEW CONCEPT OF MEASURING FOREIGN TRADE,ARGUMENTA OECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,international trade; import penetration; trade in value added; foreign trade of EU,,"The article discusses the issue of import market penetration (IPR). The formula that has been in use so far assumes that the products manufactured and exported by a given country do not contain any foreign value and, likewise, the goods imported by a country do not contain any domestic value. In today's open economy, however, the models taking such assumptions significantly distort the picture of the reality. The new concept on measuring foreign trade based on added value is an attempt at eliminating this limitation. Accordingly, it would be justifiable to modify the formula of the indicator so that it could account for the foreign value in the production and exports, while leaving out the domestic value in imports. The article is an attempt to develop such a formula and apply it to the assessment of the import penetration rate for the EU-15 countries. It was assumed that the inclusion of foreign value in the domestic production would cause the import penetration rate to be higher than in the case of using the old formula. The calculations were conducted with data from the OECD-WTO Database and WIOD Database. The results for the selected years from the period 1995-2011 did not allow to unequivocally confirm the hypothesis in the case of the selected group of countries. They show, however, that the import penetration rate in the EU-15 countries has risen irrespective of the method applied. On the other hand, the value of the modified indicator for agricultural and industrial goods in total was on average lower that the values calculated using the standard method by approximately 6-10 percentage points. The modified IPR was lower than the traditional one for textiles, chemicals, basic metals and fabricated metal products, computer and electronic equipment, transport equipment, but for the other groups the corrected IPR was higher than the traditional one.","[Fronczek, Malgorzata] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Int Econ Relat, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Fronczek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Int Econ Relat, Katowice, Poland.",,"Fronczek, Małgorzata/W-1554-2018","Fronczek, Małgorzata/0000-0002-1502-1168",,,,,29,3,3,0,7,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

The issue of this impact will be important in a few years for various reasons, especially because those plants tend to be drivers of the economic activity in the areas in which they are located. The focus of this communication is on these socio-economic effects. Methodologically, socio-economic analysis uses a linear Social Accounting Matrix model that improves traditional Input-Output approaches by covering the induced effects generated from the receptors of income out to other sectors of the economy. The procedure is applied to an empirical analysis of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant in Spain. This was purposely chosen as sharing many of the general characteristics of nuclear plants around the world. If the plant is closed down, our results suggest that there will be a clear negative impact in terms of employment and added value generation.","[Fuentes-Saguar, Patricia D.] Pablo de Olavide Univ, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain; [Vega-Cervera, Juan A.] Extremadura Univ, Dept Econ, Badajoz, Spain; [Cardenete, Manuel Alejandro] Loyola Univ Andalusia, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain; [Cardenete, Manuel Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Chile, Sch Business & Management, San Miguel Santiago, Chile",Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad de Extremadura; Universidad Loyola Andalucia; Universidad Autonoma de Chile,"Fuentes-Saguar, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Ctra Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",pfuesag@upo.es,"Cardenete, Manuel Alejandro/A-5300-2015","Fuentes Saguar, Patricia Dolores/0000-0002-7117-9007",,,,,25,10,11,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although cereal straw is an abundant source of biomass still largely unexploited for energy purposes, the feedstock market interplay with current straw uses (e.g. animal bedding and feeding) and on-farm practices (e.g. chopped and incorporated) is.still unknown. This research used farmers' stated preferences to assess the supply curve (i.e. amount and price) of cereal straw for bio-energy purposes. In addition, we performed an econometric regression on the straw price demanded by farmers (willingness to accept). A sample of data gathered in 2014 from 203 cereal growers in Apulia region (southern Italy) was used, and the results show that more than half of respondents would sell their cereal straw on the feedstock market, and that the preferred sales method is in-swath.

We show that different financial systems can play a critical role in shaping the cross-country different links between income and consumption inequality. This phenomenon is consistent with the cross-country different relationships between income inequality and saving rates. Consumer credit expansion in the U.S. makes inequality much less serious for consumption than for income, and this result holds to an even larger extent if more domestic credit can be financed by foreign savings. But this is not the case in China, whose financial system focuses only on investment and trade while neglecting liquidity constraints on consumption. Our assertions accord well with evidence found from the U.S., China, and other related economies.","[Gu, Xinhua; Zhang, Yang; Chang, Xiao] Univ Macau, Dept Finance & Business Econ, Fac Business Adm, Macau, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, E22-FBA, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China.",yzhang@umac.mo,"Zhang, Yang/AAW-5433-2021","Zhang, Yang/0000-0002-7219-3409; CHANG, Xiao/0000-0003-1391-2490",Universidade de Macau [MYRG2015-00133-FBA],Universidade de Macau,This work was supported by the Universidade de Macau [Grant Number MYRG2015-00133-FBA].,,38,3,3,3,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I estimate that FERS exposes approximately 24% more pension wealth to the financial markets. Compared to untreated employees, employees treated with the hybrid-DC pension respond to a one standard deviation shock to quarterly market returns by adjusting their retirement date by approximately one month, approximately offsetting changes in DC pension wealth with labor income.

Their impact and importance for cloud computing adoption were investigated among enterpirses in Slovenia. Furthermore, differences in opinion according to enterprise size were investigated. Research results show no statistically significant impacts of investigated business model factor groups to cloud computing adoption. Nevertheless, based on slope coefficient directions and statistics values, some factor groups can be recognized as having moderate or strong, positive impact on cloud computing adoption; although their impact cannot be statistically confirmed with 95 % or 90 % levels of confidence. Furthermore, significant differences in opinion about the importance of business model factor groups and factors to cloud computing adoption according to enterprises size have been identified. The results represent a contribution to the theory of cloud computing adoption from the perspective of the provider's business model.

A substantial literature instead evaluates welfare consequences by taking cumulative prospect theory (CPT) as the natural default alternative, at least where description is concerned. We present evidence, based on a review of previous literature and new experimental data, that the most empirically adequate hypothesis about human choice under risk is that it is heterogeneous, and that where EUT does not apply, more choice is characterized by rank-dependent utility models than by CPT. Most of the apparently loss-averse choice behavior results from probability weighting rather than from direct disutility experienced when an outcome is framed as a loss against an idiosyncratic reference point. We then consider implications of this finding for methodological debates about how to model welfare effects of policies, and argue that abandonment of a dogmatic belief in CPT as the correct theory of risk human choice exposes a conceptual error that is widespread in behavioral welfare economics. We provide concluding reflections on second-order, philosophical issues around the grounding of normative commitments in policy-focused economics.","[Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Georgia State Univ, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.; Ross, Don] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ross, Don] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Sociol & Philosophy, Cork, Ireland",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Cape Town; University College Cork,"Harrison, GW (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Harrison, GW (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Robinson Coll Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Harrison, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Cape Town, South Africa.",gharrison@gsu.edu,,"Ross, Don/0000-0003-1813-3111",,,,,53,20,21,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The intent of a participatory budget should be a permanent dialogue on the structural form of the Basic Economic Act of Self-Government between the active population and its elected representatives. It is therefore a process of democratic decision-making of citizens who decide on Allocation of part of the public budget through personal meetings or other forms of consensus. In other words, a participatory budget should be seen as a way of educating the public to actively decizion-making on local issues. Perhaps this knowledge will make it easier to understand the economic choices of self-government that have their borders at least on the basis of real income and useful expenses.

However, retaining highly qualified human resources in organizations appears to be a problem nowadays having been caused partly by the trend of aging population and a consequent wave of aging employees. This paper brings the latest statistical findings disclosing the area of aging population and HR. Based on primary research, it focuses on the extent to which corporate strategies take into account population aging; it shows the use of social and incentive programs focused on aging employees; in addition, it looks at the importance of the 55+ age group. The Chi-square test is run to show relationship between the above and size of a company.

Hostile inter-group interactions can help to resolve intra-group social dilemmas but these potential gains must be weighed against the insecurity of hostile relations with an out-group. Our central result is that the presence of an outside threat can induce higher levels of social capital either because a protective aspect of social capital comes into play and/or as a reallocation of investments from private to social capital. Given that social capital is potentially subject to free-riding, the threat, by promoting a greater level of social capital, can be welfare improving. When the threat is severe, social capital and welfare are more likely to fall. This effect of an external threat on social capital is stronger in poor economies. These results can shed light on the sometimes contradicting empirical evidence on the relationship between conflict and social capital.","[Jennings, Colin] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England; [Sanchez-Pages, Santiago] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of London; King's College London; University of Barcelona,"Sanchez-Pages, S (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Jennings, Colin/HIR-3150-2022","Sanchez.pages, Santiago/0000-0003-2259-0745; Jennings, Colin/0000-0002-5554-3825",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-66281-P],Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"We thank Toke Aidt, Giuseppe De Feo, Michelle Garfinkel, Esther Hauk, David Hugh-Jones, Dominic Rohner, Petros Sekeris, two anonymous reviewers, audiences at the Universities of Barcelona, Brunel, Edinburgh, Portsmouth, the EPSA 2015 conference and the 2016 Stockholm Workshop in Advances in the Economics of Conflict for their comments and suggestions.

They argue that the Fed's forward guidance has enabled economic agents to anticipate the changes in interest rates more accurately. As a result, it is harder to find truly exogenous monetary policy shocks, which has made monetary policy ineffective. In this article, we find that anomalous economic behaviours of financial institutions might be the true reason for the ineffective monetary policy. Our structural vector autoregressive model shows that increases in the US money supply mostly flowed into the financial sector to increase its profits instead of stimulating the real sector of the economy through business investment.","[Jung, Chulho] Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH USA; [Ryu, Jay E.] Ohio Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Athens, OH USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Jung, C (通讯作者)，Ohio Univ, Dept Econ, Athens, OH USA.",jung@ohio.edu,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Theories on the economic impacts of military expenditure greatly differ and include arguments that they either enhance economic growth or crowd out productive investments. Empirical literature on defence expenditure and economic growth nexus generally employs linear specifications to investigate the impact of defence expenditures on economic growth. Although it is now well established that many economic variables may have a non-linear data-generating mechanism, it seems that this reality has long been neglected in empirical work on defence-growth nexus. This paper attempts to fill this gap by employing non-linear panel data models to examine the effects of military expenditures on economic growth for Middle Eastern countries and Turkey, for the time period 1988-2012. Results show that the effect of military expenditure on economic growth is nonlinear such that the state of the economy actually determines the effect of the former on the latter. This is important not only in showing asymmetric relationship between these variables but also in revealing the reasons of mixed results of earlier literature.","[Karadam, Duygu Yolcu] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Econ, Denizli, Turkey; [Yildirim, Julide] TED Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Ocal, Nadir] Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Pamukkale University; Ted University; Middle East Technical University,"Öcal, N (通讯作者)，Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",ocal@metu.edu.tr,"Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/G-5706-2018","Öcal, Jülide Yıldırım/0000-0002-4739-6028; Ocal, Nadir/0000-0001-6607-0587",,,,,53,29,30,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of freight rate earnings and newbuilding orders (in various terms) over the period 1996-2016, Granger causality between the two variables are examined in a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. In addition, the potential asymmetry of the causal relationship according to bullish and bearish market conditions is also investigated using a combination of moving averages of different time spans. Findings - The results indicate a uni-directional causality running from freight rate earnings to newbuilding orders. This finding implies that shipowners' confidence in the shipping freight market is particularly important determinants in their newbuilding investment, which is consistent with the overconfidence hypothesis. However, the causality does not vary according to different market conditions. Research limitations/implications - This study offers several importation contributions. First, the authors provide evidence that newbuilding orders are positively associated with increase in freight rate earnings. Second, the authors document a causality running from changes in freight rate earnings to the volume of newbuilding orders. These findings support the theoretical expectation of the overconfidence hypothesis. Third, contrary to the findings in the financial market, there is no asymmetric response of the volume of newbuilding orders in bullish and bearish markets. Fourth, this study provide implications for management of Korean shipyards by providing evidence on driving force of newbuilding investment decisions of their customers (shipowners). Practical implications - The findings in this study suggest implications for management of Korean shipyards by providing evidence on driving force of newbuilding investment decisions of their customers, as well as determinants of shipbuilding export, an important source of Korea' national income. Social implications - The analysing the major determinants of shipbuilding exports, the findings in this study presents understanding of market cycles in shipbuilding, an important source of Korea's national income and balance of payment. Originality/value - This study is the first attempt to analyse the relationship between freight rate earnings and newbuilding investment in the context of the behavioural theory in economics.","[Kim, Chi Yeol] Univ Reading, ICMA Ctr, Reading, Berks, England; [Park, KwangSo] Konkuk Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of Reading; Konkuk University,"Park, K (通讯作者)，Konkuk Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",kspark40@konkuk.ac.kr,,,,,,,26,3,4,2,19,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

AN ASSESSMENT OF UNSYSTEMATIC RISK,ARGUMENTA OECONOMICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,local government debt; local government risk; unsystematic risk; DEA method,,"The paper presents research devoted to changes in the local government credit risk profile in Poland. Firstly, the risk assessment is conducted based on the free operating cash flow and net debt approach as a preferred alternative to the statutory debt limits. Then, using the Data Envelopment Analysis method, an analysis is conducted of changes of unsystematic risk of local government subcategories during the period of economic slowdown. The study finds that the general risk profile of local governments strongly deteriorated compared to the pre crisis year of 2008. Since 2011 it has slightly improved. However, this partial improvement was mainly due to a drop in market interest rates in 2013. Adjusting data for this factor reveals that the financial standing would not have changed in a positive way. Two local government subcategories have relatively inferior risk profiles. The first one is the towns with county rights, which represent more than one third of the population and revenues of the local government sector. They have the highest debt levels compared to their debt service capacities, and some of them accumulated high unsystematic risk. Approximately 20% of them have debt service indicators below safe levels. The second category is the counties. Despite relatively low debt levels, there is high systematic risk in this group. Without system reform of the counties, approximately 25% of them may have problems with performing their statutory tasks or servicing their debt in the medium term. The rural boroughs are the safest local government category in Poland.","[Kluza, Krzysztof] Warsaw Sch Econ, Quantitat Econ Dept, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Kluza, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Quantitat Econ Dept, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Kluza, Krzysztof/ABE-2773-2020","Kluza, Krzysztof/0000-0002-2792-8234",,,,,40,2,2,1,15,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Crises occur when there is a run' of bad shocks; based on this sample they occur on average once every 64years and when they occur around 10% are accompanied by financial crisis.

We argue that the optimal lengths of moving averages depend on the frequency of structural breaks. A new stochastic time-series process including structural breaks is modelled by discrete probability distributions that capture the frequency and size of structural breaks. A permanent shock (means structural breaks in this article) is captured by a Poisson-jump or a Bernoulli-jump process, and a temporary shock is represented by a white noise process. Futures basis data are used to estimate the frequency of permanent shocks as well as the size of both shocks. Most shocks are permanent shocks. Since most shocks are permanent, the most recent year provides the best forecast and the optimal length of the moving average is one.","[Lee, Yoonsuk] Korea Maritime Inst, Busan, South Korea; [Brorsen, B.

I then develop a computational method to ex-ante rank information structures on their tolerance to noise. Subjects' behavior in a laboratory experiment is consistent with the model's prediction: though the posterior revision process do move reports towards each other and towards the full information posterior, noise persists and aggregation is incomplete. As predicted, aggregation attempts in the two least noise-tolerant information structures result in public statistics that perform worse than the common prior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This direct observation of elasticity allows us to demonstrate that firms' price across market segments act in a manner consistent with the Lerner index and the theory of third-degree price discrimination. Further we show, in line with expectations based on the literature, that increased quality of the accommodation lowers the elasticity of demand, while the elasticity of demand is higher in winter.

Our study shows that the primary processing stage of a metal's supply chain may contribute significantly to the overall supply risks, suggesting that this stage should be taken into due account in understanding and mitigating supply-chain vulnerability through, e.g. supplier diversification and alternative material development.","[Nansai, Keisuke; Nakajima, Kenichi; Takayanagi, Wataru] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management Res, Tsukuba, Japan; [Suh, Sangwon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Kagawa, Shigemi] Kyushu Univ, Fac Econ, Fukuoka, Japan; [Kondo, Yasushi] Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Shigetomi, Yosuke] Nagasaki Univ, Fac Environm Sci, Nagasaki, Japan",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Kyushu University; Waseda University; Nagasaki University,"Nansai, K (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management Res, Tsukuba, Japan.;Nansai, K (通讯作者)，CONTACT Keisuke Nansai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",nansai.keisuke@nies.go.jp,"Nansai, Keisuke/C-2516-2008; Suh, Sangwon/E-2019-2011; Shigetomi, Yosuke/H-4422-2018; Nakajima, Kenichi/AAQ-3768-2021; Kondo, Yasushi/B-9219-2013","Nansai, Keisuke/0000-0002-2449-1874; Suh, Sangwon/0000-0001-8290-6276; Shigetomi, Yosuke/0000-0003-1384-0992; Nakajima, Kenichi/0000-0002-7241-7695; Kondo, Yasushi/0000-0002-6855-2691; Kagawa, Shigemi/0000-0003-3936-4103","Environment Research AMP; Technology Development Fund of the Japanese Ministry of Environment [1-1402, 1-1601]; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science [16H01797, 26241031]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H01797, 16H07072, 26241031] Funding Source: KAKEN","Environment Research AMP; Technology Development Fund of the Japanese Ministry of Environment; Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported in part by The Environment Research & Technology Development Fund of the Japanese Ministry of Environment [grant numbers 1-1402, 1-1601]; The Grants-in-Aid for research from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science [grant numbers 16H01797, 26241031].",,61,20,22,3,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

We develop a two-level regression model based on the existing economics of happiness' literature. Factors describing an individual's characteristics are included at the within level, measures describing the social situation are included at both levels, while a nation's income, inflation and unemployment rates are between-level variables. In order to obtain the moderating effects of gross national income per capita on the influence of individuals' relative incomes, a random intercept and random intercept-random slope model are tested using the cross-sectional data from the last wave of the World Values Survey. Our results support the hypotheses that the impact of relative income on subjective well-being decreases with the development of a country.","[Novak, Matic] Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia; [Pahor, Marko] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Primorska; University of Ljubljana,"Novak, M (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fac Management, Koper, Slovenia.",matic.novak@fm-kp.si,"Novak, Matic/AAO-7352-2020",,,,,,46,21,23,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

It contributes to the existing technical analysis (TA) literature by comparing for the first time in emerging markets the relative performance of individual stocks' trading portfolios with that of trading strategies for the index that consists of the same stocks (i.e., the most liquid stocks of the Moscow Exchange). The results show that the best trading strategies of the in-sample period can outperform buy-and-hold strategy during the subsequent out-of-sample period, although with low statistical significance. In addition, we document the benefits of using DMAC combinations that are much longer than those employed in previous TA literature. Moreover, the decomposition of the full-sample-period performance into separate bull- and bear-period performances shows that the outperformance of the best past index trading strategies over is mostly attributable to the fact that they managed to stay mostly out of the stock market during a dramatic crash caused by the global financial crisis.","[Patari, Eero; Luukka, Pasi; Fedorova, Elena] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland; [Garanina, Tatiana] St Petersburg Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg, Russia",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; Saint Petersburg State University,"Pätäri, E (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland.",eero.patari@lut.fi,"Garanina, Tatiana/X-8587-2019; Luukka, Pasi/AAA-5199-2019","Garanina, Tatiana/0000-0002-8349-4506; Luukka, Pasi/0000-0003-0124-6646; Patari, Eero/0000-0002-4536-8701",,,,,27,3,4,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A biased perception of the target pursued by the Central Bank may arise due to idiosyncrasies in information processing, leading to heterogeneous beliefs about the target. We consider an arbitrarily large number of agents' beliefs and apply the concept of Large Type Limit. We find that an increase in the sensitivity of agents in selecting the optimal prediction strategy or in the spread of beliefs is crucial for the extent of the Central Bank to stabilize the economy. When the predictors are largely dispersed around the target, the Taylor principle is a requisite for stability since it prevents the self-fulfilling reinforcement mechanism between the realizations of the relevant macroeconomic variables and the forecasts of the agents. When the set of beliefs is somehow anchored to the target, stability can be achieved with weaker monetary policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The criteria identified for household classification were: sex and age of household head, their socio-economic situation, household size, and level of education of household head. The data source was unpublished CSO (GUS) data for investigations into household budgets. It has been shown that the determinants most seriously affecting health expenditures in households of people aged over 65 years were level of education of household head and household size. A low but significant impact on health expenditure was recorded in relation to the sex of the household head. The structure of health expenditure in Polish households with elderly people indicates the satisfaction of basic needs in this area (medicines), and medical services are a small percentage of this structure, in particular in households headed by people with a lower educational level.","[Piekut, Marlena; Kludacz-Alessandri, Magdalena] Warsaw Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Social Sci, Ul Lukasiewicza 17, PL-09400 Plock, Poland",Warsaw University of Technology,"Piekut, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Social Sci, Ul Lukasiewicza 17, PL-09400 Plock, Poland.",Marlena.Piekut@pw.edu.pl; Magdalena.Kludacz@pw.edu.pl,"Magdalena, Kludacz-Alessandri/R-7845-2018","Magdalena, Kludacz-Alessandri/0000-0002-7011-2302",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1206,1213,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300120,0

In the context of theories dealing with rational, imperfectly rational and rationally inattentive behaviour of agents, it tries to describe the problem of avoiding risk by the contracting authorities in further detail. Theories observing behaviour of bureaucracy no matter how well they are reasoned mostly meet the problem of empiric verifiability. In this case, the authors try to fill the gap using an empiric analysis where it is worked with real data of public contracts from 2010 - 2014. We can consider the main findings to be the fact that public contracting authorities prefer strategies that are based on a reduction of risk of conflicts with the regulator. These strategies are chosen mainly based on signals of behaviour of central authorities, rather than based on the effort of gaining the most informative strategy. However, the final result is the same. In the authors' opinion, the aversion to risk by the contracting authorities, which is enforced by the public policy in this field, plays the major role.","[Placek, Michal; Ochrana, Frantisek; Krapek, Milan; Pucek, Milan] Charles Univ Prague, Inst Sociol Studies, Fac Social Sci, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Schmidt, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Masaryk University Brno,"Placek, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Inst Sociol Studies, Fac Social Sci, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",michalplacek@seznam.cz; ochrana@fsv.cuni.cz; m.schmidt@email.cz; krapek@syse.cz; milan.pucek@seznam.cz,"Pucek, Milan Jan/F-3478-2012; Ochrana, Frantisek/E-9765-2018; Křápek, Milan/AAF-2639-2020","Křápek, Milan/0000-0002-6049-8248",project Performance Management in Public Administration Theory vs. Practice in the Czech Republic and other countries of Central and Eastern Europe (project GACR) [GA16-13119S],project Performance Management in Public Administration Theory vs. Practice in the Czech Republic and other countries of Central and Eastern Europe (project GACR),This paper has been prepared within the framework of the project Performance Management in Public Administration Theory vs. Practice in the Czech Republic and other countries of Central and Eastern Europe (project GACR No. GA16-13119S).,,17,5,5,1,11,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The evaluation covers various periods of time, embracing the time before the economic crisis, in 2007, during the economic crisis, in 2009, and after the economic crisis, in 2013. For assessing the efficiency of their construction sectors' performance, the investigated countries are arranged in the order of preference according to this indicator by using three multiple-criteria decision making methods (MCDM), such as SAW, TOPSIS and COPRAS. These evaluation methods are based on determining the weights of the structural criteria used. For this purpose, three various methods, including the entropy, the method of the criteria impact loss (CILOS) and a new method of determining the objective criteria weights (IDOCRIW) suggested by the authors. The results obtained allowed the researchers to assess the construction market performance in the considered states in various periods of time, to compare them with other countries and to rank them based on this parameter. Therefore, the suggested method of market performance evaluation may be used as an effective supplementary aid for determining the priorities in the future business development, as well as for studying the competitive markets or directing the cash flows of an enterprise to the appropriate areas.","[Podvezko, Valentines] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Math Stat, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kildiene, Simona; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Res Inst Smart Bldg Technol, Vilnius, Lithuania.",valentinas.podvezko@vgtu.lt; simona.kildiene@vgtu.lt; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Kildienė, Simona/GNP-4345-2022; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018","Kildienė, Simona/0000-0002-2188-113X; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X",,,,,43,9,9,1,7,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,4,,,,,493,512,,10.2298/PAN150518004P,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FJ5KL,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000412790300007,0

We propose a conceptual model of four types of relationships in the internationalisation process. We call them: domestic contacts, domestic embeddedness, international exploration and international exploitation, as internationalisation does not mean that a company gives up contacts with domestic entities at the same time. These types of relationships generate positive and negative effects depending on the scope of the relationship (domestic/international) and its strength (weak/strong). By looking at internationalisation from the complex perspective of both domestic and foreign relationships, we point to the need for a comprehensive look at the internationalisation process, its accompanying effects and the related problems of relationship management. To achieve this purpose we primarily adopt the network model of internationalisation and integrate it with the strategic approach to network analysis. Our proposal allows us to analyse the effects of interdependencies in a global business landscape including the conditions under which relationships management and internationalisation lead to improved performance.","[Ratajczak-Mrozek, Milena] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int Mkt, Poznan, Poland; [Mielcarek, Pawel] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Org & Management Theory, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Ratajczak-Mrozek, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int Mkt, Poznan, Poland.",,"Ratajczak-Mrozek, Milena/E-7607-2015","Ratajczak-Mrozek, Milena/0000-0003-4432-5459; Mielcarek, Pawel/0000-0002-1997-4361",Polish National Centre of Science [Narodowe Centrum Nauki] [DEC-2012/05/D/HS4/01138],Polish National Centre of Science [Narodowe Centrum Nauki],"The paper was written with the financial support from the Polish National Centre of Science [Narodowe Centrum Nauki] - Decision no.

This article explores the extent to which these new financial forms have arisen outside of the US and a small number of other advanced financial markets. There has been greater experimentation with global finance in emerging markets than is often acknowledged and domestic resistance to Anglo-Saxon business processes has not derailed the spread of new finance across the Asian region. The rise of these new financial industries, with the notable exception of Japan, would have been impossible without the commitment of one key domestic actor. Asian institutional investors, especially pension funds, have served as crucial financiers to hedge funds and private equity groups. The article concludes with caution concerning whether these new financial actors are set to capture significant global market share.","[Robertson, Justin] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Int Studies, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Robertson, J (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Asian & Int Studies, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",justin.robertson@cityu.edu.hk,,"ROBERTSON, Justin/0000-0002-7484-0112",Strategic Research Grant from the City University of Hong Kong [7004318],Strategic Research Grant from the City University of Hong Kong,This work was supported by a Strategic Research Grant from the City University of Hong Kong [grant number 7004318].,,47,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We find strong evidence that older ICT and transport technologies (and less frequently modern ICT) tend to increase inequality.

In this article, we develop a stochastic frontier model to measure channel market power as deviations from a perfectly competitive frontier and decompose it into buyer and seller power. We provide an empirical illustration using milk data from five Brazilian states and find that channel market power ranges between 4% and 12% of the wholesale price, but that 75% of the market power is accounted for by retail buyer power. The methodology proposed can provide a rapid assessment of the degree of market power in other markets and a method for separating out buyer and seller power in the market channel.","[Scalco, Paulo R.] Univ Fed Goias, Fac Management Accounting & Econ, Quadra D,Campus Samambaia, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Lopez, Rigoberto A.; He, Xi] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA",Universidade Federal de Goias; University of Connecticut,"Scalco, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Goias, Fac Management Accounting & Econ, Quadra D,Campus Samambaia, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil.",scalco@ufg.br,"Scalco, Paulo/AAK-4448-2021","Scalco, Paulo/0000-0002-0667-0422",Research Foundation of the State of Goias (FAPEG); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),Research Foundation of the State of Goias (FAPEG); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Research Foundation of the State of Goias (FAPEG) and the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq).,,14,5,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Furthermore, these patterns are compared to specifics of each region's economic structure. We make use of input-output-based innovation flow networks, which are directed and weighted instead of binary. The value added of the proposed analysis is that we are able to trace a variety of different aspects related to the structure of innovative activities for each territory. It gets evident that mostly innovative activities in each territory are not strong in niche' branches but in fields of intense economic activity, signalising the high path-dependency of innovative activities in a specific geographical environment.","[Schuetz, Marlies H.] Graz Univ, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Schütz, MH (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Graz Schumpeter Ctr, Graz, Austria.",marlies.schuetz@uni-graz.at,,,Austrian Science Fund [P24915-G11]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P24915] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),This work was supported by Austrian Science Fund [P24915-G11].,,60,6,6,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Isolated cycles provide no economic interpretation of the extracted component. Adding new data to the sample (filtering) period results in instability of extracted components. This study proposes a new econometric filtering technique (MARINER) able to overcome known shortcomings in standard econometrics filters such as Hodrick and Prescott (1997), Baxter and King (1999), Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003). MARINER provides a practical tool for policy makers dealing with business cycles. It also provides economic interpretation (new theory) on causes and sources of business cycles elaborating on theories developed by Phillips (1962) and Skare (2010). MARINER decomposes GDP macroeconomic data series in trend (long term) and cycles (medium term) components using three year moving average recursive filtering method. Extracted cycles are defined as deviations from equilibrium GDP path (minimized output gap) caused by poor synchronization between monetary and fiscal policy. MARINER bridge the gap in the literature on measuring and causes of business cycles.

The industry became an important source of jobs, with over 6.5 per cent of total manufacturing employment at the close of the 1960s. As Australia has moved towards freer trade, employment in clothing production has fallen substantially. The question of whether the clothing industry can remain viable in its new environment became an important issue. Here, we examine two crucial economic considerations relating to that question: economies of scale and relations (substitute/complementary) between the various inputs, both domestic and outsourced foreign. The findings strongly indicate the presence of economies of scale and that the industry has reduced its unit costs over the period of study. The results also suggest that most of the inputs are substitutes for one another, although only the estimated cross price elasticities between capital and labour are highly statistically significant in both models utilized in the study. To be successful in the future, the Australian clothing industry will likely need to find market niches where it can offer superior products and/or service as well as further reduce its unit costs.","[Truett, Lila J.; Truett, Dale B.] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Truett, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",lila.truett@utsa.edu,,"Truett, Lila/0000-0002-6976-2324",,,,,65,3,4,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We present two versions of the basic post-Keynesian model in order to address the implications of a dominant shareholder class and rising debt-driven consumption on demand.

These new measures have enabled more accurate estimates that reveal that the EU countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE10) exhibit an approximately five percentage points lower DVA share of exports compared with other EU countries (EU15). The lag is on average the highest in knowledge-intensive manufacturing sectors (eight percentage points) and the lowest in knowledge-intensive services (0.3 percentage points). However, this article argues that the CEE10 economies have acquired new knowledge by participating in GVCs and thus have gradually started increasing their level of DVA. Based on EU trade data, this article presents evidence of convergence of DVA in manufacturing and especially in the services sector. It is also shown that a negative relationship exists between participation in GVCs and DVA in the CEE10 economies that is declining over time in both manufacturing and services exports.","[Vrh, Natasa] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Vrh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",natasa.vrh@ef.uni-lj.si,"liping, sun/AAW-1808-2021","liping, sun/0000-0002-4711-3518; , Natasa/0000-0001-9972-1219",Slovenian Research Agency [36385],Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia),This work was supported by Slovenian Research Agency [grant number 36385].,,80,2,2,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2017,29.0,3,,,,,405,430,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1319107,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FB9SJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406479000009,0

Companies with CSR, while addressing issues of well-being of employees as an interested party, ethics and human rights, must face up to their responsibilities to prevent the employees from facing psychosocial stressors caused by mobbing and bullying, while both collaborating with organised employees' structures and accepting employees' reports on destructive relationships in working environment and taking them into consideration. Having created the instrument, an empirical research was completed conducting a survey among 1,512 respondents from 34 organisations in Lithuania that declared or did not declare CSR. It was discovered that CSR has a significant influence on the employees' approach to organisation's products, promotes greater confidence and loyalty and leads to greater personal initiative while completing tasks. However, comparing the organisations which declared and did not declare CSR, approval of the statements about psychosocial well-being is more significant in the latter ones, while in the organisations which declared CSR, orientation towards external interested subjects was revealed, and the systematic work organisation advantages possessed are not used for ensuring functional relationships between employees and employee safety against psychosocial stressors.","[Vveinhardt, Jolita] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Social Sci, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Grancay, Martin] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, Social Sci, Radlinskeho 9, Bratislava 81237, Slovakia; [Andriukaitiene, Regina] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Fac Sports Educ, Social Sci, Sporto St 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University; Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Lithuanian Sports University,"Vveinhardt, J (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, Social Sci, S Daukanto St 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Jolita.Vveinhardt@vdu.lt; martin.grancay@stuba.sk; Regina.Andriukaitiene@lsu.lt,"Grancay, Martin/N-9889-2014; Andriukaitiene, Regina/AAC-8251-2022; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Andriukaitiene, Regina/AAW-8584-2020; Andriukaitiene, Regina/AAA-2509-2019","Grancay, Martin/0000-0002-7006-147X; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Andriukaitiene, Regina/0000-0002-0691-7333",,,,,63,3,3,2,40,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We examine this question in a simple principal-agent model. We show that, even though investment is contractible, the principal underinvests whenever her agent's alternatives are rather poor. This provides a reason for regulation. The indirect regulatory approach of taking measures that improve the agent's bargaining power or outside option at least weakly enhances the agent's well-being and welfare. The direct regulatory approach of demanding a certain standard of working conditions increases the principal's investment, but may nonetheless leave the agent's well-being unaffected and deteriorate welfare. This holds true since due to a standard, the principal may provide the agent with a lower-powered incentive scheme and implement a lower effort level.","[Weinschenk, Philipp] Univ Kaiserslautern, Gottlieb Daimler Str, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany; [Weinschenk, Philipp] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Weinschenk, Philipp] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",University of Kaiserslautern; University of Mannheim; Max Planck Society,"Weinschenk, P (通讯作者)，Univ Kaiserslautern, Gottlieb Daimler Str, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",weinschenk@wiwi.uni-kl.de,,,,,,,40,3,3,2,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5371,1879-1034,,LABOUR ECON,Labour Econ.,JAN,2017,44.0,,,,,,177,191,,10.1016/j.labeco.2017.01.004,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EQ8LI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398337200012,0

However, analysis of differential impacts of two or more constituent institutions within a broad-based institution appears to be more useful for policy decision-making. There is a paucity of studies on how constituent institutions within a broad measure of institution affect FDI across countries. Our article constitutes the first attempt in bridging this gap. In this article, we examine the relative effects of property rights institution (PI) and contracting institution (CI) on investment flows. Our results show that PI is much more important than CI in determining the cross-border flows of FDI and affiliate sales. Moreover, PI is found to be more important for FDI than for affiliate sales, indicating that final goods are less of a concern for being expropriated by governments and powerful elites than capital goods. Through unbundling a broad-based institution and examining how the constituent institutions affect investments flows, our article provides practical location decisions for investments in FDI, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and affiliate sales.","[Xu, Xinpeng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Voon, Jan P.] Lingnan Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Shang, Yan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shang, Yan] Ind & Commercial Bank China, Postdoctoral Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Lingnan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)","Xu, XP (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",xinpeng.xu@polyu.edu.hk,"Xu, Xinpeng/E-5997-2012","VOON, Jan Piaw/0000-0002-4590-6450; XU, Xinpeng/0000-0002-8238-8701",Hong Kong Polytechnic University [G-UC99],Hong Kong Polytechnic University(Hong Kong Polytechnic University),This work was supported by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University: [Grant Number G-UC99].,,32,9,9,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Selecting the best desirable ERP software covering both qualitative and quantitative factors has been the most critical problem for a long time. On the other hand, multiple criteria decision making has been found to be a useful approach to analyze conflicting factors. Qualitative criteria are often accompanied by ambiguities and vagueness. This makes fuzzy and grey logic become more natural approaches to handle this kind of problem. This paper presents a new approach for the selection of SME-specific ERP systems. Firstly, criteria for SMEs in China to evaluate the most suitable ERP system are put forward using group-discussing and anonymous questionnaire methods. An effective and practical algorithm, which is integrated of modified Delphi, analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and grey relational analysis, is utilized to convert the qualitative description to quantitative data to select the most appropriate alternative in the presence of vagueness and uncertainty. Finally, the potential use of the proposed model is illustrated through a case study.","[Zeng, Yu-Rong; Wang, Lin; Xu, Xian-Hao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Yu-Rong] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Informat Engn, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China",Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Hubei University of Economics,"Wang, L (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",wanglin982@gmail.com,"Wang, Lin/G-6354-2010; Zeng, Yu-Rong/G-7598-2019; wang, Lin/L-3018-2019","Wang, Lin/0000-0003-0881-9689;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71531009, 71371080, 71131004]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Chinese Ministry of Education [15YJA630095]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Chinese Ministry of Education,"The authors are grateful for the constructive comments of editors and referees.

These reductions can be the result of either a compression of internal demand or an improvement in external competitiveness. In this paper, we compute exchange rate misalignments within the euro area to assess whether peripheral countries have managed to improve their external competitiveness. After controlling for the reduction of business cycle synchronization within the EMU, we find that peripheral countries have managed to reduce their exchange rate misalignments thanks to internal devaluations. To some extent, these favourable evolutions reflect improvements in external competitiveness. Nevertheless, these gains could only be temporary if peripheral countries do not improve their non-price competitiveness, their trade structures and their international specializations in the long run.","[Saadaoui, Jamel] Univ Strasbourg, BETA CNRS, CEPN CNRS, Strasbourg, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Saadaoui, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, BETA CNRS, CEPN CNRS, Strasbourg, France.",saadaoui@unistra.fr,"Saadaoui, Jamel/AAG-2386-2021","Saadaoui, Jamel/0000-0003-1143-4480",,,,,22,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This general principle has been manifest in the objectives of achieving a higher level of economic convergence, territorial competitiveness, and fostering employment creation in EU countries. The recent economic crisis has implied profound changes, not only in the path of growth but also in the structural and technological characteristics of EU countries, with these elements highly conditioning their inter-dependencies, economic outcomes, and convergence. This paper analyzes the role that the evolution of economic structures has played in the evolution of recent convergence in Europe expanding the traditional measures of economic convergence extended to a multi-regional input-output framework. Our study shows a trend towards convergence among EU countries and a significant breakpoint with the arrival of the economic crisis in 2008. Moreover, we observe a continuous change in the role of different components, raising the participation of trade (intra and extra European trade) in income for most of the countries and sectors analyzed. In addition, the different behavior of services, in particular, knowledge intensive services in the EU countries notably condition income generation in countries. Nevertheless, our results show that despite services economy explains significantly income growth in Europe over the period 2000-2014, income growth in Eastern Europe countries has notably relied on the positive reliance of manufacturing sectors (particularly medium and low technology sectors), and the expansion of conventional services, with a lower representativeness of the knowledge intensive sectors. Domestic and intra-EU markets are dominant, although also with an increasing share of extra-EU exports.

In the open economy, the Taylor principle is generally valid for both contemporaneous and forward-looking IT. Active policy in contemporaneous IT guarantees determinacy, eccentric cases aside. In forward-looking IT, the scope for active policy is constrained by an upper bound on the Taylor coefficient. The upper bound is insensitive, however, to the share of poor, nonsaving households. Moreover, it can be increased substantially-to a level that does not bind-through reserve sales/purchases that limit exchange rate volatility.","[Buffie, Edward F.] Indiana Univ, 2414 East Rock Creek Dr, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Zanna, Luis-Felipe] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; International Monetary Fund,"Buffie, EF (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, 2414 East Rock Creek Dr, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.",ebuffie@indiana.edu,,,,,,,62,2,2,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

In this case, a sufficiently high debt-to-capital ratio coefficient in the borrowing rate schedule operates like an automatic stabilizer that mitigates belief-driven cyclical fluctuations. The analysis conducted within the monetary setting shows that both the benchmark nominal interest rate and the inflation rate of the country of the denominated currency may lessen the destabilizing effect of international borrowing. When domestic sunspot shocks exert sufficiently strong effects on these two variables, international borrowing may instead stabilize the domestic economy. I also find that inflation indexed bonds remove the stabilizing effect of the inflation rate of the country of the denominated currency and make different types of international bonds under different monetary regimes exhibit qualitatively the same destabilizing effect as real bonds in real economies. In addition, flexible inflation targeting performs no worse than rigid inflation targeting in all cases. Finally, the quantitative analysis undertaken shows that in the past few decades the considerable increase in foreign indebtedness may have destabilized the U.S. economy by giving rise to belief-driven fluctuations.","[Chen, Shu-Hua] Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Chen, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Dept Econ, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan.",shchen@mail.ntpu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Shu-Hua/0000-0003-3942-6028","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2410-H-305-003-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, Grant/Award Number: MOST 105-2410-H-305-003-MY3",,41,2,2,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Most religions also contain a notion of redemption, or forgiveness of sin, but they differ as to whether or not redemption requires atonement, or penance. The possibility of redemption allows sinners to be rehabilitated, but in so doing potentially undermines the incentive for them to refrain from sin in the first place. We show that a properly calibrated form of penance as the price of redemption can both deter people from committing early sins, and provide an incentive for those who have previously sinned to refrain from committing further sins. In other words, it achieves marginal deterrence. Such a system requires strong belief in the afterlife. When belief is moderate, we show that a regime of free redemption may be optimal. We conclude by examining the implications of the analysis for after-death redemption, the Catholic Church's practice of selling redemption (indulgences), and the Protestant doctrine of Predestination, which was in part a reaction to the Church's commodification of redemption.

Entrepreneurs can take on short-term collateralized debt and trade long-term assets to finance investment. Funding liquidity can erode market liquidity. High funding liquidity discourages firms from selling their good long-term assets since these good assets have to subsidize lemons when there is information asymmetry. This can cause a liquidity dry-up in the market for long-term assets and even a market breakdown, resulting in a financial crisis. Multiple equilibria can coexist.

The principal constructs a contract for three possible outcomes, LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH, and the agent observes the contract and responds with either an effort level of 0 or 12. Non-monotonic contracts that motivate high effort are optimal for principals because effort only affects the probability of LOW and MEDIUM outcomes. Our experiment has two treatments: one where principals interact with human agents and another with computer agents. Principals only select non-monotonic contracts with a frequency of 15% and 33% in each treatment, respectively.

The empirical evidence in a developing country context in particular is however still scarce. Based on a case study of the Pakistani cement industry, this paper fills this gap. Our study shows that due to interconnected conglomerates' tactics, such as exclusionary practices, the acquisition of smaller competitor firms and the addition of significant capacities, the industry has witnessed a stable degree of seller concentration after broader reforms including privatization. Consequently, colluding conglomerate firms have been able to maintain control over supply and prices for two decades in the post-reform period, despite allegations of tacit collusion leading to the imposition of fines and the issuing of warnings by the regulator, which is, however, weak and inefficient.","[Ghulam, Yaseen] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Ghulam, Yaseen] Al Yamamah Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",University of Portsmouth; Al-Yamamah University,"Ghulam, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England.;Ghulam, Y (通讯作者)，Al Yamamah Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",yaseen.ghulam@port.ac.uk,,"Ghulam, Yaseen/0000-0002-3206-1786",,,,,41,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

A new generalized measure of uncertainty is introduced and a number of sources of uncertainty are discussed and presented. The causes of uncertainty are recognized and an examination is made of how they affect the adopted policies and how important their management is in any decision-making process, either under the introduced generalized normal distribution or the model choice. We show that mathematical models formulate the problem and statistical models offer possible solutions, restricting the underlying uncertainty, given the model and the error assumptions are correct. The mathematical approach can be adopted using environmental economics problems by paying attention to model choice uncertainty.

Moreover, the lower and upper quartiles of the conditional distribution of firm size are all significantly negatively associated with the higher marketization degree of financial institutions, whereas increased financial institution competition and market-oriented allocation of credit funds have greater negative effect on the average size of larger firms, relative to smaller firms. In sum, improvements on the degree of marketization of financial institutions lead to an increase in the number of firms and a reduction in the average size of firms in China's industry.

It focuses on works since 1997, when this literature was last surveyed comprehensively. Among the findings are the following: Ramadan fasting by pregnant women harms prenatal development; Islamic charities mainly benefit the middle class; Islam affects educational outcomes less through Islamic schooling than through structural factors that handicap learning as a whole; Islamic finance has a negligible effect on Muslim financial behavior; and low generalized trust depresses Muslim trade. The last feature reflects the Muslim world's delay in transitioning from personal to impersonal exchange. The delay resulted from the persistent simplicity of the private enterprises formed under Islamic law. Weak property rights reinforced the private sector's stagnation by driving capital from commerce to rigid waqfs. Waqfs limited economic development through their inflexibility and democratization by keeping civil society embryonic. Parts of the Muslim world conquered by Arab armies are especially undemocratic, which suggests that early Islamic institutions were particularly critical to the persistence of authoritarian patterns of governance. States have contributed to the persistence of authoritarianism by treating Islam as an instrument of governance. As the world started to industrialize, -non-Muslim subjects of Muslim-governed states pulled ahead of their Muslim neighbors, partly by exercising the choice of law they enjoyed under Islamic law in favor of a Western legal system.","[Kuran, Timur] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Kuran, Timur] Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Kuran, T (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Kuran, T (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",,,,"Religious Freedom Project of the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University; College of Administrative Sciences and Economics at Koc University","Religious Freedom Project of the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University; College of Administrative Sciences and Economics at Koc University","For financial support, I am grateful to the Religious Freedom Project of the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University and the College of Administrative Sciences and Economics at Koc University.",,178,61,70,4,36,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Beijing introduced the mandatory retirement age for provincial leaders in the 1980s, but the rule was not enforced across all provinces until 2000. I use this window to construct a difference-in-differences design and show how the enforcement of mandatory retirement rule leads to better economic outcomes. Provincial leaders eligible for promotion are now motivated to perform better on growth in order to succeed under the performance-based promotion system. But this institution is not perfect, as it results in poorer performances among lame-duck leaders near the retirement age. I also find that leaders with central connection tend to have worse performances. This suggests that when politicians have connection with the center, they hold the key to promotion already, so they do not need to worry about the Chinese-style yardstick competition.","[Liu, Derek Tai-wei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, DTW (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, 777 Guoding Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",derek.twl@gmail.com,,"Liu, Derek Tai-wei/0000-0003-0042-8210",,,,,50,6,8,1,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Innovation in science-based, high-tech sectors is changing its tempo, from the evolutionary pace of incremental novelties punctuated by occasional radical novelties, to innovation cascades. These cascades involve a long series of interlinked radical innovations, which can be traced through various scientific and technological indicators like patents and publications. Innovation cascades are relevant to industry, because they make the future less predictable. They are particularly interesting because these changes also enable the testing an abundance of new business models. Innovation cascades have a major impact on the number and sustainability of business models and on strategy. Business model innovations are visible not only in the existing organizations that undergo change, but also new organizational models appear. The case of biotechnology after the 1980s is used to illustrate our conceptualization.","[Niosi, Jorge] Univ Quebec Montreal, Sch Management, UQAM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [McKelvey, Maureen] Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Dept Econ & Soc, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Gothenburg,"McKelvey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Dept Econ & Soc, Sch Business Econ & Law, Gothenburg, Sweden.",niosi.jorge@uqam.ca; maureen.mckelvey@handels.gu.se,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Sten A Olsson Foundation; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumfond),Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Sten A Olsson Foundation; Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumfond),"Professor Niosi would like to acknowledge financing from The Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

Using data obtained from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we employ fixed-effect methods to explore the effects of displacement on the dismissed workers' health status. Our results show that these displaced workers are more likely to report having poor health and suffer from chronic conditions, such as hypertension and stroke. The effect on chronic conditions appears only in the long run. In addition, we find that the displaced workers are less likely to be covered by health insurance, less likely to see a doctor when they are ill, and more likely to engage in unhealthy behavior such as smoking, which may help explain the poor health outcomes of these individuals. Moreover, we show that the health effects are heterogeneous among different groups of individuals.","[Tian, Xinping] Hunan Univ, Ctr Econ Finance & Management Studies, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jinquan] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yueqiu] SUNY Buffalo, Grad Sch Educ, Buffalo, NY USA",Hunan University; Peking University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Gong, JQ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jinquang@pku.edu.cn,"wu, xiaokang/JUJ-4602-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023; zhang, yuanyuan/GYA-4428-2022","wang, wenjuan/0000-0002-4220-8817;","National Institute for Nutrition and Health, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R24 HD050924, R01-HD38700]; NIH Fogarty International Center [D43 TW009077, D43 TW007709]; China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health; Carolina Population Center [P2C HD050924, T32 HD007168]","National Institute for Nutrition and Health, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIH Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health; Carolina Population Center","We would like to express appreciation for comments from two anonymous referees,the editor Cheryl Long, participants of the 9th International Symposium on Human Capital and Labor Markets, and seminars at Central University of Finance and Economics and Hunan University.

Using the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) unit root test, we surveyed the stationarity of the selected variables, all of which were found to be stationary at the first difference. Based on Vector Error-Correction Model (VECM) model, Granger causality test was further employed in order to detect the causal relationship among the competing variables. The results show the presence of unidirectional causality running from energy consumption structure, and from export and import structure, to CO2 emissions. No causal link was found to exist in relation to the other two variables. An impulse response analysis and a variance decomposition analysis were subsequently utilized, the results of which demonstrated that the energy consumption structure and the investment structure do significantly affect CO2 emissions in the long run and that the energy consumption structure is the most significant variable. This paper contributes existing scholarly research into the relationship between socioeconomic structure and CO2 emissions, and our findings have significant implications for the government in the task of implementing policy measures in order to mitigate the growth of CO2 emissions.

The model predicts that with costly screening, firms concentrate (per student) at selective universities over those where high-quality students are larger in number, but smaller in proportion. Further, recruiting is affected by nearby universities' selectivity. This prediction has strong support using data from 39 finance and consulting firms and the Baccalaureate and Beyond. For median-selectivity universities, a better regionally-ranked university is twice as likely to attract a consulting firm, and wages are higher by 4%.

The modern economy can be modeled as Entrepreneurial Cyclical Dynamics of Open Innovation with three sub-economies such as market open innovation by SMEs and start-ups, closed open innovation by big business, and social open innovation. When there is low balance among the three sub-economies, which is to say, if any of the sub-economies is too big, or too small, the economy dynamics decreases, and the economic growth rate slows down to nearly zero or even negative according to the model simulation. South Korea, with a low internal reserve policy, is in this situation. When there is medium balance among three sub-economies, which is to say, any of the sub-economies is big enough to lead the total economy but is not sufficiently big to control totally the other two economies, the economy dynamics increases and the economic growth rate will be maintained at a high level according to the model simulation. India, with its grassroots innovation festival, demonstrates this situation. When there is a high balance among the three sub-economies, which is to say, the three sub-economies are well balanced and there is no change in the economic system, the economy dynamics become too low and the economic growth rate stays at a low level according to the model simulation.

Simultaneous equation models were employed to estimate the relationship between an array of public sector expenditures in order to address potential endogeneity. Our empirical findings strongly support the crowding-out hypothesis whereby increased military expenditures reduce the capacity of government to direct expenditures to health expenditures. These findings were robust to alternative specifications explored in the sensitivity analyses. Compared with upper-middle-income countries, the crowding-out effect became more pronounced among lower-middle-income countries. Consequently, this study shows that increased military expenditures negatively impacts health expenditures, and therefore poses as an important risk factor for population health and individual well-being. Moreover, it is the poorest of nations that are most sensitive to the negative effects of increased military expenditures.","[Fan, HongLi; Liu, Wei] Nankai Univ, Sch Finance, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Coyte, Peter C.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada",Nankai University; University of Toronto,"Coyte, PC (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada.",peter.coyte@utoronto.ca,,"Coyte, Peter/0000-0002-2993-3491",Policy Theory Project of China Aging Commission [QLB2016A002]; China Scholarship Council [201506200086]; MOE Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project [14YJC790012]; Philosophy and Social Sciences Project of Tianjin [TJYY16-005]; National Social Science Foundation(General) of China [16BRK019],Policy Theory Project of China Aging Commission; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); MOE Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project; Philosophy and Social Sciences Project of Tianjin; National Social Science Foundation(General) of China,This work was supported by the Policy Theory Project of China Aging Commission [grant number QLB2016A002]; the China Scholarship Council [grant number 201506200086]; the MOE Humanities and Social Sciences Youth Fund Project [grant number 14YJC790012]; Philosophy and Social Sciences Project of Tianjin [grant number TJYY16-005]; National Social Science Foundation(General) of China [grant number 16BRK019].,,47,20,21,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Despite more modest goals, the European Union's (EU) Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) has experienced no fewer difficulties in garnering men, money, and materiel. While this may not come as a surprise, the fact that some EU member states have carried disproportionate shares of the burden of CSDP operations is a puzzle that remains unaccounted for. We address this gap by analyzing determinants of contribution levels to CSDP operations. In employing an innovative multi-method design that combines insights from collection action theory with those from integrated theories of military burden sharing, our results indicate that EU countries tend to contribute in positive disproportion with their capabilities when they have a strong peacekeeping tradition and elections are distant. In contrast, they undercontribute when small trade volumes with the area of operations combine with a weak peacekeeping tradition.","[Haesebrouck, Tim] Univ Ghent, Ghent Inst Int Studies, Ghent, Belgium; [Thiem, Alrik] Univ Geneva, Dept Philosophy, Geneva, Switzerland",Ghent University; University of Geneva,"Thiem, A (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Dept Philosophy, Geneva, Switzerland.",alrik.thiem@unige.ch,,"Haesebrouck, Tim/0000-0002-9877-4754",,,,,68,9,9,0,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

We derive structural equations for value added trade flows, the domestic value added content of exports (DVA) and the value added to exports (VAX) ratio, as well as model-based measures for production networks from a multi-sector gravity model with inter-sectoral linkages. We calibrate the model and perform a counterfactual analysis of China's WTO accession in 2001. We find that the associated trade cost changes spurred global production fragmentation, explaining about 6-12% of the decrease in the world DVA ratio as observed between 2000 and 2007. For China, the counterfactual experiment robustly replicates the increase in its DVA ratio, driven by the export-processing zones. Furthermore, our results imply that China's WTO accession was a driving force behind the strengthening of production networks with its neighbors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a search-theoretic model of price-setting heterogeneous retailers and traveling consumers who face nominal exchange rate shocks. These shocks affect retailers on the supply side, through imported input prices, and on the demand side, via their effect on the propensity for consumers to cross the border and shop at foreign retail stores. We use Canadian retailer and traveler data from 1986 to 2007 to estimate the model. Consistent with the model, the empirical results indicate that an appreciation of the Canadian dollar substantially increases Canadians' cross border travel which has a significant negative effect on the sales of Canadian retailers. These effects diminish with the distance to the nearest US shopping destination, relative population and the median income of the community in which the retailer operates. Using counterfactual experiments, we quantify the positive effects on Canadian retailers' sales of more restrictive border controls after September 2001, and the negative effects on those sales of increased Canadian duty free allowances and the expansion of US shopping opportunities.

Using count data models, we regress such measures on the type of organization. We distinguish between governmental museums, public museums whose administration is either outsourced or has financial autonomy and private museums. We control for the most salient characteristics of a museum, competition pressure and some proxies of potential audience. Our evidence shows that private museums, public museums with financial autonomy and outsourced museums outperform public museums run as sub-units of culture departments.

By identifying from variation in peers' import experience across source countries, by comparing the spillover from neighboring buildings with a cross-street placebo, and by exploiting plausibly exogenous firm moves, we obtain credible estimates and establish three results. (1) There are significant knowledge spillovers in both spatial and managerial networks. Having a peer which has imported from a particular country more than doubles the probability of starting to import from that country, but the effect quickly decays with distance. (2) Spillovers are heterogeneous: they are stronger when firms or peers are larger or more productive, and exhibit complementarities in firm and peer productivity. (3) The model-implied social multiplier is highly skewed, implying that targeting an import-encouragement policy to firms with many and productive neighbors can make it 26% more effective.

In our first set of treatments designed to evaluate the refinement with its usual emphasis on literal meanings, we find that a fully revealing equilibrium that is neologism-proof is played more often; senders deviate from an equilibrium in a way that can be predicted by the credibility of the neologism; and receivers' behavior indicates that they understand senders' deviating incentives. Our second set of treatments evaluates neologism-proofness from an evolutionary perspective in the absence of a common language. We find that the proportion of observations in which the meaning of a neologism evolves to disrupt a prevailing fully revealing equilibrium is lower when the equilibrium is neologism-proof.

The model features a negative mortality-income gradient, asymmetric information of individual mortality rates, and a warm-glow bequest motive that varies by age and family structure. The model matches life-cycle changes in life insurance coverage and generates advantageous selection in the insurance market. For male agents, reducing survivors benefits for dependent children generates welfare losses, whereas reducing survivors benefits for aged spouses produces welfare gains.

When the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) methodology is applied, the estimated total connectedness index is 5.08%, suggesting a low level of connection among the four markets. Furthermore, the results show that the stock and CDS markets are net transmitters of volatility, while foreign exchange and bond markets are net receivers of the spillovers. When the Barunik and Krehlik (2018) frequency-domain analysis is carried out, the results indicate, first, that at higher frequencies, the degree of connectedness increases, and, second, that the net transmitter of volatility spillovers across the markets is contingent on the frequency under consideration.

In this article, we study female authorship, academic networks and the topics discussed in Mexican economic journals from 2000 to 2017. Methodology: Using data for six of the main economic journals in Mexico from 2000 to 2017 we study the authors as well as the subjects discussed in them. With the author information we study how the presence of female authors has evolved in Mexican economic journals and, also, the interactions among scholars from different institutions. On the other hands, we use text analysis on the abstracts to determine if certain keywords related to Mexico's main economic problems or vulnerable groups were mentioned. Results: First, we observe that women have acquired a greater presence -measured both as the percentage of articles with at least one female author (an increase of 31 percentage points) as well as the percentage of authors that are women (an increase of 14 percentage points). On the other hand, interuniversity networks seem to be quite rare during this period: the UNAM'S coauthorships with the IPN, the most common source of interuniversity collaboration, represents only 7.7% of its coauthorships. Finally, both important themes for Mexico's economy as well as vulnerable groups are not mentioned in most of the abstracts. Conclusions: Mexican economic journals can be improved on many accounts. Given that science benefits from diversity, it is desirable to have more female authors as well as more interuniversity collaboration networks. On the other hand, the topics studied in Mexican economic journals are mostly not related neither with Mexico's main economic challenges nor with vulnerable groups.","[Campos Vazquez, Raymundo M.] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Lopez-Araiza B, Sergio E.] Colegio Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico; Colegio de Mexico,"Vázquez, RMC (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx; selopab@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

We begin by describing several presumed market failures affecting entrepreneurial firms that would lead to an under-provision of entrepreneurial activity: 1) information spillovers from innovations in entrepreneurial firms to other firms, 2) positive externalities to consumers from innovative new products sold by these firms, and 3) lemons problems in the market for both debt and equity issued by these firms. We then analyze the degree to which various tax policy measures can alleviate these failures. A key complication we focus on is the inability of the government to observe which, and the degree to which, any given start-up firm is entrepreneurial. This forces policy to target behavioral differences between entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial start-ups. We presume that start-up firms, to the degree they are entrepreneurial, face upfront costs in developing and marketing a new technology, and in the process face substantial risk. Our analysis then suggests the use of refundable tax savings from business losses in start-ups together with a compensating surtax on the profits of start-ups (needed in the case of lemons problems) to help alleviate the various market failures faced by entrepreneurial start-ups.

At the intertemporal margin, there is a novel incentive for introducing distortions that can lead to an ex-ante capital subsidy. Overall, optimal policy calls for a much stronger use of debt returns as a fiscal absorber, leading to the conclusion that actual fiscal policy is even worse than we thought.","[Karantounias, Anastasios G.] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Karantounias, AG (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Atlanta, GA 30309 USA.",,,"Karantounias, Anastasios/0000-0003-0315-8535",,,,,47,5,12,2,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

An interesting feature of prosecutor elections is that the pool of potential challengers to an incumbent comes primarily from subordinates within the office. We develop a signaling model that analyzes whether entry into the political race by a subordinate provides voters with useful information. We challenge the commonly held presumption that the election mechanism is ineffective. Exploring the decision of an insider to challenge the boss, we demonstrate that a challenger can strategically convey information about the incumbent's quality by entering the race. Anticipating this, poor incumbents exit. Thus, the model matches empirical observations of rare contested elections and rather modest vacancy rates. Compared to the situation where outsiders challenge the incumbent, the election mechanism is effective.","[McCannon, Bryan C.; Pruitt, Joylynn] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"McCannon, BC (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, POB 6025, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",bryan.c.mccannon@gmail.com; jopruitt@mix.wvu.edu,,"McCannon, Bryan/0000-0003-2433-2803",,,,,56,7,7,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Zombie firms and productivity performance in OECD countries,ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CREDIT; SELECTION,"This paper explores the extent to which 'zombie' firms - defined as old firms that have persistent problems meeting their interest payments - are stifling labour productivity performance. The results show that the prevalence of and resources sunk in zombie firms have risen since the mid-2000s and that the increasing survival of these low productivity firms at the margins of exit congests markets and constrains the growth of more productive firms. Controlling for cyclical effects, cross-country analysis shows that within-industries over the period 2003-13, a higher share of industry capital sunk in zombie firms is associated with lower investment and employment growth of the typical non-zombie firm and less productivity-enhancing capital reallocation. Besides limiting the expansion possibilities of healthy incumbent firms, market congestion generated by zombie firms can also create barriers to entry and constrain the post-entry growth of young firms. Finally, we link the rise of zombie firms to the decline in OECD potential output growth through two key channels: business investment and multi-factor productivity growth.","[McGowan, Muge Adalet; Andrews, Dan; Millot, Valentine] OECD, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"McGowan, MA (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,39,76,78,5,47,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Simultaneously, the scope for shifting taxes to more growth-friendly revenue sources appears underused. This motivates our simulation of a tax shift from labor to property for Germany, a country where property tax revenues are particularly low and the tax wedge on labor income is among the highest in industrialized countries. We simulate a reform where property is no longer taxed by its (often) outdated cadastral value but by its market value, using the additional revenue to reduce social insurance contributions (SIC). To make such a simulation possible, we match property-related information with the input data of the tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD. We find a considerable increase in property tax revenues, allowing to reduce the implicit tax rate on labor from 37.2 to 36.5%. Distributive effects tend to be modest and depend on the design of the SIC reduction. Overall, our results suggest that more households would gain than lose from the tax shift, with gainers mostly situated in the middle of the income distribution.","[Paetzold, Joerg] Univ Salzburg, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Salzburg, Austria; [Tiefenbacher, Markus] Univ Salzburg, Dept Econ & Social Sci, SCEUS, Salzburg, Austria",Salzburg University; Salzburg University,"Paetzold, J (通讯作者)，Univ Salzburg, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Salzburg, Austria.",joerg.paetzold@sbg.ac.at; markus.tiefenbacher@sbg.ac.at,,,Paris Lodron University of Salzburg; Humer Foundation; Salzburg Centre for European Union Studies (SCEUS); European Commission's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2013-2017) [312691]; European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation Easi (2014-2020),Paris Lodron University of Salzburg; Humer Foundation; Salzburg Centre for European Union Studies (SCEUS); European Commission's 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2013-2017); European Union Programme for Employment and Social Innovation Easi (2014-2020),"Open access funding provided by Paris Lodron University of Salzburg.

This takeover has been associated with greater investment in urban amenities and clean means of transport, with adverse effects on commuting time. The model allows us to explain those developments by productivity growth in the new economy, and by the differences in production processes between the new and old economies. The consequences of bobo takeover for house prices and employment of unskilled service workers are also discussed. A bunkerized equilibrium in which skilled workers in the old economy no longer reside in the city and have been replaced by service workers is studied. In such an equilibrium urban amenities are at their maximum and commuting flows have been eliminated. For some parameter values, bobos are better-off under bunkerization, in which case they may gain by favoring it with a diversity subsidy for unskilled workers to reside in the city.","[Saint-Paul, Gilles] Paris Sch Econ ENS PSL, Paris, France; [Saint-Paul, Gilles] New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); New York University Abu Dhabi,"Saint-Paul, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ ENS PSL, Paris, France.;Saint-Paul, G (通讯作者)，New York Univ Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",gstpaulmail@gmail.com,,,Paris Sciences Lettres; OSE [ANR-10-LABX-93],Paris Sciences Lettres; OSE,"This paper has benefitted from comments by seminar participants at the London School of Economics, CEMFI\Madrid, the Bank of Spain, the University of Zurich, two anonymous referees, and the NBER Summer Institute EFG\meeting on income distribution.

Beginning in 1988, the Egyptian government cut the number of primary school years from six to five, moving from a 12-year system of pre-university education to an 11-year system. This policy change affected all individuals born on or after October 1977. Using triennial pooled cross-section data from 1992 to 2014 and a nonparametric regression discontinuity approach, we compare education and fertility of women born just before and right after October 1977. Our analysis shows that female education significantly reduces the number of children born per woman. The reduction in fertility seems to result from delaying maternal age rather than changing women's fertility preferences. We also provide evidence that female education in Egypt does not boost women's labor force participation or affect their usages of contraceptive methods. Female education, however, does appear to increase women's age at marriage which might explain the delay of maternal age.","[Ali, Fatma Romeh M.] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Giza, Egypt; [Gurmu, Shiferaw] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Ali, FRM (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Econ, Giza, Egypt.",fatma_romeh@feps.edu.eg,,,,,,,58,20,24,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Competition is exclusive: each type of each agent can participate with at most one principal and meaningfully communicate only with him. Exclusive competition is at the center stage of recent analyses of markets with private information. Economic models of exclusive competition restrict principals to use standard direct mechanisms, which induce truthful revelation of agents' exogenous private information. This paper investigates the rationale for this restriction. We provide two results. First, we construct an economic example showing that direct mechanisms fail to completely characterize equilibrium outcomes even if we restrict to pure strategy equilibria. Second, we show that truth-telling strongly robust equilibrium outcomes survive against principals' unilateral deviations toward arbitrary mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Similarly, many have argued that trade makes war less likely, yet the First World War erupted at a time of unprecedented globalisation.

Exploring the pathways from human capital increases to TFP growth, we find that these industries also accelerated new technology adoption, as reflected in the importation of advanced capital goods, R&D expenditure and capital intensity, as well as employment of more highly skilled individuals.

Consequently, studying the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic development is important, especially when viewed from a historical perspective. We test the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for a panel of 20 OECD nations, dating back to the first globalization boom in the nineteenth century. Utilising recently developed panel data estimators that account for cross-sectional dependence and parameter heterogeneity, for the period 1870 to 2014, we find support for the EKC hypothesis for the panel as a whole with three of our preferred four estimators, with turning points in income per capita that lie between $18,955 and $89,540 (in 1990 US$). Country-specific results, however, only provide mixed support for the EKC hypothesis. Specifically, we find evidence of an EKC for nine of the 20 countries, with five exhibiting a traditional inverted U-shaped relationship, three exhibiting an N-shaped relationship and one, an inverted N-shaped relationship.

We address the issue of endogeneity by applying the system generalized method of moments (GMM) technique. Our findings are threefold: first, when all developing countries are included in the same panel, on average, ICT diffusion has a positive and significant impact on economic growth but financial development does not. Second, the joint effect of ICT and finance is positive, suggesting that the direct effect of ICT diffusion on economic growth in developing countries is realized because of development of the financial sector. Third, the ICT-finance joint effect is found to be positive in LICs but insignificant in LMICs.

The principal assigns a test consisting of a finite sequence of tasks. The test is adaptive: each task that is assigned can depend on the agent's past performance. The probability of success on a task is jointly determined by the agent's privately known ability and an unobserved effort level that he chooses to maximize the probability of passing the test. We identify a simple monotonicity condition under which the principal always employs the most (statistically) informative task in the optimal adaptive test. Conversely, whenever the condition is violated, we show that there are cases in which the principal strictly prefers to use less informative tasks.","[Deb, Rahul; Stewart, Colin] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Deb, R (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",rahul.deb@utoronto.ca; colinbstewart@gmail.com,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This paper was previously circulated with the shorter title Optimal adaptive testing.

To do so, an unbalanced panel dataset of 128 countries over the period 1990-2014 is utilized. Considering the cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity observed in the panel, a series of econometric techniques allowing for cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity is employed. The results of cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity tests confirm the existence of significant cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity. The empirical results of the common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) estimator indicate that, at both the global and regional levels, population size and economic growth positively and significantly influence CO2 emission levels. Furthermore, although increased renewable energy intensity leads to a decline in CO2 emissions for all of the six regions, its coefficient in S. & Cent. America and Europe & Eurasia is considerably higher than the levels seen in other regions, which may be affected by the proportion of renewable energy in the primary energy mix.

In a competitive equilibrium, sophisticated investors are offered contracts with perfect commitment, and first best results are achieved; naive investors are attracted by contracts that offer seemingly attractive returns in the long run but introduce discontinuous penalties for early withdrawal. If the investor types are private information, naive investors withdraw early and cross-subsidize sophisticated investors. When a secondary market for long-term contracts opens for trading, financial intermediaries are compelled to offer contracts that have more flexible withdrawal options with linear schemes, and the welfare of naive investors is improved. Arbitrage-free linear contracts allow for a unique term structure for interest rates that includes a premium for naivete. Solvency requirements may limit competition for contracts and result in positive profits; banks that have capital are able to compete more aggressively, which improves investor welfare.

We show that oil prices have a nonlinear impact on the 5- and 10-year market-based inflation expectation components. Specifically, we find that the impact of oil price changes on inflation expectations is more intense when oil prices are above a threshold of 67 USD per barrel and is more pervasive for the intermediate term than for the longer term. Furthermore, we show that oil prices have a nonlinear impact on the inflation risk premium. These results have implications for the management of inflation expectations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, products and services can be marketed more specifically or even customized according to the preference of the consumer. In this paper we argue that we are currently witnessing the emergence of a consumer-centered economy. In such an economy, the success of firms depends on how well they are able to integrate consumer information into the process of value addition. Producing standardized products will offer few prospects for success, even when integrated into regional or global value chains. For Asia, this new trend means that developing countries need to rapidly upgrade the skills of their work force, improve their information technology and transport connectivity, and lower their trade costs.","[Heible, Matthias] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, 3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan",,"Heible, M (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, 3-2-5 Kasumigaseki, Tokyo 1006008, Japan.",mhelble@adbi.org,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

To do so, I develop a two-country DSGE monetary union model, which I calibrate to the core and periphery regions of the euro area. Monetary policy is set by the ECB, while macroprudential policies, based on the loan-to-value ratio (LW), are set nationally. Results show that, given that the economy in the periphery is more leveraged, macroprudential policies need to be more aggressive in that region. I also find that, when LTV policies are set independently in a non-coordinated manner by each authority, albeit being beneficial for both countries and for the union as a whole, welfare gains are not as high as when they are coordinated and supervised by a separate body.

The evolutionary approaches highlight that interdependent components of the economic system may respond to their respective motions in a mutually reinforcing way thereby leading to the emergence of new structures. The structural approaches highlight the asymmetries between response patterns of different components of the economy and address the economic discontinuities arising from the mismatch of different types of motion or the compensatory policies needed to achieve certain objectives (such as full employment) under conditions of structural change. This paper argues that the two approaches stem from different intellectual traditions but may complement each other. The structural approach provides tools to the investigation of evolutionary processes in which bottlenecks and asymmetries affect the formation of new structures, while the evolutionary approach provides tools to the analysis of changes leading to the irreversible transformation of economic structures.

We also see wider implications for household economic welfare, demonstrated by reduced self-reported financial distress, better resilience to economic shocks, and a greater capacity to securing basic needs.

This strategy is consistent with the goal of targeting 2 percent inflation, on average, over the business cycle.

We show how a recently-proposed solution to the first problem also helps address the second. The policy is an emissions tax tied to average temperatures, coupled with permits that exempt the emitter from paying the tax in a future year. It has been shown that the resulting tax path will be correlated with future marginal damages. It has been conjectured that the permit prices will yield unbiased forecasts of the climate, which, if true, would address the second uncertainty. We confirm the conjecture by describing a trading mechanism that converges on unbiased forecasts if traders are risk-neutral. Risk aversion slows down but does not prevent convergence. We also show that the forecasts are more likely to be sufficient statistics the stronger the consensus on climate science. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Contrary to the common wisdom that competitive balance bolsters performance in contests, in this setting theory predicts that aggregate output increases in the variation in abilities between groups, i.e., it is maximized by the most unbalanced sorting of players. However, the data does not support this prediction. In the absence of communication, we find no effect of sorting on aggregate output, while in the presence of within-group communication aggregate output is 33% higher under the balanced sorting as compared to the unbalanced sorting. This reversal of the prediction is in line with the competitive balance heuristic. The results have implications for the design of optimal groups in organizations using relative performance pay.

This question is addressed by analysing international co-movements of value added growth in a multi-sector dynamic factor model. The model contains a world factor, region factors, sector factors, country factors, and idiosyncratic components. The model is estimated using Bayesian methods for 9 disaggregated sectors in 5 developed economies (G5) and 19 emerging economies for the 1972-2009 period. The results suggest that, while there exists a common 'regional business cycle' in the G5, fluctuations in sectoral value added growth are dominated by country-specific factors in the emerging markets. Despite that, the international factor (the sum of world and sector factors) is more important than the region factor, suggesting that the emerging markets are more synchronized with the G5. A simple regression shows that (i) the world factor would be more important the larger the share of agriculture in output; (ii) in more open economies the sector factor is more important in explaining sectoral value added growth fluctuations; (iii) the region factors is more important the richer and the less volatile the economy. Finally, a comparison of the variance of sectoral value added growth accounted for by each factor from the pre- to the post-globalization period shows convergence of the business cycles within the G5 and EM, respectively. The changes in the contribution of the world, sector and region factor are due to changes in the importance of those factors within sectors. However, for the emerging markets, the fall in the importance of the country factors is dominated by changes in the structural composition of the economies. Therefore, the evolution of the structural composition in the emerging markets could be an important driver for more synchronized business cycles at the regional and international level.

In this paper, I propose a new rationale for why it may be beneficial to use collateral tax sanctions for the purpose of tax enforcement. By affecting consumption and providing enforcement targeted to a group, collateral tax sanctions may allow the government to impose punishment correlated with an individual's earning potential. Such punishment also makes the effective tax rates correlated with an individuals' earning potential and therefore leads to a more effective redistribution of income. I show that the use of collateral tax sanctions could increase the CES social welfare function when the skill distribution of the targeted group first-order stochastically dominates the skill distribution of the other group and the social welfare function is sufficiently concave.","[Kuchumova, Yulia] Higher Sch Econ St Petersburg, Dept Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Kuchumova, Y (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ St Petersburg, Dept Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",jul.paramonova@gmail.com,"Kuchumova, Yulia/AAP-3936-2020","Kuchumova, Yulia/0000-0001-7885-0118",,,,,11,1,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

We choose an experimental setting and focus on two features of the tax system: efficiency and tax rate. We develop our analysis in two countries characterized by high tax burdens, but with relevant differences in terms of tax evasion and the quality of public services: Italy and Sweden. The main result is that participants from both countries react similarly to changes in efficiency and tax rates: tax compliance rises when efficiency increases, and tax compliance falls when the tax rate increases. However, the absolute level of tax compliance depends on the population's composition in terms of social preferences (prosocials and individualists). This may suggest that, even if cultural factors matter, institutional features-especially efficiency-play a relevant role in determining taxpayers' behavior. In particular, if the level of efficiency is high, both Italians and Swedes tend to pay taxes when the tax burden is high. We conclude the paper by discussing related policy implications.","[Ottone, Stefania] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Ponzano, Ferruccio] Univ Piemonte Orientale, Dept Law Polit Econ & Social Sci, I-15100 Alessandria, Italy; [Andrighetto, Giulia] European Univ Inst, Dept Social & Polit Sci, I-50014 Fiesole, Fiesole, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro; European University Institute,"Ottone, S (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",stefania.ottone@unimib.it; ferruccio.ponzano@uniupo.it; giulia.andrighetto@gmail.com,,"PONZANO, Ferruccio/0000-0003-1485-1386",European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC [295675],European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agreement n.(295675).

In a large online sample, we replicate the seminal finding that cheating rates are largely insensitive to stake size, even at a 500-fold increase. We present two new findings. First, resisting the temptation to cheat at high stakes led to negative moral spill-over, triggering a moral license: participants who resisted cheating in the high stakes condition subsequently donated a smaller fraction of their earnings to charity. Second, participants who cheated maximally mispredicted their perceived morality: although such participants thought they were less prone to feeling immoral if they cheated, they ended up feeling more immoral a day after the cheating task than immediately afterwards. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings on moral balancing and self-deception, and the practical relevance for organisational design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

If the goal of policy makers is to stabilize these dynamics they can do so by introducing profit taxes that reduce the regions' relative profitability. While stability can already be obtained by imposing profit taxes in one of the two regions, total welfare is maximized if policy makers coordinate their tax setting behavior across regions. However, policy makers only interested in welfare in their own region may have the incentive to decrease their profit tax below this level, thereby attracting more firms and increasing tax revenues, at the cost of instability in both regions.","[Schmitt, Noemi; Westerhoff, Frank] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany; [Tuinstra, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Tuinstra, Jan] Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Westerhoff, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Dept Econ, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany.",frank.westerhoff@uni-bamberg.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015; Tuinstra, Jan/H-4197-2011; Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022; Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Tuinstra, Jan/0000-0001-6156-4940",,,,,22,1,1,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

J,"Wagner, J",,,,"Wagner, Joel",,,Downward nominal wage rigidity in Canada: Evidence against a greasing effect,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MONETARY-POLICY; INFLATION; UNEMPLOYMENT,"The existence of downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR) has often been used to justify a positive inflation target. It is traditionally assumed that positive inflation could grease the wheels of the labour market by putting downward pressure on real wages, easing labour market adjustments during a recession. A rise in the inflation target would attenuate the long-run level of unemployment and hasten economic recovery after an adverse shock. Following Daly and Hobijn (2014), we re-examine these issues in a model that accounts for precautionary motives in wage-setting behaviour. We confirm that DNWR generates a long-run negative relationship between inflation and unemployment, in line with previous contributions to the literature. However, we also find that the increase in the number of people bound by DNWR following a negative demand shock rises with the inflation target, offsetting the beneficial effects a higher inflation target has on closing the unemployment gap. As an implication, contrary to previous contributions that neglected precautionary behaviour, the speed at which unemployment returns back to pre-crisis levels during recessions is relatively unaffected by variations in the inflation target. Resume Rigidite a la baisse des salaires nominaux au Canada: resultats remettant en question l'effet de lubrification. L'existence de la rigidite a la baisse des salaires nominaux (RBSN) a souvent ete utilisee pour justifier une cible d'inflation positive. Traditionnellement on presume qu'une inflation positive peut lubrifier les rouages du marche du travail en mettant une pression a la baisse sur les salaires reels, facilitant ainsi les ajustements dans le marche du travail au cours d'une recession. Un accroissement dans la cible d'inflation attenuerait l'effet a long terme sur le niveau de chomage et pourrait accelerer la reprise apres un choc adverse. la suite de Daly et Hobijn (2014), l'auteur reexamine ces questions dans un modele qui tient compte du motif de precaution dans le comportement de determination des salaires. On confirme que la RBSN genere une relation negative a long terme entre inflation et chomage, resultat deja inscrit dans la litterature specialisee. Cependant on decouvre aussi que le nombre de personnes frappees par la RBSN a la suite d'un choc negatif dans la demande augmente a proportion que la cible d'inflation augmente, compensant les effets benefiques d'une cible d'inflation accrue sur l'ecart de chomage. Voila qui implique que, contrairement a ce qui est rapporte dans une litterature qui negligeait le comportement de precaution, la vitesse avec laquelle le chomage retourne a son niveau de l'avant-crise est relativement non-affectee par les variations dans la cible d'inflation.","[Wagner, Joel] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada",Bank of Canada,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",jwagner@bank-banque-canada.ca,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

To provide references for the on-going electricity market reform, this study employs an optimization model to quantify the economic dispatch savings in the coal-fired power sector. Key findings are summarized as follows: (1) The heat rates of 2803 coal generators in China range from 273.91 gce/kWh to 348.38 gce/kWh units in 2014, and the great differences among these generators at different geographical areas exhibit the necessity for economic dispatch. (2) 5.67% of the coal used for power generation could be saved from economic dispatch in a provincial level, the monetary value of which can reduce the average electricity price by 0.0058 yuan/kWh in 2014. (3) Three major political and economic challenges hinder the transition from the current dispatch mode to economic dispatch, namely the insufficient running hours for cost recovery, limited cross-border trading due to electricity over-supply and local protectionism, and the political economy problems from generators of different ownership types.

Scholars have argued that this balance of power contributed to a tradition of limited government and constitutional bargaining. I argue that 5(th)- and 6th-century barbarian settlements created a foundation for this balance of power. The settlements provided barbarians with allotments of lands or taxes due from the lands. The allotments served to align the incentives of barbarian warriors and Roman landowners, and realign the incentives of barbarian warriors and their leadership elite.

While a C&T sets a total emission cap for a region, a performance-based program under CPP relies on trading the emission rate credits (ERCs), which represent an equivalent MWh of energy generated or saved with zero associated CO2 emissions, to reduce emission costs. This paper examines the theoretical properties of the tradable performance-based policy and compares it to a C&T program. We distinguish two kinds of tradable performance-based policy: (1) a regional policy, under which all states are subject to a regional performance-based standard, and (2) a state-by-state policy, under which each state adopts its performance-based policy within a regional power market while trading of ERCs is allowed. Our findings indicate that under a state-by-state policy, power prices across states could be different even without any transmission congestion, reflecting varying stringency of tradable performance-based standards among states within an interconnected market. We also identify a counterintuitive result that even if ERCs trading is allowed under the state-by-state performance policy, the permit prices could diverge. Two models are simulated in our analysis: three-state and the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland (PJM) regional power market. While the three-state example allows us to illustrate the theoretical properties of the policies, the PJM-based simulation allows us to gauge the performance of the policies. Our PJM analysis shows that a C&T policy is the most effective, while the comparison between a regional and state-by-state tradable performance policy is ambiguous.

From the outset, his government deployed an aggressive security policy to fight drug trafficking organizations in what became known as the Mexican Drug War. The policy earned considerable criticism since a heavy number of unintended casualties resulted from the frontal assault waged against the drug cartels. In this article, we evaluate the effects of the Mexican Drug War on Mexican states' economic growth. To do so, we study the effects of the rise in the homicide rate and changes in a state-level approximation of the military budget on economic growth. Using dynamic panel data econometrics, we find that while the growth in the number of homicides had negative and significant effects on state GDP growth, state military expenditures aimed at fighting drug trafficking had a positive and significant effect on the per capita economic growth rate.","[Bel, Germa; Holst, Maximilian] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Holst, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, John M Keynes 1-11, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",gbel@ub.edu; maximilian.holst@ub.edu,"Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Holst, Maximilian/0000-0002-9560-4901","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-76866-R]; Catalan government [SGR2014-325, 2017 SGR 644]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Catalan government,The authors thank the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (project ECO2016-76866-R) and the Catalan government (SGR2014-325; 2017 SGR 644) for financial support.

This is at odds with a prominent theoretical view which, using the logic of the permanent income hypothesis, argues that consumption responses should be small. We show that, in contrast to this view, workhorse models of consumption with incomplete markets calibrated to rich cross-sectional micro facts actually predict large consumption responses, in line with the data. To explain this result, we show that consumption responses to permanent house price shocks can be approximated by a simple and robust rule-of-thumb formula: the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income times the value of housing. In our model, consumption responses depend on a number of factors such as the level and distribution of debt, the size and history of house price shocks, and the level of credit supply. Each of these effects is naturally explained with our simple formula.","[Berger, David; Lorenzoni, Guido] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Guerrieri, Veronica; Vavra, Joseph] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Northwestern University; University of Chicago,"Berger, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,56,120,149,14,140,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

To solve the potential endogeneity of the supply of museums, we use three different empirical strategies: we use a fixed effects model controlling for bilateral macro-area dummies, we compute the degree of selection on unobservables relative to observables which would be necessary to drive the result to zero and, finally, we adopt a two-stage least squares approach that uses a measure of historical patronage, the number of noble families, as an instrument for the number of museums.

This practice is partly motivated by the stronger implication derived by Lee (2008), who showed that under certain conditions the distribution of baseline covariates in the RDD must be continuous at the cut-off. We propose a permutation test based on the so-called induced ordered statistics for the null hypothesis of continuity of the distribution of baseline covariates at the cut-off; and introduce a novel asymptotic framework to analyse its properties. The asymptotic framework is intended to approximate a small sample phenomenon: even though the total number n of observations may be large, the number of effective observations local to the cut-off is often small. Thus, while traditional asymptotics in RDD require a growing number of observations local to the cut-off as n -> 8, our framework keeps the number q of observations local to the cut-off fixed as n -> 8. The new test is easy to implement, asymptotically valid under weak conditions, exhibits finite sample validity under stronger conditions than those needed for its asymptotic validity, and has favourable power properties relative to tests based on means. In a simulation study, we find that the new test controls size remarkably well across designs. We then use our test to evaluate the plausibility of the design in Lee (2008), a well-known application of the RDD to study incumbency advantage.","[Canay, Ivan A.; Kamat, Vishal] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Canay, IA (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1530534]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1530534] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: UKRI","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","We thank the Co-Editor and four anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We add to the literature in different ways. First, we adapt the categories that Rodriguez-Pose used for studying convergence among old EU members to CEECs regions. This allows us to assess the relevance of geo-sectoral groups (urban areas, old industrialized areas and peripheral areas) for newcomer regions. Second, we introduce a new category, that of successful Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)-based restructuring' in order to capture regions that, often through considerable FDI, manage to reconvert their old industrial base. We then analyze whether this group helps understand catching-up/falling behind processes in CEECs. We test the relevance of these groups by means of both non-parametric and spatial regression analyses.

Hundreds of empirical studies have tried to explain differences in student performance by evaluating the impact of particular teacher characteristics. Yet, this topic has not been the subject of a systematic review for more than 10 years, even though most of the empirical evidence has emerged over the past decade. This study provides an up-to-date review, drawing on empirical findings from several countries and distinguishing between acquired and sociodemographic teacher characteristics. This review confirms the existing consensus that subject-related degrees and knowledge, and not general teacher certifications, are positively related to student performance and particularly so for Master's degrees in math and science. A new insight is that recent findings point out that teacher experience continues to contribute to student test scores throughout a teacher's career, instead of merely the first few years. An important future research avenue would be to examine which mechanisms can explain these teacher characteristic effects.","[Coenen, Johan] Etil Res Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Cornelisz, Ilja; Van Klaveren, Chris] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Ctr Learning Analyt, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Groot, Wim; van den Brink, Henriette Maassen] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Maastricht University,"Coenen, J (通讯作者)，Etil Res Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",jb.coenen@gmail.com,,"Van klaveren, Chris/0000-0001-5975-4454; Cornelisz, Ilja/0000-0002-9948-7861",,,,,68,22,27,2,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The model incorporates two competitive channels for merger effects: the price coordination channel and the internalization of the innovation externality. We solve the model numerically and find that price coordination between the two products of the merged firm tends to stimulate innovation, while internalization of the innovation externality depresses it. The latter effect is stronger in our simulations and, as a result, the merger leads to lower innovation incentives for the merged entity, absent cost efficiencies and knowledge spillovers.

We examine individual income for men 1970-2007 and family income for both men and women 1980-2007. During this period, income inequality increased in most western countries, but especially so in Sweden. Drawing on a large sample of the Swedish population, our results show that the gap in life expectancy between the richest and poorest fifths of the income distribution also increased. This was the case both for individual and family income. The increase was larger for men than for women, but the only group with stagnant life expectancy at age 35 was women in the lowest income quintile group. Between 1986 and 2007, the difference between the lowest and highest family income quintiles increased by about one year for women and by almost two years for men. The causes of death that most significantly contributed to the increased disparities among women were circulatory and respiratory diseases. For men, circulatory disease mortality alone caused most of the increased disparities.","[Hederos, Karin; Jaentti, Markus; Lindahl, Lena; Torssander, Jenny] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Jaentti, Markus] Univ Helsinki, VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland",Stockholm University; University of Helsinki; VATT Institute for Economic Research,"Hederos, K (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",,,"Jantti, Markus/0000-0001-6075-6553","Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE)","Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE)","Hederos, Lindahl and Torssander gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE).",,38,15,16,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2018,85.0,339,,,,,606,625,,10.1111/ecca.12224,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GI5LQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434412400009,0

Firms have two alternative means to increase work effort: discipline and control vs. monetary incentives. A key ingredient of our model lies in the fact that workers suffer from present-bias. We show that this lack of self-control makes discipline relatively cheap when workers' outside option is low even in the absence of moral hazard. Then, as one economy develops, it endogenously goes through three stages where firms successively use low-powered monetary incentives, factory discipline and then high-powered monetary incentives. When moral hazard is introduced, multiple development paths may emerge.","[Hiller, Victor] Univ Pantheon Assas, LEMMA, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas,"Hiller, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pantheon Assas, LEMMA, Paris, France.",victor.hiller@u-paris2.fr,"Hiller, Victor/HGF-7139-2022","Hiller, Victor/0000-0002-1616-6158",project Labex MME-DII [ANR11-LBX-0023-01],project Labex MME-DII,I would like to thank an Editor and an anonymous Referee for useful comments and suggestions.This research has been conducted as part of the project Labex MME-DII (ANR11-LBX-0023-01).,,42,0,0,0,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

In a setting that combines risky entrepreneurial activity with moral hazard, we find that a shift from autarky to financial integration leads to boom-bust cycles in capital flows, output and consumption. Moral hazard causes cycles because financial intermediaries incentivize effort by insisting entrepreneurs take an equity share in their own projects. The size of this stake rises with wealth, discouraging entrepreneurship and inhibiting capital formation. The reverse is true when wealth falls, generating cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Such objectivity may be undermined by group membership that is difficult to detect. In this paper we exploit an institutional feature of figure skating, namely that figure skaters possess individual styles and technique, rather than their performance being influenced by club-specific characteristics, which allows us to identify the role of favouritism in a context where it is intended to be excluded. We can identify judges being influenced by group identity, in this case club membership and exhibiting favouritism for club members.

Due to biological disadvantages, patient populations of blood types B/O are disproportionately hurt by this increasing shortage. The disadvantaged blood types are overrepresented among minorities in the US. In order to mitigate the disproportionate harm to these biologically disadvantaged groups, the UNOS reformed in 2014 the US deceased-donor kidney-allocation system, utilizing a technological advance in blood typing. The improved technology allows a certain fraction of blood type A kidneys, referred to as subtype A2 kidneys, to be transplanted to medically qualified patients of blood types B/O. The recent reform prioritizes subtype A2 deceased-donor kidneys for blood type B patients only. When restricted to the deceased-donor allocation system, this is merely a distributional reform with no adverse impact on the overall welfare of the patient population. In this paper we show that the current implementation of the reform has an unintended consequence, and it de facto extends the preferential allocation to kidney exchange as well. Ironically this spillover not only reduces the number of living-donor transplants for the overall patient population, but also for the biologically disadvantaged groups who are the intended beneficiaries of the reform. We show that minor variations of the current policy do not suffer from this unintended consequence, and we make two easy-to-implement, welfare-increasing policy recommendations.

UNDERREACTION TO HOT AND COLD HANDS IN NCAA BASKETBALL,ECONOMIC INQUIRY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GAMBLING MARKET; EFFICIENCY; MOMENTUM; BELIEVE; SPREAD,"The hot hand bias is the widely documented bias toward overestimation of positive serial correlation in sequential events. We test for the hot hand bias in a novel real-world context, the seeding of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball tournament teams. That is, we examine whether teams that perform relatively well heading into March Madness are seeded too high, and/or teams with poor recent performance are seeded too low. The seeds are determined by a 10-member committee that only has implicit incentives, but these incentives are still substantial as the committee's decisions are highly scrutinized by the media, fans, and other stakeholders. We find that, contra the hot hand bias, the committee underreacts to signals of momentum heading into the NCAA tournament. Various results indicate this behavior can be attributed to both: (1) inattention to relatively detailed information indicating momentum; and (2) under-appreciation of the predictive value of this information. Betting markets incorporate this information efficiently, but neglect some additional information that is predictive of winning NCAA tournament games but not of beating the spread. We note that the NCAA tournament has been highly popular and lucrative partly due to the madness (high frequency of wins by lower-seeded teams), which the bias we document contributes to, making the persistence of bias less surprising.

We also investigate how local product differentiation and the spatial discount factor affect the equilibrium prices. We show that these effects non-trivially depend on the network structure.

This paper analyses the impact of contract observability in a two-sided market composed of symmetric indirect externalities with quantity competition and perfect information on agents' effort. We show that, in both types of contracts, managers' effort and platform subscription on each side of the market increase as the indirect network externality becomes more intense. However, the impact of the indirect network externality on platform profit is ambiguous. Managerial incentives, consumer surplus and social welfare are higher with observable contracts; however, platform profit is higher with unobservable contracts.

Employing an event study, we find that, if a private firm loses political connections because of the sudden death of an independent director who was previously a government official, its stock price drops 3.61% on average within ten trading days. After the loss of political connections, we find that it is possible but infeasible for a private firm to reestablish political connections with the government in a short period of time. Moreover, the sudden death of a retired government official leads to a reduction in the economic benefits (e.g., bank loans, tax preference, and government subsidies) obtained by a private firm, which provides a reasonable explanation for the negative stock price reaction after losing political connections.","[Cheng, Lei] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Ctr Macroecon Res & Policy Evaluat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Cheng, L (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Ctr Macroecon Res & Policy Evaluat, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",chenglei2016@whu.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71703113],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"I am grateful to Brian Wright, Jeffrey Perloff, Sofia Berto Villas-Boas, Lee Fleming, David Zilberman, Peter Berck, Michael Anderson, Gerard Roland, Larry Karp, Zhen Sun, and three anonymous referees for their detailed comments.

We first develop a model of school choice in which the demand for religious schooling is driven partly by the desire of parents to limit their children's exposure to the influences of competing religions. The model predicts that when a religious group's share of the local population grows, the fraction of that group's members whose children attend religious schools declines. In addition, it shows that if the motivation to preserve religious identity is sufficiently strong, the fraction of all children that attend a given denomination's school is an inverse u-shaped function of the denomination's market share. Finally, the model implies that the overall demand for religious schooling is an increasing function of both the local religiosity rate and the level of religious pluralism, as measured by a Herfindahl Index. Using both U.S. county-level data and individual data from ECLS-K and NELS:88, we find evidence strongly consistent with all of the model's predictions. Our findings also illustrate that failing to control for the local religiosity rate, as is common in previous studies, may lead a researcher to erroneously conclude that religious pluralism has a negative effect on participation.

We evaluate five Brexit scenarios, based on different assumptions regarding Brexit, TTIP and various free trade deals the UK may attempt to broker with the US or Commonwealth countries. We also consider the dynamics of welfare changes over a period of two decades. Our estimates suggest that the impact of Brexit is negative in all policy scenarios, with lower welfare losses under a soft Brexit scenario. The losses are exacerbated if TTIP comes into force, demonstrating the benefits of being a member of a large trade bloc. However, they occur gradually and can be partially compensated by signing new free trade agreements. To further minimise losses, the UK should avoid a hard Brexit.","[Jackson, Karen] Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England; [Shepotylo, Oleksandr] Univ Bradford, Sch Management, Emm Lane, Bradford BD9 4JL, W Yorkshire, England",University of Westminster; University of Bradford,"Jackson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Westminster, Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England.",K.Jackson@westminster.ac.uk,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023; Shepotylo, Oleksandr/G-4773-2015","Shepotylo, Oleksandr/0000-0003-4990-6025",,,,,54,15,15,2,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In particular, we. analyse the stock return dynamics in G7 countries over recent decades while considering the effect of heterogeneous investor sentiment. We develop an empirical and nonlinear heterogeneous stock price specification allowing for the presence of two types of investors (arbitrageurs and noise traders) and two regimes. With reference to the heterogeneous smooth transition regression model, we enable the price to switch smoothly between regimes after accounting for an endogenous change in investor sentiment. Our findings do not reject the hypothesis of the nonlinear investor sentiment effect on stock returns. Further, we show that two regimes characterize the stock price dynamics for which the price is closely governed by fundamentals in the first one, while investor sentiment drives the price in the second one. Our model, therefore, captures the main stylized facts observed in the market and shows good in- and out-of-sample forecasting power. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Some groups began to organize themselves with the aim of collectively assuming the management of bankrupted factories in order to keep their jobs. The first 'recovered factories' appeared in Brazil. In this context, some supporting institutions were also born, in order to support these experiences, as well as other initiatives within the cooperative and social economy.

We consider different social objectives and incorporate a novel approach taken in the spirit of Roemer (Equality of opportunity, Harvard University Press, Harvard, 1998) and Van de Gaer (Equality of opportunity and investments in human capital, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1993). This approach applies a compromise between the principle of compensation and the principle of responsibility. We derive analytical expressions which describe the optimal distortion (upward or downward) in saving. As the multidimensional problems become very complicated, to gain a better understanding, we also numerically examine the properties of an optimal lifetime redistribution policy. We find support for a nonlinear tax/pension program in which impatient types are taxed at the margin, and patient low ability types are subsidized in their retirement consumption. Numerical simulations show quite big differences in terms of the levels of marginal tax rates between different social objectives, indicating that the optimal income taxation results are sensitive to the choice of the social planner's goals.","[Ravaska, Terhi; Tuomala, Matti] Univ Tampere, Tampere 33104, Finland; [Tenhunen, Sanna] Finnish Ctr Pens, Helsinki 00065, Finland",,"Ravaska, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tampere, Tampere 33104, Finland.",terhi.ravaska@labour.fi; Sanna.Tenhunen@etk.fi; matti.tuomala@uta.staff.fi,,"Ravaska, Terhi/0000-0003-2057-7088; Tenhunen, Sanna/0000-0002-3767-1751",Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland [293120]; OP Groups Scientific Foundations; Academy of Finland (AKA) [293120] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland; OP Groups Scientific Foundations; Academy of Finland (AKA),"Funding from the Strategic Research Council of Academy of Finland, No. 293120 (STN-WIP-consortium) is gratefully acknowledged.

In the raw data, a large gap emerges at the upper end of the unconditional distribution. While OLS estimates show no difference in average net wealth levels, quantile regressions at the 95th percentile yield mixed evidence for the gender wealth gap in different specifications. Labour market characteristics and participation in asset and debt categories largely explain the differences between male and female single households. The gender gap in net wealth is driven by gaps in gross wealth and its components, but is attenuated in four countries by gender gaps in (collateralized) debt. In the full specification, the unexplained gap in gross wealth amounts to 27 percent in Slovakia, 33 percent in France, 44 percent in Austria, 45 percent in Germany, and 48 percent in Greece.","[Schneebaum, Alyssa; Mader, Katharina] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Rehm, Miriam] Fed Chamber Labour Vienna AK Wien, Dept Econ & Stat, Vienna, Austria; [Hollan, Katarina] European Ctr Social Welf Policy & Res, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Schneebaum, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, WU Wien, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",alyssa.schneebaum@wu.ac.at,"Holloway, Susan/KBD-1889-2024","Hollan, Katarina/0000-0001-8725-0253; Schneebaum, Alyssa/0000-0002-0320-5525",,,,,59,24,24,3,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

At the same time, during recent decades, services have contributed increasing shares of valued-added to products produced through global production chains. For this reason we examine the evolving role of Chinese services in international production chains. Our results suggest that Chinese services account for an increasingly large share of production for the domestic market, and more recently have made increasing contributions to foreign production chains, which suggests that Chinese production is shifting to activities in production chains that are associated with higher value-added.","[Simola, Heli] Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit BOFIT, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland",,"Simola, H (通讯作者)，Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit BOFIT, POB 160, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",heli.simola@bof.fi,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,10,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Both the principal and the agent can be either good or biased; the good players prefer the correct decision, while the biased ones prefer a high action even though it may be wrong. An evaluator who forms the principal's reputation may or may not be able to observe who makes the decision. When the evaluator cannot observe the allocation of authority, the principal shares the credit and blame with the agent. Although delegation can improve the quality of decision making because the agent has better information, it may also hurt the good principal's reputation because the high action may be taken by the biased agent while the blame will be shared when it is wrong. Thus, the good principal has a tendency to keep too much authority to maintain her reputation. By contrast, when the evaluator can observe the allocation of authority, delegation becomes a signaling device for the good type of principal to differentiate herself from the biased one. This results in an excessive allocation of authority toward the agent.","[Tamada, Yasunari] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Tsai, Tsung-Sheng] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan",Keio University; National Taiwan University,"Tamada, Y (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",tamada@econ.keio.ac.jp; tstsai@ntu.edu.tw,"Tsai, Tsung-Sheng/M-1604-2018","Tsai, Tsung-Sheng/0000-0002-8523-6789","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC 93-2415-H-001-033]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","We sincerely thank the Associate Editor and two referees for their insightful comments and helpful suggestions.

Given the large deficits in Croatian merchandise trade and accumulated external liabilities, wage formation in the exporting sectors receives a particular focus. It has been found that exporters are wage leaders and that labour productivity is a more important wage determinant for the exporting sectors than for other sectors. Public sector wages do not affect wages in private sectors. There are, however, wage spillovers within the group of exporting sectors and possibly a bi-directional causal relationship between wages in exporting and private sheltered sectors. Thus, some exporting industries may face pressure from wage increases in more successful exporting sectors as well as in private sheltered sectors. A more coordinated wage-setting system could contribute to improving overall export performance and reducing external trade imbalances.","[Vuksic, Goran] Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Vuksic, G (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia.",goran.vuksic@ijf.hr,"Vuksic, Goran/A-7454-2016","Vuksic, Goran/0000-0003-1502-5561",Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw); Global Development Network (GDN),Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw); Global Development Network (GDN),"The author is grateful to the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw) and the Global Development Network (GDN) for their financial support.

The results show that union membership has a significant effect on the wage level of rural migrant workers across the wage distribution. The effect of coefficient differences which results from the different rewarding systems explains the majority wage differentials between union members and non-members in non-unionized firms. There is also significant union coverage effect at the lower part of the distribution when comparing the union-covered non-member to the nonunion-covered non-member, which is also mainly caused by the coefficient effect. By contrast, wage differentials between union members and non-members in unionized firms are attributed to significant composition effect, which reveals that union members are positively selected within unionized firms. As a result, the positive wage effect of union is limited to the more advantaged group among migrant workers.","[Wang, Wen] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lien, Donald] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",Beijing Forestry University; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Lien, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",Don.Lien@utsa.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403023]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [JGTD2015-06],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71403023) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (grant no.

The design is implemented in two-stage asymmetric-information games. Subjects' information-seeking behavior reveals that they tend to choose certain information sets that are consistent with belief-based learning theories rather than reinforcement theories. A hybrid-learning model with information acquisition that is a variant of the Generalized Experience-Weighted-Attraction (GEWA) model (Shafran, 2012) is also proposed. It successfully captures the different learning speeds of two groups of subjects (i.e., informed and uninformed subjects), and shows that once information acquisition data is added into a structural model that focuses on action data alone, the performance is enhanced. Additional individual analysis indicates that the information acquisition behavior assumed by learning models appears to suggest the learning rule subjects follow. The results suggest that tracking subjects' voluntary information choices is a useful tool for analyzing their learning behaviors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, current policies cannot meet this ambitious goal. Adjusting its energy-intensive, heavy and chemical-based industrial structure is not only the main way China can change its economic growth pattern but also a key policy strategy to achieve its carbon emission peak goal. In addition to carbon emissions goals, economic growth and employment security must be considered for China's development in the context of addressing climate change. Hence, by proposing a new economic-carbon emission-employment multi-objective optimization model, we take a different approach to analyze China's emissions trajectory. The optimized results show that China's energy-related carbon dioxide emissions could peak between 2022 and 2025, most likely in 2023, with CO2 emissions of 11.21-11.56 Gt. When pursuing this peak (from 2013 to 2030), China could still maintain an average growth of approximately 6.1 to 6.4% yr(-1) for GDP and approximately 0.24% to 0.51% yr(-1) for employment. Furthermore, China's coal consumption has peaked in 2013 while oil would be peaked around 2023 to 2025, based on the optimized industrial structure adjustment trajectory from 2013 to 2030.

We generalize a sufficient condition for existence of equilibrium due to Anesi and Seidmann (2015). We then use this existence result to show that if a weak gradient restriction holds at an alternative, then when players are sufficiently patient, there is a continuum of equilibria with absorbing sets arbitrarily close to that alternative. A sufficient condition for our gradient restriction is that the gradients of all players' utilities are linearly independent at that alternative. When the dimensionality of the set of alternatives is high, this linear independence condition holds at almost all alternatives, and equilibrium absorbing sets are dense in the set of alternatives. This implies that constructive techniques, which are common in the literature, fail to identify many plausible outcomes in dynamic bargaining games.","[Anesi, Vincent] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Polit Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Duggan, John] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Nottingham; University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Anesi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England.",vincent.anesi@nottingham.ac.uk; dugg@ur.rochester.edu,,"Duggan, John/0000-0001-8554-2594; Anesi, Vincent/0000-0003-4424-2581",,,,,29,5,5,1,2,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

This paper documents this pattern using Spanish data and builds a two-sector, dynamic quantitative model of sovereign default with capital accumulation. Recessions are very persistent in the model and more pronounced for nontraded sectors because of default risk. An adverse domestic shock increases the likelihood of default, limits capital inflows, and thus restricts the ability of the economy to exploit investment opportunities. The economy responds by reducing investment and reallocating capital toward the traded sector to support debt service payments. The real exchange rate depreciates, a reflection of the scarcity of traded goods. We find that these mechanisms are quantitatively important for rationalizing the experience of Spain during the recent debt crisis. (C) 2018 The Authors.

This paper fills this gap by exploring to what extent concentration of a country's non-resource export basket is determined by their exports of natural resources. We present a theoretical framework that shows how upward pressure in wages caused by a resource windfall results in higher export concentration. We then document two robust empirical findings consistent with the theory. First, using data on discovery of oil and gas fields and of commodity prices as sources of exogenous variation, we find that countries with larger shares of natural resources in exports have more concentrated non-resource export baskets. Second, we find capital-intensive exports tend to dominate the export basket of countries prone to Dutch disease episodes.","[Bahar, Dany] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Bahar, Dany; Santos, Miguel A.] Harvard Ctr Int Dev, Cambridge, MA USA; [Santos, Miguel A.] Inst Estudios Super Adm, Caracas, Venezuela",Brookings Institution; Institute of Advanced Studies in Administration (IESA),"Bahar, D (通讯作者)，1775 Massachusets Ave, Washington, DC 20001 USA.",db21@post.harvard.edu,,"Santos, Miguel Angel/0000-0003-1305-9477",,,,,32,41,45,2,29,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We first set up a model of collateralized borrowing in domestic and foreign currency with international financial intermediation in which a change in leverage of global intermediaries leads to an international credit supply increase. In this environment, we illustrate how house price increases and exchange rates appreciations contribute to fueling the boom by inflating the value of collateral. We then document empirically, in a Panel VAR model for 50 advanced and emerging countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985 to 2012, that an increase in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers also leads to an increase in cross-border credit flows, a house price and consumption boom, a real exchange rate appreciation and a current account deterioration consistent with the transmission in the model. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the consumption and asset price response to such a shock, and show that country differences are associated with the level of the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the share of foreign currency denominated credit.

Our analysis produces new results that explain howthe rule governing the distribution of resources among household members is related to the measurement of household welfare and intra-household inequality. We show that in a collective model of private consumption, income shares are equal to the product of two weights: the Pareto weight and a distribution weight reflecting income effects across individuals. For a weighted Bergsonian representation of household utility and general assumptions about individual preferences, we derive the associated household welfare functions and intra-household inequality measures belonging to a family of entropy indexes. We illustrate our findings with an empirical application that estimates a collective demand system to recover associated individual and household welfare functions along with the measures of intra-household inequality. This is the first application that estimates the Pareto weight and examines its role within a measure of income dispersion among household members.","[Chavas, Jean-Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Menon, Martina; Pagani, Elisa; Perali, Federico] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Verona, Italy; [Perali, Federico] CHILD, Verona, Italy",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Verona,"Chavas, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jchavas@wisc.edu; martina.menon@univr.it; elisa.pagani@univr.it; federico.perali@univr.it,,,,,,,47,5,5,3,16,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

To improve the incentives for early exploration, the optimal design trades off fully transparent disclosure by selectively overrecommending the product (or spamming) to a fraction of users. Under the optimal scheme, the designer spams very little on a product immediately after its release but gradually increases its frequency; she stops it altogether when she becomes sufficiently pessimistic about the product. The recommender's product research and intrinsic/naive users seed incentives for user exploration and determine the speed and trajectory of social learning.

In every period until its discovery, the players decide how much of the unsearched area to comb. If a player finds the prize alone he wins it and the game ends. Players have a per-period discount factor and costs proportional to the area they search. First, as a benchmark for efficiency, we solve the one-player search problem. Second, in the two-player setting we show that typically there is inefficient over-search - a result akin to the tragedy of the commons. However, for players with intermediate levels of patience, there is the possibility of inefficient under-search as players incorporate the expected future payoffs in their current search decisions. Finally, with patient players, several counterintuitive results can arise: for example, players might be better off searching a larger island or looking for a less valuable prize.

We focus on three basic aspects of boards that have been reviewed in the recent reform of the Good Governance Code: the size of boards, their independence and their diversity. For the study of diversity, we use an index that integrates not only the gender of board members, but also their age and nationality, since these are factors that can influence the knowledge, experience and skills of the directors. The results confirm a high degree of compliance with the recommendations of the Good Governance Code, and suggest that the performance of the advisory and monitoring functions are factors that determine the composition of boards. With respect to the performance of the company, we note that there is a negative and significant relationship with the independence of boards. However, the results are sensitive to the performance measure employed.","[Garcia Martin, C.

The underlying intuition of the model is simple: when the scope of information search is more limited, marginal search efforts produce less useful information due to redundancy, but commonality of information among different agents increases. Consequently, limited information searchability induces a trade-off between an information source's precision and its commonality. In a beauty contest game with endogenous information acquisition, this precision-commonality trade-off generates non-fundamental volatility through the channel of information acquisition.

Our analysis of the English premium auction (EPA) reveals that, while maintaining ex post efficiency, awarding a premium to the highest two bidders makes the auction more attractive to all risk-averse bidders. This result is remarkably general, as it holds with possible interdependent bidder valuations and affiliated types. When bidders exhibit independent types, the EPA can also benefit a risk-averse seller and therefore strictly improve ex ante, or interim, Pareto efficiency of the English auction.","Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tsinghua University; University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; University of Amsterdam,"Hu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business, Sect Microecon, Postbus 15867, NL-1001 NJ Amsterdam, Netherlands.",x.hu@uva.nl,,"Offerman, Theo/0000-0002-3469-8334; Hu, Audrey/0000-0002-0498-9480",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [016.145.289],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This article has much benefited from the constructive comments and suggestions of the editor, Andrea Galeotti, and two anonymous referees.

The integrated welfare-environmental analysis, which is based on a censored energy consumer demand system, extends previous work in two ways. First, the estimation of a full matrix of substitution elasticities allows us to test the necessity of incorporating second-order effects into the welfare analysis. Second, the substitution elasticities derived from the demand system are used to estimate the shortrun CO2 emission-reduction potential. We find that first-order approximations of welfare effects provide reasonable estimates, particularly for carbon taxes. Analog to evidence in other low- and middle income countries, the taxation of all energy items is found to be regressive, with the exception of motor fuels. The analysis of the emission implications of different tax scenarios indicates that short-run emission reductions at the household level can be substantial- though the effects depend on how revenue is recycled. This effectiveness combined with moderate and manageable adverse distributional impacts renders the carbon tax a preferred mitigation instrument. Considering the large effect of food price increases on poverty and the limited additional emission-saving potential, the inclusion of CH4 and N2O in a carbon tax regime is not advisable.

The study used secondary data from the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) published in 2013-14, and analysis was undertaken by econometric approaches such as logistic and multiple linear regression models and propensity score matching methods. The results show that among those participants who successfully obtained credit, approximately 85 per cent of women obtained less credit than men; and the amount of credit that women obtained was also less (on average, approximately 1.8 per cent less). Gender, number of years of schooling, marital status, participation in agricultural activities, off-farm employment, and ownership of agricultural land for a male-headed household positively influenced discrimination in obtaining credit and the amount of credit obtained. Moreover, the propensity score matching results found that the average increase in the credit obtained by males was 220,000 Vietnamese Dong (VND) and this is mainly due to discrimination in favour of men. The results suggest that policy action is needed to avoid discrimination in credit disbursement on the basis of gender.","[Thi Kieu Van Tran; Zhang, Liqin] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Elahi, Ehsan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Abid, Muhammad] COMSATS Inst Informat Technol, CCRD, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Quang Trung Pham] Cent Inst Econ Management, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Thuy Duong Tran] Hanoi Univ, Hanoi, Vietnam",China Agricultural University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); University of Hanoi,"Zhang, LQ (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",ehsanelahi@nuist.edu.cn; liq-zh@263.net,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023; Elahi, Ehsan/ABB-2791-2020; Abid, Muhammad/J-8581-2017; Abid, Muhammad/ITW-0166-2023","Abid, Muhammad/0000-0002-7691-4066; Elahi, Ehsan/0000-0001-7848-8024",Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) [2012GXZ551]; China Agricultural University; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology [2017r101],Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); China Agricultural University; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology,"The authors are grateful to the Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC) (CSC No. 2012GXZ551), China Agricultural University and the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (No. 2017r101) for fellowship and financial support for this study.",,33,12,13,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

To do so, we apply the general modelling framework of the Bai-Perron breaking regression to all available quarterly data for capital cities, individually, and Australia as a whole (1989Q3-2017Q2). Retail energy prices in most Australian states were deregulated in the 2000s. We find that increases in average quarterly growth rates of electricity and gas prices consistently occurred in the third (September) quarter, and find very few instances of increases in any other quarters of the year. In the post-deregulation period, price increases are significantly higher than in the pre-deregulation era. Results for some capital cities are stark: in Perth, third-quarter growth in electricity prices has been five times higher after the structural break. In Australia, as a whole, third-quarter growth in gas prices has been three times higher after the structural break. We discuss several possible explanations for energy price rises in the period since deregulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This research is motivated by an apparent lack of attention on the unrestrained extraction of non-renewable natural resources in developing countries by multinational corporations in the empirical literature of pollution haven hypothesis. Using a panel data set of 38 SSA countries, over the period 1996-2011, this study reveals that FDI has a negative and significant net effect on forest area. The magnitude of this effect depends on the level of governance in these countries, despite the positive impact of governance indicators on forest preservation. This means that multinational corporations activities are associated with a lost of forest cover due to the low level of governance in SSA. Moreover, among the selected governance indicators, the findings suggest that in a regime where the rule of law and corruption control are not enforced, FDI leads to more forest degradation. More precisely, a marginal increase in the FDI stock (resp. flow) conditional on the average levels of rule of law and corruption control lead to a reduction of 6.63% (resp. 9.77%) and 5.74% (resp. 8.86%) respectively of forest cover per capita.","[Assa, Boka Stephane Kevin] Econ Policy Anal Unit CIRES CAPEC, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",,"Assa, BSK (通讯作者)，Econ Policy Anal Unit CIRES CAPEC, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",stephaneassaboka@gmail.com,"Assa, Boka Stéphane/GQZ-8997-2022",,,,,,60,26,26,0,31,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Second, it is the first to estimate the interconnections by means of a FIVAR model, in order to account for long memory. Our analysis indicates measures of total and directional connectedness unlike those that would be obtained with the use of a short memory VAR. These differences arise when the focus is on market turmoil periods and on forecast horizons of thirty days. Future research evaluating spillovers among long memory series can benefit from our results.

In particular, the empirical analysis explores the impact of the Federal Reserves' QE policy on lending by foreign branches of US banks. The findings reveal significant policy-induced liquidity spillovers via foreign lending during the QE policy implementation in the US, suggesting the existence of an international bank lending channel. The channel worked its way through different segments of the credit markets, having asymmetric effects on foreign host countries. Overall, our findings highlight the role of global banks in channelling QE created liquidity across borders, adding pressure to increasing debt levels in foreign countries.","[D'Avino, Carmela] Univ East London, Royal Docks Sch Business & Law, Water Lane, London E15 4LZ, England",University of East London,"D'Avino, C (通讯作者)，Univ East London, Royal Docks Sch Business & Law, Water Lane, London E15 4LZ, England.",C.Davino@uel.ac.uk,,"D'Avino, Carmela/0000-0002-8979-4593",,,,,45,8,10,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Conventional wisdom holds that FDI is a preferable form of external financing compared to other types of capital flows because of its stabilizing properties. While this might hold true largely for FDI flows of the Greenfield variety, in reality, a greater share of FDI to emerging economies in general and Asian economies appears to be in the form of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Do all types of FDI flows produce similar macroeconomic benefits? This paper empirically explores whether the type of FDI flow, i.e. Greenfield versus M&A, matters in the way it impacts economic growth and domestic investment for a large panel of developing Asian economies over 1990-2013. We find Greenfield FDI contributes positively to economic growth while FDI in the form of M&A appears to have no significant growth influence. We also find that the effects of Greenfield FDI on domestic capital formation are stronger and larger relative to M&A flows.","[Gopalan, Sasidaran] Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Competitiveness Inst, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore; [Ouyang, Alice] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rajan, Ramkishen S.] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Central University of Finance & Economics; National University of Singapore,"Gopalan, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Asia Competitiveness Inst, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore, Singapore.",sppsdg@nus.edu.sg; Alice.Ouyang@gmail.com; spprsraj@nus.edu.sg,"Rajan, Ramkishen/J-2344-2017; Gopalan, Sasidaran/J-2335-2017","Rajan, Ramkishen/0000-0002-7718-3867; Gopalan, Sasidaran/0000-0002-7106-6168",China National Social Science Fund [16BJY167],China National Social Science Fund,This paper was supported by China National Social Science Fund (Grant No.: 16BJY167).,,49,7,7,2,30,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

In this paper, we analyze how different dividend treatment of stock options and restricted stock grants impacts stock price and the riskiness of the firm. We find that if a firm's manager's utility function includes contemporaneous dividends (as in the case of restricted stock grants), the manager increases the risk level of equity in order to maintain the preferred risk level of her utility function. Increased risk level negatively impacts stock price, ceteris paribus.

The experimental data show that closeness in the division of preferences induces a significant increase in turnout. Moreover, for closely divided electorates (and only for these electorates), the provision of information significantly raises the participation of subjects supporting the slightly larger team relative to the smaller team. We show that the heterogeneous effect of information on the participation of subjects in different teams is driven by the subjects' (incorrect) beliefs of casting a pivotal vote. Simply put, subjects overestimate the probability of casting a pivotal vote when they belong to the team with a slight majority, and choose the strategy that maximizes their utility based on their inflated probability assessment. Empirical evidence on gubernatorial elections in the United States between 1990 and 2005 is consistent with our main experimental result. Namely, we observe that the difference in the actual vote tally between the party leading according to the polls and the other party is larger than the one predicted by the polls only in closely divided electorates.

Using administrative data on Ohio college students linked to matched firm-worker data on earnings, we examine how layoff affects the educational outcomes of working college students. Theoretically, layoff decreases the opportunity cost of college enrollment, but it could also make financing one's education more difficult, so the net effect is ambiguous. We find that layoff leads to a considerable reduction in the probability of employment while in school, but it has little impact on enrollment decisions at the extensive margin.

Using a large database that covers international R&D collaborations from 1984 to 2009, we localize each actor precisely in space through its latitude and longitude. This allows us to analyze the R&D network at all geographic scales simultaneously. Our empirical results show that despite the high importance of the city level, transnational R&D collaborations at large distances are much more frequent than expected from similar networks. This provides evidence for the ambiguity of distance in economic collaboration which is also suggested by the existing literature. In addition we test whether the hypothesis of local buzz and global pipelines applies to the observed R&D network by calculating well-defined metrics from network theory.","[Scholl, Tobias] Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, House Logist Mobil HOLM GmbH, Frankfurt0, Marburg, Germany; [Garas, Antonios; Schweitzer, Frank] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Syst Design, Weinbergstr 58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Philipps University Marburg; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Scholl, T (通讯作者)，Philipps Univ Marburg, Dept Geog, House Logist Mobil HOLM GmbH, Frankfurt0, Marburg, Germany.",to.scholl@gmail.com; agaras@ethz.ch; fschweitzer@ethz.ch,"Garas, Antonios/E-9952-2011; Schweitzer, Frank/B-2127-2012","Garas, Antonios/0000-0001-6914-0819",EU-FET project MULTIPLEX [317532]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); SNF [100014_126865],EU-FET project MULTIPLEX; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); SNF,AG and FS acknowledges support by the EU-FET project MULTIPLEX 317532.

However, migrants are often socially segregated and discriminated against in their destination cities in China. This paper uses a large representative survey to investigate whether interpersonal contact between urban locals and migrants improves urban locals' attitudes towards migrants. The novel part of this paper is to examine the effect of different contact experiences on multiple dimensions of attitudes. The results show distinct patterns between the effects of non-intimate and intimate contact experiences. All the OLS results, IV results and IV results together with Lewbel's () heteroscedasticity identification approach suggest that non-intimate contact experience only significantly improves willingness to engage in non-intimate interactions, and the magnitude of the effect reduces as the intimacy level of the intended interaction increases. On the contrary, intimate contact experience significantly improves willingness to engage in both non-intimate and intimate interactions.","[Xue, Sen] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Xue, S (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sen.xue@hotmail.com,,"Xue, Sen/0000-0002-7542-0136",Australian National University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China [17JNQN023]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province in China [2017A030310182],Australian National University(Australian National University); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province in China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province),"This study is supported by the scholarship provided by the Australian National University during the author's PhD study, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China (grant no. 17JNQN023), and the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province in China (grant no. 2017A030310182).",,50,8,9,2,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

However, ongoing economic, technological, social, and cultural changes in recent years have made it difficult for these firms to survive: since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008 until 2015, almost 94,400 craft workshops have closed, which amounts to a 7.26 % rate of decrease. In order to face these challenges, craft entrepreneurs must be innovative and review the ways in which they provide value to customers. By means of a qualitative explorative analysis, this study aims to analyze recent strategic directions undertaken by some Italian craft firms and identify the opportunities derived from them. It highlights three directions in particular: (1) to embrace the use of digital technologies, rather than viewing them as a threat to the firm's future, (2) to involve customers in the design and production processes and expand the firm's network, and (3) to offer a wide range of services in relation to their products. Following all three of these strategic paths will help craft firms to survive and increase their competitive advantage by capturing opportunities offered by new technologies and new ways to produce. This paper concludes that mixing ancient and digital knowledge in an open context of collaboration will allow craft entrepreneurs to positively look to the future.","[Bonfanti, Angelo] Univ Verona, Via Artigliere 19, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Del Giudice, Manlio] Link Campus Univ, Rome, Italy; [Papa, Armando] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy",University of Verona; University of Naples Federico II,"Bonfanti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Via Artigliere 19, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",angelo.bonfanti@univr.it,"DEL GIUDICE, MANLIO/JQV-3207-2023","DEL GIUDICE, MANLIO/0000-0002-2389-4495; BONFANTI, Angelo/0000-0002-3332-9780",,,,,60,54,55,6,72,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

The aim of the paper is to analyse the transitional dynamics of unemployment and vacancies when financial constraints are in place. We model the financial sector as a monopolistically competitive banking sector that intermediates financial capital between firms. This structure implies a per period financial resource constraint which has a closed form solution and describes the transition path of unemployment and vacancies to their steady state values. We show that the transition path crucially depends on the degree of wage flexibility. When wages do not depend on the unemployment rate the transition path is always downward sloping. This implies unemployment and vacancies adjust in opposite directions as observed in the data. When calibrating the model to the Great Recession and its aftermath we find that the lack of an improvement in the financial sector's effectiveness to intermediate resources played a crucial role in the slow recovery of the labour market.

To provide a robust description of the literature's findings, we gather and analyze a metadata set of experiments on infinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma games. The experimental data show that cooperation is affected by infinite repetition and is more likely to arise when it can be supported in equilibrium. However, the fact that cooperation can be supported in equilibrium does not imply that most subjects will cooperate. High cooperation rates will emerge only when the parameters of the repeated game are such that cooperation is very robust to strategic uncertainty. We also review the results regarding the effect of imperfect monitoring, changing partners, and personal characteristics on cooperation and the strategies used to support it.","[Dal Bo, Pedro] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Dal Bo, Pedro] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Frechette, Guillaume R.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University,"Dal Bó, P (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Dal Bó, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,111,111,117,3,77,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

The index combines monetary and non-monetary indicators, updates deprivation cut-offs for certain traditional unsatisfied basic needs indicators and includes some new indicators, aiming to maximize regional comparability within the data constraints. The index is estimated for 17 countries of the region at two points in timeone around 2005 and the other around 2012. Overall, we estimate about 28 percent of people are multidimensionally poor in 2012 in the region. We find statistically significant reductions of poverty in most countries, both in terms of incidence and intensity over the period under analysis. However, important disparities between rural and urban areas remain. Statistical scrutiny of the index suggests that it captures the state of poverty relatively well while maintaining a certain parsimony and being highly robust to changes in weights, indicators, and poverty cut-off.","[Emma Santos, Maria; Villatoro, Pablo] Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Sur IIES, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Emma Santos, Maria; Villatoro, Pablo] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Caribe CEPAL, Santiago, Chile",,"Santos, ME (通讯作者)，UNS, CONICET, Dept Econ, Inst Invest Econ & Sociales Sur IIES, San Andres 800, RA-8000 Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Santos, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Argentinal Oxford Poverty & Human Dev Initiat, Oxford, England.",msantos@uns.edu.ar,"Santos, Maria Emma/ABA-1817-2021","Villatoro, Pablo/0009-0002-0491-2560","ANPCyT-PICT [2015-2079]; CONICET-PIP [11220150100659CO01]; ESRC [ES/I032827/1, ES/N01457X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N01457X/1, ES/I032827/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ANPCyT-PICT(ANPCyT); CONICET-PIP(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are deeply grateful to Xavier Mancero and Pascual Gerstenfeld for insightful comments and suggestions throughout this research.

We argue that, if occurring simultaneously, these transformations reduce overall uncertainty and thus improve health. Two concrete mechanisms are at work: first, people suffer less from stress related diseases, and second, they start investing more in their own health. To capture the proposed theoretical mechanisms, we use stress-caused mortality and private expenditures on health as our dependent variables. Empirically, we employ mediation analysis with country and time fixed effects. We find that, ceteris paribus, democratization and economic liberalization exert a cumulatively positive impact upon health. Our findings should be relevant to other countries that undergo politico-economic transitions.","[Kozlov, Vladimir A.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Demog Dept, 3 Bolshoi Tryokhsvyatitelskiy Pereulok,Off 402, Moscow, Russia; [Kozlov, Vladimir A.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Lab Social Demog Policy, 3 Bolshoi Tryokhsvyatitelskiy Pereulok,Off 402, Moscow, Russia; [Rosenberg, Dina Y.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Fac Social Sci, Sch Polit Sci, 20 Myasnitskaya St,Off 536, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Rosenberg, DY (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Fac Social Sci, Sch Polit Sci, 20 Myasnitskaya St,Off 536, Moscow, Russia.",vakozlov@hse.ru; dbalalaeva@hse.ru,"Kozlov, Vladimir A/J-6059-2015; Rosenberg, Dina/J-5638-2015","Rosenberg, Dina/0000-0002-5636-4167",Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) [T3-22],Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE),"This article is an output of research project T3-22, 2016, Demographic development in Russia in 2005-2015 in the context of long-term trends, implemented as part of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE).",,84,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

The Penrose square root rule (PSRR) is the main benchmark for 'fair representation' of all bottom-tier voters in the top-tier decision making body, but rests on the restrictive assumption of independent binary decisions. We consider intervals of alternatives with single-peaked preferences instead, and presume positive correlation of local voters. This calls for a replacement of the PSRR by a linear Shapley rule: representation is fair if the Shapley value of the delegates is proportional to their constituency sizes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals are heterogeneous in two dimensions: productive ability in the private sector and negotiating ability in politics. When these are positively correlated, rich voters always prefer a rich legislator, but poor voters face a trade-off. A rich legislator will secure more pork for the district, but will also prefer lower taxation than the poor voter. Our theory organizes a number of stylized facts across countries about taxation and redistribution, parties, and class representation in legislatures. We demonstrate that spending does not necessarily increase when the number of legislators increases, as the standard common-pool intuition suggests, and that many policies aimed at increasing descriptive representation may have the opposite effect.","[Mattozzi, Andrea] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy; [Mattozzi, Andrea] MOVE, Florence, Italy; [Snowberg, Erik] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Snowberg, Erik] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Snowberg, Erik] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Snowberg, Erik] CESifo, Washington, DC USA",European University Institute; University of British Columbia; California Institute of Technology; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Mattozzi, A (通讯作者)，European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy.;Mattozzi, A (通讯作者)，MOVE, Florence, Italy.",Andrea.Mattozzi@EUl.eu; snowberg@caltech.edu,"Mattozzi, Andrea/H-2939-2014; Mattozzi, Andrea/JWP-2586-2024",,NSF [SES-1156154],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Jonathan Chapman for excellent research assistance.

This study employs an enclave IV strategy, which exploits social distance between origin and destination locations, as well as conflict-induced migration, to estimate the impact that the arrival of displaced individuals has on the wages of local residents. I compare the effects on four different subgroups of the population, partitioned by skill (low skilled versus high-skilled) and by gender. The analysis suggests that a conflict-induced increase in population leads to a short-run negative impact on wages, but that subsequent out-migration from receiving municipalities helps to mitigate these effects. Though the impact tends to dissipate over time, it persists for low-skilled women, suggesting that this group is particularly vulnerable to the arrival of forced migrants.","[Morales, Juan S.] Coll Carlo Alberto, Piazza Arbarello 8, I-10122 Turin, TO, Italy",Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Morales, JS (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Piazza Arbarello 8, I-10122 Turin, TO, Italy.",juan.morales@carloalberto.org,"Morales, Juan S./AAB-5553-2022","Morales, Juan S./0000-0002-7397-6843",,,,,44,33,46,1,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Hence, an economy may fall into a poverty-environment trap that is characterized by low environmental quality, low life expectancy, and therefore, low per capita physical capital, while the others may converge to the opposite steady state. The competitive steady states differ from the first-best steady state in the benevolent social planner's viewpoint not only because of imperfect altruism between generations in the competitive economy, but also because individuals cannot internalize the effects of their savings (capital accumulation) and capital allocation on environmental quality through producing dirty intermediate inputs, whereas the social planner can. So we propose fiscal strategies towards social planner's steady state. These fiscal strategies, which are combination of traditional Pigouvian taxes and capital income tax implemented for transition phase are quite new compared to the existing related literature. Although we focus on the transition phase, the proposed taxes are stationary. They include: (i) a set of tax and subsidy imposed on the production of dirty and clean intermediate inputs to improve environmental quality, and therefore, life expectancy and capital accumulation, in order to guarantee that an economy that is locked in a poverty-environment trapcan escape such the stagnation; and (ii) a set of taxes (subsidies) imposed on the production of intermediate inputs and capital income in order to decentralize the transition to the first-best steady state as a competitive outcome.","[Nguyen Thang Dao] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Dao, NT (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.",daonguyen@mcc-berlin.net; edenhofer@pik-potsdam.de,"; Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Dao, Thang/0000-0002-6097-4881; Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208",,,,,32,15,15,1,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

The basic assumption of both the MNL model and the independent probit (IP) model is independence of utilities between alternatives, also referred to as IID assumption. Since the MNL model in addition exhibits the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property, it is often directly concluded that the IP model likewise exhibits the IIA property, thereby relating IID to IIA. However, this is not true considering Luce's definition of the IIA property. The objective of this paper is twofold: First, we clarify that IID does not imply IIA in the specific context of the IP model. Second, we work out the sources for the non-proportional shifting of the ratio of choice shares that distinguishes the IP model from the MNL model. Accordingly, we first theoretically review the true property of the IP model and subsequently illustrate with a conjoint example that the IP model does not exhibit the IIA property. In addition, we provide a case-by-case analysis to explain the non-proportional shifting of choice shares in the substitution pattern of the IP model and work out the principles for that non-proportional shifting mechanism.","[Paetz, Friederike] Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Julius Albert Str 6, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany; [Steiner, Winfried J.] Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Julius Albert Str 2, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany",TU Clausthal; TU Clausthal,"Paetz, F (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Management & Econ, Dept Management & Mkt, Julius Albert Str 6, D-38678 Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.",friederike.paetz@tu-clausthal.de; winfried.steiner@tu-clausthal.de,,,,,,,21,4,4,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Current macroeconomic research is not mindless DSGE modelling filled with ridiculous assumptions and oblivious of data. Rather, young macroeconomists are doing vibrant, varied, and exciting work, getting jobs, and being published. Macroeconomics informs economic policy only moderately, and not more than nor differently from other fields in economics. Monetary policy has benefitted significantly from this advice in keeping inflation under control and preventing a new Great Depression. Macroeconomic forecasts perform poorly in absolute terms and, given the size of the challenge, probably always will. But relative to the level of aggregation, the time horizon, and the amount of funding, macroeconomic forecasts are not so obviously worse than those in other fields. What is most wrong with macroeconomics today is perhaps that there is too little discussion of which models to teach and too little investment in graduate-level textbooks.","[Reis, Ricardo] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Reis, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",r.a.reis@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,36,38,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

This hierarchical model is contrasted with the alternatives of decentralized and centralized supervision, where only the local or the central supervisor collects information and decides on liquidation. The local supervisor has a higher bias against liquidation (supervisory capture) and a lower cost of getting local information (proximity). Hierarchical supervision is the optimal institutional design when the bias of the local supervisor is high but not too high and the costs of getting local information from the center are low but not too low.

Index Decomposition Analysis and Production Decomposition Analysis methods are combined to complete the decomposition analysis. Overall, seven factors are related to the decline in the energy intensity and technology improvement effect is the most significant factor. Technical efficiency effect is positively related to the decline in twelve provinces but negatively related in seventeen provinces. Capital-energy substitution effect is beneficial to the decline in twenty provinces. Labor-energy substitution effect undermines the decline and substitution effect among different categories of energy can be ignored. Considering provincial contribution, only Xinjiang Province has a negative contribution. Liaoning, Hebei and Shanghai provinces make the largest contributions to the decline in energy intensity. The main policy implications include enhancing investments in research and development in China's energy intensive industries; transforming the intensive development model of the energy intensive industries; gradually reforming energy price; and improving the layout of energy intensive industries.

Unfortunately, Israel's gender wage gap remains one of the highest among developed countries, despite a growing reverse gender gap in educational attainment. Investigating the gender wage gap for the Jewish majority and for the Arab minority, we find evidence of gender segregation by industry and occupations in addition to a glass ceiling effect for Jewish and Arab women. Using data from the Israeli Household Income Survey and electoral data from the Israeli parliamentary elections (2009), this paper provides novel evidence of the role of voter preferences in explaining the persistence of gender pay gaps. Importantly, we find strong evidence of an association between a higher share of votes allocated to nationalist parties, in a given locality, and a larger, (adjusted), gender wage gap for both Jewish-Israelis and Arab-Israelis.

The study is carried out over a panel dataset comprising 148 countries of which 40 Least developed countries (LDCs) and over the period 1980-2013 as well as the sub-period 1990-2013. The empirical results show that the sustainability of development aid on non-resource tax revenue depends on countries' level of economic development proxied by their real per capita income. In particular, for LDCs, we obtain that on average, half of the impact of development aid inflows is felt within a very short time-period, that is, two or three years depending on the period considered. This indicates that for these countries, the impact of aid on non-resource tax revenue is yet positive, but not really sustainable, i.e., persistent over time.

A parsimonious set of 24 physical geography attributes explains 47% of worldwide variation and 35% of within-country variation in lights. We divide geographic characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for agriculture and those primarily important for trade, and confront a puzzle. In examining within-country variation in lights, among countries that developed early, agricultural variables incrementally explain over 6 times as much variation in lights as do trade variables, while among late developing countries the ratio is only about 1.5, even though the latter group is far more dependent on agriculture. Correspondingly, the marginal effects of agricultural variables as a group on lights are larger in absolute value, and those for trade smaller, for early developers than for late developers. We show that this apparent puzzle is explained by persistence and the differential timing of technological shocks in the two sets of countries. For early developers, structural transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began when transport costs were still high, so cities were localized in agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these agglomerations persisted. In late-developing countries, transport costs fell before structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies, manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations. Consistent with this explanation, countries that developed earlier are more spatially equal in their distribution of education and economic activity than late developers.",,,,,"Storeygard, Adam/H-2633-2017",,World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program; Global Research Program on Spatial Development of Cities - Multi Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,World Bank's Knowledge for Change Program; Global Research Program on Spatial Development of Cities - Multi Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank; UK Department for International Development; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank Alex Drechsler, Joshua Herman, Andrew Jiang, Young Min Kim, Patrick Mayer, Kevin Proulx, Nicholas Reynolds, Sameer Sarkar, Yang Shen, and Sanjay Singh for excellent research assistance, and Treb Allen, Marcus Berliant, Will Masters, and seminar/conference participants at Berkeley, University of Copenhagen, George Mason, Iowa State University, ITAM, LSE, UCSB, UMass-Boston, Washington University, Williams, World Bank, University of Zurich, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia/NBER Conference on Macroeconomics Across Time and Space, the Brown University conference on Deep-Rooted Factors in Comparative Economic Development, and the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics conference on New Directions in Economic Geography for helpful comments and suggestions.

This empirical evidence is based on a world sample of 170 countries for the year 2010. The findings have significant implications for the fight against the Dutch disease. In essence, investing in human capital could bring economic diversity and therefore dampen negative external shocks related to resource-dependence.

To that aim we use an innovative computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that includes, in a multi-regional setting, foreign multinationals operating in monopolistic competition. The model is based on data that split the world economy in 2016 into 11 regions (China - US - EU27 - Great Britain-other advanced economies - India - Japan - South East Asia - Latin America - Middle East - Sub Saharan Africa) and 21 sectors. We provide quantitative evidence on several characteristics of the 21 sectors in China, EU27 and the US, as well as other data on the role of China in the global stage, including its evolution since 2004. Several scenarios focusing on the increase of FDI inflows in services, because of the reduction of its FDI barriers, are simulated deriving short and long run results. We find that the impact of more foreign multinationals in services is positive for China but smaller than the one that had been obtained in other previous studies on FDI in manufactures. This is due to the still limited role of services in the Chinese economy and to a crowding out effect that domestic firms experience after the entry of foreign multinationals. On the whole the impact is, however, slightly positive for China, because manufactures benefit from the entry of foreign services multinationals. The rest of regions are unaffected or benefit very slightly, due to the fact that services production is less export oriented and more devoted to private consumption than in the case of manufactures. However, their manufacturing sectors are slightly harmed by the stronger Chinese competition. Many of them manage to more than offset this latter trend through higher exports or FDI in services directed to China.","[Latorre, Maria C.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Yonezawa, Hidemichi] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Zhou, Jing] Xiangtan Univ, Xiangtan, Peoples R China",Complutense University of Madrid; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Xiangtan University,"Latorre, MC (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Estudios Estadist, Avda Puerta de Hierro S-N,Ciudad Univ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",mmunozla@ucm.es,"Latorre, Maria C./AFK-2004-2022; Yonezawa, Hidemichi/ADE-5543-2022; Latorre, Maria C./AAF-9316-2022","Latorre, Maria C./0000-0001-8741-1897; Latorre, Maria C./0000-0001-8741-1897; Zhou, Jing/0000-0002-3091-3826; Yonezawa, Hidemichi/0000-0002-9658-7226","Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2016-78422-R, ECO2013-41317-R]; Educational Commission of Hunan Province of China [16B267]; Chinese Social Funds [12CJL047]",Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Educational Commission of Hunan Province of China; Chinese Social Funds,"Maria C.

Our findings indicate that: (i) hierarchical meta-regression models are sufficiently versatile for addressing both selection bias and data dependence in observational data; (ii) innovation's effect on employment is positive but small and highly heterogeneous; (iii) only a small part of residual heterogeneity is explained by moderating factors; (iv) selection bias tends to reflect preference for upholding prevalent hypotheses on the employment effects of process and product innovations; (v) country-specific effect-size estimates are related to labour market and product market regulation in six OECD countries in a U-shaped fashion; and (vi) OLS estimates reflect upward bias whereas those based on time-differenced or within estimators reflect a downward bias.

The assessment methodology, as a first step, selects a set of indicators measuring specific aspects of tax policy. Subsequently, for each individual indicator, performance thresholds are calculated based on a benchmarking approach. Finally, a screening algorithm based on commonly accepted findings from the relevant economic literature is used to assess the overall performance of a country in two policy areas, namely the need for a tax shift and the scope for it. Various robustness checks are performed.","[Wohlbier, Florian; Astarita, Caterina; Mourre, Gilles] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, Brussels, Belgium; [Astarita, Caterina] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Mourre, Gilles] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",University of Naples Federico II; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Astarita, C (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate Gen Econ & Financial Affairs, Brussels, Belgium.",astarita@ec.europa.eu,"Astarita, Caterina/ABC-1808-2020","Astarita, Caterina/0000-0002-5713-9228",,,,,24,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

A consumer survey was implemented among a sample of 1464 consumers from the urban area of a developing European country. Our research reveals that customer-based perceptual corporate sustainability significantly and positively impacts customer loyalty in all investigated industries, with a stronger impact in retail banking services and a lower one in the case of personal care products. The research identifies those perceptual corporate sustainability dimensions which significantly impact customer loyalty and on which companies should focus within their marketing communication in order to increase customer loyalty. The paper brings relevant multi-sectorial insights, filling a regional knowledge gap, in the particular socio-cultural and economic context of a developing country, and thinking forward the general theoretical knowledge regarding the relationship between customer loyalty and perceptual corporate sustainability as complex constructs. Moreover, by using a quasi-exhaustive manner to conceptualise corporate sustainability, this paper complements previous research on the topic, in which corporate sustainability was constructed narrowly, within limited conceptual frameworks.","[Moisescu, Ovidiu-Ioan] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Moisescu, OI (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",ovidiu.moisescu@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Moisescu, Ovidiu I./C-1175-2013","Moisescu, Ovidiu I./0000-0003-0097-5660",Babes-Bolyai University through the 'Young Researchers Grants' ('Granturi pentru tinerii cercetatori') [31802/2016],Babes-Bolyai University through the 'Young Researchers Grants' ('Granturi pentru tinerii cercetatori'),This work was supported by the Babes-Bolyai University through the 'Young Researchers Grants' ('Granturi pentru tinerii cercetatori') [project number 31802/2016].,,70,33,35,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Nowadays global inequalities are very relevant, particularly a proletarization process based on an increase in class struggle, growing inequalities, unsustainability and the transnational concentration of power and wealth. The neoliberal approach ignores Marx's theory and suggests that the Marxian view fails to explain the current economic system. However, I believe this to be a (dishonest) simplification of Marx's theory (because data is very clear). This misrepresentation has a negative effect on the overall validity and sustainability of several European policies, mainly distribution and migration policies. Consequently, some policy recommendations need to be readdressed, including from a feminist point of view.","[Agustin Franco, J.] Univ Extremadura, Fac Business Finance & Tourism, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Caceres 10004, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura,"Franco, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Business Finance & Tourism, Dept Econ, Ave Univ 1, Caceres 10004, Spain.",franco@unex.es,"Martínez, J.

The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of perceived brand quality on credibility and attitudes towards this perceived quality from the point of view of users, as well as whether that relationship could trigger increased loyalty and recommendations. The survey was conducted with users of a public sports service located in Valencia, Spain, and the analysis of the data and the creation of the structural model was carried out using structural equation modeling (SEM). Its results have confirmed the influence of perceived quality on credibility but not on attitudes. On the other hand, the effects of credibility and attitudes on loyalty have been significant because of the influence of credibility on recommendations and attitudes. Conversely, attitudes have not had a direct influence on the word of mouth (WOM). This type of study, represent a novel contribution, because the studies of brand perception in sports services are practically non-existent, especially in the case of public sports services. In addition, the fact of using this type of methodology is in line with the most current works. Therefore, it supposes to contribute relevant information to the bibliography of this topic, and at the same time, it provides valuable information for managers, because if they have more information about how the variables are related and to what extent they do it, they will have more and better tools to be able to manage sports services more effectively and with less expenditure of resources, being able to plan more precisely the actions that they consider appropriate.","[Alguacil, Mario; Manuel Nunez-Pomar, Juan; Crespo-Hervas, Josep] Univ Valencia, FCAFE, Gasco Oliag 3, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Valantine, Irena; Staskeviciute-Butiene, Inga] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto St 6, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Perez-Campos, Carlos] Catholic Univ Valencia, Sacre Cor 5, Godella 46113, Spain",University of Valencia; Lithuanian Sports University; Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir,"Alguacil, M (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, FCAFE, Gasco Oliag 3, Valencia 46010, Spain.",aljima@alumni.uv.es; juan.m.nunez@uv.es; irena.valantine@lsu.lt; josep.crespo@uv.es; carlos.perez@ucv.es; inga.staskeviciute@lsu.it,"Nunez-Pomar, Juan Manuel/AAG-6454-2019; Butiene, Inga Staskeviciute/AAD-9184-2020; Alguacil, Mario/U-9064-2019; Valantine, Irena/AAD-3844-2020; N, Juan/GRX-8056-2022; Pérez-Campos, Carlos/GXF-9173-2022; Valantine, Irena/AAV-4873-2020; Crespo Hervas, Josep/I-5526-2016","Alguacil, Mario/0000-0002-4832-2290; N, Juan/0000-0002-9476-9392; Pérez-Campos, Carlos/0000-0002-8996-2411; Crespo Hervas, Josep/0000-0002-8509-0353",,,,,64,8,9,2,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We present evidence for the main industrial economies that suggests that inflation displays persistence which is of the same order of magnitude as the persistence of deviations of unemployment from its natural' rate. We provide a theoretical explanation of this fact based on a model of the dynamic interactions between central bankers and labour market insiders. The clash in the objectives of central bankers and labour market insiders is what causes both inflation and unemployment to display the same persistence in this model. The analysis suggests that inflation persistence could be addressed in a welfare-improving way, if central banks adopted monetary policy rules that targeted unanticipated changes in unemployment rates instead of deviations of unemployment from its natural' rate.","[Alogoskoufis, George] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Alogoskoufis, George] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece",Tufts University; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Alogoskoufis, G (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Medford, MA 02155 USA.;Alogoskoufis, G (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.",,"Alogoskoufis, George/HLP-6819-2023","Alogoskoufis, George/0000-0001-6196-6325",Athens University of Economics and Business,Athens University of Economics and Business,"The author would like to acknowledge the comments of two anonymous referees, Francesco Caselli and participants in the 2016 Annual Congress of the EEA in Geneva, and the AUEB Economics Research Workshop in Athens.

(1) While the de jure (KAOPEN) indicator of financial openness improves financial depth, the de facto (FDI) measurement decreases it, with the effect of the latter measure positive on financial size. (2) Whereas trade openness improves financial depth, its effect on financial activity and size is negative.

The results of the developed methodology are compared with classical present value analysis and intuitionistic present value analysis. The comparison results indicate that investment evaluation problem can be tackled by using the proposed methodology effectively.","[Aydin, Serhat] Natl Def Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Turkish Air Acad, TR-34149 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kahraman, Cengiz] Istanbul Tech Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Fac Management, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey; [Kabak, Mehmet] Gazi Univ, Ind Engn Dept, TR-06570 Ankara, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University; Gazi University,"Aydin, S (通讯作者)，Natl Def Univ, Ind Engn Dept, Turkish Air Acad, TR-34149 Istanbul, Turkey.",saydin3@hho.edu.tr; kahramanc@itu.edu.tr; mkabak@gazi.edu.tr,"Kabak, Mehmet/ABI-8118-2020; kahraman, cengiz/N-9259-2013","Kabak, Mehmet/0000-0002-8576-5349; kahraman, cengiz/0000-0001-6168-8185; AYDIN, SERHAT/0000-0003-0861-8297",,,,,36,9,9,5,22,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The contest yields the per-period relative influence over institutions, which partly spills over into the next period, by affecting relative conflict efficiency.

Our analysis is based upon the unified framework offered by Galor and Moav (2004) while the empirics account for cross-section dependence, parameter heterogeneity, and endogeneity, in nonstationary series. We conclude that changes in inequality do not influence growth, neither in the short run nor in the long run in the United States as a whole in the 1929-2013 period. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of overall income inequality measures. These findings provide support for the theoretical prediction of the unified theory of inequality and growth, according to which the growth effect of inequality becomes insignificant in the latest stages of economic development that the United States experiences during our period of investigation. Therefore, future policies aiming at moderating the concentration at the upper end of income distribution are not likely to have adverse growth consequences in developed countries such as the United States.","[Benos, Nikos] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Karagiannis, Stelios] European Commiss, DG JRC, Finance & Econ Unit, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",University of Ioannina; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Benos, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece.",nbenos@cc.uoi.gr; stelioskarayanis@hotmail.com,"Benos, Nikos/Z-5719-2019","Karagiannis, Stelios/0000-0002-7544-4330; Benos, Nikos/0000-0002-9361-8808",,,,,26,6,9,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

We present two main findings. First, transaction taxes are highly distortionary across a range of margins, causing large distortions to the price, volume, and timing of property transactions. Secondly, temporary transaction tax cuts are an enormously effective form of fiscal stimulus. A temporary elimination of a 1% transaction tax increased housing market activity by 20% in the short run (due to both timing and extensive responses) and less than half of the stimulus effect was reversed after the tax was reintroduced (due to re-timing). Because of the complementarities between moving house and consumer spending, these stimulus effects translate into extra spending per dollar of tax cut equal to about 1. We interpret our empirical findings in the context of a housing model with downpayment constraints in which leverage amplifies the effects of transaction taxes.","[Best, Michael Carlos] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Kleven, Henrik Jacobsen] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Columbia University; Princeton University,"Kleven, HJ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",h.j.kleven@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,45,75,83,6,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

National regulators typically care only for domestic welfare and they tend to push national firms in the common market. When information about production costs is held privately by firms and is unknown to the regulator, competition between national and foreign firms can help to reduce the information rents captured by national producers and thus increase efficiency. This is more likely when the production costs of national and foreign firms are highly correlated, for instance because firms use similar technologies. In other cases, market share rivalry pushes national regulators to inefficiently expand the production of national firms, also increasing the information rents. When the ex-ante uncertainty of the production costs is high, the creation of a common market is more likely to increase expected welfare, as compared to separated national markets.","[Biancini, Sara] Univ Caen Normandie, CREM, F-14000 Caen, France",Universite de Caen Normandie,"Biancini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Caen Normandie, CREM, F-14000 Caen, France.",sara.biancini@unicaen.fr,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This is why it is being increasingly explored as a source of new indicators of technology, economics and development. Web-based indicators can be made available on a real-time basis, unlike delayed official data releases. In this paper, we examine the viability of monitoring firm export orientation from automatically retrieved web variables. Our focus on exports is consistent with the role of internationalization in economic development. To evaluate our approach, we first checked to what extent web variables are capable of predicting firm export orientation. Once these new variables are validated, their automated retrieval is assessed by comparing the predictive performance of two nowcast models: one considering the manually retrieved web variables, the other considering the automatically retrieved ones. Our results evidence that i) web-based variables are good predictors for firm export orientation, and ii) the process of extracting and analyzing such variables can be entirely automated with no significant loss of performance. This way, it is possible to nowcast not only the export orientation of a firm, but also of an economic sector or of a region.","[Blazquez, Desamparados; Domenech, Josep] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Cami de Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Blazquez, D (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Cami de Vera S-N, E-46022 Valencia, Spain.",mdeblzso@ade.upv.es,"Domenech, Josep/I-3666-2012; Blazquez, Desamparados/AAA-4860-2019","Domenech, Josep/0000-0002-7302-5810; Blazquez, Desamparados/0000-0002-5203-6369",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [TIN2013-43913-R]; Spanish Ministry of Education [FPU14/02386],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),"This work has been partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under grant TIN2013-43913-R, and the Spanish Ministry of Education under grant FPU14/02386.",,64,18,19,2,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

FCMs have been shown to be particularly useful for handling complex decision problems characterized by lack of information or unavailable data. They constitute a methodological framework that allows for a reduction of omitted determinants - in this case, with regard to sustainable banking - and are typically able to provide a greater understanding of the cause-and-effect relationships between such determinants.

To this end, in this paper we aim to measure the effects of external macroeconomic shocks on business cycles of Central and Eastern European Countries, not yet Euro-area members. Using quarterly data from 1999 to 2015 and the structural near-VAR methodology, we focus on the effects of Euro-area monetary policy and global oil price shocks on prices and output of the analyzed countries. Results show that business cycle fluctuations are mainly explained by domestic shocks in the short run, while monetary policy and oil price shocks play an increasing role in the medium run.

Equilibrium analysis and numerical examples suggest that when resource similarity is high and resource complementarity is low, the acquirer should choose a high integration degree to improve the number of innovation collaborations and increase technology innovation. When resource similarity is low and complementarity is high, the acquirer should choose a low integration degree. When resource similarity and complementarity are both high, the acquirer should choose a medium integration degree. We run quantile regressions using samples of cross-border mergers and acquisitions proposed by acquirers from China, Japan and the United States in the period of 2000-2013. The dynamic game and quantile regressions altogether provide new insight and empirical evidence for understanding post-merger integration's effect on technology innovation under different resource backgrounds.

Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the World Input-Output Database to examine and compare the competitiveness of service industry between Taiwan and South Korea in China from 1995 to 2011. The author measures the value added of export in two ways: value added in trade (VAiT) and trade in value added (TiVA). Findings The proportion of domestic (intermediate and final demand) VAiT was created by Taiwanese and South Korean exports to China. The services amount share of value added embodied in Taiwanese electrical and optical equipment (ELE) exports to China increased gradually (38.0-45.7 percent) from 1996 to 2011, that was more than that of South Korea (26.7-23.3 percent). Taiwanese financial and business (F&B) service contributed to Taiwanese ELE production exported to China. In service sectors, the proportion of VAiT of Taiwanese F&B service embodied in ELE exports to China increased annually (9.8-11.5 percent), that was similar to that of South Korea (12.2-11.3 percent). Thus, F&B sector played an increasingly important role in service sectors. Taiwanese F&B promotes the ELE export to China with higher efficiency than South Korea does. Originality/value Over the past two decades, the development of information technology and the growth of international specialization and fragmentation of production processes have brought about a global value chains (GVCs) phenomenon in services, which has already been taking place in manufacturing for a long time. Intangible value added of services increasingly involved intermediate inputs from manufacturing and were indirectly embodied in intermediate and finished goods exported to the global market. The focus of this paper is to analyze how the service industry participates in the development of the GVC, with emphasis on the export of ELE production to China in the bilateral trade of Taiwan and Korea with China. In addition to the value-added components, the exports of F&B intermediate products to China have been increasing year by year, and Taiwanese is higher than South Korean. In the bilateral trade between Taiwan or Korea and China, for ELE production exported to China, double counted part of intermediate products is increasing year by year. In terms of the value added of the double counting of F&B exports to China, Taiwan is higher (PDC, 31.23-17.26 percent) than South Korea. (PDC, 8.7-15.12 percent). South Korea and China are not as closely related as Taiwan and China.","[Chen, Min Hui] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Business, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Chen, MH (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Coll Business, Taoyuan, Taiwan.",cmhloveoys@gmail.com,,,,,,,25,2,3,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Galbraith always took into account phenomena of power in economics, and shed light on the power of economists in particular. I then show how the reaction of conservatives to the broadcasting of the Age of Uncertainty highlights the relevance of Galbraith's theory. Letters exchanged by conservative Lords in an effort to fight against Galbraith's ideas paradoxically illustrate his theory. This leads to questions about the status of economists, popularizers, and experts. Finally, I argue that convictions have a crucial role in scientific production, and that Robert Solow's distinction between the 'serious scholars' and the proselyte economist is irrelevant because of its incapacity to understand how economists produce knowledge.","[Chirat, Alexandre] Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, Lyon, France",Universite Lyon 2,"Chirat, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, Lyon, France.",,,"CHIRAT, alexandre/0000-0001-6172-8829",,,,,90,3,3,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We quantify volatility spillovers by means of an unconditional analysis performed using the entire sample, and a conditional analysis which estimates the model using a rolling window. As our database contains the global financial crisis (GFC), we are able to determine how volatility spillovers spread in the economy during the recent market turmoil. Our unconditional results confirm that the Financials sector was a main contributor to the overall market volatility along with the Consumer Goods, Consumer Services and Basic Materials sectors. The conditional analysis clearly identifies that the Financials was the major feeding sector of volatility spill-over effects, and that the market volatility was successively driven by Technology and Basic Materials over a rather short period of time, followed by Consumer Goods and Consumer Services over a prolonged period of time. Our results illustrate indirect linkages between the sectors that conveyed shocks during the GFC.","[Da Fonseca, Jose] Auckland Univ Technol, Business Sch, Dept Finance, Auckland, New Zealand; [Da Fonseca, Jose] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, PRISM Sorbonne EA 4101, Paris, France; [Ignatieva, Katja] UNSW Australia, Business Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Auckland University of Technology; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Ignatieva, K (通讯作者)，UNSW Australia, Business Sch Risk & Actuarial Studies, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",k.ignatieva@unsw.edu.au,"Da Fonseca, Jose/Q-8299-2019; Ignatieva, Katja/W-8813-2019","Da Fonseca, Jose/0000-0002-6882-4511; Ignatieva, Katja/0000-0001-7472-5475",,,,,31,11,11,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical analysis focuses on two of the main ways in which NTs could contribute to improve labour productivity: through the externalities coming from expenditure on research and development, and employment in NTs-intensive sectors.

The relationship between energy and economic growth is an important indicator for the direction of economic policies. In this context, this paper aims at examining the relationship between total energy consumption and economic growth in the E7 countries (Brazil, China, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey) by using data for the 1990-2016 period. The results of the cointegration analysis with structural breaks suggest that the series move together in the long term.

In this article, we revisit this hypothesis by investigating how different speculative measures affect our conclusion on the role of speculation. Four speculative measures are considered, including index trading activities, non-commercial net long positions, Working's speculative index, and an excessive speculative volume index. These four measures imply different underlying hypotheses about the role of speculation on commodity price movements and encompass most of the measures used in the recent literature on the role of speculation in commodity markets. Using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model, we show a mixed impact of speculative trading on corn prices depending on the measure used. While shocks to index trading activities and excess speculation as measured by Working's T have either zero or negative impact on corn prices, a positive shock to non-commercial net positions or the Tadesse index significantly increases the price of corn. However, the magnitude of the impact is not large, at most about $0.30 per bushel in real terms. Our findings are robust to structural breaks, alternative ordering of variables, and an alternative specification of the model.","[Etienne, Xiaoli L.] West Virginia Univ, Div Resource Econ & Management, 333 Evansdale Dr, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Irwin, Scott H.; Garcia, Philip] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",West Virginia University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Etienne, XL (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Div Resource Econ & Management, 333 Evansdale Dr, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",xletienne@mail.wvu.edu,"Etienne, Xiaoli/GQB-5494-2022; Irwin, Scott H./AAN-1996-2020; Irwin, Scott H./CAA-2702-2022","Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Irwin, Scott H./0000-0003-4556-0848; Etienne, Xiaoli/0000-0003-4519-9028",,,,,62,16,17,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, the identification of the marginal effect requires a measure of at least one component of risk that cannot be diversified or avoided. Moreover, measures of uninsurable wage risk must vary over time to eliminate unobserved heterogeneity. Secondly, evaluating the economic significance of risk requires knowledge of the size of all the wage risk actually faced. Existing estimates are problematic because measures of wage risk fail to satisfy the 'non-avoidability' requirement. This creates a downward bias, which is at the root of the small estimated effect of wage risk on portfolio choices. To tackle this problem we match panel data of workers and firms and use the variability in the profitability of the firm that is passed over to workers to obtain a measure of uninsurable risk. Using this measure to instrument total variability in individual earnings, we find that the marginal effect of uninsurable wage risk is much larger than estimates that ignore endogeneity. We bound the economic impact of risk and find that its overall effect is contained, not because its marginal effect is small but because its size is small. And the size of uninsurable wage risk is small because firms provide substantial wage insurance.","[Fagereng, Andreas] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Guiso, Luigi] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Pistaferri, Luigi] Stanford Univ, NBER, Stanford, CA USA; [Fagereng, Andreas] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Guiso, Luigi] EIEF, Rome, Italy; [Pistaferri, Luigi] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Pistaferri, Luigi] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Pistaferri, Luigi] CEPR, Washington, DC USA; [Pistaferri, Luigi] SIEPR, Stanford, CA USA",Statistics Norway; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Statistics Norway; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Fagereng, A (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",,,"Fagereng, Andreas/0000-0002-0427-9737",Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway) [230843]; Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway) [230843],Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway)(Research Council of Norway); Finansmarkedsfondet (The Research Council of Norway)(Research Council of Norway),"We thank Sumit Agarwal, Adne Cappelen, Francis Vella, the editor, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

The extent of inefficient college entry also depends on the distribution of myopic workers in the population, and inefficiencies can arise even if not all workers are myopic. We extend the model to study the impact of the dropout rate and heterogeneous expectations as well the dynamic implications of inefficient college entry.","[Fedaseyeu, Viktar] Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Fedaseyeu, Viktar] IGIER, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Strohush, Vitaliy] Elon Univ, Dept Econ, 2075 Campus Box, Elon, NC 27244 USA",Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Elon University,"Fedaseyeu, V (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Finance, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.;Fedaseyeu, V (通讯作者)，IGIER, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",fedaseyeu@unibocconi.it; vstrohush@elon.edu,,"FEDASEYEU, VIKTAR/0000-0002-2743-9043",,,,,27,0,0,1,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-6108,1935-1682,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Experimental evidence,GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR,,,English,Article,,,,,,Inequality; Money burning; Fairness; Procedural concerns,SOCIAL PREFERENCES; RISK-TAKING; FAIRNESS; PUNISHMENT; RECIPROCITY; INCENTIVES; INNOVATION; EQUALITY; AVERSION; DEMAND,"Increasing inequality is commonly associated with social unrest and conflict between social classes. This paper reports the results of a laboratory experiment to study the implications of greater inequality on the tendency to burn others' income. The experiment considers an environment where higher earnings in a real-effort task are typically associated with higher effort and varies how fair and transparent this relationship is. The findings indicate that greater inequality does not lead to more money burning itself. Rather, it depends on whether the increase in inequality can be unequivocally attributed to exerted effort, i.e., the fairness of the income-generating process. Only if greater inequality can be the result of morally questionable activities, subjects engage in substantially more money burning. While most income burning aims at reducing inequality, the fairness of inequality only plays a role in the extent of money burning but not so much for the qualitative burning patterns.

Our aim is to explain the observed change in firms' innovativeness after receiving EU support for technological investment. To do so, we take an approach that is novel in innovation studies: a Bayesian Network Analysis to assess the effectiveness of EU policy instrument for technological innovation and to determine the mechanisms by which the policy works within firms. Our data draw from a unique survey of 200 Polish firms that received Technological Credit during the 2007-2013 programming period. First, we confirm the short-term positive impact of the EU innovation policy (i.e. a wider range of products/services offered, increased sales and exports). More importantly, we determine the causal chain between economically quantifiable outcomes and behavioural change in the firm, which is an important node in the network of effects generated. We find that only the financially sounder and more internationalised firms managed to take advantage of the policy. These findings suggest that programmes based on technological credits are not well suited to foster innovation in more fragile and domestically oriented SMEs, which may require different policy instruments.","[Florio, Massimo] Univ Milan, Milan, Italy; [Parteka, Aleksandra] Gdansk Univ Technol, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Sirtori, Emanuela] Ctr Ind Studies, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Parteka, A (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",aparteka@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Parteka, Aleksandra/AAN-5881-2020","Parteka, Aleksandra/0000-0003-1149-6614; Sirtori, Emanuela/0000-0002-9318-3453","European Commission, Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy; National Science Centre, Poland [DEC-2015/19/B/HS4/02884]; [2014CE16BAT002]","European Commission, Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy; National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland);","This paper is based on the results of the Ex post evaluation of Cohesion Policy programmes 2007-2013, focusing on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF).

I build an open economy general equilibrium model that features a low-skill-intensive nontradable sector.

Accordingly, there is a need to understand fully the factors that influence quality and price of pearls - and threats to future sustainability. Focus, thus far, has been on production practices that affect pearl characteristics and quality. Although there is a generally accepted hierarchy in the characteristics of black pearls that determine quality and price, the contributory value of specific characteristics and their interdependence has not been assessed. We used information from two retailers that supply distinct markets to estimate the implicit value of black pearl characteristics, i.e. grade, shape and size. Calculated premiums and discounts revealed key similarities between retailers including that a more preferred shape demanded larger premiums than an improved grade. Results of this analysis will help direct research aimed at modifying production methods to increase the yield of higher value pearls. This is especially important given that climate change will, in fact, affect many environmental parameters that influence pearl quality. If ignored, such changes have the potential to negatively impact the quality of produced pearls with profound socio-economic consequences.","[Hilsenroth, Jana; Frazer, Thomas K.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Larkin, Sherry L.] Univ Florida, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Hilsenroth, J (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",jana.hilsenroth@ufl.edu,,"Hilsenroth, Jana/0000-0002-2898-4086; Larkin, Sherry/0000-0002-8850-0856",National Science Foundation [OCE-1130359],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation under [Grant OCE-1130359] and is a contribution from UC Berkley's Richard B.
