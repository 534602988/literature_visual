In contrast, program-eligible students in more recent cohorts (2007-2010), when the program supplemented grant-heavy aid with an array of nonfinancial supports, were more likely to meet credit accumulation benchmarks toward timely graduation and earned higher grade point averages than their barely ineligible counterparts.","[Clotfelter, Charles T.; Ladd, Helen F.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27088 USA; [Hemelt, Steven W.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Publ Policy, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",Duke University; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Clotfelter, CT (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27088 USA.",charles.clotfelter@duke.edu; hemelt@email.unc.edu; helen.ladd@duke.edu,,,National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER); Gates Foundation,National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER); Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"The research reported here was supported by the National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research (CALDER) and the Gates Foundation.

We discuss why anthropomorphic analogies are not helpful for understanding firm aging, because of differences in population pyramid shapes (with around 50 % of firms exiting after just 3 years), no upper bound on firm ages, and no deterministic change in performance with firm age. We discuss the liabilities of newness, adolescence, and senescence and obsolescence, and define what we mean by the direct and indirect causal effects of age. Our causal model also helps clarify previous confusion about why controlling for size in regressions of firm age on survival can reverse the results (Simpson's paradox and the 'bad control' problem). While aging processes can occur at many levels (employee-level, firm-level, cohort-level, etc.), we focus on the firm-level. We summarize empirical work on firm age and conclude that the most interesting age effects occur within the first 5-7 years, which underscores the importance of datasets that do not under-represent young firms.","[Coad, Alex] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton BN19SL, E Sussex, England; [Coad, Alex] European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain",University of Sussex; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Coad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton BN19SL, E Sussex, England.;Coad, A (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC IPTS, Seville 41092, Spain.",Alexander.Coad@ec.europa.eu,"Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528",,,,,145,85,89,1,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

The theoretical/analytical framework for this article derives from the developmental hypotheses of Veblen, Gerschenkron, Innis, Abramovitz, Amsden, and Chang. All addressed, in their related but varied approaches, the catching-up problematique-with Veblen and Abramovitz analyzing falling-behind. In Latin America-the theoretical formulations regarding catching-up have had minimal explanatory power, for reasons explored in the text. Pioneering institutionalists, modern revisionist institutionalists (e.g., Amsden) and the Latin American Structuralists (e.g., Furtado and Prebisch) often converged regarding their confidence in the efficacy of rational, operative, developmentalist policies and programs. However, only those drawing from the work of Veblen-including Innis with his analysis of the staples trap-seriously considered the falling-behind hypothesis. During the latest commodity boom, Latin America's elite failed to exploit favorable circumstances to diversify from low-value added, volatile, commodity production due to pre-Import Substitution (i.e., nineteenth century) institutional legacies. Endogenous industrialization was fragile, while the agro-mineral-financial export elite was persistent.","[Cypher, James M.] Univ Autortoma Zacatecas, Econ, Doctoral Program Dev Studies, Zacatecas, Mexico",,"Cypher, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Autortoma Zacatecas, Econ, Doctoral Program Dev Studies, Zacatecas, Mexico.",,,,,,,,88,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Commons understood, the role of the firm in providing employment and income distribution is a form of public power (Munkirs and Knoedler 1987). This public power of firms is supported by the laws of the state, which protect private property and enforce market transactions. The Global Production Network (GPN) is a new form of the firm, influenced by information technology to lower transaction costs (Coase 1937), as well as international trade regimes, such as the Washington Consensus to improve the ease of world trade and investment. The GPN is globe-scanning, yet private and able to shape the economies and policies of countries. Under the banner of branded products, the lead firm in a supply chain exercises considerable power over subsidiaries, contractors, workers, communities, and countries. By influencing trade relations, GPNs also influence international finance, foreign currency reserves and exchange rates, as well as trade deficits and race to the bottom of taxes and environmental protection. Drawing on interdisciplinary research, this topic benefits from an alliance of sociology, business, history, law, and international as well as institutional economics in the AFEE tradition. I draw on the work of leading scholars in the field (Antras 2016; Baldwin 2016; Gereffi 2013; Milberg and Winkler 2013) and analyze the implications for the world trade system, as well as the ongoing political resistance to globalization.

Conventional linear models of the relationship between wages and unemployment, the so-called wage Phillips curve (WPC), and previous models of the WPC that rely on regime-switching driven only by changes in unemployment, provide a poor fit in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Meanwhile, standard linear theoretical general equilibrium models are based on an assumption that economic agents take into account nominal wages relative to prices when making labor decisions, suggesting that there is a role for inflation in determining the empirical dynamics of the WPC. We employ a nonlinear empirical model to study how the relationship between U.S. wage growth and unemployment changes over the business cycle. In particular, we estimate a threshold vector autoregression with multiple threshold variables and multiple threshold parameters for each threshold variable for the 1965-2015 period. We find that the WPC changes according to the dynamics of both unemployment and inflation. Specifically, it changes as the unemployment rate transitions above or below the two estimated thresholds, defined by 5.03% and 7.77%. Simultaneously, it also evolves depending on whether inflation is above or below 0.38% relative to trend. The results show a strong negative relationship between wage growth and unemployment during periods of expansion when inflation is above its long-run trend. The relationship weakens, although remains negative, during periods of expansions with low inflation and during mild recessions. Our results indicate that the negligible wage growth observed during 2013-2015 was driven not only by labor market slack, as suggested by previous studies, but also by the low inflation environment.","[Donayre, Luiggi] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Panovska, Irina] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Taylor St,Rauch Business Ctr Room 457, Bethlehem, PA 18105 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; Lehigh University,"Donayre, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, 1318 Kirby Dr, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",adonayre@d.umn.edu; irp213@lehigh.edu,,"Panovska, Irina/0000-0002-6297-3452",,,,,59,10,11,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The quality of communication depends on the conflict of interests between the government levels and on which government level controls the degree of decentralization. We show that the extent of misaligned interests and the relative importance of local and central government knowledge affect the optimal choice of policy-decision schemes.

Mergers may improve innovation incentives by promoting economies of scope and scale, R&D activities, and increasing the ability to deal with uncertainties. However, mergers may also discourage innovation by reducing competition, increasing costs, and decreasing production and R&D efficiencies. In this study, we investigate merger impacts on innovation using a panel data consisting of four different data sets on publicly traded US manufacturing firms from 1980 to 2003. Our proxy for innovation is based on citation-weighted patent stocks. In our estimation model, we control for endogeneity using instrumental variables and factors such as market share, size, industry, and time. We find that mergers are positively and significantly correlated with firms' innovation. Our findings also indicate that merger effect on innovation is heterogeneous across industries, increases with market share, and is greater in the long run.

As an alternative, real-options theory allows decision makers to use the concepts of uncertainty and managerial flexibility, which classical methods do not deal with, in valuing investment projects. Carlsson and Fuller's fuzzy real-options theory has been a solution for situations where cash flow and cost variables used in the model cannot be expressed by using classical numbers but by using fuzzy numbers. The idea of using intuitionistic fuzzy numbers in real options theory can expand the narrow scope more effectively than the idea of using classical real-options theory, thereby providing an opportunity to evaluate investment projects from a wider perspective. In this study, intuitionistic fuzzy real-option valuation model has been developed and applied to the evaluation of solar energy investment projects. Studies have shown that solar energy investments that do not seem profitable today in Turkey can perform profitably in the future.

By comparing these factors simultaneously, one is able to consider if there are some factors that correlate with players' draft positions, but fail to correlate with on-court performance. For example, the results reveal that a player's college turnover rate does not predict his draft position or his playing time in the NBA despite evidence that turnover-prone college players are less effective in the NBA. These results can be used to improve draft-day decisions for NBA executives.","[Evans, Brent A.] Georgia Coll & State Univ, Finance & Econ Dept, 402 Atkinson Hall, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia College & State University,"Evans, BA (通讯作者)，Georgia Coll & State Univ, Finance & Econ Dept, 402 Atkinson Hall, Milledgeville, GA 31061 USA.",brent.evans@gcsu.edu,,,,,,,3,5,6,3,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This segmentation might affect term structure estimation, introducing distortions in longer maturity yields, especially in parametric models. In order to deal with such segmentation, we propose a new model that combines the flexibility of spline functions with the parsimoniousness of a parametric four-factor exponential model. The short end of the yield curve is fitted using a B-spline function, while longer segments are captured by the parametric model. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed model for pricing and risk management purposes, using two examples: the real yield curve in the Brazilian government index-linked bond market, and the US Treasury nominal yield curve. We show that, in both markets, our model is simultaneously able to fit the yield curve well and to provide unbiased Value at Risk estimates for all tested portfolios of bonds, outperforming an important parametric benchmark model frequently adopted by central banks.

So far, most studies have focused on developed countries and few on developing countries. Methods: We consider worker's characteristics, employers, and regional heterogeneity of labor markets to estimate wage equations with mixed effects. As an alternative method, we also estimate wage differentials using matching techniques. Results: The evidence, with 2006 and 2014 data, is favorable to the hypothesis. The most modest estimates indicate a premium between 17 and 19% for the most intensive users. Conclusions: Acceptance means that the computer is part of technological change that increases productivity, which encourages employers to pay a premium to skilled workers. It indicates to the country the importance of reducing the digital divide in both skilled workers and companies that adopt the technology.","[Felix-Verduzco, Gustavo] Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Ctr Invest Socioecon CISE, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico; [Torres Garcia, Aldo Josafat] Univ Autonoma Chihuahua, Fac Econ Int, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila,"Félix-Verduzco, G (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Ctr Invest Socioecon CISE, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico.",gustavo.felix@uadec.edu.mx; ajtorres@uach.mx,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Due to the limitations of the income per capita approach, this paper focuses in general and sectorial productivity per hour convergence. Evidence of convergence is not found at a general level, while the sectorial picture is mixed. Some branches of services suggests convergence but industrial branches points to strong divergence. Within the neoclassical framework, convergence is an expected phenomena, but empirical evidence shows variability in its success. In fact, there is not a general process of productivity convergence among original members of the Eurozone. Hence, some key conclusions are presented in order to develop a more accurate theoretical background.","[Garcia-Duch, Miguel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Garcia-Duch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",miguel.garcia.duch@ucm.es,"GARCIA DUCH, MIGUEL/JJE-6528-2023","GARCIA DUCH, MIGUEL/0009-0004-9438-1242",,,,,27,1,1,0,1,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

A data-driven approach, namely the directed acyclic graph (DAG), is first employed to disclose the contemporaneous relations among natural gas, crude oil and various factors. The main results indicate that there is a stable contemporaneous causal flow from crude oil to natural gas. Unlike most of the previous research, we found a longterm equilibrium relationship between crude oil and natural gas returns when additional factors were taken into account. However, the impact of oil price returns on natural gas price volatility has decreased after the 2008 global financial crisis.

This method allows us to consider both North African and Sub-Saharan African stock markets, and provides a flexible parsimonious specification. The results reveal varying reactions of the impulse response functions. The most exposed African stock markets are those of Egypt, South Africa and Mauritius, while the least affected stock market is, surprisingly, that of Ivory Coast. Our analysis shows that, in addition to direct transmission, several macroeconomic and market channels, such as commodities, exports, and exchange rates, are relevant. Specifically, countries with strong commercial links to European countries will be most impacted by the crisis. The severity of transmission also depends on the country's dependence on commodities.","[Kablan, Sandrine] Univ East Paris Creteil, ERUDITE, 61 Ave Gnl de Gaulle, F-94000 Creteil, France; [Kaabia, Olfa] INSEEC Business Sch, INSEEC Lab, Paris, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Groupe Inseec,"Kablan, S (通讯作者)，Univ East Paris Creteil, ERUDITE, 61 Ave Gnl de Gaulle, F-94000 Creteil, France.",sandrine.kablan@u-pec.fr,,,,,,,59,5,5,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Often, however, the timing and structure of reform are unknown. We explicitly model policy uncertainty in a general equilibrium life-cycle model and let agents update expectations and react as uncertainty is resolved over time. Using the case of Japan, a country facing severe demographic and fiscal challenges, we quantify welfare tradeoff across generations by delaying reform or reducing its scope. Individuals respond to a delay by dis-saving and working less, while facing higher taxes to cover additional expenditures during the transition. Fiscal uncertainty itself has a more significant adverse effect on older individuals, who face greater income risks and a lower return on their retirement savings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This new type of urban area has been termed the aerotropolis or airport metropolis and is meant to function as an economic center with land-use that link local and global markets. However, to find the optimal means for developing an aerotropolis requires additional research, particularly from the viewpoint of long-term public policy and planning. In this study, a multiple criteria decision making model was applied to explore the key factors for successfully building an aerotropolis. We first applied the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory based Analytical Network Process to construct the complex system and influential weights. A modified VIKOR method was then utilized to explore the gaps between the aspiration levels and the current situation. In addition, considering the uncertainty of decision-makers, fuzzy theory was integrated into the model. Data from the Taoyuan Aerotropolis in Taiwan were used to demonstrate this method. The results indicate that internationalization is the most crucial factor within the system, and that administrative efficiency has the highest degree of net influence. The largest weighted gap to the examined aspiration level is adequate regulation. Management implications are provided in the discussion.","[Liou, James J.

Examining the approach to land reform embodied by technocrats such as Liu Shaoqi in China and Wada Hiroo in Japan in addition to the implementation mechanisms of the policies they adopted, we show that the land reforms developed characteristics of dynamic factor endowment according to the Engerman-Sokoloff hypothesis. Fairly equal land redistribution led to political power equality and improved agricultural productivity and income equality, which is conducive to long-term economic development and the prevention of the Kuznets effect ex ante. Nevertheless, factors such as initial exogenous shocks, insufficient scale of family farming, persistent government support and consequential interest groups obstruct sustainable development of the agricultural sector as well as the generalization of East Asian experiences. Equality or inequality is essentially a policy choice in addition to being a long-term ex post evaluation of the reforms.","[Liu, Qunyi] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Liu, QY (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,29,0,0,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Consequently, we establish that financing sources affect bidding strategies of acquiring companies in case of difficult-to-value targets.","[Mataigne, Virginie; De Maeseneire, Wouter; Luypaert, Mathieu] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [De Maeseneire, Wouter] Erasmus Univ, Vlerick Business Sch, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Luypaert, Mathieu] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Vlerick Business Sch, Leuven, Belgium",Ghent University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; KU Leuven; Vlerick Business School,"Mataigne, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.",virginie.mataigne@ugent.be,"Luypaert, Mathieu/JEZ-4461-2023","Luypaert, Mathieu/0000-0002-7213-8637",,,,,15,0,0,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

J,"McCalman, P",,,,"McCalman, Phillip",,,"International trade, income distribution and welfare",JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intra-industry trade; Monopolistic competition; Inequality,PRICE-DISCRIMINATION; QUALITY; MARKET; MONOPOLY,"This paper studies the relationship between income distribution and international integration in a canonical trade setting with one change. In the standard model prices are solely a function of (constant) marginal costs and (constant) elasticities, implying that information on individual incomes are of no value to a firm. To allow a more realistic role for consumer level information, a firm's strategy space is expanded to include non-linear prices. Now profit maximizing firms use information on income distribution to design a product for each income class and set prices to induce each group to optimally select the appropriate option. Equilibrium involves designs below the first best for low income groups and above the first best for high income groups welfare differences are more exaggerated than income differences. When countries with differing income distributions integrate this has implications for the size of these distortions, influencing the gains from trade both within and across countries. These implications are quantified and shown to be potentially significant factors affecting welfare outcomes from integration with the consequences more pronounced at lower trade costs. The structure of trade and expenditure patterns that emerge also match a range of empirical findings. These results are driven by firm strategy based on income difference alone as preferences are assumed to be identical and homothetic across countries, placing the distribution of income at the center of the analysis.

However, lack of direct measures of the VERSs' deployment of these devices has impeded efforts to test the hypothesized effects of S&S and SSP on terrorism. This article exploits the relationship between exogenous variation in the marginal productivities of S&S and SSP as inputs in the production of commitment and variation in VERSs' employment of these inputs to identify proxies for S&S and SSP. Using data from 158 countries, our cross-sectional estimates of the effects of S&S and SSP on the impact of terrorism are significant and larger than the effects of geographic and political variables that are consistently reported to be both significant and substantial.","[Morales, Kendrick] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Raynold, Prosper; Li, Jing] Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University System of Ohio; Miami University,"Raynold, P (通讯作者)，Miami Univ, Dept Econ, Oxford, OH 45056 USA.",raynolp@miamioh.edu,,,,,,,24,0,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The theoretical analysis has revealed a positive relationship between a successful implementation of competition policy and the country's economic development. The article reviews the situation related to the implementation of competition policy in countries with developing/emerging culture of competition - Lithuania and Latvia. Quantitative research has shown that competition policy in countries with a developing/emerging culture of competition is mostly manifested through the same areas as in countries with a developed competition culture: the areas of innovation, investment, international trade and human resources. Qualitative research has shown that there is a positive tendency within countries with a developing/emerging culture of competition that more and more economic entities are ready to compete fairly, and the competition itself is considered as a value. In addition, while the deterrence from violations of competition law in countries with a developing/emerging competition culture is lower than in countries with a developed competition culture, the impact of an effective competition policy on the reduction of and deterrence from the intentions to violate competition is apparent.","[Pekarskiene, Irena; Bruneckiene, Jurgita; Daugeliene, Rasa; Peleckiene, Lina] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Pekarskiene, I (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",irena.pekarskiene@ktu.lt; jurgita.bruneckiene@ktu.lt; rasa.daugeliene@ktu.lt; peleckiene.lina@gmail.com,"Bruneckiene, Jurgita/AAE-4948-2020","Bruneckiene, Jurgita/0000-0002-8281-1813; Daugeliene, Rasa/0000-0002-5232-7270",,,,,59,1,1,2,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The purpose of the study is to identify the scope, the place of enterprise boundaries' occurrence and their nature in situations when alternative solutions are applied with reference to employment. It was accompanied by specifying the nature of psychological contract. Design/methodology/approach - Case study methodology was applied. Findings - The empirical research confirmed that formal boundaries are different from the real ones related to the functioning of people employed in a particular entity, performing work for the benefit of this entity and being subject to the processes of HRM. Objective boundaries are not the same as the subjective ones referring to the perception of boundaries and the attachment identified by the providers of contacted tasks. The majority of the analysed psychological contracts were of a temporary nature. Originality/value - The notion of a particular conceptual framework (recognized and shared in the scientific environment) allows for the comparison of research results and the development of theories. The methodology for analysing organizational boundaries in human resources (OBHR) was proposed. The presented results of empirical studies provide knowledge about the existence and perception of OBHR referring to non-standard employment forms as well as work organization based on project teams allowing for analytical generalizations. The presented discussion can also become the foundation for developing quantitative research the results of which could facilitate statistical generalizations.","[Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Labour & Ind Relat, Wroclaw, Poland; [Bak-Grabowska, Dominika] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Econ & Management Org, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Piwowar-Sulej, K (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Labour & Ind Relat, Wroclaw, Poland.",,"Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/AAS-1994-2021; Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/P-2694-2018","Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/0000-0002-4627-4344; Piwowar-Sulej, Katarzyna/0000-0002-4627-4344",,,,,51,4,4,0,1,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

J,"Saussay, A",,,,"Saussay, Aurelien",,,Can the US shale revolution be duplicated in continental Europe? An economic analysis of European shale gas resources,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Shale gas; Extraction cost; United States; Europe,BARNETT SHALE,"Over the past decade, the rapid increase in shale gas and shale oil production in the United States has profoundly changed energy markets in North America, and has led to a significant decrease in American natural gas prices. The possible existence of large shale deposits in continental Europe, mainly in France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, has fostered speculation on whether the U.S. shale revolution could be duplicated in Europe. However, a number of uncertainties, notably geological, technological, regulatory, and relating to public acceptance make this possibility unclear. We present a techno-economic model of shale gas production amenable to direct estimation on historical production data to analyze the main determinants of the profitability of shale wells and plays. We contribute an in-depth analysis of an extensive production dataset covering 40,000 wells and accounting for nearly 90% of shale gas production in the six main plays of the continental United States from 2004 to 2014. We combine this analysis with a discussion of the main differences between the American and European contexts to calibrate our model and conduct Monte-Carlo simulations. This enables us to estimate the distribution of breakeven prices for shale gas extraction in continental Europe. We find a median gross breakeven price before taxes and royalties of $10.1 per MMBtu. This would make extraction unprofitable in Europe in the current natural gas price environment, with <47% of the well distribution reaching breakeven at the mean 2011-2016 price. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the breakeven price is most sensitive to initial production rate, drilling and completion costs, and decline rates. We also find that the economic outlook would be slightly better if the productivity of European shale gas plays was comparable to that of U.S. plays of similar depth, but not significantly so. We conclude that under assumptions calibrated on existing shale gas production data, it is unlikely that the U.S. shale revolution can be duplicated in continental Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a more robust Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation approach for a sample of non-financial firms listed at Karachi Stock Exchange over the period 2005-2012, we find that both current- and previous-year accounting performances has positive influence on CEO compensation. However, stock market performance does not appear to have a positive impact on executive compensation. We further find that ownership concentration is positively related with CEO compensation, indicating some kind of collusion between management and largest shareholder to get personal benefits. Inconsistent with agency theory, CEO duality appears to have a negative influence, while board size and board independence have no convincing relationship with CEO compensation, indicating board ineffectiveness in reducing CEO entrenchment. The results of dynamic GMM model suggest that CEO pay is highly persistent and takes time to adjust to long-run equilibrium.","[Sheikh, Muhammad Fayyaz] GC Univ, Lyallpur Business Sch, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Shah, Syed Zulfiqar Ali] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Scarman Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Akbar, Saeed] Hull Univ, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",Government College University Faisalabad; University of Warwick; University of Hull,"Shah, SZA (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Scarman Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",zulfiqar.shah@wbs.ac.uk,"Sheikh, Muhammad Fayyaz/ABD-3625-2020; Sheikh, Muhammad Fayyaz/JAC-4779-2023","Sheikh, Muhammad Fayyaz/0000-0003-0009-7538; Akbar, Saeed/0000-0003-0413-9395",,,,,78,72,79,0,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use an endogenous switching regressions model to estimate the sensitivity of bank profitability to risks and control for the endogenous choice to use or not to use derivatives. We then compute counterfactual effects and show how profitability would have looked without derivatives use for banks that used derivatives and how it would have looked with derivatives for banks that did not use derivatives. The results show that derivatives helped reduce the sensitivity of profitability to credit risks and improved profitability for most specialists. However, for the largest number of banks which are non-user non-specialists, devivates usewould have resulted in lower return on assets had they used derivatives post 2008. Therefore, our evidence suggests that implementation of the Volcker Rule, imposing high compliance costs on community banks and, thus, discouraging hedging, may have a negative impact on profits of specialists banks but, overall, a neutral effect on profits in the community banks industry as a whole.","[Shen, Xuan] Regions Bank, Model Bldg Team, Birmingham, AL USA; [Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Finance, Dept Ag Econ & Rural Sociol, 210 Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Hartarska, V (通讯作者)，Auburn Univ, Dept Finance, Dept Ag Econ & Rural Sociol, 210 Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",hartarska@auburn.edu,"Shen, Xuan/AAB-5484-2020",,"Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture","No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.

The objective is to provide insights of the underpricing (first trading day) of IPOs and to find out the determinants of underpricing in the light of asymmetric information and signaling theories. The results indicate that underpricing prevails on the KSE. The level of underpricing with regard to the marked adjusted model is found to be 28.28 percent for the full sample of 83 IPOs, which shows that investors can make a market adjusted profit of 28.28 percent by investing in new issues of IPO firms. The profit opportunity for the day traders is also observed. The year-wise analysis of the level of underpricing shows that the overall amount of level of underpricing decreased over the succeeding years. Furthermore, the level of underpricing is observed in all sectors except equity investment instruments, technology hardware and equipment and personal goods. The risk adjusted performance of IPO firms is also measured with the help of five models by using matched firm techniques. The level of underpricing is observed to be 39.64 percent for the market adjusted model, 42.63 percent for market model, 42.31 percent for CAPM, 42.84 percent for the Fama-French three-factor model and 42.99 percent for the four-factor model.

Results demonstrate positive relationship between the credit growth and the NPL dynamics; however, estimated posterior mean values are rather small and imply that the credit growth influenced the accumulation of credit risk and the origination of the NPL in a modest way.

This is the first study to apply wavelet analysis in studying money and GDP lead-lag links in the Asia-Pacific countries. The main advantage of the wavelet approach is the ability to analyze transient dynamics between two time series across different frequencies or time scales. The use of the wavelet tool is superior to traditional tools because it allows us to determine how the series interact at different frequencies and how they evolve over time. The method allows us to identify both the causality and sign of correlation between our research variables. Therefore, through wavelet coherency and phase-difference analysis, this paper is the first study to identify certain period causality relationship of finance-growth, the lead-lag effect in 15 Asia-Pacific countries. In addition, our study has verified that monetary neutrality did support in some Asia-Pacific countries (i.e., Australia, Malaysia, Philippines, and South Korea). However, monetary policy did work in most of Asia-Pacific countries. The empirical results have important policy implications for these 15 Asia-Pacific countries conducting monetary policy to boot up its economy.","[Tsai, Su-Ling] Shih Chien Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Int Trade, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Tsangyao] CTBC Business Sch, Business Adm, Tainan, Taiwan",Shih Chien University; Feng Chia University,"Chang, T (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Finance, Taichung, Taiwan.;Chang, T (通讯作者)，CTBC Business Sch, Business Adm, Tainan, Taiwan.",t2746112@gmail.com; tychang@mail.fcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,36,12,12,0,2,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Three moments in this evolution will be highlighted, starting by his rejection of GET and advocating disequilibrium in Anti-Equilibrium (1971). While Kornai does not treat the equilibrium paradigm as irrelevant, he suggests an alternative paradigm, namely economic systems theory that he further develops in the 1980s as system paradigm. Economics of Shortage (1980) marks a second phase in which Kornai distinguishes Walrasian equilibrium from normal state or Marshallian equilibrium. In this phase, he supports Marshallian equilibrium rather than disequilibrium. Finally, By Force of Thought (2006) is a critical self-appraisal in which Kornai considers Anti-Equilibrium as a failure and acknowledges GET as a benchmark of an ideal competitive market. He now advocates a Walrasian equilibrium as an abstract reference model, but refuses to consider this model as a description of reality. In this sense, he rejects the New Classical economics. Paradoxically, however, his original heterodox concept of soft budget constraint, irreconcilable with standard microeconomics, has been integrated into new microeconomics as an optimal intertemporal strategy of a maximizing agent in the absence of credible commitments. It will be argued that Kornai's so-called failure is rather related to his half-in, half-out mainstream position, while his institutionalist system paradigm is still a heterodox research project of the future.","[Vahabi, Mehrdad] Univ Paris Nord, CEPN, Ctr Econ, Econ,Univ Paris 13, Paris, France",Universite Paris 13,"Vahabi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nord, CEPN, Ctr Econ, Econ,Univ Paris 13, Paris, France.",mehrdad.vahabi@wanadoo.fr,,,,,,,64,4,4,0,4,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We take advantage of the time dimension available for an increasing number of countries to tackle the endogeneity issue stressed in previous studies. We also use pertinent econometric techniques to address other biases inherent in the data (e.g.measurement errors, missing observations and multicollinearity). Our results reinforce previous findings by validating, with a larger than usual sample of countries and industries, the importance of a larger set of environment variables. We show that infrastructure quality, information & communication technologies, skills and experience of the labour force, cost of and access to financing, security and political stability, competition and government relation contribute to firms' and countries' performances gap. The empirical analysis also illustrates that firms which choose an outward orientation have higher productivity level. Nevertheless, outward oriented enterprises are more sensitive to investment climate limitations. These findings have important policy implications by showing which dimensions of the business environment, in which industry, could help manufacturing firms to be more competitive in the present context of increasing globalization.","[Nguyen, H.

Job insecurity is evaluated in both subjective (perception of job insecurity) and objective (probability of joblessness) terms while mental health is measured using a standardized psychological distress index. Applying a person-specific fixed-effects estimator, results indicate that for males and females age 25-64, job insecurity, regardless of how it is measured, is associated with an increase in psychological distress. Results regarding unemployment are not as conclusive, suggesting that it is not so much the actual occurrence of job loss but the threat of unemployment that is associated with higher psychological distress. Estimates of the relationship between job insecurity and psychological distress using pooled ordinary least squares are much larger, implying that much of the psychological distress/job insecurity correlation may be due to unobservable fixed characteristics. All results are robust to the inclusion and exclusion of a host of other potential determinants including income-related variables, education, and various health measures.","[Watson, Barry] Univ New Brunswick, Fac Business, St John, NB, Canada; [Osberg, Lars] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS, Canada",University of New Brunswick; Dalhousie University,"Watson, B (通讯作者)，Univ New Brunswick, Fac Business, St John, NB, Canada.",bwatson@unb.ca,,"Osberg, Lars/0000-0001-9643-9269",,,,,55,16,17,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, low demand among targeted groups may inhibit take-up relative to non-targeted groups, ownership may not result in use, and there exists little large-scale evidence on how use of socially marketed goods varies by targeted characteristics. I assemble national household survey data from 27 sub-Saharan African countries to examine how use of one of the most common socially marketed preventive health goods (i.e. male condoms) varies by the main targeted characteristics (i.e. low income, low educational attainment, and high HIV risk).The results suggest that the majority of condoms used are socially marketed condoms, engaging in transactional sex is associated with an increased likelihood of using a socially marketed condom brand, and low-income/low educational attainment are not associated with increased likelihoods of using socially marketed brands. The fact that distribution targets low socioeconomic status groups and relative use remains low suggests that weak demand for condoms among these groups inhibits use. Policymakers should consider mechanisms to increase demand and to further refine targeting efforts.","[Wilson, Nicholas] Off Evaluat Sci, US Govt, Washington, DC 20405 USA; [Wilson, Nicholas] Reed Coll, Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA",Reed College - Oregon,"Wilson, N (通讯作者)，Off Evaluat Sci, US Govt, Washington, DC 20405 USA.;Wilson, N (通讯作者)，Reed Coll, Econ, Portland, OR 97202 USA.",nicholas.l.wilson@gmail.com,,,,,,,74,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Drawing on previous research (e.g. Kennedy, Widener, 2008; Fullerton et al., 2013) the paper aims to empirically examine whether service organizations use specific management accounting systems (MAS) to support lean strategy. The theoretical influence of the research is threefold: (a) the research adds to the literature by responding to calls to provide empirical research on the functioning of MAS in a lean environment, especially in service organizations, (b) it suggests that service companies recognize the need to change MAS in response to changes in their strategy, (c) it also investigates associations between different management accounting (MA) practices, examining if they work as a package in support of lean strategy in a service organization. These are important issues that keep MA research up to date with the practical problems of world-class organizations, and they move the knowledge of MA forward. The case study method was used in the research to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomena analyzed. It was found that there is a positive and significant association between lean practices and employee empowerment, whiteboard use and individual process costing. Thus, it was generally observed that departments with higher use of lean methods also use MA practices more extensively. Limited evidence was found, however, that in the case of company MA practices work together (as a package) to support lean strategy. It was also observed that MA tasks, related to lean practices, are moving from the Accounting Department to operational departments.","[Wnuk-Pel, Tomasz] Univ Lodz, Matejki St 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Wnuk-Pel, Tomasz] Affiliated Linnaeus Univ, Box 451, S-35106 Vaxjo, Sweden",University of Lodz; Linnaeus University,"Wnuk-Pel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Matejki St 22-26, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland.;Wnuk-Pel, T (通讯作者)，Affiliated Linnaeus Univ, Box 451, S-35106 Vaxjo, Sweden.",tomwnuk@uni.lodz.pl,,"Wnuk-Pel, Tomasz/0000-0001-5169-6608",,,,,42,3,4,4,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

To investigate the mechanism, this paper has employed Ho & Zhu (2004) two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to decompose banks' efficiency into operational efficiency (ability to expand their business with given inputs), and market efficiency (ability to make maximum profits with given business scale), and test the impacts of foreign capital participation on sixteen Chinese listed commercial banks' market efficiency. The Tobit regression method has been employed since the market efficiency measured with the two-stage DEA approach is always positive and hence not random. The findings indicate that the foreign capital participation has significant and positive impact on the Chinese listed commercial banks' market efficiency even as a minority shareholder, while the weight of the foreign ownership is not so important. Besides, the banks are all significantly influenced by macroeconomic fluctuations. These findings are important for both China and the other transitional economies and developing economies to improve the policies of financial liberalisation.","[Xu, Tao] Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xu, Tao] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46637 USA",Soochow University - China; University of Notre Dame,"Xu, T (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, 50 Donghuan Rd, Suzhou 215021, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Xu, T (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46637 USA.",tylersu@sina.com,,,Ministry of Education of China [15YJA790071]; Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program,"Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program",The author is grateful for the sponsorship of the Humanity & Social Science Funds from the Ministry of Education of China (Fund No.: 15YJA790071) and the Fulbright Visiting Research Scholar program.,,35,1,1,3,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Between the two versions, the numbers in all 11 tables stayed exactly the same (to three decimal places), so it is clear that the specifications generating the results were the same. But the description of the specifications changed. The 2015 working paper version says that, for their main results, the authors used one method of ranking firms by market capitalization, while the 2017 published version says that they used another method. Replication and investigation suggests that the working paper version accurately describes the main specification, and the published version misstates it.

We used the Markowitz efficient frontier method to select the best projects of the organisation. The choice of proper measures impacts on this decision and can change the organisation's portfolio. The standard deviation was applied, and the relevant optimisation was made for this purpose. Then, the semi-standard deviation was used to differentiate between favourable and unfavourable opportunities. Afterwards, Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall were applied as appropriate risk measures to make a better estimate of the tail risks. All these risk measures were used to select the best possible projects. Managers should select the appropriate risk measures according to their objectives, estimation of their project distribution, and characteristics of the projects.

Some research, mainly in marketing and psychology, suggests that the differences do not give the full picture of how decision makers evaluate choice alternatives, e.g. some decision makers may penalise an alternative additionally because it has the highest price. In this paper, we specify a discrete choice model that takes into account the ordering of attribute values across alternatives. This model is used to investigate the effect of attribute value ordering in three case studies related to alternativefuel vehicles, mode choice, and route choice. In our application to choices among alternativefuel vehicles, we see that especially the price coefficient is sensitive to changes in ordering. The ordering effect is also found in the applications to mode and route choice data where both travel time and cost sensitivities are affected by the ordering. Overall, the ordering effects have implications for both parameter estimates and the evaluation of willingness-to-pay measures.","[Mabit, Stefan L.] DTU Management Engn, Lyngby, Denmark",Technical University of Denmark,"Mabit, SL (通讯作者)，DTU Management Engn, Lyngby, Denmark.",,,"Mabit, Stefan Eriksen/0000-0002-3675-6884",,,,,11,1,1,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Based on data from China, we initially find that improvement of the road infrastructure is negatively correlated with the share of labor income and that the results are robust to endogeneity checks. We then explore two transmission channels underlying this negative relationship. First, since road infrastructure leads to expansion of markets, it helps promote the mobility and bargaining power of capital, raising the share of capital income, especially under the current hukou system, which impedes labor mobility. Second, the share of labor income declines as an economy transforms from being labor intensive (dominated by the agriculture sector) to being capital intensive (dominated by the manufacturing sector). China has been undergoing industrialization, which is reinforced by the development of the road infrastructure, contributing to the decline in the share of labor income associated with structural transformation. Finally, when the two transmission channels are controlled for, road infrastructure is found to help raise the labor share and therefore reduce income inequality in China.","[Zhang, Xun] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xun] Shanghai Finance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua; Wang, Xu] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Econ, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Wang, Xu] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Chongqing Technology & Business University; Asian Development Bank; Peking University,"Wang, X (通讯作者)，Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Wang, X (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangxun@bnu.edu.cn; guanghuawan@yahoo.com; xuwangpku@foxmail.com,,,"Bairen Program of Yunnan province; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71133004, 71373186, 71603026]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA027, 16ZDA006]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M580055, 2016T90048]",Bairen Program of Yunnan province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"This paper was funded by the Bairen Program of Yunnan province and the Projects 71133004, 71373186 and 71603026 supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

Multivariate analysis of the moderate innovator countries,OECONOMIA COPERNICANA,,,English,Article,,,,,,innovation activities; firm; the European Union; moderate innovator countries,,"Research background: The uncertainty in the environment and rapid changes have impact on firms, regions and countries. The necessity to adapt to new conditions requires a stimulation of actions aimed at enhancing competitiveness and economic growth. In this respect, the European Union strategy called Europe 2020 should be mentioned. Regarding the role of firms' innovation activities in economic growth of regions and countries, substantial importance was attached to how innovation activities of Polish firms differ from those from the other EU countries with a level of innovation similar to Poland. Here, a particular emphasis was put on moderate innovator countries. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to investigate Polish firms' innovation activities against those by other moderate innovator countries. Methodology: In the study a multivariate analysis and zero unitarization methods were applied. These methods allowed for a division of moderate innovator countries into four groups and for a multivariate analysis of firms' innovation activities in Poland and other EU countries with a level of innovation similar to Poland. The study was based on data from the European Innovation Scoreboard 2016 relating to dimensions of firm activities: firm investments, linkage & entrepreneurship and intellectual assets. The study referred to the period 2008-2015. Findings & Value added: This paper contributes to the existing literature by providing new insight on understanding the issues related to firms' innovation activities. The analysis has revealed several conclusions. One of them indicated the highest distance of Polish firms to those from the other moderate innovator countries, in terms of SMEs innovating in-house, innovative SMEs collaborating with others and public-private co-publications.

Empirical evidence suggests that the ECB's forward guidance, consisting of a carefully expounded series of expectations involving both key policy rates and asset purchases, has been successful in (i) reducing the sensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic news, (ii) insulating euro area financial conditions from external shocks and (iii) providing additional monetary policy accommodation at a time when the room for cuts in key policy rates has been very limited. At the same time, a central bank cannot always be sure how its forward guidance works and much of the challenge arises from the interaction between central banks and financial markets. In this environment, and for forward guidance to be credible and effective, policymakers need to be clear about their reaction function, regularly align their policy expectations with the evolving assessment of the state of the economy and its likely evolution, and act accordingly.","[Coeure, Benoit] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Coeuré, B (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",Office.Coeure@ecb.int,,,,,,,22,5,6,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Between 1980 and 2012, jobs requiring high levels of social interaction grew by nearly 12 percentage points as a share of the U.S. labor force. Math-intensive but less social jobs-including many STEM occupations-shrank by 3.3 percentage points over the same period. Employment and wage growth were particularly strong for jobs requiring high levels of both math skill and social skills. To understand these patterns, I develop a model of team production where workers trade tasks to exploit their comparative advantage. In the model, social skills reduce coordination costs, allowing workers to specialize and work together more efficiently. The model generates predictions about sorting and the relative returns to skill across occupations, which I investigate using data from the NLSY79 and the NLSY97. Using a comparable set of skill measures and covariates across survey waves, I find that the labor market return to social skills was much greater in the 2000s than in the mid-1980s and 1990s.","[Deming, David J.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Deming, David J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Deming, DJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Deming, DJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,85,353,358,29,237,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

We extend the previous literature on volatility spillover linkages among the currencies by taking into account the uncovered interest-rate parity hypothesis for 2004-2015. The results indicate that the Canadian Dollar and Great British Pound were affected mainly by the US Dollar across the two crises due to strong financial and economic ties among the three economies, while the Japanese Yen shows evidence of a safe-haven currency. We also provide evidence of varying vulnerability of currencies to both crises, implying increased portfolio diversification benefits, since holding a portfolio with diverse currencies is less subject to systematic risk. These results show that the policy makers need to adopt a stricter form of monetary policy coordination among central banks, since the different vulnerability of currencies across turbulent periods reveals possible non-cooperative monetary policies.","[Dimitriou, Dimitrios; Kenourgios, Dimitris] Univ Athens, Dept Econ, 1 Sofokleous Str, Athens 10559, Greece; [Simos, Theodore] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Ioannina 45110, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Ioannina,"Simos, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Ioannina 45110, Greece.",tsimos@cc.uoi.gr,"Dimitriou, Dimitrios/GYQ-7943-2022; Simos, Theodore/H-6033-2011; Kenourgios, Dimitris/AAM-5342-2021","Kenourgios, Dimitris/0000-0003-2676-2524; Dimitriou, Dimitrios/0000-0002-7974-3581",,,,,26,37,39,1,27,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We show that when the Fed funds rate rises, banks widen the spreads they charge on deposits, and deposits flow out of the banking system. We present a model where this is due to market power in deposit markets. Consistent with the market power mechanism, deposit spreads increase more and deposits flow out more in concentrated markets. This is true even when we control for lending opportunities by only comparing different branches of the same bank. Since deposits are the main source of liquid assets for households, the deposits channel can explain the observed strong relationship between the liquidity premium and the Fed funds rate. Since deposits are also a uniquely stable funding source for banks, the deposits channel impacts bank lending. When the Fed funds rate rises, banks that raise deposits in concentrated markets contract their lending by more than other banks. Our estimates imply that the deposits channel can account for the entire transmission of monetary policy through bank balance sheets.","[Drechsler, Itamar] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA; CEPR, Washington, DC USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research; New York University; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Drechsler, I (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,43,192,271,11,86,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Low-quality firms sell their product in a low demand but less quality-sensitive period. A dataset including 1697 US theatrical releases between 1998 and 2008 is compiled and explored for evidence of this separating equilibrium. We find that our measures of signal intensity and realized quality (budgets and critical ratings, respectively) are both significantly greater during high-demand periods. Ticket sales are also shown to be more sensitive to expected quality as measured by budgets during the high-demand season. Other seasonal differences and implications are explored.","[King, Amanda S.; King, John T.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Reksulak, Michael] Qatar Natl Res Fund, Doha, Qatar",University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University,"King, JT (通讯作者)，Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA.",jking@georgiasouthern.edu,,"Reksulak, Michael/0000-0003-1560-8708; King, John/0000-0001-6692-8176",,,,,44,5,5,1,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

By using provincial environmental petition data, this paper finds that the number of environmental petitions is positively associated with provincial governments' investments in pollution mitigation. The increased petitions serve as a signal to provincial leaders of the possibility of potential social instability.

In addition, contrasting with previous literature, this research categorizes SRI and Islamic funds into two distinct types in order to allow a fair comparison. Our findings demonstrate that Islamic and SRI funds in general perform close to the conventional funds with significantly better risk-return tradeoff in US focused funds. Results further indicate that the UK-based Islamic and SRI funds were less effected during financial crisis as the magnitude of loss was significantly lower for them when compared to conventional funds. The research suggests that Islamic and SRI funds do provide a rational substitute and investors can benefit from investing in these funds as ethic and faith-based screening criteria do not affect the returns of Islamic and SRI funds adversely.

However, existing studies have not reached a consensus about the decisive factors in China's OFDI. To verify whether China's OFDI activities are motivated by profits, this paper applies a measure of country-specific growth opportunities adopted by Bekaert et al. (2007) to measure the growth opportunities of the target countries for China's OFDI. A multinational panel data model, based on data from 51 countries from 2003 to 2012, is used to explore the relationship between host countries' growth opportunities and China's OFDI. Overall, the analysis finds that China's OFDI does not follow the host countries' growth opportunities but exhibits different features toward developed countries and developing countries. For developed countries, China's OFDI follows host countries' growth opportunities to some extent. In the case of developing countries, China's OFDI does not follow host countries' growth opportunities. When we consider factors such as a host country's financial development and political stability, improvement in these factors improves the attractiveness of the host country to China's OFDI. It is also found that the 2008 global financial crisis did not have a very significant impact on China's OFDI activities.","[Shen, Jun] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Jun] Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Li, Li] Marist Coll, Sch Management, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA",Jinan University; Jinan University; Marist College,"Li, L (通讯作者)，Marist Coll, Sch Management, Poughkeepsie, NY 12601 USA.",Jnshenjun@163.com; lyanlin2010@gmail.com,,"Li, Li/0000-0002-9997-1477",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771093],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Jun Shen, Professor, School of Economics and Institute of Finance, Jinan University, China.

However, the volume of China's OFDI increased rapidly from 2004. There has been an increasing amount of literature on the motivations of China's OFDI, but few studies have focused on its location determinants. The present paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on two important location factors, natural resources and technology, which are the most important determinants of China's OFDI. We use a large panel dataset comprising 132 countries over the period 1991-2009 and the Tobit as well as the Heckman models to establish the relationship between the two location factors and China's OFDI. The empirical results suggest that although China's OFDI has been driven by the country's desire for a secure supply of natural resources and to attain advanced technology from the developed world, China's technology is also a critical attraction for the host developing economies.","[Yao, Shujie] Chongqing Univ, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Shujie] Univ Nottingham, Econ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fan] Chongqing Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pan] Agr Bank China, Zhejiang Branch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Luo, Dan] Univ Reading, Management Accounting & Financial Management, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England",Chongqing University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; Chongqing University; Agricultural Bank of China; University of Reading,"Yao, SJ (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Yao, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Econ, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yaoshujie@cqu.edu; zhangfan514@hotmail.com; wangpan110@hotmail.com; Dan.luo@henley.ac.uk,,,"National Science Foundation of China [71673033]; Chinese Ministry of Education [16YJA790058, 2017CDJSK]","National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China)","Shujie Yao (corresponding author), Chueng Kong Professor of Economics, Chongqing University, and Special Chair Professor of Economics, University of Nottingham Ningbo, China.

With this aim in mind, the authors discuss a model which explains the factors that can affect the production of healthcare, demand for healthcare, and finally, the inequalities between healthcare supply and demand. This analysis proves that, due to imbalances between supply and demand, there is an excess of demand that is equal to waiting lists. This demand excess is called the waiting list function. Hence, the second part of this paper develops an empirical analysis which estimates the function for the waiting lists of Spanish Public Hospitals for the period 1996-2009. As a result of the estimation, the supply and demand factors influencing waiting lists, as well as their evolution, are determined and studied. An imbalance between supply and demand reduces the supply and increases demand resulting in the amount traded by the market being less than potential demand.","[Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain; [Rosete-Rivero, Mayte] Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Rodríguez-Alvarez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain.",ana@uniovi.es,"Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/G-6344-2010","Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/0000-0002-2492-5070",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-43925-R]; project Oviedo Efficiency Group [FC-15-GRUPIN14-048],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; project Oviedo Efficiency Group,The authors thank Esther Lafuente for her helpful comments to this article.

To meet the increasing demand for air transportation, airports seek to expand their capacities, but studies looking at market responses to a spatial redistribution of noise pollution are scarce. Using online advertisements of rental apartments around a large European airport (ZRH) and an unexpected change in flight regulations, we investigate the post-shock dynamics in apartment rents and tenants' search behaviour. We find that rents take about two years to stabilise to a new equilibrium value. After this period there is a constant markup (discount) for apartments exposed to less (more) aircraft noise. Moreover, the number of advertisement clicks as a proxy for search behaviour and information acquisition is significantly higher during the adjustment period.

We track individuals from birth to death, and are able to identify age and cause of death. The intervention was pioneered in Sweden in 1931-1933, and appears to have been pivotal in the emergence of universal infant care programmes in the Scandinavian countries during the creation of the Welfare State. It provided information and support to mothers, with an emphasis on nutrition and sanitation, while monitoring infant care through home visits and clinics. We estimate that the average duration of programme exposure in infancy led to a 1.56% point decline in the risk of infant death (24% of baseline risk) and a 2.56% point decline in the risk of dying by age 75 (7.0% of baseline risk), and these impacts are much larger for children born out of wedlock. Intervention-led declines in the risk of dying after the age of 50 are dominated by reductions in cancer and cardiovascular mortality. We find no evidence of selective utilisation, and the estimates are similar when we exploit within-mother variation in outcomes.","[Bhalotra, Sonia] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Karlsson, Martin] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany; [Nilsson, Therese] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, Therese] Res Inst Ind Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Essex; University of Duisburg Essen; Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Bhalotra, S (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England.",srbhal@essex.ac.uk; martin.karlsson@uni-due.de; therese.nilsson@nek.lu.se,,"Nilsson, Therese/0000-0002-9745-3449","Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences; Centre for Economic Demography (CED); ESRC [ES/L009153/1, ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Centre for Economic Demography (CED); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Silke Anger, Atheendar Venkataramani, and participants of various conferences and seminars for their feedback on earlier versions of this paper.

The general assumption of a reduction in plant growth with increases in plant size and plant age is confirmed by our manufacturing industry data set, while plant growth increases with the stock of human capital, albeit at a diminishing rate, thereby implying a positive concave relationship between plant growth and human capital. Moreover, we find that for plants with higher levels of human capital, the reduction in plant growth is more moderate with regard to size than with regard to age, indicating that differences in the stock of human capital within plants will tend to lead to differences in the patterns of age and size impacts on such plants' growth. Finally, substantial differences were observed among the influences of the various characteristics on plants with high, moderate and low growth in size.","[Chang, Ching-Fu] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Keelung, Taiwan; [Lin, Cherng-Shiun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan Ocean University; National Taiwan University,"Chang, CF (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Appl Econ, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan.",cfchang@ntou.edu.tw,"Chang, Ching-Fu/ABG-7119-2020",,,,,,53,1,1,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

The seminal paper of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) argues that reputation concerns are sufficient to ensure that sovereigns repay their debt. In a famous critique, Bulow and Rogoff (1989a) demonstrate that reputation alone cannot sustain sovereign borrowing in equilibrium, without some other type of default cost or punishment. The size and features of this cost also play a key role in quantitative models of sovereign debt, beginning with Aguiar and Gopinath (2006) and Arellano (2008). Numerous empirical papers have been written trying to find the source and measure the size of these costs. The fundamental identification challenge is that governments usually default in response to deteriorating economic conditions, which makes it hard to determine if the default itself caused further harm to the economy.","[Hebert, Benjamin] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Schreger, Jesse] Columbia Univ, Columbia Business Sch, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Schreger, Jesse] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hébert, B (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",bhebert@stanford.edu; jesse.schreger@columbia.edu,,,economics department of Stanford; economics department of Princeton,economics department of Stanford; economics department of Princeton,"Hebert: Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, 655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 (email: bhebert@stanford.edu); Schreger: Columbia Business School, Columbia University, 3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027, and NBER (email: jesse.schreger@columbia.edu).

For coordination games with zero payoff off-diagonal, it is shown that the difficulty of leaving the basin of attraction of a convention can be well approximated by only considering paths of transitions on which an identical perturbation repeatedly affects one of the populations.","[Hwang, Sung-Ha] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Newton, Jonathan] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Sogang University; University of Sydney,"Hwang, SH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",sunghah@sogang.ac.kr; jonathan.newton@sydney.edu.au,"Hwang, Sung-Ha/A-9942-2017; Hwang, Sung-Ha/AAB-4907-2021","Newton, Jonathan/0000-0003-3290-9721",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5A8019513]; Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Australian Research Council [DE130101768]; Australian Research Council [DE130101768] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government); Discovery Early Career Researcher Award - Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"First Version: January 31, 2014, This version: June 27, 2016.

Based on data for a group of developing countries, the findings show that an increase in FDI inflow is associated with a decrease in the tradable-nontradable ratio, and that an increase in the tradable-nontradable ratio leads to a depreciation of the real exchange rate; this effect being greater with an increase in financial openness. This suggests that an increase in FDI inflow could result in an expansion of the nontradable sector, which would be associated with a greater appreciation of the real exchange rate under a higher level of financial openness.","[Lartey, Emmanuel K.

The changes or the differences in national and regional CO2 emissions during 2000-2014 are decomposed into nine underlying determinants. Temporal decomposition results show that economic scale effect is the dominant driving force leading to the increases in both national and regional CO2. emissions, while energy intensity effect is the main contributor to the reduction of CO2 emissions. Contribution of various variables to CO2 emissions between eastern region and central region are roughly same. Spatial decomposition results demonstrate that the differences of CO2 emissions among China's 30 regions are expanding increasingly. Economic scale effect is main driving force responsible for the difference in CO2 emissions among regions, and energy intensity effect, energy structure effect and industrial structure effect are also important factors which result in the increasing differences in regional CO2 emissions. In addition, resource-based and less developed regions have greater potential in the reduction of CO2 emissions. Understanding CO2 emissions and the driving forces of various regions is critical for developing regional mitigation strategies in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The pattern of spending is inconsistent with models in which identical households cycle rapidly through high and low-response states as they manage liquidity, but is instead highly predictable by income years before the payment. Spending responses are unrelated to expectation errors, almost unrelated to crude measures of procrastination and self-control, significantly related to sophistication and planning, and highly related to impatience.","[Parker, Jonathan A.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Bldg E62-642, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Parker, Jonathan A.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Parker, JA (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave,Bldg E62-642, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Parker, JA (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",japarker@mit.edu,,,MIT Sloan School of Management; Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University; Initiative for Global Markets at the University of Chicago; Zell Center at the Kellogg School of Management,MIT Sloan School of Management; Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University; Initiative for Global Markets at the University of Chicago; Zell Center at the Kellogg School of Management,"MIT Sloan School of Management, MIT, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Building E62-642, Cambridge, MA 02139, and NBER (email: japarker@mit.edu).

In this paper we propose a regime-switching AR-GARCH copula to model pairs of day-ahead electricity prices in coupled European markets. While capturing key stylized facts empirically substantiated in the literature, this model easily allows us to 1) deviate from the assumption of normal margins and 2) include a more detailed description of the dependence between prices. We base our empirical study on four pairs of prices, namely Germany-France, Germany-Netherlands, Netherlands-Belgium and Germany-Western Denmark. We find that the marginal dynamics are better described by the flexible skew t distribution than the benchmark normal distribution. Also, we find significant evidence of tail dependence in all pairs of interconnected areas we consider. As a first application of the proposed model, we consider the pricing of financial transmission rights, and highlight how the choice of marginal distributions and copula impacts prices. As a second application we consider the forecasting of tail quantiles, and evaluate the out-of-sample performance of competing models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

(2002) provides a popular vehicle to model the implied volatilities in the interest rate and foreign exchange markets. To exclude arbitrage opportunities, we need to specify an absorbing boundary at zero for this model, which the existing analytical approaches to pricing derivatives under the SABR model typically ignore. This paper develops closed-form approximations to the prices of vanilla options to incorporate the effect of such a boundary condition. Different from the traditional normal distribution -based approximations, our method stems from an expansion around a one-dimensional Bessel process. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the explicit expression yielded from our method is appealing from the practical perspective because it can lead to fast calibra. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Under certain assumptions, patient players can attain approximately efficient payoffs in equilibrium. The public signal must satisfy a pairwise full rank condition that is somewhat stronger than the monitoring condition required in the folk theorem proved by Fudenberg et al. (1994). Under stronger assumptions, the efficiency result partially extends to settings in which one player has private information that determines every player's payoff. The proof is partially constructive and uses an intuitive technique to mitigate the impact of private information on continuation payoffs.","[Barron, Daniel] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Barron, D (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",d-barron@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,Cowles Foundation at Yale University,Cowles Foundation at Yale University,"I am extremely grateful to Juuso Toikka, Johannes Horner, Robert Gibbons, Glenn Ellison, and two anonymous referees for tremendous advice.

We report a laboratory experiment that, for the first time, estimates the shape of survivor curves in several different settings. Laboratory subjects engage in a series of six desirable activities, e.g., playing a video game, viewing a chosen video clip, or earning money by answering questions. For each activity and each subject we introduce a chosen level of a particular nuisance, and the subject chooses whether to tolerate the nuisance or to switch to a bland activity for the remaining time. New non-parametric techniques provide bounds on the empirical survivor curves for each activity. Parametric fits of the classic Weibull distribution provide estimates of the survivor curves' shapes. The fitted shape parameter depends on the activity and nuisance, but overall the estimated survivor curves tend to be log-convex. An implication, given the model of Aperjis and Huberman (SSRN, doi: 2011), is that introducing nuisances all at once will generally be more profitable than introducing them gradually.","[Bosch-Rosa, Ciril] Colegio Univ Estudios Financieros, Madrid, Spain; [Aperjis, Christina] Power Auct, Washington, DC USA; [Friedman, Daniel] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Econ, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Huberman, Bernardo A.] HP Labs, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Bosch-Rosa, Ciril] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",CUNEF Universidad; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Hewlett-Packard; Technical University of Berlin,"Bosch-Rosa, C (通讯作者)，Colegio Univ Estudios Financieros, Madrid, Spain.;Bosch-Rosa, C (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",cirilbosch@gmail.com,"Huberman, Bernardo/GRI-9648-2022",,HP Labs; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB 649],HP Labs; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We would like to thank Albert Satorra, Manel Baucells, Curtis Kephaert, Sara Hernandez, and Gabriela Rubio for their helpful comments.

Several novel findings emerge. First, cuts in output tariffs reduce markups, but raise productivity. Second, pro-competitive effects are most important among incumbents, while efficiency gains dominate for new entrants. Third, cuts in input tariffs raise both markups and productivity.

In this paper, we examine the spot price dynamics, asymmetric clustering and regime-switching behaviors of CO2 emissions allowances in the new China-wide emissions trading scheme (CETS) pilots using AR-GARCH, AR-TARCH and MRS-AR-GARCH models. The regional ETS pilots' design in China vary widely in their coverage thresholds, sector coverage, emissions allocation and caps setting methods, market trading rules and price stabilization provisions. Our empirical results indicate that the spot prices of regional emissions allowances exhibit significant dynamic behaviors, asymmetric leverage effects and regime-switching behaviors in the entire period considered; previous market overreactions in the Beijing, Tianjin and Guangdong pilots have stronger price clustering effects on future conditional variances than do the Shanghai and Hubei pilots. Unexpected market shocks and greater persistence in the Beijing, Tianjin and Guangdong ETS pilots display stronger market volatility and higher market risks, and their asymmetric leverage effects display a decreasing trend in the volatility of the BEA, TJEA and GDEA prices. The BEA and SHEA prices exhibit significant regime-switching behaviors, price jumps and higher volatility; in addition, the changes in the regime-switching phases are often related to the political mechanism design and the fundamental market factors. Those empirical results are beneficial for government decision-makers and market participants to strengthen risk management strategies, support emission-related investment decisions and optimize co-benefits of alternative energy-environmental policies.

Fieldwork with a generalist news website in Saint Petersburg focused on this difference in order to bring to light the ordinary compromises worked out by the editorial staff. Observations of editorial board meetings shed light on the subtle exchanges among journalists that led to the decision to post an article. Posted articles corresponded neither to orders from government propaganda nor to the opinions of the opposition: they were in-between, a compromise based on a contrast of shared commonplaces. Coming out of this process of deliberation, the published articles were evidence of the fine balance that could be achieved in the handling of news in Russia in mid-2010. This compromise was based on an unspoken mutual interpretation that did not call for a general justification of the implied political agenda. This study contributes to work on the domination of politics over the Russian media and on the critique of journalistic opposition. For the sociology of journalism, it proposes new keys to understanding journalism in less-than-free political contexts.","[Dauce, Francoise] EHESS, CERCEC, Etud, Paris, France",,"Daucé, F (通讯作者)，EHESS, CERCEC, Etud, Paris, France.",francoise.dauce@ehess.fr,,,,,,,51,1,1,0,3,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

This paper proposes a number of models that account for different equilibria (some better, some worse) of the electricity sector. They show how policy choices (affecting insolvency prospects or related to rules for electricity dispatching or tariff setting), stochastic generation costs, and initial conditions, affect investment in generation and electricity supply. They also show how credible (non-credible) promises of stronger enforcement to reduce theft result in larger (smaller) electricity supply, lower (higher) government subsidies, and lower (higher) tariffs and distribution losses, which in turn affect economic activity. To illustrate these findings, the paper reviews the experience of Haiti, a country stuck in a bad equilibrium of insufficient supply, high prices, and electricity theft; and that of Nicaragua, which is gradually transitioning to a better equilibrium.

Dramatic changes occurred in China's rural land policies after 2000, including the extension of rural land contractual period, restriction of land reallocation 'among villages and villagers groups, elimination of agricultural taxes for responsibility land, and rapid development of rural land rental markets. These changes have given farmers more secure tenure on collectively controlled responsibility land and have strengthened farmers' income rights for responsibility lands, incentivizing them to increase their investments on responsibility lands. A panel data method was used to quantitatively investigate the impact of land policy changes on agricultural investment. We considered the application of organic fertilizer as an indicator for long-term agricultural investment, and compared the use of organic fertilizer between private plots and responsibility lands operated by the same household. The results showed that the difference in organic fertilizer use between private plots and responsibility land for the same household has become smaller from 2000 to 2008. Our findings suggest that recent changes in rural land policies have provided farmers incentives to increase land quality investment on their responsibility lands.","[Gao, Liangliang] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Dingqiang] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1,Weigang Rd, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jikun] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Nanjing Agricultural University; Peking University,"Sun, DQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, 1,Weigang Rd, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dqsun@njau.edu.cn,"Gao, Liangliang/L-7388-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473122, 71333008]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17BJY010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71473122 and No. 71333008) and the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 17BJY010).

Using data on cases in which the political immunity of German representatives was lifted, we find that resignations are more common when the media covers the case intensely. The amount of this news coverage, in turn, depends on the availability of other newsworthy, exogenous events. Therefore, we instrument for coverage of liftings of immunity with the overall news pressure. We estimate the causal effect and find that a change from no coverage to the mean coverage increases the likelihood of resignation by 6.4 percentage points. The effect is likely driven by the crowding out of reports on politicians with the same ideology as the newspaper, rather than reports on representatives with different political leanings. There is no evidence that the reporting affects the chances of conviction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We measure individuals' autonomic nervous system activity in a resting state as well as under non-competitive and competitive incentive schemes using heart rate variability (HRV) measurement. We find that both baseline HRV and competition-induced changes in HRV predict willingness to compete. Notably, we find that women with low baseline HRV, a marker associated with chronic stress exposure, are more likely to choose piece rate incentives over competitive incentives than women with high baseline HRV. We observe that men with large acute HRV response to forced competition are more likely to choose tournament pay over piece rate pay than men with small acute HRV response to competition. Our results suggest that HRV can predict individual differences in willingness to compete, but HRV does not close the gender gap in willingness to compete at the aggregate level.

Nash equilibrium configurations are such that either everyone is friends with everyone or agents can be partitioned into different sets, where agents within the same set are friends and agents in different sets are enemies. Any strong Nash equilibrium must be such that a single agent is in an antagonistic relationship with everyone else. Furthermore, I show that Nash equilibria cannot be Pareto ranked. This paper offers a game-theoretic foundation for a large body of work on signed networks, called structural balance theory, which has been studied in sociology, social psychology, bullying, international relations, and applied physics. The paper also contributes to the literature on contests and economics of conflict. Keywords.

All of these redesigned matching models increase responses of unemployment to movements in productivity by diminishing the fundamental surplus fraction, an upper bound on the fraction of a job's output that the invisible hand can allocate to vacancy creation.

I develop a general equilibrium model where heterogeneous establishments optimally select themselves into informality, tax compliance, and formal tax evasion. Informal firms evade taxes by staying small, while larger, formal firms can engage in costly tax evasion. In equilibrium, tax revenues rely on medium-sized firms, which are scarce. In a calibration exercise using data from Mexico, I find that reducing the returns to tax evasion by formal firms increases tax revenues by up to 68%. However, economies where such returns are too high face a trade-off between tax collection and aggregate efficiency, as cracking down on formal tax-evading firms pushes some firms into informality. Last, as the economy develops, the informal sector shrinks, while the tax-evading sector expands, thus limiting potential collection. If lower informality is a byproduct of development, and not vice versa, a solid tax base can be achieved by fiscal authorities effectively by focusing on formal tax evasion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Then, we discuss the main existing findings on the effects of decentralization on a relevant list of socio-economic issues. The impact of fiscal decentralization reforms on political institutions and public policies is also considered. Complete answers on the impact of fiscal decentralization are not likely to be certain but, overall, there are reasons to be optimistic about the net positive result.

For this purpose, we rely on company-level data of French importing firms. We find that the well established fact that prices rise faster than they fall, which is characterized by the convex import price reaction function, lies primarily with the presence of nominal rigidity. Once price stickiness is controlled for, there is empirical evidence that the import price reaction function is rather concave if the linearity assumption can be rejected, indicating that firms aim primarily to protect their market share.","[Razafindrabe, Tovonony] Univ Rennes 1, CREM, Rennes, France; [Razafindrabe, Tovonony] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, EconomiX, Paris, France",Universite de Rennes; Universite Paris Nanterre; Universite Paris Saclay,"Razafindrabe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Fac Sci Econ, Bur 144,7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",tovonony.razafindrabe@univ-rennes1.fr,,,,,,,52,3,3,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The main aim is to measure cross-country sensitivities that feature systemic contagion in the international banking system and characterize how systemic shocks are propagated. To this end, we estimate the sensitivity of the expected-loss function in the local banking industry to contemporaneous shocks in foreign expected-loss functions in a dynamic equation system during the period December 1999 through November 2013, after controlling for global exposures to common factors, and considering stressed and non-stressed economic scenarios. We implement instrumental estimation to ensure robust estimates against endogeneity and characterize impulse-response functions to appraise the expected duration of tail-contagion. Our study reveals that cross-country vulnerabilities exhibit strong state-dependent patterns which largely increase during periods of distress. During tranquil or normal periods, shocks cause minor or no significant impacts are quickly absorbed by the domestic systems. Under stressed market conditions, however, even idiosyncratic shocks can trigger a pronounced response in other areas with effects that tend to last over long periods of time. Our analysis also reveals the existence of directionality in cross-border contagion, with the US banking sector being the greatest source of financial contagion worldwide and, simultaneously, being more resilient than other areas. Furthermore, systematic exposures to Central EMU area are largely significant than Peripheral Europe, being US the most vulnerable country to shocks originating in Central EMU. Finally, US and Eurozone are sensitive to shocks in Emerging banking system.","[Rubia, Antonio] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain; [Sanchis-Marco, Lidia] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Rubia, A (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain.",,"Sanchis-Marco, Lidia/AAC-1811-2021; Rubia, Antonio/AAF-5833-2021; Sanchis-Marco, Lidia/H-6161-2018","Sanchis-Marco, Lidia/0000-0002-7631-0238; Rubia, Antonio/0000-0002-3892-6648","Spanish Department of Education and Innovation [ECO2012-33619, ECO2014-58434P]",Spanish Department of Education and Innovation,"We would like to thank Zeno Adams, Antonio Diaz, Javier Lopez-de-LaCalle, Simone Manganelli, Antonio Moreno, Alfonso Novales, James W.

This should lead to savings in public funds. Domestic and foreign studies point to the fact that sufficient competition on the supply side is the condition for achieving those savings. Slovakia currently belongs to a group of countries with low competition on the supply side of the tender. Every year, about 10,000 tenders will be made in Slovakia for 5 billion Eur. However, contracting authorities have difficulty with establishing the estimated contract value and defining non-discriminatory criteria. On the other hand, contractors lack the expertise to prepare tenders, specifications are often tailored to specific bidders or products, and the price criterion has a negative impact on the quality of the goods and services purchased. Purpose of the article: The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of selected efficiency determinants on savings in public procurement in Slovakia in 2010-2016. The number of bids, the subcontractor's participation, the narrower competition and the impact of the narrower competition and the expected price on the number of bids have been examined. Methods: The survey sample consisted of 800 randomly selected public procurement contracts from different sectors in 2010-2016. The contracts were split on the basis of the median estimate of the above-limit (409 contracts) and below-limit (391 contracts) contracts; the divestment value was the estimated price of 400,000 Euro (without the tax). Findings & Value added: The number of offers positively influences the creation of savings in public procurement, an average of 5-6%. The impact of a narrow competition was significant, which led to a decrease in savings of 3-4% compared to the open competition if the sample was 800 contracts and over 400,000 Euro (without the tax). For below-limit orders, this determinant was shown to be statistically insignificant. The size of the contract did not affect the number of successful candidates. Also, the negative impact of narrower competition on the number of tenders was demonstrated. These findings are in line with the presented research studies. In the future, we plan to perform sectoral analyses to verify the validity of the hypotheses under review based on the results of our research.","[Tkacova, Andrea; Gavurova, Beata; Danko, Jakub] Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia; [Cepel, Martin] LIGS Univ, Honolulu, HI USA",Technical University Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Cepel, Martin/AAY-6375-2020; Tkáčová, Andrea/ABC-9384-2021; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Tkáčová, Andrea/0000-0002-6025-1261; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X",,,,,52,16,16,3,10,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called One Farm Household, Two Production Systems (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years. This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for Tamers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow Green Food are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides.","[Zhang, Man; Jin, Yanhong] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, 88 Lipman Dr, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Zhang, Man; Qiao, Hui; Zheng, Fengtian] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Renmin University of China,"Zheng, FT (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",yanhong.Jin@Rutgers.edu; qiaohui@ruc.edu.cn; zft@ruc.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Man/0000-0001-9600-904X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473256],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Fengtian Zheng acknowledges the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project ID: 71473256).,,47,26,29,5,70,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

We measure national identification with survey data from the fourth wave of the Afrobarometer and proxy regional development with night lights data. To account for the endogeneity of regional development, we employ an instrumental variables approach and use a proxy for mineral resource wealth as our main instrument. Our results show that inhabitants of more prosperous regions are more likely to identify with their nation rather than their ethnic group. Regarding transmission channels, we find suggestive evidence consistent with the interpretation that national identification is higher in richer regions because of different cultural beliefs and a lower reliance on traditional ethnic networks. Overall, our research implies that African governments can foster national identification by ensuring that all parts of a country participate equitably in economic development.

The Great Recession was mainly caused by a large demand shock and by the ZLB on the interest rate policy. In contrast with previous findings, the subsequent jobless recovery is explained by the ZLB effect. We estimate a fraction of Non-Ricardian households which is close to 50%, and obtain comparatively large fiscal multipliers. However we cannot detect a significant contribution of fiscal policies in stabilizing the US economy. For instance, the 2007-2009 large increase in expenditure-to-GDP ratios was apparently determined by the adverse non-policy shocks that caused the recession. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is because stability is regarded as necessary for building strong ties and friendships, which in turn affect educational outcomes. However, amongst the vast number of studies on the effect of neighbours on a child's education, none has tested whether neighbourhood stability matters. We fill this gap by estimating the causal effect of residential turnover on student test score gains. Estimation is based on administrative data on four cohorts of secondary school students in England, allowing us to control for pupil-level, neighbourhood-level, and school-by-cohort level unobservables and for changes in neighbourhood composition driven by students' residential mobility. We show that a high turnover of same-school-grade students reduces value added for teenagers who stay in their neighbourhood, although turnover of other age groups does not matter. These results coupled with auxiliary findings based on survey data suggest that neighbours' turnover damages education through the disruption of local ties and friendships, highlighting a so-far undiscovered spillover of mobility.","[Gibbons, Stephen; Silva, Olmo] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Weinhardt, Felix] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Gibbons, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",s.gibbons@lse.ac.uk; o.silva@lse.ac.uk; felix.weinhardt@hu-berlin.de,,"Gibbons, Stephen/0000-0002-2871-8562",ESRC [ES/J003867/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Tony Champions, Camille Hemet, Larry Katz, Daniele Paserman (the Editor), Steve Rivkin, four anonymous referees, and participants at the CEP Labour Market Workshop, NIESR Seminar (London), the SERC Annual Conference 2013, SOLE Annual Meetings 2014, the Tinbergen Institute (Amsterdam), the University of Alicante, the University of York and the III Workshop in Urban Economics (Barcelona) for helpful comments and suggestions.

Can a regulator design an optimal environmental policy to reduce emissions and to promote clean technologies? This paper studies optimal environmental policy in the situation where a monopoly innovator develops and licenses dean production technologies to downstream polluting firms. We find that (i) a higher emission tax will encourage innovation when the burden of the tax payment in the polluters' costs and/or the price-elasticity of the demand for polluting goods are small, (ii) the innovation-inducing effects of emission tax are inversely related to the emission-reduction (Pigouvian) effects of the tax, and (iii) the social optimum can be achieved by the mix of tax and subsidy. We also show that if the policy instrument is limited to the tax, the second-best tax rate would lie between the marginal damage and the first-best rate. By performing numerical simulations, we also demonstrate that the optimal mix of the emission tax and R & D subsidy can have double dividend benefits.","[Hattori, Keisuke] Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan",,"Hattori, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Higashiyodogawa Ku, 2-2-8 Osumi, Osaka 5338533, Japan.",hattori@osaka-ue.ac.jp,,"Hattori, Keisuke/0000-0001-8686-4704",JSPS KAKENHI [25380343],"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",I would like to thank two anonymous referees and an editor of this Journal for helpful comments and suggestions.

Using German microdata, we argue that individual religiosity accounts for differences in individual's risk preferences and private financial behaviour. First, we find that adherents of the two main Christian religions in Germany (Protestants and Catholics) are less willing to take risks in general than non-religious people. We further find that Muslims in Germany are less risk-taking in general than Catholics, Protestants and non-religious people. Moreover, in explicitly considering a context-specific risk attitude, namely the willingness to take risks in financial matters, our results indicate that it is necessary to control for underlying general risk-taking preferences due to the heterogeneous attitudes of Christians and Muslims regarding financial risk taking. Second, while controlling for individual financial risk-taking preferences, we provide empirical evidence of differences in household financial behaviour between religious and non-religious individuals in Germany. Our results furthermore support the view that religious participation helps to explain different individual investment behaviour. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Lewis, PA",,,,"Lewis, P. A.",,,Ontology and the history of economic thought: the case of anti-reductionism in the work of Friedrich Hayek,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SOCIOECONOMIC ORDER; EQUILIBRIUM; EMERGENCE; PSYCHOLOGY,"Tony Lawson has long advocated an 'ontological turn' in the history of economic thought. This essay aims to contribute towards that goal by considering how one aspect of the methodology adopted by a prominent heterodox economist was informed by ontological considerations. The economist is Friedrich Hayek, the aspect of his methodology concerns the possibility of reductionism, while the ontological category that informs his anti-reductionist methodology-though not, as we shall see, in a wholly consistent way-is that of 'emergence'. The account presented below suggests that the notion of emergence played an increasingly important, and also increasingly explicit, role in the arguments Hayek mounts against reductionism in his postwar work on theoretical psychology and social theory. In the case of his theoretical psychology, notwithstanding the fact that he had access to a set of concepts that afforded him the opportunity to mount an emergentist case against reductionism, Hayek's most prominent argument against reductionism was, and remained, computational-rather than emergentist-in nature. In the case of his mature, post-1960 social theory, however, Hayek explicitly advanced a consistently 'emergentist' case against reductionism, based on the importance of organising relations for the generation of higher-level structural properties such as the coordinative powers of the liberal market economy. The implications of this ontologically informed discussion of Hayek's arguments against reductionism for existing interpretations of Hayek's work are considered.","[Lewis, P.

Endogenous-entry models typically fail to generate the observed joint increase in consumption and entry.

Empirically, however, there is considerable debate on the effect of taxes on informality. In this paper I show that whether a positive, negative or non-relation arises between tax rates and informality depends on the degree of tax enforcement and the level of credit market development in an economy. Higher enforcement implies a higher probability of detection and punishment while more credit implies better formal sector access to finance. Both are incentives to become formal. In a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model with borrowing constraints, I show that informality rises with the tax rate up to a threshold level of tax enforcement beyond which it falls as tax increases.

This paper explores the implications of the use of arithmetic hedonic price indexes for art investments. Log-linear predictions are retransformed back to the original scale by performing a modified version of the Duan's smearing factor. This procedure is illustrated with an analysis of the returns from 10,459 Surrealist paintings sold worldwide during the pre-crisis period 1990-2007. Findings show significant differences between the arithmetic versus geometric price indexes, while emphasising the caution that should be exercised in interpreting the hedonic index prices of non-standard investments as they are typically computed for academic and business applications.

In particular, the accuracy of spillover estimates obtained from bilateral models depends on two aspects of economies' integration with the rest of the world. First, accuracy worsens as direct bilateral transmission channels become less important, for example when the spillover-sender accounts only for a small share of the spillover-recipient's overall integration with the rest of the world. Second, accuracy worsens as indirect higher-order spillovers and spillbacks become more important, for example when the spillover-recipient is more integrated with the rest of the world overall. Empirical evidence on the global output spillovers from US monetary policy is consistent with these generic results: Spillover estimates obtained from two-country VAR models are systematically smaller than those obtained from a global VAR model; and the differences between spillover estimates obtained from two-country VAR models and a global VAR model are more pronounced for economies for which the US accounts for a smaller share of their overall trade and financial integration with the rest of the world, and for economies which are more integrated with the rest of the world overall.

We build on a recently developed micro-foundation for the competitive production sector that rests on the idea that the fabrication of output requires tasks to be performed by capital and labor (Irmen, 2017). Firms may engage in innovation investments that increase the productivity of capital and labor in the performance of their respective tasks. These investments are associated with new technological knowledge that accumulates over time and sustains long-run growth. We show that the equilibrium allocation is not Pareto-efficient since both forms of technical change give rise to an inter-temporal knowledge externality. An appropriate policy of investment subsidies may implement the efficient allocation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study contributes to the literature by examining the scantly studied area of co-movement in exchange rates and using the wavelet approach, which allows us to analyse time-frequency-wise co-movement of the time series. The empirical results indicate that the currency futures markets are nearly perfectly integrated in the long run (monthly, quarterly and biannual scales) offering little potential gains from international portfolio diversification. The discrepancies between currency futures markets are small and almost fade away within 3-6months. Moreover, international currency diversification might offer relatively higher potential gains at intraweek, weekly, and fortnightly time horizons owing to lower correlations among the currencies under consideration. Finally, our multiple-wavelet correlation and cross-correlation analysis shows that GBP acts as a potential leader/follower across scales. The results of our analysis indicate the dynamic pattern of co-movement among the major currency futures contracts, which provides several implications for portfolio managers and international investors participating in the Indian market.","[Kumar, Satish; Pathak, Rajesh; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] IBS Hyderabad, Fac Management, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] Montpellier Business Sch, CESD, Montpellier, France; [Yoon, Seong-Min] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Busan, South Korea; [Yoon, Seong-Min] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France",The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE); ICFAI Business School (IBS); Montpellier Business School; Pusan National University; IPAG Business School,"Yoon, SM (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Busan, South Korea.;Yoon, SM (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France.",smyoon@pusan.ac.kr,"Yoon, Seong-Min/AFL-6471-2022; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011; Kumar, Satish/AAJ-6596-2020; Yoon, Seong-Min/ABF-2564-2021","Yoon, Seong-Min/0000-0003-3011-9486; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263; Kumar, Satish/0000-0001-5625-8877; Yoon, Seong-Min/0000-0003-3011-9486",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2016S1A3A2924349],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2016S1A3A2924349].,,31,15,16,0,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Hence, a gloomy future induces the agent to shorten her time horizon in order to reduce distress caused by the anticipation of poverty, at the cost of worsening her realized future consumption, resulting in a behavioral poverty trap where poverty and shortsightedness reinforce each other. The paper also provides primary empirical evidence of the endogenous determination of time horizon and of the existence of a behavioral poverty trap. Using a randomized controlled trial in Mozambique that provided agro-input subsidies and a Matched Savings program, I show that improvement in economic prospects resulted in a significant increase in the planning horizon of the poor beneficiaries.

By comparing estimates in the literature, we highlight that while pregnant women are responsive to taxes and taxes improve child health, their responsiveness has declined over time. We show that these trends reflect a compositional change; specifically, the least addicted smokers quit in the 1990s, leaving the pool of smoking mothers to be dominated by less price elastic smokers. Reviewing the literature on other tobacco policies, we show that a state-level U.S. smoking ban has roughly three times the effect on pregnant women of a 10% increase in prices using elasticity estimates from more recent periods.

Using micro-level data on French manufacturing firms spanning the period 1995-2005, we show that a supply-driven increase in the share of foreign-born workers in a French departement (a small geographic area) increased the total factor productivity of firms in that departement. We also find this effect to be significantly stronger for firms with low initial productivity and small size. The positive productivity effect of immigrants was also associated with faster growth of capital, larger exports, and higher wages for natives. Highly-skilled natives, in competition with immigrants, moved towards firms hiring fewer immigrants spreading positive productivity effects to those firms too. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We determine the size, composition and effects of fiscal consolidation using a 'bottom-up' measurement strategy and find notable cross-country variation. We show that while richer households tend to bear a greater burden in most countries, combined cuts in public wages and transfers are more likely to affect liquidity-constrained households and thereby aggregate demand, casting doubts on the presumed effectiveness of such measures for macro-economic recovery. This suggests that in order to reach robust policy conclusions it is important to consider the distributional patterns of detailed policy measures.","[Paulus, Alari; Figari, Francesco; Sutherland, Holly] Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England; [Figari, Francesco] Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Figari, Francesco] Collegio Carlo Alberto, CeRP, Moncalieri, TO, Italy; [Figari, Francesco] Bocconi Univ, DONDENA, Milan, Italy",University of Essex; University of Insubria; Bocconi University,"Figari, F (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, ISER, Colchester, Essex, England.;Figari, F (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, Via Monte Generoso 71, I-21100 Varese, Italy.;Figari, F (通讯作者)，Collegio Carlo Alberto, CeRP, Moncalieri, TO, Italy.;Figari, F (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, DONDENA, Milan, Italy.",francesco.figari@uninsubria.it,"Paulus, Alari/AAC-2678-2020","FIGARI, FRANCESCO/0000-0003-0735-1076; Paulus, Alari/0000-0001-7921-0462",European Commission through the Social Situation Monitor; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex [ES/L009153/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI,European Commission through the Social Situation Monitor; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the European Commission through the Social Situation Monitor; and the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC) at the University of Essex [grant number ES/L009153/1].,,53,18,18,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

In this context an innovative social marketing campaign, which targeted pro sanitation messages to households active in local marriage markets, was implemented with the goal of increasing toilet ownership. This paper estimates the impact of this program, known colloquially as No Toilet No Bride, on household-level latrine ownership. Private sanitation coverage in Haryana increased by 21% specifically among households with boys active on the marriage market. This effect is larger and concentrated in marriage markets where women are relatively scarce and absent when women are relatively abundant, which together suggest the program operated by successfully linking sanitation outcomes with marriage market competition induced by local scarcities of women due to male-biased sex ratios.","[Stopnitzky, Yaniv] Univ San Francisco, 2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA",University of San Francisco,"Stopnitzky, Y (通讯作者)，Univ San Francisco, 2130 Fulton St, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.",ystopnitzky@usfca.edu,"Kuang, Jinyi/L-8488-2017","Kuang, Jinyi/0000-0003-4173-3246",,,,,42,24,24,1,18,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

This paper also examines different events (i.e., nominations, inclusions, and awards) in the analysis of how much importance investors place on CSR. The results show that investors do not exhibit significant recognition of U.S. companies included in the DJSI. However, when CSR becomes common practice within a given industry, certification by independent third parties regarding CSR policies conveys actual benefits to corporate performance. In addition, this paper compares degrees of CSR recognition between investors in the United States and investors in Taiwan. This study uses the Awards of Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility given by Common Wealth Magazine to assess whether investors form different expectations of CSR based on company size. The results indicate that Taiwanese investors are increasingly aware of CSRs and the awards received by mid-sized companies show significant impacts. Changes in share prices for mid-sized companies are slower than for large companies. This paper argues that CSR policies not only enhance reputation but also lead to good financial performance.

Additionally, we investigate the influence of individuals' financial loss aversion and financial risk preferences on this valuation. In our study we conduct a choice experiment survey in which respondents' choices indicate the value they place on avoiding wind, solar, and biomass externalities. We combine this survey with a financial lottery choice task that elicits the respondents' risk preferences and degree of loss aversion. In the choice experiment we use both increases and decreases in electricity bills to depict the uncertain effect of new sources of energy generation on the current price level. This design allows us to investigate if obtained values are independent of the payment mechanism. In the analyzed context, our results indicate that marginal utility of money seems to be lower with a rebate on the energy bill than with a surcharge. We find that financial risk preferences affect people's choices both in a case of a surcharge and a rebate, while loss aversion for money affects them just in the case of a rebate. Loss aversion for money seems to not be present during a buying process. The results indicate that the more risk seeking people are in a financial domain the more they are willing to pay for proposed changes in renewable energy development, at the same time people who are more risk averse require less compensation before they accept externalities from renewable electricity production. Moreover, a higher compensation is required by people who are more loss averse with regard to money. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

I show that public investment induces rather complex private capital dynamics falling in the short and in the long run, but potentially increasing along transition if public capital augments private capital and private inputs are gross complements in production. Whether private investment is crowded in or out during transition critically depends on parameters that are empirically hard to measure, such as the labor supply elasticity and the elasticity of substitution between private inputs a small increase in the latter from 0.5 to 0.6, for instance, turns a totally negative transitional effect into a predominantly positive one.

Minority participation by private investors-as empirically observed-arises endogenously in the model to prevent investment expropriation. We consider the example of water supply with perfectly inelastic demand and fixed-price regulation, coupled with price discretion at a local level. Welfare-maximizing local governments face a trade-off between the increase in consumers' surplus and the reduction in costly public funds. Therefore, private shareholders choose investment to keep the government share at a threshold such that the politician always sticks to the price-cap and dividends are then maximized. To consider normative issues, we compare investment by mixed firms and by a social planner.","[Cavaliere, A.; Maggi, M.] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, Pavia, Italy; [Cavaliere, A.] Univ Bocconi, IEFE, Milan, Italy; [Stroffolini, F.] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Stat, Naples, Italy",University of Pavia; Bocconi University; University of Naples Federico II,"Cavaliere, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Aziendali, Pavia, Italy.;Cavaliere, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bocconi, IEFE, Milan, Italy.",alberto.cavaliere@unipv.it; maggma@eco.unipv.it; stroffol@unina.it,,,,,,,22,1,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

To that end, an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration and the Johansen cointegration approach are applied to annual time series data from 1963 to 2012. We find that the PFD payouts tend to worsen income inequality in Alaska in both the short-and long-run. We also provide evidence to support the existence of Kuznets' hypothesis for Alaska - growth deteriorates income inequality initially and improves it later. Finally, population is found to reduce Alaska's income inequality in the short- and long-run. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas state attempts to establish agricultural cooperatives in Russia in a top-down fashion have largely failed, such cooperatives have sprung up widely in Belgorod. The article investigates: (1) what influence the (regional) state exerts on the cooperatives, and how that affects their daily functioning and viability; and (2) to what extent such top-down cooperatives might evolve into less state-led forms, such as classic member-driven or business-like cooperatives.","[Kurakin, Alexander] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ HSE, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, Moscow, Russia; [Visser, Oane] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, The Hague, Netherlands",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Visser, O (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies ISS, The Hague, Netherlands.",visser@iss.nl,"Kurakin, Alexander/E-7395-2015","Kurakin, Alexander/0000-0002-1043-9100",Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics; European Research Council (ERC) [313871]; European Research Council (ERC) [313871] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),Support from the Basic Research Program of the National Research University Higher School of Economics is gratefully acknowledged by Kurakin.

Using bank-level quarterly data over the period 2005-2013, we perform stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and compute cost efficiency scores at the bank and bank group levels. We deduct from gross costs the negative revaluations of foreign currency items generated by official exchange rate dynamics rather than by managerial decisions. The results indicate that the core state banks, as distinct from other state-controlled banks, were nearly as efficient as private domestic banks during and after the crisis of 2008-2009. Foreign banks appear to be the least efficient market participants in terms of costs, which might reflect their lower (and decreasing over time) penetration of the Russian banking system. We further document that the group ranking by cost efficiency is not permanent over time and depends on the observed differences in bank capitalization and asset structure. We find that foreign banks gain cost efficiency when they lend more to the economy. Core state banks, conversely, lead in terms of cost efficiency when they lend less to the economy, which can result from political interference in their lending decisions in favor of unprofitable projects Private domestic banks that maintain a lower capitalization significantly outperform foreign banks and do not differ from the core state banks in this respect.","[Mamonov, Mikhail] Russian Acad Sci, Ctr Macroecon Anal & Short Term Forecasting CMASF, Inst Econ Forecasting, 47 Nakhimovsky Prospekt, Moscow 117418, Russia; [Mamonov, Mikhail] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, 20 Myasnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Vernikov, Andrei] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow 117218, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences","Vernikov, A (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Moscow 117218, Russia.",mmamonov@forecast.ru; vernikov@inecon.ru,"Vernikov, Andrei Владимирович/I-7868-2013; Vernikov, Andrei/HLH-8152-2023; Mamonov, Mikhail/AAE-3947-2020","Vernikov, Andrei Владимирович/0000-0003-1561-9458;",HSE,HSE,"We gratefully acknowledge, without implication, comments and suggestions from anonymous referees, Richard Frensch (the editor), Zuzana Fungacova, Sergei Golovan, Ikka Korhonen, Israel Marques, Henry Penikas, Anatoly Peresetsky, Anna Pestova, Maria Semenova, Michael Skully, Vladimir Sokolov, Laura Solanko, Oleg Solntsev, and participants at the EBES conference in Barcelona (2014), the 16th International Academic Conference at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow (2015), the BOFIT research seminar at the Bank of Finland in Helsinki (2015), the 2015 RCEA Money and Finance Workshop in Rimini (2015), the First World Congress of Comparative Economics in Rome (2015), the 5th International Banking Workshop Banking in Emerging Markets: Challenges and Opportunities in Moscow (HSE and BOFIT, 2015), and the XXIV International Rome Conference on Money, Banking and Finance (2015).

This is done by using a Cox Proportional Hazard model to analyse data generated by an employer survey. Analysis indicates that important determinants of vacancy duration include the skill level of the vacancy, the accessibility of the region of the vacancy, and the size of the firm advertising the vacancy. Wage offers are found to have a confounding effect, with higher wage offers apparently associated with longer duration. However, an ancillary regression uncovers evidence of wage posting. Surprisingly, little evidence of variation in vacancy duration across industries is found. Results from a proportional hazard model with shared frailty based on the firm advertising the vacancy, suggest unobserved heterogeneity is also important.

The different estimation techniques assessed are: (1) The maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach; (2) The Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane (GHK) simulator with Halton sequences, implemented in conjunction with the composite marginal likelihood (CML) estimation approach; (3) The GHK approach with sparse grid nodes and weights, implemented in conjunction with the composite marginal likelihood (CML) estimation approach; and (4) a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. In addition, for comparison purposes, the GHK simulator with Halton sequences was implemented in conjunction with the traditional, full information maximum likelihood approach as well. The results indicate that the MACML approach provided the best performance in terms of the accuracy and precision of parameter recovery and estimation time for all data generation settings considered in this study. For panel data settings, the GHK approach with Halton sequences, when combined with the CML approach, provided better performance than when implemented with the full information maximum likelihood approach, albeit not better than the MACML approach. The sparse grid approach did not perform well in recovering the parameters as the dimension of integration increased, particularly so with the panel datasets. The Bayesian MCMC approach performed well in datasets without correlations among random parameters, but exhibited limitations in datasets with correlated parameters.","[Patil, Priyadarshan N.; Bhat, Chandra R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, 301 E Dean Keeton St Stop C1761, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dubey, Subodh K.] Univ South Australia, Inst Choice, 140 Arthur St,Level 13, Sydney, NSW 2060, Australia; [Pinjari, Abdul R.] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave,ENB 118, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Cherchi, Elisabetta] Newcastle Univ, Transport Operat Res Grp, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Cassie Bldg, Newcastle NE1 7RU, England; [Daziano, Ricardo] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 305 Hollister Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of South Australia; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Newcastle University - UK; Cornell University,"Cherchi, E (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Transport Operat Res Grp, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Cassie Bldg, Newcastle NE1 7RU, England.",priyadarshan@utexas.edu; subbits@gmail.com; apinjari@usf.edu; Elisabetta.Cherchi@newcastle.ac.uk; daziano@cornell.edu; bhat@mail.utexas.edu,"Pinjari, Abdul/Y-3020-2019; Bhat, Chandra/AAC-6965-2019; Patil, Priyadarshan/AAY-8350-2021; Daziano, Ricardo A/N-4604-2014","Pinjari, Abdul/0000-0002-3056-4259; Bhat, Chandra/0000-0002-0715-8121; Patil, Priyadarshan/0000-0001-8747-4679;",,,,,32,20,22,0,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

A consensus in the development literature is that differences in productivity are a dominant source of these differences. But what accounts for productivity differences across countries? One explanation is that frontier technologies and best practice methods are slow to diffuse to low-income countries. The recent literature on misallocation offers a distinct but complementary explanation: low-income countries are not as effective in allocating their factors of production to their most efficient use. We provide our perspective on three key questions. First, how important is misallocation? Second, what are the causes of misallocation? And third, beyond the direct cost of lower contemporaneous output, are there additional costs associated with misallocation? A summary of our answers is as follows: Misallocation appears to be a substantial channel in accounting for productivity differences across countries, but the measured magnitude of the effects depends on the approach and context. Researchers have not yet found a dominant source of misallocation; instead, many specific factors seem to contribute a small part of the overall effect. Beyond the static cost of misallocation, we believe that the dynamic effects of misallocation on productivity growth are significant and deserve much more attention going forward.","[Restuccia, Diego] Univ Toronto, Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Restuccia, Diego] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Restuccia, Diego; Rogerson, Richard] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rogerson, Richard] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; Princeton University,"Restuccia, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Restuccia, D (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Restuccia, D (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",diego.restuccia@utoronto.ca; rdr@princeton.edu,,,,,,,116,172,175,17,92,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Once information is transformed into digital form, it can be copied and distributed at near-zero marginal costs. This change has facilitated piracy in some industries, which in turn has made it difficult for commercial sellers to continue generating the same levels of revenue for bringing products to market in the traditional ways. Yet despite the sharp revenue reductions for recorded music, as well as threats to revenue in some other traditional media industries, other aspects of digitization have had the offsetting effects of reducing the costs of bringing new products to market in music, movies, books, and television. On balance, digitization has increased the number of new products that are created and made available to consumers. Moreover, given the unpredictable nature of product quality, growth in new products has given rise to substantial increases in the quality of the best products. Although there were concerns that consumer welfare from media products would fall, the opposite scenario has emerged-a golden age for consumers who wish to consume media products.","[Waldfogel, Joel] Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Waldfogel, Joel] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Carlson Sch Management, Appl Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.;Waldfogel, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jwaldfog@umn.edu,"Waldfogel, Joel/A-4916-2015","Waldfogel, Joel/0000-0002-8040-7227",,,,,35,64,82,4,52,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Yet, economists tend to neglect that however compelling economic analyses may be, the stumbling block on the way of the reform of the Monetary Union is political will, and that in democracies the ultimate source of political will comes from electors. In this paper, first of all the authors wish to bring to the economists' attention some recent analyses of citizens' attitudes towards Europe from political science. Then, by cross-referencing the results of the 2014 elections of the European Parliament with Eurobarometer opinion polls eliciting judgements for the EU vis-a-vis home countries and an indicator of economic pain, the authors show the presence of a geo-economic-political cleavage across four groups of countries. This is more complex, and perhaps worse, than the simplistic divide between 'North' and 'South' or 'Core' and 'Periphery'. The main implication is that the EU experiences a stalemate between 'more Europe vs. less Europe' at the level of peoples, which seriously undermines support for further integration 'from below'.","[Farina, Francesco] Univ Siena, Dept Social Polit & Cognit Sci, Siena, Italy; [Tamborini, Roberto] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy",University of Siena; University of Trento,"Tamborini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Trento, Italy.",roberto.tamborini@unitn.it,"Tamborini, Roberto/H-4183-2019",,,,,,25,0,0,0,6,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 3,2017,11.0,,,,,,,,201710.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-10,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EW1TI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402276200001,0

The increasing competitiveness among them and the need to safeguard their future viability make it necessary to identify factors that not only attract and satisfy new participants, but also retain previous attendees. Accordingly, this article examines the relations between motivation, satisfaction and loyalty in the case of a cinema event the Valdivia International Film Festival (Chile), distinguishing, in turn, between local attendees and visitors. To achieve this goal, a structural equation modelling is performed based on the data obtained through a survey conducted among festival attendees. The results show there are different motivations for attending a festival (leisure, professional motives and cinema) and that some directly affect satisfaction and loyalty. Similarly, satisfaction is presented as an unquestionable antecedent of loyalty, the latter being measured by means of different concepts. Finally, the research highlights some significant differences between residents and tourists and seems to point to the existence of a kind of cultural tourism focused on an interest in the cinema, which contributes to the festival's continuity and sustainability. All of this allows us to extract some implications for the managers of this type of event and for those responsible for the destination's cultural and tourist policy.","[Baez-Montenegro, Andrea] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Estadist, Fac Cs Econ & Adm, Pasaje Viel S-N Edificio FACEA 301, Valdivia, Chile; [Devesa-Fernandez, Maria] Univ Valladolid, Dept Econ Aplicada, Fac Cs Sociales Jurid & Comunicac, Plaza Univ 1, Segovia 40005, Spain",Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad de Valladolid,"Báez-Montenegro, A (通讯作者)，Univ Austral Chile, Inst Estadist, Fac Cs Econ & Adm, Pasaje Viel S-N Edificio FACEA 301, Valdivia, Chile.",abaez@uach.cl; mdevesa@eco.uva.es,"Baez Montenegro, Andrea/G-6768-2019; Devesa, Maria/L-9015-2014","Baez Montenegro, Andrea/0000-0001-5562-4089; Devesa, Maria/0000-0002-3735-1977",,,,,96,42,44,5,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We use standard credit spreads as proxies to the external finance premium. Our first result suggests that the US and Canadian credit spreads contain substantial forecasting power for several measures of the Canadian real economic activity, especially during the recent financial crisis and its aftermath. Secondly, an adverse US credit shock generates a significant and persistent economic slowdown in Canada: the national external finance premium rises immediately while interest rates, credit aggregates, output and employment indicators decline. Variance decomposition reveals that credit shocks have a sizeable effect on real activity measures, leading indicators and credit spreads. Yet, the unexpected shocks in domestic credit spreads are not able to generate any significant dynamic response of the real activity oncewe control for the US credit market conditions.","[Bedock, Nathan] HEC Montreal, Inst Econ Appl, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Stevanovic, Dalibor] Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Stevanovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Quebec, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",dstevanovic.econ@gmail.com,"Stevanovic, Dalibor/ABE-7555-2020",,Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec); Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Fonds de recherche sur la societe et la culture (Quebec); Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),We thank the editor Francisco Ruge-Murcia and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We investigate two contrasting forces. First, since consumers cannot fully inspect an online product's quality prior to purchase, conventional wisdom and some of the literature suggest that this attracts low-quality products to the online market (a pooling effect). On the other hand, the literature on vertical product differentiation indicates that a firm with a lower-quality product may prefer to reveal its product quality in the physical market because quality differentiation helps alleviate price competition (a differentiation effect). We show that an entrant firm with product quality lower than that of the offline incumbent may choose the physical market, whereas the entrant with a quality higher than the incumbent's may sell online. More generally the two contrasting forces can give rise to a wide range of product quality from low-end to high-end in both markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We use these data to document two novel empirical patterns. First, foreign affiliate and headquarter sales exhibit strong positive comovement: a 10% growth in the sales of the headquarter is associated with a 2% growth in the sales of the affiliate. Second, shocks to the source country account for a significant fraction of the variation in sales growth at the source-destination level. We propose a parsimonious quantitative model to interpret these findings and to evaluate the role of multinational firms for international business cycle transmission. For the typical country, the impact of foreign shocks transmitted by all foreign multinationals combined is non-negligible, accounting for about 10% of aggregate productivity shocks. On the other hand, since bilateral multinational production shares are small, interdependence between most individual country pairs is minimal. Our results do reveal substantial heterogeneity in the strength of this mechanism, with the most integrated countries significantly more affected by foreign shocks.","[Cravino, Javier] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cravino, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,"Levchenko, Andrei A/0000-0001-9087-7911",Michigan Institute for Teaching and Research in Economics (MITRE),Michigan Institute for Teaching and Research in Economics (MITRE),"We are grateful to the editor (Pol Antras), four anonymous referees, Ariel Burstein, Aaron Flaaen, Jim Hines, Sebastian Krautheim, Sebastian Sotelo, Linda Tesar, Carolina Villegas-Sanchez, Andrei Zlate, and seminar participants at various institutions for helpful suggestions and to Laurien Gilbert, Nitya Pandalai-Nayar, and Rishi Sharma for excellent research assistance.

Most evidence of hyperbolic discounting is based on violations of either stationarity or time consistency. Stationarity is violated when intertemporal choices differ for trade-offs in the near versus the more distant future. Time consistency is violated if the optimal allocation for specific dates changes over time. Both types of choice reversals may however also result from time-varying discount rates. Hyperbolic discounting is an unambiguous explanation for choice reversals only if the same individuals violate both stationarity and time consistency. Our field experiment in Nigeria examines the extent to which this is the case. The experiment measured both stationarity and time consistency for the same participants. Violations of the two rarely coincide, especially among more liquidity-constrained participants. Thus, in a context of liquidity constraints, eliciting only one type of choice reversal is insufficient to identify hyperbolic discounting.","[Janssens, Wendy; Swart, Lisette] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Janssens, Wendy; Kramer, Berber] Amsterdam Inst Int Dev, Pietersbergweg 17, NL-1105 BM Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Janssens, Wendy; Swart, Lisette] Tinbergen Inst, Gustav Mahlerlaan 117, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kramer, Berber] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Swart, Lisette] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, Bezuidenhoutseweg 30, NL-2594 AV The Hague, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Kramer, B (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Markets Trade & Inst Div, 2033 K St, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",b.kramer@cgiar.org,,"Janssens, Wendy/0000-0002-2085-8608; Kramer, Berber/0000-0001-7644-6613",PharmAccess Foundation; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU-IRPP) [2012-06]; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [451-10-002],PharmAccess Foundation; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU-IRPP); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from the PharmAccess Foundation 2011-08 and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU-IRPP Grant 2012-06), as well as the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO, Grant no. 451-10-002).",,42,15,16,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We assess the relevance of resource-depletion models for intertemporal financial decisions by estimating the effects of three interventions - prior impulse-controlling activity, consumption of a sugared drink, and consumption of a placebo (sugar-free) drink - on intertemporal monetary chokes in a cash-advance framework. These manipulations have large impacts on the demand for advances, but contrary to resource-based models prior impulse-controlling activity and placebo drink consumption increase patience. To understand these effects, we estimate treatment effects on the three parameters of a decision utility model for every subject in our sample. All treatments reduce utility curvature and present-bias, and these movements are highly correlated. Together, we argue that these patterns suggest that the treatments are acting not on subjects' fundamental utility parameters but on subjects' tendencies to frame financial decisions narrowly (within the frame of the lab experiment) versus broadly (in the context of their other financial options). Thus, while decision environments have large effects on intertemporal financial decisions, both the direction and the mechanisms underlying these effects appear to be quite different from those suggested by resource-depletion models.

We characterize the set of payoffs profiles that can be sustained by a perfect equilibrium, as players become increasingly patient. There are two conditions: admissibility and joint rationality. An admissibly feasible payoff can be achieved by an action profile that offers no unilateral deviation which is both undetectable and profitable. It is jointly rational if for all weights on players, the weighted average payoff is greater than or equal to the minmax level of the weighted average payoff function. This characterization is alternative to the one provided by the score method of Fudenberg and Levine (1994). We provide a simple construction of equilibrium strategies based on cooperation, punishments and rewards. Punishments rely on Blackwell's approachability algorithm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The production process is distributed globally, and the pollution haven effect of international trade is becoming more complicated. For instance, intermediate product trade corresponds to the largest share of embodied emissions, and the share of emissions induced by the global value chain related trade is increasing gradually. The aim of this paper is to make a comprehensive analysis on the pollution haven hypothesis in carbon emissions embodied in three different trade patterns from global, bilateral, and national perspectives. We propose a method to parcel the pollution haven hypothesis in a multi-regional input-output analysis and discuss the contribution of production fragmentation for global emissions. It is found that international production fragmentation generates global emissions savings. The intermediate product trade has a negative balance of avoided emissions. The final product trade becomes increasingly less environmentally effective during the period 1995-2009. There are significant differences in the environmental effects of different trade patterns for each country.

This approach can be traced back to Ricardo's theory of rent on land. While this is a sound theory for determining rent on land, it cannot be generally applied to all production factors such as labour and capital, especially since the nature of the latter lends itself to somewhat questionable quantification. In the paper I am able to show, with the help of a stock-flow model, that in a setting where loanable money capital and labour are abundant and virtually inexhaustible; high, even double-digit interest rates, can emerge. Reasons for this are structural, they depend on power relations between different groups and on the underlying institutional arrangement in a given society.","[Susnik, Urban] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Susnik, U (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",urban.susnik@outlook.com,,,"European Union; European Social Fund; Republic of Slovenia, Ministry for Education, Science, and Sport","European Union(European Union (EU)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Republic of Slovenia, Ministry for Education, Science, and Sport","This paper is a result of doctoral research, in part financed by the European Union, European Social Fund, and the Republic of Slovenia, Ministry for Education, Science, and Sport within the framework of the operational programme for human resources development for the period 2007-2013.",,23,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We argue that these firms have considerable political power locally even if they are not large in the regional or national perspective. These locally dominant firms can use their political power to voice their concerns directly vis-a-vis the local government-a channel of influence that is hardly available in municipalities with an atomistic structure of tax payers. We hypothesize that municipalities with locally dominant firms will set lower tax rates than municipalities in which tax-payers' concentration is low. We test the impact of tax-payers' concentration on local business tax rates using data from 423 municipalities in the German state Hesse between 1998 and 2005. The estimation technique accounts for spatial lags and autoregressive disturbances. Results support our central hypothesis: the higher the tax-payers' concentration, the lower the municipal business tax rates.","[Bischoff, Ivo] Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 4, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [Krabel, Stefan] IIT, Steinpl 1, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Bischoff, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, Dept Econ, Nora Platiel Str 4, D-34109 Kassel, Germany.",bischoff@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de; krabel@iit-berlin.de,"Bischoff, Ivo/AAQ-3278-2021",,,,,,51,10,10,2,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Evidence from Uruguay,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,English,Article,,,,,,technology; education; impact evaluation,COMPUTERS; CLASSROOM; SCHOOLS,"Background: In recent years many countries have made substantial investments in One Laptop per Child (oLPc) programs, while others are about to start implementing this type of interventions. This paper contributes to the study of the effect of OLPC programs on students reading and math scores using a quasi experimental design and data from Uruguay, the first country to implement an OLPC program at a national scale: Plan CEIBAL. Methods: We use a difference-in-difference strategy (Dip) to estimate the impact of Plan CEIBAL on educational achievement. The analysis exploits the fact that the rollover of the program was based on geographic criteria and not on students' school performance. The exact date at which each student received the laptop is available. This gives us the ability to calculate with no error a continuous measure of treatment as the number of days that each student has been exposed to the program by the time of the follow-up date (normalized to years). We control for potential systematic differences in school improvement over time between schools in Montevideo (the capital of Uruguay) and the rest of Uruguay. Results: Our findings suggest that the program did not have an impact on reading and math scores. We also do not find heterogeneous effects across children with different mother's education. When analyzing descriptive data on the frequency of laptop use during class, we observe that every-day use of laptops in class is not widespread across all public schools. Besides, laptops' main use in class is to search for information in the internet rather than for training using drills and exercises. A particularly important feature of the program is that teacher training has been, up to now, optional. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in the first two years of its implementation Plan CEIBAL had no effects on math or reading scores.","[Miranda, Alfonso] CIDE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

However, in the subsequent practice and legislation, such form of local negotiation has never been adopted. A question arises from the Italian experience: in the presence of a predetermined equalization scheme decided by the central government, are local agreements on equalization transfers possible? In this paper we show that, in the presence of quasi-linear local preferences on public goods, there is no space for alternative local agreements on the allocation of equalizing transfers in the presence of predetermined schemes decided by the central government. Our results suggest that similar practices, when allowed, are destined to have scarce success.

In professional basketball teams must shoot within 24s of the start of a possession. The decision of when to shoot requires weighing the current shooting opportunity against the continuation value of a possession. At each second of the shotclock, optimal play requires that a line up's reservation shot value equals the continuation value. We empirically test this prediction with a structural stopping model. Most lineups adopt a reservation threshold that matches the continuation value closely. Overall, the lineups we study capture 84% of the gains of a dynamic vs. an optimal fixed threshold. Lineups with more shared playing experience performed better on average. Observed mistakes lean towards impatience - the adopted threshold is either in too low or has excess steepness - meanings too many shots are taken early in the possession. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We address this issue using related application outcomes at the European Patent Office as indicators for patent weakness. We create a proxy for potentially citable prior art using latent semantic analysis of US patent documents, and use this to construct a measure of examiner search effort. We find that US examiners tend to devote more search effort to weaker patents, implying that they can identify a substantial portion of the weak patents that they issue.

Instead of these, it focuses on the State-building process whereby a small emerging elite of business owners and urban professionals, drawing on and adapting international ideas, used public policy to deal with social conflict and expand their own economic opportunities.

The government has access to two policy tools: taxes on formal business activity and enforcement (or policing) discouraging informality. The main focus of the paper is on transitional dynamics under different initial wealth levels. Whether an initially small business will be trapped in the informal economy and remain small forever or grow quickly and become a large formal business depends on tax and enforcement policies. High tax rates accompanied by loose enforcement - which is mostly the case in less-developed countries (LDCs) - induce tax avoidance, discourage investment in formal businesses, and drive the entrepreneurial activity towards the informal sector even though the initial wealth level is high. Lowering taxes on formal activity joined with strict enforcement can help reducing the magnitude of poverty traps in LDCs - such as the MENA region, Latin America and developing Asia.","[Tumen, Semih] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey; [Tumen, Semih] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Tumen, Semih] ERF, Bonn, Germany",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Tumen, S (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey.;Tumen, S (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Tumen, S (通讯作者)，ERF, Bonn, Germany.",semih.tumen@tcmb.gov.tr,"Tumen, Semih/S-3412-2019","Tumen, Semih/0000-0002-8841-2290",,,,,79,3,3,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

Looking at the diversity of corporate structures of large-sized firms around the world (and over time) would fascinate Charles Darwin. This work develops a critical review of the literature on political determinants of corporate governance through the Darwinian theory (including some Lamarckian aspects). As Darwin, in his work On the Origin of Species, explicates the diversity of species of tortoises, finches and iguanas of the Galapagos Islands, so Darwinism may contribute in understanding the origin and the persistence of corporate diversity. In particular, this paper takes into account politics-driven variations, their inheritances, and the subsequent selection of advantageous corporate' attributes.","[Vatiero, Massimiliano] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Brenno Galli Chair Law & Econ, Lugano, Switzerland",Universita della Svizzera Italiana,"Vatiero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Brenno Galli Chair Law & Econ, Lugano, Switzerland.",vatierom@usi.ch,"Vatiero, Massimiliano/C-3820-2013; Vatiero, Massimiliano/ABF-6606-2020","Vatiero, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2886-9870",Swiss National Science Foundation; Comparative Corporate Governance and Finance Program at Harvard Law School,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Comparative Corporate Governance and Finance Program at Harvard Law School,"The author acknowledges comments from Filippo Belloc, Peter Gourevitch, Eleonora Guadagno, Yuliya Guseva, Giuseppe Niglia, Ugo Pagano, Marcello Puca, Mark Roe, Hans-Bernd Schafer, Mathias Siems, Holger Spamann, two anonymous referees of this journal and participants of EALE 2013 (Warsaw), EALE 2014 (Marseille) and WINIR 2014 (Greenwich) conferences.

This finding may be surprising in light of previous evidence for a democracy premium but is in line with authoritarian norms which are prominent in China. We further show that there is a systematic association between participants' values and their relative contribution decisions in exogenous and endogenous implementation of the rule. Our major finding is that those subjects that place greater value on accepting authority are responsible for greater levels of cooperation under top-down governance.

To address the endogeneity of fertility, we exploit exogenous variations in the number of children caused by twin births, which can be considered a natural experiment. The instrumental variable estimates indicate that an additional child reduces female employment by 10.5 percentage points for those who have at least one delivery, and the effects gradually decline for females who have two or more deliveries, with the effects vanishing when females have three or more deliveries. Also, the effect of fertility varies substantially with the time elapsed since the last childbirth, which has a consequence for differences in estimates across different samples in the literature.

Our findings show that, while foreign aid does not have a significant effect on political rights, foreign aid volatilities do mitigate democracy in recipient countries. Such volatilities could be used by populist parties to promote a neocolonial agenda, instill nationalistic sentiments, and consolidate their grip on power. This is especially true when donors are asking for standards that the majority of the population in control does not want and political leaders are unwilling to implement them. Our empirical evidence is based on 53 African countries for the period from 1996 to 2010. As a main policy implication, creating uncertainties in foreign aid for political rights enhancement in African countries may achieve the opposite results. We also discuss other implications, including the need for an After-Washington Consensus.","[Asongu, Simplice A.] African Governance & Dev Inst, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nwachukwu, Jacinta C.] Coventry Univ, Fac Business Environm & Soc, Dept Econ Finance & Accounting, Coventry, W Midlands, England",African Governance & Development Institute; Coventry University,"Asongu, SA (通讯作者)，African Governance & Dev Inst, Yaounde, Cameroon.",,"Simplice, Asongu/K-3436-2014","Simplice, Asongu/0000-0001-5227-5135",,,,,110,11,11,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

However, the relationship between labour macroeconomic indicators and poverty seems to have become weaker recently. Using panel data on unemployment and poverty for Spanish regions, we estimate a system GMM model to model this relationship using alternative measures of the unemployment rate. We also test the hypothesis of asymmetric effects of the business cycle on the share of poor individuals in the population. Our results show that unemployment has a positive impact on severe poverty, while inflation has a negative effect. We also highlight the extent to which results differ when alternative intra-household unemployment distribution-sensitive measures are considered. Regarding the existence of asymmetric business cycle effects on severe poverty, our results show that despite the fact that the Great Recession has had a strong and positive effect on severe poverty, the effects of expansions and recessions on poverty are not significantly different.","[Ayala, Luis] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Ayala, Luis] Equalitas, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain; [Canto, Olga] Univ Alcala, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencias Econ Empresariales & Turismo, Plaza Victoria S-N, Madrid 28802, Spain; [Canto, Olga] Equalitas, Plaza Victoria S-N, Madrid 28802, Spain; [Rodrigurez, Juan G.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Anal Econ 1, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Rodrigurez, Juan G.] Equalitas, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad de Alcala; Complutense University of Madrid,"Ayala, L (通讯作者)，Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.;Ayala, L (通讯作者)，Equalitas, Paseo Artilleros S-N, Madrid 28032, Spain.",luis.ayala@urjc.es; olga.canto@uah.es; juangabr@ucm.es,"Ayala, Luis/AAA-2231-2019; Cantó, Olga/E-7883-2016; Ayala, Luis/ABF-8664-2021","Cantó, Olga/0000-0003-0780-3212; RODRIGUEZ, JUAN GABRIEL/0000-0002-0256-8789","Comunidad de Madrid Project Desigualdad, pobreza e igualdad de oportunidades [S2015/HUM-3416-DEPOPOR-CM]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-46516-C4-3-R, ECO2013-46516-C4-2-R, ECO2013-46516-C4-4-R]; Red Tematica de Excelencia [ECO2015-71981-REDT]; Fundacion Ramon Areces","Comunidad de Madrid Project Desigualdad, pobreza e igualdad de oportunidades; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Red Tematica de Excelencia; Fundacion Ramon Areces","The authors would like to warmly thank M.A. Davia for her inestimable guidance in exploiting the Spanish Labour Force Survey database, Elena Barcena for a detailed discussion of the paper and Gustavo Marrero for relevant suggestions.

It allows ADL computations that take into account the complexity of pension rules. Concerning the what for question, it is known that ADL are not an indicator of global financial sustainability. Messages they convey are more interesting at the micro level, from a household perspective. This fosters the case for microsimulation which spontaneously generates consistent micro/macro results. We illustrate these points using the French situation as a case study. We emphasize one aspect of French reforms that may concern other countries as well: the move to price indexation and the connection it creates between sustainability and growth assumptions.","[Blanchet, Didier; Le Minez, Sylvie; Marino, Anthony] Insee, 18 Bd Adolphe Pinard, F-75675 Paris 14, France",,"Blanchet, D (通讯作者)，Insee, 18 Bd Adolphe Pinard, F-75675 Paris 14, France.",didier.blanchet@insee.fr,,,,,,,32,2,3,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

By vertical flexibility we mean partial/total and reversible outsourcing of a necessary input. A firm simultaneously selects the vertical setting and the financial sources of investment in flexibility, in particular debt and venture capital. A loan may come from a lender that requires the payment of a fixed coupon over time and an option to buy out the firm in certain circumstances. Debt leads to the same level of flexibility of an unlevered firm. Yet investment occurs earlier. The injection of venture capital reduces the quest for vertical flexibility and speeds up investment. Then, there arises a fresh substitutability between a financial (venture capital) and a real variable (vertical flexibility). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, although he focused on individual beliefs, we argue in this paper that such beliefs are social constructs. We suggest that institutions - rules, expectations, and norms - are based on shared cognitive rules. Cognitive rules are social constructs that convey information that distills and summarizes society's beliefs and experience. These rules have to be self-enforcing and self-confirming, but they do not have to be correct'. We describe the characteristics of such rules in the context of a market for ideas, and illustrate their importance in two developments central to the growth of modern economies: the rise of the modern state with its legitimacy based on consent, and the rise of modern science-based technology that was the product of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment.","[Greif, Avner] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Greif, Avner; Mokyr, Joel] CIFAR, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Mokyr, Joel] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL USA; [Mokyr, Joel] Tel Aviv Univ, Tel Aviv, Israel",Stanford University; Northwestern University; Tel Aviv University,"Greif, A (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Greif, A (通讯作者)，CIFAR, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",avner@stanford.edu; j-mokyr@northwestern.edu,"Greif, Avner/D-6973-2011",,,,,,71,51,54,1,27,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

This paper attempts to address the relevant magnitude of this issue in the cdntext of growth regressions based on the Solow growth model. The paper develops a method of running Monte Carlo simulations that allows us to generate simulated data that match the moments of observed real-world data typically used in such regressions while simultaneously allowing us to impose arbitrarily high correlations between the steady-state determinants of the Solow model and the unobserved residual term of the data-generating process. After running simulations that represent a wide sample of the mathematically-possible correlations, we conclude that a between estimator or a random effects estimator will deliever a lower average absolute bias across all coefficients than alternative estiniators in almost all of our simulations. Conversely, estimators that use within-country variation will generate lower biases when looking solely at rates of convergence. Furthermore, we conclude that these results are robust when restricting our sample of simulations to several subsets of the assumed parameters and to changing our assumptions about country fixed-effects terms.

Not assuming any kind of substitutes condition or the law of aggregate demand, we obtain the following results. First, the number of stable and strategy-proof rules is at most one. Second, the doctor-optimal stable rule, whenever it exists, is the unique candidate for a stable and strategy-proof rule. Third, a stable and strategy-proof rule, whenever it exists, is second-best optimal for doctor welfare, in that no individually rational and strategy-proof rule can dominate it. This last result is further generalized to non-wasteful and strategy-proof rules. Due to the weak assumptions, our analysis covers a broad range of markets, including cases where a (unique) stable and strategy-proof rule is not equal to the one induced by the cumulative offer process or the deferred acceptance algorithm.

We explain these observations using a synthetic economic model with endogenous lifetime, retirement, and human capital accumulation. In contrast to the result obtained by assuming an institutionally fixed and compulsory retirement, a longer life expectancy attributable to rises in per-capita income can induce elderly people to leave the labor market later, thereby enabling them to increase consumption of goods as well as children when young. Consequently, higher per-capita income can be associated with higher fertility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It need not be so: often, free-riders' property can be forcibly appropriated by a coordinated group. This power makes punishment profitable, but it can also be abused. It is easier to contain abuses, and focus group punishment on free-riders, in societies where coordinated expropriation is harder. Our theory explains why public goods are undersupplied in heterogenous communities: because groups target minorities instead of free-riders. In our laboratory experiment, outcomes were more efficient when coordination was more difficult, while outgroup members were targeted more than ingroup members, and reacted differently to punishment.

Using average annual state-level home prices as an instrument, we attempt to identify the causal effect in an panel IV framework. Results from the panel IV estimations suggest that having a high mortgage loan to home value (LTV), defined as LTV at or above 80 %, leads to more depressive symptoms and a higher incidence of hypertension, but has no effect on subjective well-being. Since the results from panel estimations did not show that debt affects health, whether the panel IV results demonstrate a causal relationship depends critically on the exclusion assumption.","[Leung, Leigh Ann] Brown Univ, 121 South Main St, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Lau, Catherine] Carthage Coll, 2001 Alford Pk Dr, Kenosha, WI 53140 USA",Brown University,"Leung, LA (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, 121 South Main St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",leigh_ann_leung@brown.edu,,,,,,,46,17,17,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Yet, it features the principle of effective demand which is at the core of Traditional Post-Keynesian (TPK) models and follows from the perception that the wage inflation is a policy variable rather than a labor-market clearing variable. In order to locate the DSDE model among the traditions of economic thought, the paper compares DSDE first-order conditions of optimal behavior with TPK rule-of -thumb behavior. It further compares the economic propagation of a DSDE model to those of a DSGE and TPK model as well as a Synthetic Neoclassical (SNC) model which features TPK behavioral assumptions and labor-market clearing. We arrive at two core conclusions: First, apart from assumptions regarding expectation formation, orthodox micro-foundation is, to a considerable extent, consistent with the behavioral hypotheses underlying TPK models. Second, the economy characterized by the DSDE model is essentially post-Keynesian rather than neoclassical because it features the principle of effective demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between inflation and output can be modeled by a four-regime smooth transition regression model in which the responses of inflation to output depend on both inflation and economic growth rates. The inflation-output type Phillips curve may be positively sloped, negatively sloped, or even vertical in the short term, depending on different business cycles. Furthermore, we analyze business cycle fluctuations based on the nonlinear Phillips curve, indicating a coexisting zone of stable inflation rate and rapid growth rate.","[Zhang, Lingxiang] Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Institute of Technology,"Zhang, LX (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",lingxiangzh@163.com,"Zhang, Tony/AAN-2354-2020",,"National Social Science Fund of China [13CJY011]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71372015, 71272060]",National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by grants of the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 13CJY011), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71372015), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71272060).

Using monthly data spanning 1980:2-2014:12, we show that there exist multiple structural breaks and nonlinearities in the data. Therefore, we employ methods that are capable of accounting for these and at the same time date stamping the periods of causal relationship between the U.S. returns and those of the other countries. First we implement a subsample analysis which relies on the set of models, data set and sample range as in Rapach et al. (J Finance LXVIII(4):1633-1662, 2013). Our results show that while the U.S. returns played a strong predictive role based on the OLS pairwise Granger causality predictive regression and news-diffusion models, its role based on the adaptive elastic net model is weak. Second, we implement our preferred model: a bootstrap rolling window approach using our newly updated data on stock returns for each countries, and find that U.S. stock return has significant predictive ability for all the countries at certain sub-periods. Given these results, it would be misleading to rely on results based on constant-parameter linear models that assume that the relationship between the U.S. returns and those of other industrialized countries are permanent, since the relationship is, in fact, time-varying, and holds only at specific periods.","[Aye, Goodness C.; Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Balcilar, Mehmet] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, Northern Cyprus, Turkey",University of Pretoria; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Aye, G (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",goodness.aye@gmail.com; Mehmet@mbalcilar.net; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196",,,,,37,23,23,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2017,44.0,1,,,,,121,146,,10.1007/s10663-015-9313-3,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EJ2NV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393048000005,0

Among other results, we find that if interstate mobility is costless, internal enforcement is overprovided, and border enforcement and local goods are underprovided when regions take more responsibility in deciding policies. This leads to higher levels of unauthorized immigration under decentralization. Interregional migration costs moderate such over/underprovision. Moreover, income distributive motives in the host country may shape the design of immigration policies in specific ways. The basic model is extended in several ways. First, we study how the policies change when regions can exclude unauthorized immigrants from the consuming of regionally provided goods or services. Second, we assume that the potential number of unauthorized immigrants is endogenous. And finally, we examine the effect of considering an alternative spatial configuration that includes border and interior regions.","[Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Pinto, Santiago M.] Fed Reserve Bank Richmond, Richmond, VA USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Richmond,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",Subhayu.Bandyopadhyay@stls.frb.org; Santiago.Pinto@rich.frb.org,"Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016","Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/0000-0003-1626-6543; Pinto, Santiago/0000-0002-7911-7257",,,,,28,5,5,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0014-2921,1873-572X,,EUR ECON REV,Eur.

We construct a dynamic general equilibrium model with multi-region, multi-sector set-up where labor is a mobile input, which adjusts to regional and sectoral productivity shocks, resulting in migration across regions. The proposed model generates a migration network where the flow of migrants between any two regions follows a gravity equation. We calibrate the model to the U.S. data and we find that variation in industrial and regional total factor productivity shocks explains about 63% of the interstate migration in the U.S. Finally, we perform comparative statics to estimate the effects of long-run structural changes on migration. We find that capital intensity of the production process and the demand for services over manufactured goods negatively impact aggregate level of migration whereas asymmetries in trade patterns do not appear to have substantial effects.","[Chakrabarti, Anindya S.] Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India; [Sengupta, Aparna] Bates White Econ Consulting, Washington, DC 20005 USA",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad,"Chakrabarti, AS (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Econ Area, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",anindyac@iima.ac.in; aparna.sengupta@bateswhite.com,,,,,,,35,6,7,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We develop an integrated micro-macro model framework that is based on household survey data for a subset of the EU countries that the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) contains. We use the model for the purpose of assessing the efficacy of borrower-based macroprudential instruments, namely loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt service to income (DSTI) ratio caps, and illustrate its outcome for four European countries. The simulation results from the model can be attached to bank balance sheets and their risk parameters to derive the impact of the policy measures on their capital position. The model framework also allows quantifying the macroeconomic feedback effects that would result from the policy-induced reduction of demand for mortgage loans.

Here, firm-level data from 2001 to 2007 were used to determine how this change in land policy has affected firms' investments and housing prices. Results have shown that cities in which land-use quotas decreased experienced faster housing price growth than the cities in which land-use quotas increased after 2003. This sharp change in policy also highlighted two major channels of the effects of housing prices on investment by firms. The results show that higher housing prices increased firms' investment by providing a source of more valuable collateral, while crowding out fixed capital investment. The net effect of housing prices on investment is negative and limiting economic growth.","[Han, Libin] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Lu, M (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",luming1973@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Han, Libin/0000-0003-2427-3866","China's National Social Science Funds [13ZD015, 12AZD045]; National Natural Science Funds [71273289, 71133004]; Fudan Lab for China Development Studies",China's National Social Science Funds; National Natural Science Funds(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fudan Lab for China Development Studies,"The study was supported by China's National Social Science Funds [13&ZD015], [12AZD045]; National Natural Science Funds [71273289], [71133004]; and Fudan Lab for China Development Studies.",,17,32,41,2,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

We begin to answer this question through a laboratory experiment in which subjects play two public goods games simultaneously. We systematically vary the incentives for contributing in one of the games - investigating the effects of recognition, a bonus conditional on contributing, and non - monetary sanctions - and measure the effect on contributions in both games. Monetary incentives in the form of conditional bonuses increase contributions, even when two games are played simultaneously. However, non - monetary incentives such as recognition and sanctions are less effective than in related literature on games played in isolation. Moreover, we find mixed evidence of a treatment spillover on the un-treated games - bonuses increase contributions initially, recognition decreases contributions, and sanctions have no effect.

We provide a framework that may help researchers to evaluate and improve structural models of market power. Starting with the specification of the approaches in question, we compare published empirical studies of market power with respect to the choice of the applied approach, functional forms, estimation methods and derived estimates of the degree of market power. Thereafter, we use our framework to evaluate several structural models based on PTA and GIM to measure oligopsony power in the Ukrainian dairy industry. The PTA-based results suggest that the estimated parameters of oligopsony power are significantly different from zero, while GIM-based results do not indicate any evidence of oligopsony market power in the Ukrainian dairy industry.

J,"Schneider, P; Bose, G",,,,"Schneider, Patrick; Bose, Gautam",,,Organizational Cultures of Corruption,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMIC THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CRIME,"Systematic differences in the incidence of corruption between countries can be explained by models of coordination failure that suggest that corruption can only be reduced by a big push across an entire economy. However, there is significant evidence that corruption is often sustained as an organizational culture, and can be combated with targeted effort in individual organizations one at a time. In this paper, we propose a model that reconciles these two theories of corruption. We explore a model of corruption with two principal elements. First, agents suffer a moral cost if their corruption behavior diverges from the level they perceive to be the social norm; second, the perception of the norm is imperfect; it gives more weight to the behavior of colleagues with whom the agent interacts regularly. This leads to the possibility that different organizations within the same country may stabilize at widely different levels of corruption. Furthermore, the level of corruption in an organization is persistent, implying that some organizations may have established internal cultures of corruption. The organizational foci are determined primarily by the opportunities and (moral) costs of corruption. Depending on the values of these parameters, the degree of corruption across departments may be relatively uniform or widely dispersed. These results also explain another surprising empirical observation: that in different countries similar government departments such as tax and education rank very differently relative to each other in the extent to which they are corrupt. This is difficult to explain in incentive-based models if similar departments face similar incentives in different countries.","[Schneider, Patrick; Bose, Gautam] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Schneider, P (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",schneider.patrick.m@gmail.com; g.bose@unsw.edu.au,,"Bose, Gautam/0000-0002-5573-3055",,,,,25,8,12,1,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Based on the feedback from over 319,000 visitors at 791 locations, we create an index that shows the extent to which World Heritage sites are actually branding themselves as such. We find great heterogeneity throughout the list and explain this econometrically with site-specific incentives. Notably, the sites that benefit more from the World Heritage brand are significantly more willing to contribute to the collective brand than sites that benefit less. Specifically, rural sites are much better branded than urban sites, as rural sites benefit more from the brand than urban sites. We also find a positive relationship between World Heritage branding and its conservation status and a U-shaped relationship between a site's visitor numbers and its branding. Furthermore, Asian sites are much better branded than sites in the Middle East, and richer countries and those with already more international tourists are branded less. The difficulty of effective branding, e.g., for large, open-access sites, has no significant effect. Our findings suggest that mandatory World Heritage branding obligations would have a positive effect on the World Heritage brand equity, bringing conservation and economic benefits to a much wider range of World Heritage sites.","[Wuepper, David] Tech Univ Munich, Prod & Resource Econ, WZW, Alte Akad 14,Room 41, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Patry, Marc] UNESCO, Off Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya",Technical University of Munich,"Wuepper, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Prod & Resource Econ, WZW, Alte Akad 14,Room 41, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",david.wuepper@tum.de,,"Wuepper, David/0000-0002-1344-6023",,,,,35,34,36,1,70,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

This paper studies China's provincial research activities with a focus on the spillover-induced productivity and efficiency change. The results show that spillovers as a result of inflow of foreign investment contribute positively to the performance of overall research activities, however, the productivity effects vary across regions. Our analysis also indicates that highly skewed distribution of FDI leads to a less improved innovation efficiency in FDI-rich provinces. Future innovation policy should adjust the investment profiles based on the preferential innovation output on one hand, and optimize the complementary policy for FDI on the other hand to reduce inefficiency and the potential negative effects of knowledge spillovers. Inter-provincial governmental cooperation is necessary to resolve the uneven distribution of FDI and improve the innovation efficiency in both FDI-poor and rich regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measure was used to compare poverty levels among households using a mechanized cassava processing system against those households using a nonmechanized process. Based on the FGT poverty measure's specifications, a significantly lower poverty status of 49% was found among households using the mechanized process when compared to the 58% found among households using the nonmechanized process. The significant factors contributing to these differences in poverty levels include whether households are using a mechanized process or not, the number of years' schooling among household members, the number of years' farming experience, household income and membership of associations. The study concludes that the mechanization of cassava processing, particularly if done on the right scale, can transform primary production activities, in turn leading to higher incomes and reduced poverty levels in rural villages. Thus, policies should be introduced aimed at encouraging the promotion of mechanized post-harvest cassava processing technologies among rural households, so as to enhance crop productivity and household income levels, as well as reduce poverty among rural households.","[Abass, Adebayo; Bachwenkizi, Beatrice; Alenkhe, Bamidele] Int Inst Trop Agr IITA, Reg Hub Eastern Africa, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Amaza, Paul] Univ Jos, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Jos, Nigeria; [Mukuka, Ivor] Zambia Agr Res Inst, Mt Makulu Res Stn, Lusaka, Zambia; [Cromme, Nicolaus] Common Fund Commod, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Jos,"Amaza, P (通讯作者)，Univ Jos, Dept Agr Econ & Extens, Jos, Nigeria.",amazap@unijos.edu.ng,,,Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) in the Netherlands [CFC/FIGG 43],Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) in the Netherlands,The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) in the Netherlands: [Grant Number CFC/FIGG 43].,,16,5,5,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Thus, for policy purposes, it is important to know whether a country's export basket enjoys these productive opportunities. They have been associated with technological content of exports. However, measuring them is not easy. Previous methodologies to account for exports' technological content used either R&D data or trade data. The former is used to account for knowledge-intensive activities during the production phase and the latter to identify levels of 'sophistication' of exports based on exporting countries' characteristics. Building on these contributions, this paper combines industry-based and product-based indicators to circumvent some of the shortcomings of the received literature, including the product-industry controversy (i.e. are the actual activities during the production process or the product characteristics what better accounts exports' technological content?). We use data from Uruguay on direct and indirect R&D spending from public and private sources and also trade data to build the sophistication index corrected by quality. We contrast our findings with existing methodologies to highlight our contribution.","[Aboal, Diego; Rovira, Flavia] Ctr Invest Econ CINVE, Uruguay 1242, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Aboal, Diego] Univ ORT Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Aboal, Diego] Univ Republica, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Arza, Valeria] Tres de Febrero Univ UNTREF, Natl Sci & Tech Res Council CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Arza, Valeria] Tres de Febrero Univ UNTREF, Res Ctr Transformat CENIT, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","University ORT Uruguay; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay; Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","Aboal, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Invest Econ CINVE, Uruguay 1242, Montevideo, Uruguay.",aboal@cinve.org.uy,,"Aboal, Diego/0000-0002-6217-962X",Uruguay XXI (the Uruguayan export promotion agency),Uruguay XXI (the Uruguayan export promotion agency),"This paper is based on a previous work financed by Uruguay XXI (the Uruguayan export promotion agency).

This study has used two-step process for this analysis. Firstly, we applied the Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) to examine the overall efficiency trend of commercial banks. We used the value added approach for the selection of input and output variables for the first time in Pakistan to examine the cost and,profit efficiency of commercial banks. It is suggested that in developing countries with low savings of people, higher cost of deposits and high competition to attract larger number of deposits, it is inappropriate to place deposits as outputs instead of inputs by following an intermediation approach. The results suggested that the profit and cost efficiency of banks is slightly improved over the study period. Secondly, the association of various firm specific variables along with financial reforms and financial crises with the efficiency of the commercial banks is investigated. Tobit analysis results indicated that variables like size, profitability, equity and an increase in the minimum capital requirement are found to be positively related whereas the provision for advances (loans) is found to be negatively related with the efficiency of commercial banks in Pakistan. It can be concluded that the large size, higher solvency and increase in minimum capital requirement has helped the commercial banks to operate at an optimum level.","[Afza, Talat] Govt Sadiq Coll Women Univ, Bahawalpur, Pakistan; [Asghar, Muhammad Jam-e-Kausar Ali] Univ Sargodha, Dept Business Admin & Commerce, Gujranwala, Pakistan",,"Afza, T (通讯作者)，Govt Sadiq Coll Women Univ, Bahawalpur, Pakistan.",,,,,,,,54,10,13,2,13,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Although considered as a developed market, the Australian Securities Exchange merits separate investigation, as it is small and concentrated on some sectors, when compared with the major developed markets. As realized returns are a proxy for expected returns, we separately examine conditional returns in upturn and downturn periods. We find that both downside risks are separately priced by investors, and that our results are unaffected by the inclusion of a range of company characteristics. We subsequently confirm that returns to each downside risk are not related. In robustness tests, we conclude that the return to downside risk cannot be explained by a size, a value, or a momentum premium. Although it also has explanatory power, the inclusion of a leverage factor also does not reduce the explanatory power of downside risk.","[Alles, Lakshman] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA, Australia; [Murray, Louis] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Dublin 4, Ireland",Curtin University; University College Dublin,"Murray, L (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Dublin 4, Ireland.",louis.murray@ucd.ie,,,,,,,36,13,13,2,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In other words, we investigate if there is market integration between wild and farmed gilthead seabream and European seabass. In order to do this analysis, we use data from the main gilthead seabream and European seabass markets in Spain. The results show that there is no market integration between wild and farmed gilthead seabream and European seabass.

The key innovation of this paper is the documentation of how these relationships have evolved over time. We present a new method to combine econometric analysis and index decomposition analysis to examine household energy transition. This approach also allows us to consider a broad range of demographic and structural factors, while providing a clear and concise representation of our findings. We find that the composite indices mask important underlying patterns. In particular, our results indicate that energy transition in Indonesia cannot be confidently attributed to any one index. Rather, it has been driven predominantly by the triple interaction of demographics, income growth, and change in demand/supply parameters. Our findings point to the importance of utilizing time-series data in studying both the characteristics and determinants of energy transition in developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Different econometric models are used to give a quantitative measure of the TRIPs agreement to reduce air pollution. In particular, the impact of the TRIPs is addressed using a dummy variable and the index of Ginarte and Park (Ginarte, Park 1997) that is one of the more commonly used indicators of TRIPs enforcement employed in economic literature. The findings of this research partially support the idea that the strengthening of a uniform minimum standard protection level of IPR, among the member countries of the World Trade Organization, may help to reduce air pollution emissions.","[Di Vita, Giuseppe] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95128 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Di Vita, G (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95128 Catania, Italy.",gdivita@lex.unict.it,"Di+Vita, Giuseppe/AAD-9924-2020","Di Vita, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1916-1544",,,,,73,4,4,5,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Since the EU ETS is the primary example of an ETS where the regions, that is the member states (MS), are at very different levels of development like the regions are in China, there should be some lessons to be learned. First of all the EU ETS is clearly not a success story, since there is a very low carbon price having a very small effect on emissions if any at all. That rises the questions of alternative methods, in particular a carbon tax instead of an ETS. Secondly there are several issues of governance; in particular the tension between the member states themselves and the EU Commission. Who take the lead, who decides in the final end?

Such indexes typically consist of inflation, growth, employment and long-term interest rates. We develop such an index by appending exchange rate and weighting each variable by the inverse of its variance in order to prevent the more volatile variable to dominate the index. We call this macroeconomic performance index (MPI) and argue that such an index better explains the overall economic stance especially in emerging economies. We generate the index using data from three emerging economies, namely Turkey, Brazil and Poland. Our analysis indicates that the index has a nonlinear structure and hence we analyse its behaviour using threshold autoregressive (TAR) model. It is observed that MPI captures the economic stance and main economic incidents quite successfully in each subject country. To further see the relevance of the MPI, we run TAR cointegration analysis with consumer confidence indexes (CCIs) for the subject countries with TAR cointegration test. The results indicate long-term relationship between the MPI and CCI in all three countries.","[Ekren, Nazim; Alp, Elcin Aykac; Yagmur, Mete Han] Istanbul Commerce Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Ticaret University,"Alp, EA (通讯作者)，Istanbul Commerce Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",ealp@ticaret.edu.tr,"Yağmur, Mete Han/ABA-7609-2020; ALP, ELÇİN AYKAÇ/M-9150-2019; Ekren, Nazım/ABE-2423-2020","Yağmur, Mete Han/0000-0002-7630-6335; ALP, ELÇİN AYKAÇ/0000-0001-9076-2102; Ekren, Nazım/0000-0002-7550-1673",,,,,29,4,4,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The data set covers daily exchange rates and long-term foreign currency sovereign ratings, outlooks and watch list. The pairwise time-varying correlations are derived by corrected Dynamic Conditional Correlation (cDCC) modelling which is a member of multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models family. Furthermore, to capture the global factor effect, a dynamic-weighted index is created by using dynamic principal component (DPC) analysis. Findings suggest that some of the emerging market exchange rate co-movements are affected by rating announcements. Upgrades of Moody's and downgrades of Fitch lead to spillovers. Main source of these spillovers are sovereign credit rating changes of European countries, especially Czech Republic and Turkey. Countries with high amount of external debt, large current account deficit and speculative grade are more prone to be influenced by announcements on a foreign country's long-term sovereign rating.","[Eraslan, Veysel] Borsa Istanbul, Equity Market Dept, Resitpasa Mahallesi,Tuncay Artun Caddesi, TR-34467 Istanbul, Turkey",Borsa Istanbul,"Eraslan, V (通讯作者)，Borsa Istanbul, Equity Market Dept, Resitpasa Mahallesi,Tuncay Artun Caddesi, TR-34467 Istanbul, Turkey.",eraslanv@gmail.com,,"Eraslan, Veysel/0000-0003-0997-818X",,,,,65,9,9,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of this work is to formulate policy recommendations aimed at increasing the number of matches. I use monthly registered unemployment data for the period January 1999-June 2013 and econometrically correct for temporal aggregation bias in the data. I extend known solutions and apply them directly to a job queuing model. Job seekers (from the pool) seek work among old and new job posts, but only a small fraction of the newly unemployed individuals find work quickly. Vacancies are the driving force in aggregate hiring, but the inflow is more important than the stock. The random model has greater explanatory power, although the results do not negate the non-random model. Hence, better information and higher inflows (especially of job offers) should facilitate matching.","[Galecka-Burdziak, Ewa] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Ul Madalinskiego 6-8, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Galecka-Burdziak, E (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Econ 1, Ul Madalinskiego 6-8, Warsaw, Poland.",ewa.galecka-burdziak@sgh.waw.pl,,"Galecka-Burdziak, Ewa/0000-0001-9020-8486",National Science Centre Poland [UMO-2012/05/N/HS4/00194]; Foundation for Polish Science (FNP),"National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Foundation for Polish Science (FNP)(Foundation for Polish Science)","I gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Science Centre Poland, project no.

A Cost Frontier Analysis of Alternative Education Campuses in Texas,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,EFFICIENCY; SCHOOL; UNEMPLOYMENT; VARIABLES; IMPACT,"Previous research on the relative efficiency of charter schools focused on schools that serve a general student population. In Texas, as in many other states, some charter schools have been designed specifically to serve students who are at risk of dropping out of school. Such alternative education campuses may have very different cost and efficiency profiles than schools designed to serve students in regular education programs. In this article, we estimate a translog stochastic cost frontier model using panel data for alternative public high school campuses in Texas over the five-year period 2007-2011, and find that alternative education high school campuses operated by charter schools are systematically more efficient than alternative education high school campuses operated by traditional public school districts. Policies that encourage the formation of alternative education charter campuses may thus be a sensible component of strategies to combat the pervasive and pernicious problem of high school dropouts.","[Gronberg, Timothy J.; Jansen, Dennis W.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Taylor, Lori L.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Publ Serv & Adm, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Serv, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service,"Gronberg, TJ (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, 4228 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",tjg@econmail.tamu.edu; dennisjansen@tamu.edu; lltaylor@tamu.edu,"Taylor, Lori/AAH-2766-2019",,Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean government [NRF-2014S1A3A20444],Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas AM University; National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),Gronberg and Jansen acknowledge research support from the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University.

To that end, spatial panel econometrics is employed. It is empirically proven that the determinants of the regional unemployment disparities are labor force participation rate, young population, industrial mix and educational attainment. Further, it is detected that there is a spatial dependence (spatial autocorrelation) among the regions. In other words, it is discovered that an increase in unemployment rate in a region also affects the unemployment rates of neighboring regions. Spillover effects of independent variables are also estimated. Hereby, the impacts of factors, which determine unemployment in a region, both on that region and neighboring regions are obtained individually.","[Guclu, Mehmet] Ege Univ, Dept Econ & Adm Sci, Izmir, Turkey",Ege University,"Güçlü, M (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Dept Econ & Adm Sci, Izmir, Turkey.",Mehmet.guclu@ege.edu.tr,"Güçlü, Mehmet/HHM-9959-2022","Güçlü, Mehmet/0000-0002-2420-3561",Ege University BAP project [2016-IKT-002],Ege University BAP project(Ege University),This study was financially supported by Ege University BAP project number 2016-IKT-002.,,35,3,3,0,3,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

We find a non-linear threshold effect that: a low-level wage gap threshold exists, below which FDI spillovers are significantly negative. This is because FDI spillovers via labour turnover are blocked due to the low wages of local firms, which jeopardizes the flow of skilled workers from foreign firms to local firms. In contrast, when the wage gap reaches a high-level threshold, local firms can get benefits from FDI spillovers. The reason is that high wages of local firms attract skilled employees to leave foreign firms, which yields a large magnitude of worker mobility from foreign firms to local firms. Our article provides evidence that labour turnover as the channel of FDI spillovers only works when the wage gap is beyond some threshold. Also, these thresholds vary across regions and firm ownerships.","[Huang, Youxing] Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan",Ocean University of China,"Huang, YX (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",huangyouxing@ouc.edu.cn,,"Huang, Youxing/0000-0002-3900-2789; Zhang, Yan/0000-0002-7406-7828",China Scholarship Council (CSC),China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council),This work was supported by China Scholarship Council (CSC).,,33,17,19,3,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In today's Russia, parental labour is of great social importance, yet it lacks prestige and status, and it is virtually unpaid. We believe that this type of labour in contemporary Russia has signs of precarity. The paper presents a methodology for assessing the level of precarity of parental labour and the results of its application. We identified variables that could be viewed as indicators for parental labour precarity. Alongside this, we identified economic, social and organisational conditions for labour. Our research showed an increase in the level of precarity of parental labour in Russia in the last 10 years. The most significant was the negative dynamic for indicators reflecting economic conditions of parental labour. At the same time there was a certain improvement in the organisational conditions for parental labour at the family level. A full understanding of the precarity of parental labour will enable the development of strategies to mitigate this precarity. We believe that overcoming the precarity of parental labour is one of the most important mechanisms for improving the demographic situation and increase in efficiency of human capital reproduction in today's Russia.","[Ilves, Edgar; Bagirova, Anna] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Ilves, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",edgar.ilves@urfu.ru; a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-32-00020],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"The article is processed as one of the outputs of the research project Integration of the parental labor results in Russian pension system, supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, project no. 16-32-00020.",,14,2,2,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,595,604,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300059,0

We find, among others, that the developing country's firm always conducts dumping, but the developed country's firm only does so under a certain condition and that if the two countries' internalization degrees of the pollution externality are the same, the firms' dumping disappears, regardless of product qualities and units of pollution emissions. We also show that a rise in the developed (developing) country's ADD decreases (increases) global pollution and that a rise in a country's ADD always decreases its rival country's welfare, but there is the possibility that it also reduces its own welfare in a certain case.","[Ishii, Yasunori] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Waseda University,"Ishii, Y (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",yishii@waseda.jp,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In the first part of the article the channels of expert influence are described, primarily within the executive branch. Features are found in these channels that mean that impartial advice is not always guaranteed. In the second part, on the basis of a survey of experts, the answers to two questions are sought: whether they feel that impartial advice is expected of them and whether they provide it. There are negative elements in the responses on both counts, suggesting that despite some evidence of demand for such advice on the part of policy-makers, expert advice is often not impartial.","[Jakobson, Lev] Natl Res Univ, Ctr Studies Civil Soc & Nonprofit Sect, Lab Nonprofit Sect Studies, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Jakobson, L (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Ctr Studies Civil Soc & Nonprofit Sect, Lab Nonprofit Sect Studies, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",ljakobson@hse.ru,,,Russian Academic Excellence Project [5-100],"Russian Academic Excellence Project(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian FederationProject 5-100, Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)",The study has been funded by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100'.,,16,3,3,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2017,29.0,4,,,SI,,491,504,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1333792,0.0,,,14,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FN1DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000415724200005,0

Potential interactions between these female characteristics and income inequality are also shown to influence the incidence of violent crime. Empirically, we introduce proxies for female characteristics that better reflect our hypotheses - for example, young unmarried female-headed households (for exposure to crime) and new job gains among females (for economic status). Using a panel of South Korean metropolitan regions, 2000-2011, we find that a certain limited change in these female characteristics could account for as much as 16% of violent crime.","[Kim, Iljoong; Byeon, Jaewook; Lee, Dongwon] Sungkyunkwan Univ SKKU, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ SKKU, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",danlee200@skku.edu,,"Lee, Dongwon/0000-0003-4568-5982",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A2A03049110],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea grant: [Grant Number NRF-2015S1A5A2A03049110].,,81,1,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, recent work has shown that these limitations can be overcome in simple settings, using neurometric technologies that provide noisy signals of subjects' preferences that can be used in the mechanism design problem.

For a qualitative point of view, three examples of analyzed projects are given. The main conclusion is that it failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the chosen indicators. We were unable to verify any statistically important impact on the indicators of profitability and productivity. Further analysis showed a statistically important difference in the profitability indicator one year after subvention use, depending on the value of the subvention.

Women who married after the 1994 genocide experienced significantly increased domestic violence and reduced decision-making power relative to women who married before, with a greater effect for women in localities with high genocide intensity. Additionally, exposure to genocide reduced the household education expenditure in families of women who were of marriageable age after the genocide relative to families of older women. Part of the effect of the genocide on domestic violence was driven by changes in the marriage market sex ratios across localities and over time, which were mainly induced by the conflict. Through changes in intra-household bargaining, civil conflicts may impair the well-being of women and children in the long-term.","[La Mattina, Giulia] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 E Fowler Ave,CMC 206A, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"La Mattina, G (通讯作者)，Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, 4202 E Fowler Ave,CMC 206A, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",glamattina@usf.edu,,,Department of Economics at Boston University,Department of Economics at Boston University,"I am grateful to Daniele Paserman, Claudia Olivetti and Dilip Mookherjee for support and guidance.

One of the key contributions of this study is clarifying the role of diverse entrant strategies and demand conditions in industry dynamics. First, we find that market expansion is favorable to incumbent firms, whereas market fluctuation is favorable to entering firms. Among the three entry strategies, the PC strategy is often best, whereas the PF strategy is the worst. However, the gap in catch-up performance is reduced if the demand condition is of the fluctuating demand variety. Fluctuation of demand works better for PF strategy firms compared with SS and PC firms, which would suffer during downturns, particularly during the early stage of entry. By contrast, the gap between each strategy increases under expanding demand with constant growth rate.","[Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Jonghoon] KBS, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoon, Minho] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Kyungpook National University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151746, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A3A2923769],National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),The authors gratefully acknowledge the support provided by the National Research Foundation of Korea [grant number NRF-2016S1A3A2923769].,,59,6,6,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

In particular, the ideas advanced by Hayek in his 1952 book, The Sensory Order can be used to provide an account of the mind that avoids the shortcomings of Shackle's Cartesianism whilst still doing justice to his emphasis on genuine choice, expectations and the role of creativity and the imagination in human decision-making.","[Lewis, Paul] Kings Coll London, London, England",University of London; King's College London,"Lewis, P (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, London, England.",paul.lewis@kcl.ac.uk,,"Lewis, Paul Andrew/0000-0003-4367-7233",,,,,55,18,20,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The objective of the article is to provide empirical evidence and raise awareness regarding the relationship between crime and socioeconomic factors in Romania over the period 1990-2014, based on statistics for testing co-integration theory and causal relationships. Specifically, the proposed analysis intends to capture the complexity of socioeconomic pressures on individuals and to clarify the ways in which the vitiation of modern society represents a manifestation of implemented economic mechanisms. By using data related to income, unemployment, inflation, inequality, development, education and population density as socioeconomic factors and also data on crime divided by region and type, the article supports the hypothesis of significant causality between socioeconomic factors and crime. Two directions can be considered for revealing the general result of the proposed analysis: one is that an increase in income inequality has a strong and robust effect regarding crime rates rising, and the second reveals that the place of residence is essential, the urban agglomeration being a generating factor for crime.","[Lobont, Oana-Ramona; Nicolescu, Ana-Cristina; Moldovan, Nicoleta-Claudia] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania; [Kuloglu, Ayhan] Univ Nevsehir, Vocat High Sch, Nevsehir, Turkey",West University of Timisoara; Ministry of National Education - Turkey; Nevsehir Haci Bektas Veli University,"Nicolescu, AC (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Timisoara, Romania.",cristina.nicolescu@e-uvt.ro,"NICOLESCU, ANA-CRISTINA/GOH-0345-2022; Kuloğlu, Ayhan/AAB-8487-2020; Lobont, Oana-Ramona/AAP-8584-2020; Moldovan, Nicoleta Claudia/ADP-3323-2022; Lobont, Oana Ramona/AHA-3609-2022; ANA-CRISTINA, NICOLESCU/AAD-2003-2022","NICOLESCU, ANA-CRISTINA/0000-0003-0659-4789; Moldovan, Nicoleta Claudia/0000-0002-1916-2638; Lobont, Oana Ramona/0000-0002-2942-3715; ANA-CRISTINA, NICOLESCU/0000-0003-0659-4789","Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway Transnational cooperation for research consolidation through knowledge and innovation transfer - KnowReset [14-SEE-PC-RO TIMISOA01]; EEA Financial Mechanism [2/21/07.2014, 2/24/07.2015]; Opportunities and Challenges for Tertiary Educational System in Promoting Evidence-Informed Good Governance Society - ActiveGovEdu [15-SEE-PC-RO TIMISOA01]","Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway Transnational cooperation for research consolidation through knowledge and innovation transfer - KnowReset; EEA Financial Mechanism; Opportunities and Challenges for Tertiary Educational System in Promoting Evidence-Informed Good Governance Society - ActiveGovEdu","This work was supported by a grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the project 14-SEE-PC-RO TIMISOA01 Transnational cooperation for research consolidation through knowledge and innovation transfer - KnowReset co-funded from the EEA Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 - Inter-institutional cooperation projects, Contract no. 2/21/07.2014 and the project 15-SEE-PC-RO TIMISOA01 Opportunities and Challenges for Tertiary Educational System in Promoting Evidence-Informed Good Governance Society - ActiveGovEdu co-funded from the EEA Financial Mechanism 2009-2014 - Inter-institutional cooperation projects, Contract no. 2/24/07.2015.",,43,13,15,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In this period, these nontraditional interventions were the main FX instrument of the Brazilian Government. Since the central bank operates through a sequence of daily interventions in most of the period, we employ the event study method, which is appropriate to investigate cumulative impact of intervention episodes. We analyse the effects on the risk neutral distribution of BRL-USD exchange rate, which incorporates economic valuation besides the likelihoods. We investigate both changes in level and in the dynamics of the moments. Our tests indicate that interventions have little effects on the exchange rate distribution. We only find evidences of some impact on the dynamics of the mean, volatility and skewness over long horizons when the central bank takes short positions on the exchange rate.","[Moura Marins, Jaqueline Terra; Araujo, Gustavo Silva; Machado Vicente, Jose Valentim] Cent Bank Brazil, Ave Presidente Vargas 730, BR-20071900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Central Bank of Brazil,"Marins, JTM (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Brazil, Ave Presidente Vargas 730, BR-20071900 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",jaqueline.terra@bcb.gov.br,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The empirical analysis is restricted to men and is based on matched employer-employee microdata and the decomposition techniques of Juhn etal. (1991, 1993) and Fortin etal. (2011). Our results show that the significant native-immigrant wage gap that exists both in terms of average wages and of differentials along the wage distribution is essentially explained by differences in the endowments of observed characteristics so that, in general, immigrants tend to receive a similar wage treatment than Spaniards with analogous observed attributes. On the other hand, the Great Recession has had a noticeable impact on the relative wages of immigrants, given that the significant increase of the native-immigrant wage gap observed during the previous expansionary period was mitigated during the economic downturn due to composition effects arising from the severe employment destruction pattern.","Univ Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain; Univ Alicante, San Vicente Del Raspeig, Alicante, Spain",Universidad de Extremadura; Universitat d'Alacant,"Murillo-Huertas, IP (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Avda Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.;Simón, H (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, IEI, IEB, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Carretera San Vicente del Raspeig S-N, San Vicente Del Raspeig 03690, Alicante, Spain.",ihuertas@unex.es; hsimon@ua.es,"Simon, Hipolito/K-8807-2014","Simon, Hipolito/0000-0001-7668-307X",,,,,94,5,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

A change of country's position in these rankings can be seen as a signal of future economic potential and opportunities for further development and growth. The reliability of this prediction, however, depends on the quality of the model applied for the international comparison. In every composite indicator analysis, the final index is the outcome of a number of choices: the framework (usually driven by theoretical models and experts' opinions), the indicators to be included, their normalization, the weights assigned to each indicator, and the aggregation method. The discussion about one clear definition of the term national competitiveness is not closed and has not one unambiguous generally accepted result. Different institutions stress different aspects of the competitiveness phenomenon and use different groups of indicators, different methods of normalization, and different aggregation methods. It is clear that countries' results are influenced by the aforementioned steps of construction of composite indicators. Taking into account the essence and the methodology of the Porter's Diamond model (SD model) and the Nine-factor model (9F model), we construct our own simple models. The main aim of this paper is to identify the similarities and differences between these two models and to discuss the suitability of these models for countries with different economic characteristics. Our discussion is based on the evaluation of the results of the Visegrad group countries (V4), which are then compared to the results of Germany.","[Necadova, Marta] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Necadová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",necadova@vse.cz,,,Faculty of Business Administration [IP 300040],Faculty of Business Administration,This article is provided as one of the outputs of the research project of the Faculty of Business Administration IP 300040 Competitiveness.,,14,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1012,1023,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300101,0

Just two decades ago, Vietnam had a level of per capita income and structural characteristics similar to many African economies. In the meantime, Vietnam has with great success taken a very different policy stance than typical in Africa. This is especially so in promoting export-oriented industry. If learning by exporting is a key driver of progress, then a fundamental reason for Africa's lack of transformation is likely to be the low policy priority given to export promotion in the past. To enlarge the body of empirical evidence, we use an extensive 2005-2012 firm-level panel data set from Vietnam and separate out productivity effects of exporting due to self-selection. This allows us to conclude that firms actually learn by exporting. We also examine how this learning takes place. Our findings suggest that productivity gains are associated with moving to larger scale for foreign-owned firms with little evidence of subsequent learning on export markets. We find strong evidence to suggest that private domestic firms learn and accumulate knowledge from export markets with learning attributed in some part to within-firm innovations, in particular research and development. These mechanisms are highly relevant to African countries where market size, innovation and research are seriously constrained.","[Newman, Carol] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Econ, Dublin, Ireland; [Rand, John; Tarp, Finn] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Tarp, Finn] UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland; [Nguyen Thi Tue Anh] Cent Inst Econ Management, Hanoi, Vietnam",Trinity College Dublin; University of Copenhagen,"Tarp, F (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark.;Tarp, F (通讯作者)，UNU WIDER, Helsinki, Finland.",Tarp@wider.unu.edu,"Newman, Carol/J-6421-2012; Tarp, Finn/T-9651-2017","Newman, Carol/0000-0002-1785-0891; Tarp, Finn/0000-0002-6247-4370",,,,,40,12,14,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The observed data are decomposed into idiosyncratic and common components, and these two components are analysed separately to find out the driving forces of the long-run stationary relationship.

Individuals have private information about contribution costs. Individuals can each make a discrete contribution. If the number of contributors is at least equal to the threshold, a public benefit accrues to all members of the group. We experimentally implement three different communication structures prior to the decision move: (a) simultaneous exchange of binary messages, (b) larger finite numerical message space and (c) unrestricted text chat. We obtain theoretical bounds on the efficiency gains that are obtainable under these different communication structures. In an experiment with three person groups and a threshold of two, we observe significant efficiency gains only with the richest of these communication structures, where participants engage in unrestricted text chatting. In that case, the efficiency bounds implied by mechanism design theory are achieved.

The results show some differences between the manufacturing and service sector. Controlling for various sources of firm heterogeneity, the global sourcing probability is increasing in the firms' share of employees with Internet access in the manufacturing sector. E-commerce-intensive firms are more likely to source inputs from abroad but generally, this relationship between e-commerce and global sourcing is only robust in services and much stronger there than in manufacturing. In both sectors, it is strongest in industries with higher upstream industry diversity. Moreover, labour productivity is positively linked to global sourcing.

Trust was defined as a delegatory relationship based on anticipation of the delegatee's behaviour. We reached four main conclusions. First, the solution to the problem posed by the indeterminacy of trust lies in the differentiation and hierarchisation of the various forms of trust-contractual, organisational and tacit-on the basis of their degree of irreversibility and stability. Second, contractual trust is unstable because it comes up against the problem of guarantees of individual intentions. This leads to the third conclusion: rational evaluation by individuals cannot by itself establish trust, which is based on collective beliefs, practices and rules. Fourth, we identified two conditions for the stability of trust: the creation of irreversibilities through adherence to a rule and the creation of a 'confidence interval' within which different interpretations of contradictory individual strategies are tolerated. Thus the viability of the various forms of trust depends on the ability of institutions and organisations to create rules that are likely, when applied, to produce an interval in which tolerance of mutual intentions is the norm. These analyses of trust hence highlight the role of time and period of time in the notion of trust.","[Reynaud, Benedicte] PSL Res Univ, Dauphine Univ, Inst Rech Interdisciplinaire Sci Soci IRISSO, UMR7170, Pl Marechal Lattre Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Reynaud, B (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, Dauphine Univ, Inst Rech Interdisciplinaire Sci Soci IRISSO, UMR7170, Pl Marechal Lattre Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",benedicte.reynaud@dauphine.fr,,,,,,,77,6,6,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, little is known about its time-varying aspects by now. In this article, a multivariate DCC- GARCH framework is employed to study dynamics of sectoral comovement across manufacturing sectors both in the United States and in Germany. To account for possible nonlinearities, asymmetric effects in conditional volatilities as well as in conditional correlations are being assessed. We find that comovement across sectors is not stable but shows irregular movements. Particularly, contractions tend to be more synchronized than expansions in manufacturing sector. Moreover, we examine the role of various aggregate factors for the fluctuations in conditional correlations. Our findings reveal that both the non-constant variability of common factors and the changes in the effects of these factors play role for the fluctuations in sectoral comovement.","[Sandqvist, Anna Pauliina] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21 LEE, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Sandqvist, AP (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Leonhardstr 21 LEE, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",sandqvist@kof.ethz.ch,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of COO effect on consumer's attitude to a product and how it depends on COO effect's moderators in the Lithuanian market. Theoretical analysis reveals that COO effect on consumer's attitude to a product depends on moderating effects of consumer experience and product knowledge, consumer ethnocentricity, consumer product involvement, consumer perceived product risk and a product brand. The quantitative research method - online questionnaire survey - was chosen as an appropriate method to collect research data. The correlation analysis was used to estimate the relationship of COO effect, its moderators and a consumer's attitude to a product. Further, the data have been analysed using a stepwise regression method in order to verify the hypotheses of our research. The findings showed that a consumer's attitude to a product is strongly influenced by COO effect. A consumer's attitude to a product is also influenced by COO effect moderators, which are product knowledge and product involvement. Analyzing the results of empirical research it can also be noticed that in this research case, when respondents evaluated their attitude to products made in foreign countries, one of COO effect moderators analyzed in theory, a consumer's ethnocentricity, did not have influence on a consumer's attitude to a product. The original contribution of this article is that it investigates the moderating effects of consumer ethnocentricity, product involvement, and product knowledge on the relationship between COO effect and consumer's attitude to a product in an emerging market.","[Sliburyte, Laimona] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Social Sci Econ, K Donelaicio St 73,04S, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bankauskiene, Giedre] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Econ, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Sliburyte, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Business, Dept Mkt, Social Sci Econ, K Donelaicio St 73,04S, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Laimona.sliburyte@ktu.lt; g.viskantaite@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,21,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It has two advantages for planning economic development. First, while it is labor intensive, asset-mapping implementation is straightforward. Second, it yields information useful to establish, inform, and achieve policy goals. Its limitations are (i) a static approach and (ii) the absence of an evolutionary process to evaluate goal attainment and modify future activities. We explore how asset mapping can be embedded into a social fabric matrix for strategic planning and evaluated using economic impact analysis. This sequential, yet two-way iterative process provides an adaptive template for policy assessment, and a qualitative and quantitative predictive framework to evaluate attainment of goals (here to be understood as the criteria for sustainability and justice, as proposed by Underwood, Hackney and Friesner 2015). Asset mapping in the next time period, structured using evaluative outputs of the social fabric matrix and economic impact analysis, can be reemployed creating a new round of inputs for the social fabric matrix and economic impact analysis to assess the extent to which the criteria for sustainability and justice are achieved. Thus, the iterative process becomes purposeful, evolutionary, and pragmatic.","[Underwood, Daniel A.] Peninsula Coll, Econ & Environm Sci, Port Angeles, WA 98362 USA; [Underwood, Daniel A.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Friesner, Dan] North Dakota State Univ, Pharm Practice, Fargo, ND USA; [Friesner, Dan] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; North Dakota State University Fargo; Washington State University,"Underwood, DA (通讯作者)，Peninsula Coll, Econ & Environm Sci, Port Angeles, WA 98362 USA.;Underwood, DA (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",,"Friesner, Daniel/AAK-2377-2020",,,,,,31,6,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In this study, we define immoral disposal as the dumping of waste in a manner that is immoral but not illegal. To detect the existence of immoral disposal, we apply a spatial econometric approach, namely an extended panel spatial Durbin model, to identify the actual spillover effect of garbage pricing in neighbouring municipalities on immoral disposal from the total waste.

At the beginning of this elaboration stands a thematic imbedding of the accreditation procedure within the EU university system. In the following, accreditation procedures are looked upon from the context of the university education policy context with the aim to protect the quality of research and education, thus the origins are to be seen starting with education and the quality itself. The abstraction of accreditation is extended by the PDCA circuit. With the help of the PDCA control circuit, a detailed sequence is made possible, from this result the four most important phases which are further discussed. For the process oriented consideration, the German accreditation system which implements so called life cycle management was introduced. A variety of actors are involved in this accreditation process and from it result information-economic perspectives, which are examined in detail and highlighted where necessary. The critical acknowledgment of the introduced accreditation process flows into the principal agent theory.

We therefore revisit this issue using macroeconomic cross-country panel data for 64 developing economies over the period 2003-2014.

Recently, the Silk Road Economic Belt has attracted the attention of the world. This research focuses on the economic impacts of financial cooperation between different countries along this belt, arguing that the adoption of local currency settlement system is at the initial stage of regional financial cooperation. This research innovatively measures international trade volume, GDP, and welfare among Silk Road and other major countries as a result of financial cooperation through the application of the GTAP model. The results show that, if the local currency settlement system becomes the main model of regional financial cooperation, the appreciation of local currency, e.g. RMB, can increase the GDP in Central Asia, the European countries, and North Africa and optimize the international trade structure in China at the same time. However, the export and import volumes of most industries of the United States, Japan and Australia which do not belong to the Silk Road will suffer from slight declines due to the change of international trade, while their national welfares will increase slightly at the same time. The results have significant implication for relevant researchers, organizations, and government policy makers.","[Zheng, Xiaosong; Jia, Lijun] Shanghai Univ, 20 Cheng Zhong Rd, Shanghai 201899, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,,xiaosong.zheng@shu.edu.cn; jialijun@t.shu.edu.cn,"Zheng, Xiaosong/AAN-7934-2021",,General Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [15BJL080]; Major Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [14AGJ006],General Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science; Major Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science,"This research is funded by the General Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (2015, Project No. 15BJL080) and the Major Project of National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science (2014, Project No. 14AGJ006).",,34,3,3,3,50,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We carry out a field experiment in a unique setting that varies the levels of reciprocity and guilt in an ethical decision. A survey more than one year before the field experiment allows us to compare at the individual level stated unethical behavior with revealed behavior in the same situation in the field. Our results indicate a strong discrepancy between stated and revealed behavior, regardless of the specific treatment in the field experiment. This suggests that, given a natural setting, people may actually behave inconsistently with the way in which they otherwise brand themselves. Our findings raise caution about the interpretation of stated behavioral measures commonly used in research on unethical behavior. In addition, we show that inducing reciprocity and guilt leads to a decrease in unethical behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We distinguish between discretionary and automatic response of primary balance of government actions, as captured by the structural component of public primary balance and by cyclical component of public primary balance. We show the existence of a systematic long-term relationship between debt and structural primary balance supporting the view that the long-term governments' discretionary response to increases in the debt-GDP ratio is negative, that is, governments are not currently taking long-term actions that counteract the increases in debts and do not satisfy the intertemporal budget constraint. In the short term, an asymmetric fiscal policy response exploiting the output gap, by part of the political class of the countries considered, seems to emerge: it intervenes with a new deficit and debt when the output gap is positive, but it does not adopt a symmetrical correction when the situation is reversed.","[Beqiraj, Elton; Fedeli, Silvia; Forte, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Fedeli, S (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",silvia.fedeli@uniromal.it,,,,,,,57,35,37,1,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

This is due to the informational advantage enjoyed by the firm's owners relatively to the workers concerning some circumstances that affect the performance of the firm. We show this both in the case in which each investor owned firm offers labor contracts to single workers who act atomistically and in the case in which each investor owned firm negotiates labor conditions with its workers who act as a group (a 'union').

The baseline result also shows that policy uncertainty shocks tend to raise financial market volatility while political uncertainty shocks tend to lower financial market volatility. Moreover, we find evidence that political uncertainty exerts asymmetric effects on aggregate corporate cash holdings, with a shock tending to raise cash holdings under normal financial conditions and lower cash holdings under tight financial conditions.

An intertemporal model is developed to analyse the effect of an increase in the household formation rate on the housing market. I find that real house prices rise over time if the rate of household formation outstrips the rate of housing supply. Under forward looking expectations, a rising household formation rate could explain rising real house prices relative to the present discounted value of future wages.

In a two-task moral hazard model in which only the agent knows which task is less costly, the agent has an incentive to focus his effort on the less costly task. Opaque schemes, which make a risk-averse agent uncertain about which task will be more highly rewarded, mitigate such gaming but impose more risk. We identify environments in which opaque schemes not only dominate transparent ones, but also eliminate the costs of the agent's hidden information.","[Ederer, Florian] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Holden, Richard] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Meyer, Margaret] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Meyer, Margaret] CEPR, London, England",Yale University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Oxford; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Ederer, F (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",florian.ederer@yale.edu; richard.holden@unsw.edu.au; margaret.meyer@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Ederer, Florian/GPG-1283-2022","Ederer, Florian/0000-0002-3018-7908",Australian Research Council [FT130101159]; Centre for International Financial Regulation at UNSW; Australian Research Council [FT130101159] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Centre for International Financial Regulation at UNSW; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Holden acknowledges the Australian Research Council Future Fellowship FT130101159 and the Centre for International Financial Regulation at UNSW for financial support.,,32,21,26,1,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Moreover, choosing a certain level of human capital, agents can differently affect their endogenous earning ability. Finally, agents differ in their human capital disposition: different agents face a different cost to acquire a certain amount of human capital. In this framework we study the problem of assessing tax reforms when a policy maker wants to reduce inequalities due to unequal skills while accepting inequalities due to diverse preferences. Consistent with the findings of the fair income taxation literature, when evaluating a tax reform, in order to obtain a social improvement one should always give priority to agents with the most disadvantaged characteristics who work full time. However, in our framework, this corresponds to a whole range of earnings depending on the corresponding level of human capital. We show how subsidies on human capital affect the level of earnings that gets most priority in order to single out more precisely the population that should be the focus of the reform. Relying on these findings we also study the shape of the optimal tax function.","[Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Valletta, Giacomo] EDHEC Business Sch, 24 Ave Gustave Delory, F-59100 Roubaix, France",Princeton University; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Valletta, G (通讯作者)，EDHEC Business Sch, 24 Ave Gustave Delory, F-59100 Roubaix, France.",giacomo.valletta@edhec.edu,"Fleurbaey, Marc/HHS-9231-2022",,Institute for Global Studies (Paris),Institute for Global Studies (Paris),"We thank the associate editor, two anonymous referees, Francois Maniquet, Paolo Piacquadio, and Emmanuel Saez for comments and suggestions, as well as seminar and conference participants at CORE, Institute for Global Studies, Luiss, the Social Choice and Welfare Meeting 2012 (New Delhi) and the ASSA meeting 2013 (San Diego).

A standard labor supply framework implies a negative effect of the nonpecuniary cost of work on the employee's effort. In contrast, a model of worker morale that is consistent with a widely used theory of Akerlof and Yellen (QJE, 1990) predicts this negative effect is stronger (weaker) for low-morale (high-morale) workers. We exploit a natural experiment design of a firm relocation from Milwaukee's Central Business District to the area's suburban ring in 1992. There is an exogenous source of variation on the adjusted commuting distance among those who stay at the firm. Some workers received a windfall gain, whereas other workers experienced an unforeseen cost in longer commuting time. The estimates suggest that low-morale workers are responsive to the shock in commuting time for some of the dimensions of morale. We conclude that the results give some indication of the model of worker morale.","[Hassink, Wolter H. J.] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hassink, Wolter H.

We analyze a series of multi-stakeholder innovation workshops at the health care social enterprise group Helsinki Deaconess Institute in Finland from 2012 to 2014 and the mediated results of the workshops. Journalists were part of all three stages in the innovation process: the creation of a holding space for innovation, creating concrete innovations, and communicating the outcomes at the level of mass communication. We suggest the model of participatory solutions journalism that could, in part, help open the gridlock journalism faces with corroding legitimacy from the outside and resistance to innovation from the inside. Our study builds on previous research suggesting that journalism should be seen as the fourth strand of the innovation ecosystem elements alongside the industry, the academia, and the government (Carayannis and Campell 2012; Bast et al. 2015). We add to this literature the finding that such a co-creating role can be supported by dialogic organizational development methods (Scharmer and Kaufer 2013; Bohm et al. 1991; Bohm 1996; Senge 1990).

The tiers are defined by the ranks in pairwise competitions. The second-tier trap (STT) is a situation in which a player from the second-tier environment has the worst expected payoff even though his expected environmental support is strictly greater than that of the third-tier player. A sufficient condition for the STT is that the ex-ante advantages, the winning probabilities when all the players exert the same amount of effort regardless of their environment, are the same for those two environments. I claim that this sufficient condition for the STT is so weak that players can easily be tempted to choose the second-tier environment, which is the wrong decision.

The empirical analysis shows that individual stock liquidity co-moves to a high degree with market liquidity and industry liquidity. Market-wide commonality is found to be stronger than industry-wide commonality for most liquidity measures. Commonality is further found to be greater in heavy manufacturing than in consumer goods, financial services, or infrastructure sectors. For most stocks, up markets show a stronger degree of commonality than down markets. Finally, short-run commonality is found to exceed long-run commonality, which suggests greater presence of noise traders in short run. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The model is used to assess the response of China's carbon emissions to environmental tax shocks. The core of the model establishes an exponential function of environmental taxes that are mapped against the share of fossil energy in the total energy use. The model parameters are obtained through a combination of calibration and Bayesian estimation. Using the impulse response analysis and variance decomposition, we find that environmental tax shocks can drive the reduction of carbon emissions in China. However, the mitigating effect of the environmental tax shocks can be weakened by some other exogenous shocks, and that China's carbon emissions are likely to grow over a long period of time. Moreover, environmental tax shocks can improve energy structure by promoting the introduction of clean energy which can reduce carbon emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the impacts of industrial structure transitions on CO2 emissions and reveal significant impacts across the three provinces. Machinery and light manufacturing have shown rapid growth, and their CO2 emissions related to CO2 intensity and production structure changes have exhibited a significant decline. However, traditional carbon-intensive industries such as resource-related manufacturing and mining still emit a large amount of CO2 and existing improvements in production structure are far from sufficient. Construction is one of the largest and fastest growing emitters, yet improvements in CO2 intensity and production structure have only been observed in Liaoning and Jilin. In conclusion, changing the industrial structure is helping northeastern China mitigate their CO2 emissions; however, more effective and targeted strategies are required for sustainable future industrial development.

A major structural change occurred in the beginning of the century as GVCs steadily turned into global networks, amid an unprecedented growth of value-added flows and the rise of China as a major player. First-order network metrics highlight the vital but also distinct roles of Germany, the US, China and Japan in the international organisation of production. Germany is very relevant both as a user and as a supplier of foreign inputs, whilst the US acts mostly as a supplier of value added to other countries. Second-order properties of networks shed light on the complex architecture of GVCs, notably in terms of cyclical triangular relationships. Germany's GVCs mostly root in direct relationships, whilst Japanese ones typically involve more than two countries.","[Amador, Joao; Cabral, Sonia] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Amador, Joao] Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mastrandrea, Rossana] IMT Sch Adv Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy; [Ruzzenenti, Franco] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Ruzzenenti, Franco] Parthenope Univ Naples, Naples, Italy",Banco de Portugal; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; University of Groningen; Parthenope University Naples,"Cabral, S (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal.",jamador@bportugal.pt; scabral@bportugal.pt; rossmastrandrea@gmail.com; f.ruzzenenti@rug.nl,"Mastrandrea, Rossana/HME-0486-2023; Ruzzenenti, Franco/C-5431-2015","Cabral, Sonia/0000-0002-6315-6745; Ruzzenenti, Franco/0000-0001-7903-0920",,,,,65,15,16,4,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Using a sample of 223 listed firms targeted by SWFs over the 2000-2014 period (among which 73 are targeted by SWFs owned by Arab countries), we find that, in comparison to non-Arab SWFs, Arab SWFs prefer larger firms operating in strategic industries based in countries with higher levels of economic and capital market development, political stability, significant degree of confidence in rules and low degree of corruption. Moreover, Arab SWFs do not seem to have a tendency to invest in firms with higher liquidity, profitability, growth or dividend payout. Taken together, results based on the sample suggest that Arab SWFs' acquisitions may not be solely motivated by purely financial considerations.

The core idea is that by deliberately inducing demand in a structured way we can bound its influence. We present a model in which participants respond to their beliefs about the researcher's objectives. Bounds are obtained by manipulating those beliefs with demand treatments. We apply the method to 11 classic tasks, and estimate bounds averaging 0.13 standard deviations, suggesting that typical demand effects are probably modest.

Evidence from Mali,ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,School access; Male education; Fertility; Marriage,,"This paper studies how school access affects men's fertility decisions. To separately identify the male response, we adopt a regression discontinuity approach that exploits the timing of a major expansion in school access in Mali and the country's large gender gap in the age of marriage. Increased school access for boys led to large subsequent decreases in fertility by age 25. The effects appear to be driven by delayed marriage entry and urbanization. The study shows how failing to account for the impact of male education on fertility may lead to an underestimate of the potential for expansions in school access to stimulate demographic transition.

The principal may be a pollution-generating firm, the agent may be a nearby town. The principal offers a contract to the agent, who has the right to be free of pollution. Then the agent privately learns the disutility of pollution. Finally, a production level and a transfer payment are implemented. Suppose there is an upper bound (possibly zero) on payments that the agent can make to the principal. In the second-best solution, there is underproduction for low cost types, while there is overproduction for high cost types.

Firms sell products with two attributes. One is readily observable, the other is observed only after visiting a firm. Search is directed as the order of search is influenced by the observable characteristics. Moreover, if prices are readily observable, firms also influence search direction by their choice of price. We show that when consumers observe prices before search, prices and profits are lower than when they do not. A lower price then not only retains more consumers, but is also more likely to attract them; the latter effect makes demand more elastic. When consumers observe prices before searching, prices decrease in search costs. Consumer surplus initially increases in search costs, but may ultimately decrease. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To what extent inflation bias helps to materialize this intention warrants empirical investigation. A more direct empirical probe into this issue, however, requires observable inflation bias indicators, which we model through desirable and threshold inflation rates as well as their respective society's preferences. While examining the effects of inflation bias for a typical case of the discretionary monetary policy strategy of Pakistan, we found that contrary to the desired boost/stabilization in real growth, the policy (via. inflation bias) produced counterproductive results. Inflation bias was not merely ineffective in inducing real growth but significantly destabilized it. Moreover, the results, which are robust to different inflation bias indicators and subsample analysis, indicate that the higher the inflation bias, the higher is the intensity (magnitude) of its destabilizing effect and vice versa. This suggests that a policy that would minimize/constrain inflation bias would be a better choice as it would not only help achieve low and stable inflation but also a sustainable real economic growth.

Regular banks pursue regulatory arbitrage via shadow banking, and they support their shadow banks with implicit guarantees. We show that an enforcement problem with implicit guarantees gives rise to an endogenous constraint on leverage for shadow banking. Our model captures that shadow banking is pro-cyclical and that shadow banking increases endogenous risk. Tightening bank regulation in our model increases the borrowing capacity of shadow banking and financial instability. Furthermore, we show that a limited degree of aggregate risk sharing does not improve financial stability in the presence of shadow banking. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Firms first choose how much to invest in information acquisition and then engage in dynamic price competition. In equilibrium firms acquire too little information from the perspective of industry profit and the perspective of social welfare. We consider two policies that an industry trade association may institute in light of this: (i) the trade association invests directly to acquire private information for each firm, and (ii) firms individually invest in acquiring private information on their costs, and the trade association collects this information and disseminates it after first period prices have been set. Allowing the trade association to acquire information increases firms' profits and may also increase consumer surplus. Information sharing eliminates firms' signaling incentives, and as a result leads to more information acquisition by the firms and higher consumer surplus as well as higher social welfare. However, information sharing increases firms' profits only when the ex ante uncertainty about cost is large, and it reduces profits otherwise. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Regions with greater business density before the deportations are argued to be suitable for future gangs, as extortion of businesses is their primary source of income. These regions are shown to become disproportionately more violent with more criminal deportations. Using variation in time and location, I estimate a difference-in-differences model to study the impact of gang exposure on children's education. Gangs hinder basic education (comparable to U.S. grades 1-9), with boys experiencing a greater loss in schooling. I reject the threat of a pre-existing trend and selective migration in high business density areas. The results do not appear to be explained by violence alone, but by a weakening economy in gang-prone areas that could have lowered the returns to schooling. Boys' involvement in gangs and increased employment could explain their larger loss of schooling.","[Kalsi, Priti] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology,"Kalsi, P (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",pkgse@rit.edu,,,,,,,34,9,12,3,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Using data for Chinese listed firms between 2003 and 2013, we find that firms headquartered in regions with higher levels of political extraction hold less cash, and the negative effect of political extraction is more significant in more corrupt regions. We also find that the negative relationship between political extraction and cash holdings is more prominent in firms without political ties than those with political ties. Further analysis shows that firms reduce cash holdings by channelling cash into hard assets such as property, plant and equipment. Overall, our study indicates that firms can protect themselves from political extraction by sheltering cash or building political ties.

The nonmonotonic relationship is derived from two key factors: Stone-Geary preferences and increasing child-raising costs. Increase in income raises fertility through the income effect but reduces it through the substitution of the children by consumption due to increased child-raising costs. When households are poor, fertility increases with income because the income effect is dominant due to Stone-Geary preferences. When, in contrast, they are rich enough, fertility decreases with income because the substitution effect is dominant. While the population growth rate is constant in the Solow growth model, it changes endogenously in our model. Consequently, it produces rich dynamics of income and population depending on the speed of technological progress.","[Nakamura, Tamotsu] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University,"Nakamura, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",nakamura@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K03431, 17K18564]; Ministry of Education of China [16JZD016]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K03555, 15K03431] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant/Award Number: 15K03431 and 17K18564; Ministry of Education of China, Grant/Award Number: 16JZD016",,30,2,2,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2018,69.0,4,,,,,768,790,,10.1111/meca.12212,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW3VZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000446838300003,0

Such penalties may be ineffective, or even backfire by crowding out intrinsic motivation. In this paper, we study shaming in the context of the collection of tax delinquencies. We sent letters to 34,334 tax delinquents who owed a total of half a billion dollars in three U.S. states. We randomized some of the information contained in the letter to vary the salience of financial penalties, shaming penalties, and peer comparisons. We then measured the effects of this information on subsequent payment rates. We found that increasing the visibility of delinquency status increased compliance by individuals who have debts below $2500, but had no significant effect on individuals with larger debt amounts. Financial reminders had a positive effect on payment rates independent of the size of the debt, while information about the delinquency of neighbors had no effect on payment rates.

I find this to be true among a large sample of 82 countries between 1998 and 2008. De facto potential fiscal support appears relevant, while de jure fiscal support, which I survey analyzing 82 central bank laws, does not appear to matter.

Only through initiatives such as this will China gain control of local government debt and thus support and promote the long-term sustainable growth of the economy.","[Shi, Jinchuan] Zhejiang Univ, Ctr Res Private Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhikai] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaojiang] Timmy Community Serv Ctr, 460 Miyun Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University,"Wang, XJ (通讯作者)，Timmy Community Serv Ctr, 460 Miyun Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",shijinchuan01@163.com; wangzhikai@zju.edu.cn; Wang_xj88@163.com,,"Shi, Jinchuan/0000-0002-0265-3211",,,,,19,5,5,2,36,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Specifically, we track wages for up to 20 years among women and men born in the years 1960-70 who completed a university degree in business or economics. These women and men have similar wages and earnings at the start of their careers, but their career paths diverge substantially as they age. These men and women also have substantial differences in wage paths associated with becoming a parent. We look at whether firm effects account for the differences we observe between women's and men's wage profiles. We document differences between the firms where men work and those where women work. However, a wage decomposition suggests that these differences in firm characteristics play only a small role in explaining the gender log wage gap among these workers. We then examine whether gender differences in firm-to-firm mobility help explain the patterns in wages that we see. Men and women both exhibit greater mobility early in their careers, but there is little gender difference in this firm to-firm mobility. We find that the main driver of the gender difference in log wage profiles is that men experience higher wage gains than women do both as switchers and as stayers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We show that the performance of the optimal FPCR menu relies crucially on the monotonicity of optimal effort. In particular, in an optimal FPCR menu, if the optimal effort is increasing in type and only a portion of cost types are induced to exert effort, the performance of the optimal FPCR menu can be very poor relative to the fully optimal contract. Our results suggest that in designing an optimal FPCR menu it is important for the principal to take into account the cost structure or, more exactly, the monotonicity of optimal effort in type.","[An, Yonghong] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zhang, Daiqiang] SUNY Albany, Dept Econ, Albany, NY 12222 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany,"An, YH (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",y.an@tamu.edu; dzhang6@albany.edu,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Recently the debate on decentralization has been reinforced by the claim of independence led by the authorities of the government of Catalonia. In addition, the statements of some politicians in favor and against advancing in the decentralization process have contributed to such a controversial debate. The allocation of public infrastructure is not out of this debate. Methodology: A non-linear equation is specified that allows to control for the traditional criteria for allocating public infrastructure: regional development, special infrastructure needs, efficiency or productivity of public capital stock and political effects. Results: The financial autonomy and transferred competences positively affect the accumulation of regional public infrastructure. However, their marginal contributions are decreasing. Conclusions: The empirical evidence could be suggesting thresholds in the decentralization process. The results related to financial autonomy are much stronger for the autonomous communities that are considered to be lagging behind in the fiscal decentralization. Moreover, the rest of the communities exhibit stronger results for the proxy that captures administrative decentralization.","[Aray, Henry] Univ Granada, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Aray, H (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Granada, Spain.",haray@ugr.es,"Aray, Henry/L-7127-2014","Aray, Henry/0000-0001-6081-0441",,,,,38,1,1,1,2,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This paper examines that claim and finds that the geometry of Bernoulli's original utility function specification either explains or implies key elements of PT: reference dependence and a loss aversion index. Theory and evidence show that the loss aversion index constructed from reference wealth in Bernoulli's utility specification is in the domain of attraction of a stable law. That is, its distribution is a slow varying function with a fat tail that decays like a power law. Additionally, the index can be tested with a modified Fisher z-transform test. Bernoulli's utility function also sheds light on why loss aversion may be over-estimated under PT. In a nutshell, Bernoulli's utility function is alive and well.

We calculate various measures of within-city income inequality for 252 Chinese cities. It is found that overall city income inequality is significantly and positively correlated with population size. As migration is crucial in determining city size distribution in China, we focus on exploring the role of massive migration into big cities in shaping this size-inequality relationship. We find that the share of migrants alone accounts for more than 40% of the city size inequality premium. This is primarily because migration leads to higher skill premiums in larger cities by changing the skill composition of workers in those places.","[Chen, Binkai] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dan] East China Normal Univ, 3663 Zhongshan N Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, 3663 Zhongshan N Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ming] Fudan Univ, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, 535 Fahuazhen Rd, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ming] Shanghai Inst Int Finance & Econ, 535 Fahuazhen Rd, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; East China Normal University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Fudan University; Shanghai Institute of International Finance & Economics,"Liu, D (通讯作者)，East China Normal Univ, 3663 Zhongshan N Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.;Liu, D (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, 3663 Zhongshan N Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",chenbinkai@cufe.edu.cn; liu.dan@mail.shufe.edu.cn; luming1973@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDB120, 13ZD015, X12AZD045]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273289, 71703187]; National Science Foundation of China [71273055]; Fudan Lab for China Development Studies",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fudan Lab for China Development Studies,"Binkai thanks financial support of the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 14ZDB120) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71273289).; Dan thanks financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71703187).; Ming thanks the financial support of the National Science Foundation of China (No. 71273055), the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 13&ZD015, No. X12AZD045) and the Fudan Lab for China Development Studies.",,48,37,41,11,100,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Using panel data derived from credit reports, we begin by documenting an association between debt characteristics - including credit risk, delinquency and loan balances on student loans, auto loans and credit cards - and subsequent entry into, and durations in parental co-residence. We find relationships consistent with parental co-residence as a smoothing mechanism for young adults facing borrowing constraints. We then formally test the hypothesis that credit accessibility affects co-residence choice by analyzing plausibly exogenous reductions in credit card limits initiated by banks during the Great Recession. We find that young adults who experienced limit reductions were 5% more likely to enter co-residence, and stayed 4% longer in co-residence. The effects of credit limit reductions were larger for young adult borrowers who were closer to their credit limit before the reduction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Lower trade costs as well as labor and product market reforms are considered critical drivers of inequality dynamics. We ask how these factors affect wage dispersion and how much of their effect on inequality is attributable to changes in wage dispersion between and within firms. To tackle these questions, we incorporate directed job search into a dynamic model of international trade where wage inequality results from the interplay of convex adjustment costs with firms' different hiring needs along their life cycles. Fitting the model to German linked employer-employee data for the years 1996-2009, we find that firm heterogeneity explains about half of the surge in inequality. The most important mechanism is tougher product market competition driven by domestic product market deregulation and, indirectly, by international trade.

The main contribution of our paper is to highlight the role of household borrowing constraints in accounting for this fact. We study the role of home-equity loans used to boost consumption as a channel that affects residential investment. We consider a multi-agent model where some home-owning households face borrowing constraints that reflect home-equity loans or refinancing constraints. We show that the severity of the households' borrowing constraints in an economy can generate this stylized fact of US residential investment dynamics. Interestingly, the model correctly predicts coincident residential investment dynamics in countries with less severe borrowing constraints. This prediction is borne out when the model is calibrated to French data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Capital-constrained entrepreneurs finance risky projects by borrowing from banks. Banks, in turn, make loans using equity and deposits. Because financial contracts are not contingent on aggregate risk, bank balance sheets are hit when entrepreneurial defaults are higher than expected. Macroprudential policy imposes a positive response of the bank capital ratio to lending. Our main result is that the Taylor Principle is violated when this response is too weak. Then macroprudential policy is ineffective in stabilizing debt and monetary policy is subject to 'financial dominance'. A too aggressive response of the interest rate to inflation can lead to debt disinflation dynamics that destabilize the financial sector. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There are many analyses exploring this relationship at the macro and meso-levels. However, there are very few studies examining this relationship at the micro-economic level, less so in cities of developing countries. Methodology: We run a linear, quadratic and cubic ordinary least squares regression between income and three pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)eq) for a representative sample of 10 582 house-holds within Mexico City Metropolitan Area (ZMVM) from 2010, 2012 and 2014. Results: The paper shows a monotonic relation (positively linear) for CO and CO(2)eq and quadratic (inverted U-shape) for NOx, the least abundant of the three pollutants. Conclusions: Evidence shows that even at levels of income above the turning point observed in the literature, richer households still do not choose to internalize the social cost of polluting, therefore it is urgent to design public policies aimed at a switch in ways of transport.","[Perez-Cirera, Vanessa] Univ Iberoamer, Inst Invest Desarrollo Equidad Equide, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Schmelkes, Elisa; Lopez-Corona, Oliver; Carrera, Francisco; Paula Garcia-Teruel, Ana; Teruel, Graciela] Equide, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de Mexico,"Pérez-Cirera, V (通讯作者)，Univ Iberoamer, Inst Invest Desarrollo Equidad Equide, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",vanessa.perez@ibero.mx; elisa.schmelkes@gmail.com; lopezoliverx@otrasenda.org; carrerasfj@gmail.com; ana.terueln@gmail.com; graciela.teruel@ibero.mx,,,,,,,31,0,0,2,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Examples include law firm associates, surgical residents, and untenured faculty at research-intensive universities. High female exit rates are sometimes blamed on the inability of new mothers to survive the sustained negative productivity shock associated with childbearing and early childrearing in these environments. Gender-neutral family policies have been adopted in some professions in an attempt to level the playing field. The gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies adopted by the majority of research-intensive universities in the United States in recent decades are an excellent example. But to date, there is no empirical evidence showing that these policies help women. Using a unique dataset on the universe of assistant professor hires at top-50 economics departments from 1980-2005, we show that the adoption of gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policies substantially reduced female tenure rates while substantially increasing male tenure rates. However, these policies do not reduce the probability that either men or women eventually earn tenure in the profession.","[Antecol, Heather] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Bedard, Kelly] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Stearns, Jenna] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Antecol, H (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, Robert Day Sch Econ & Finance, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",hantecol@cmc.edu; kelly.bedard@ucsb.edu; jestearns@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,28,152,180,7,40,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Crown corporations', as State-owned enterprises are known in Canada, were created with a built-in autonomy for their commercial activities on the condition that they also fulfil policy objectives. Of late, however, policy objectives have been articulated more through regulations and governance models and are issued far more from central agencies such as the Treasury Board Secretariat than from the home department' of the agency. This article explores the evolution of the use of Crowns from the glory days of their formation to the privatization era of the 1980s and 1990s to the modern day. It examines how governance and control mechanisms have replaced policy directives.

Further, no detailed empirical examination of both liquidity and risk premia in the New Zealand electricity futures market are discernible. Using data from October 2009 to December 2015, we address these gaps in the literature. We find that liquidity has been gradually increasing and that a policy intervention to impose a maximum bid-offer spread was associated with liquidity-enhancing structural breaks, but this was evident only in the nearest-to-maturity futures contracts. Further, we develop models to explain risk premia that include a range of risk factors, which we categorise as either statistical, physical market, production cost or liquidity variables. From this analysis, we document significant time-varying premia that are driven by potentially inefficient behaviour. Finally, we find that liquidity risk does affect risk premia, but generally only in the case of longer-dated futures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Res Policy 10(43):336-354 1981; Carlsson J Ind Econ 32(1):9-14, 1983a, b) is revisited in light of later economic development. Since the Swedish Micro to Macro model (Eliasson Am Econ Rev 67(1):277-281 1977a, 2017a) was used for quantification, this article is both (1) a study on the calibration of high dimensional micro-based and nonlinear economic systems models, and (2) a post inquiry into the empirical credibility of the cost-benefit calculations performed. We find that the Micro-based Macro model represents the minimum of detailed resolution necessary for the dynamic cost benefit calculations of the micro interventions in the Swedish economy we study. Even though the increased model complexity meant significant parameter calibration difficulties, a thoroughly researched model specification with exactly defined policy interfaces (with the markets of the economy) should take priority over parameter estimation problems, and always be preferred to estimating the parameters of a wrongly specified model perfectly. The oil price shocks of the 1970s caused radical market disorder in the western economies, bankrupting some 35% of Swedish manufacturing and threatening the Swedish government with massive unemployment. We confirm the earlier results that the government choice of a radical employment rescue policy came at enormous social cost in the form of economic stagnation, and still did not prevent the unemployment of the rest of OECD Europe from hitting Sweden a decade later, and persisting well into the next millennium. According to an alternative simulated policy scenario on the model, had the subsidies been replaced with a general lowering of the payroll tax of the same magnitude and the consequent increase in unemployment taken immediately during 1976-1980, production structures would have been radically and rapidly reorganized, normal employment would have been rapidly restored, and neither the stagnation nor the radical increase in unemployment of the early 1990s would have occurred. In retrospect we see no reason to worry about the empirical credibility of this computed dynamic trade off between Keynesian demand and Schumpeterian supply effects (caused by resource reallocations and endogenous structural change due to the price change), as we did then. We conclude with certainty that this trade-off would not even have been discovered as a possibility had we used a traditional model that did not embody these micro-macro linkages.","[Carlsson, Bo] Case Western Reserve Univ, Econ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Eliasson, Gunnar] Royal Inst Technol KTH, Ind Org, Stockholm, Sweden; [Sjoo, Karolin] Lund Univ, Econ Hist, Lund, Sweden",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Royal Institute of Technology; Lund University,"Carlsson, B (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Econ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",Bo.Carlsson@case.edu; gunnar.elias@telia.com; karolin.sjoo@ekh.lu.se,,,,,,,62,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We estimate a structural model for labour supply without and with involuntary unemployment for the Netherlands. We find that average labour supply elasticities are only slightly lower in the model with involuntary unemployment than in the model without involuntary unemployment. The main reason for this small bias is the relatively small share of individuals who are involuntarily unemployed in our data period. A simulation of tax-benefit reforms confirms that the upward bias in average labour supply responses is limited in the model without involuntary unemployment. Hence, this study provides empirical evidence that the standard labour supply model, without rationing, gives a good prediction of the effects of tax reforms when the level of (involuntary) unemployment in a country is not too high.","[de Boer, Henk-Wim] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"de Boer, HW (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",H.W.de.Boer@cpb.nl,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2018,166.0,3,,,,,285,308,,10.1007/s10645-018-9326-y,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4AM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000439942300002,0

However, when I consider heterogeneity among items (using either a Weibull model with frailty or an FMM), the evidence suggests an increasing hazard function.

The analysis is motivated by ongoing proposals by various stakeholder groups for changes to the taxation of superannuation contributions and superannuation fund income. A whole of working life approach is important because workers are affected to different degrees by the taxation of superannuation as their income changes over their working lives. The key result is that medium earners gain least from the compulsory Superannuation Guarantee Levy compared with low and higher earners, and this applies also under a number of proposed changes to the taxation of contributions and superannuation fund income. The gains are measured in terms of retirement assets for given levels of consumption and saving, and in working life consumption possibilities for a given level of retirement assets.

We study the interactions between household debt, liquidity and asset prices in a model of persistent demand shortage. We show that financially more deregulated economies are more likely to experience persistent stagnation. Credit booms or asset price booms mask this structural aggregate demand deficiency. However, the resulting debt overhang permanently depresses spending in the long run. Hence, the contractionary long run effects of relaxing lending standards are the opposite of their expansionary short run effects.

This correlation is robust to local import penetration proxies and is corroborated using differences in the exposure of commuting zones to the plausibly exogenous normalization of U.S. trade relations with China in 2000. A Ricardian trade model with endogenous variable markups arising from head-to head foreign competition can rationalize such a correlation. Following a trade liberalization shock, employment and earnings collapse in the less productive locations since they endogenously exhibit both higher trade-induced job losses and lower job creation, as in the data. When migration is muted in response to the trade shock, inequality increases across locations and induces transitional transfers towards decaying locations, even as employment and welfare rise in the aggregate.

Different forms of values in the organization are derived from three subjects (employees, managers, and the organization as a whole). From this perspective, value congruence occurs when employees' personal values match the organizational values, which are supported by the top management of the organization and are acceptable to the majority of members of the organization. Purpose of the article: To carry out verification of methodological and psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire of congruence of personal and organizational values. Methods: The survey of employees was carried out in 15 organizations, of which 11 are private and 4 belong to the public sector (N=374), and on the basis of the results of the research statistical and psychometric analysis of the data was performed. By developing the instrument of congruence of personal and organizational values, an analytical reflection method was applied. To conduct the empirical study, the mixed methods approach was employed, consistently combining qualitative and quantitative research methods, substantiating the research results with different data sources and tunny. An expert assessment method was chosen for identification of validity of the constructed instrument and suitability of its content. To identify the perceived congruence of personal and organizational values, employees personal values the values prevailing in the organization and the climate of the organization, employees attitudes towards work and organizational performance results, the employees' questionnaire surveys in fifteen organizations were conducted. The sample was formed employing the stratified sampling methodology . To identify the reliability of methodological and psychometric characteristics of the constructed questionnaire, factor distribution, Cronbach alpha and Spearman Brown coefficients, factor weights, resolutions of test steps were calculated and explained. Multivariate statistical methods: correlation and factor analysis, etc. were also applied. Findings & value added: The reliability and validity of the questionnaire empirically proved and it is recommended that scholars researching values in organizations and value congruence should use the Questionnaire of Congruence of Personal and Organizational Values for Employees with the authors consent.","[Vveinhardt, Jolita; Gulbovaite, Evelina] Vytautas Magnus Univ, S Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Vveinhardt, J (通讯作者)，Vytautas Magnus Univ, S Daukanto Str 28, LT-44246 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jolita.vveinhardt@gmail.com,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Gulbovaite, Evelina/0009-0008-8310-7300",,,,,50,3,5,2,7,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

If that strategy works, an AG should be launched for every branded drug that comes off patent. This, however, contradicts the fact that only a small proportion of branded drugs have had AGs. To explain this puzzle, I develop a two-period model in which a brand-name drug company exploits its name brand before generic entry. The model predicts that the brand-name company launches an AG only when brand loyalty is sufficiently weak.","[Wan, Yunyun] Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Wan, YY (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,,,,,11,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

The empirical evidence is based on 78 developing countries for the period 1984-2008. Domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism variables are used. Absolute (or unconditional) and conditional catch-ups are estimated using Generalised Method of Moments. We establish consistently that, the rate of catch-up is higher in domestic terrorism relative to transnational terrorism. The time to full catch-up required for the implementation of common policies without distinction of nationality is found to be in a horizon of 13-20years for domestic terrorism and 24-28years for transnational terrorism. Hence, from a projection date of 2009, in spite of decreasing cross-country differences in terrorists' attacks, there is still a long way to go before feasible common policy initiatives can be fully implemented without distinction of nationality. The paper is original by its contribution to the empirics of conflict resolution through decreasing cross-country differences in terrorism tendencies.

Four of the vast risk measures are the oil-related CDSs for auto, chemicals, natural gas, and utility sectors. In addition, three measures of the financial market risk, the one-month expected equity volatility measured by VIX, MOVE and SMOVE are included. The daily dataset covers the period from 6 January 2004 to 2 February 2016. The volatility transmission mechanism across the oil and financial markets and CDS sectors is examined using the volatility impulse response model. We evaluate the risk transmission due to several recent crisis shocks around the world and the results show complicated transmission mechanisms that spread over long periods.

We first estimate a fixed effects model that is identified by analyzing families who move across counties with children of different ages. We then use these fixed effect estimates to (i) quantify how much places matter for intergenerational mobility, (ii) construct forecasts of the causal effect of growing up in each county that can be used to guide families seeking to move to opportunity, and (iii) characterize which types of areas produce better outcomes. For children growing up in low-income families, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (std. dev.) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5%. There is substantial variation in counties' causal effects even within metro areas. Counties with less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates tend to produce better outcomes for children in poor families. Boys' outcomes varymore across areas than girls' outcomes, and boys have especially negative outcomes in highly segregated areas. Areas that generate better outcomes have higher house prices on average, but our approach uncovers many opportunity bargains-places that generate good outcomes but are not very expensive.","[Chetty, Raj] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Harvard University,"Chetty, R (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"IRS [TIRNO-12-P-00374]; National Science Foundation; Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard, Stanford University; Laura and John Arnold Foundation","IRS; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Lab for Economic Applications and Policy at Harvard, Stanford University; Laura and John Arnold Foundation","An earlier version of this article was circulated as the second part of the article, The Impacts of Neighborhoods on Intergenerational Mobility: Childhood Exposure Effects and County Level Estimates.

The theoretical model shows that corruption affects labour supply in the formal sector by reducing productivity, changing the supply of labour in the shadow economy, altering the tax burden, and distorting the saving-consumption trade-off. The predictions of the theoretical model are tested by using panel data methods for 132 countries. Using the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and employment to population ratio as proxies for labour supply, the estimated empirical results show that corruption has a statistically significant robust direct negative effect on the LFPR and employment to population ratio. Corruption also has an indirect effect on the LFPR and employment to population ratio through a higher tax burden and increase in size of the shadow economy. Higher wages, an increase in consumption, and better regulatory quality are found to reduce the negative impact of corruption on labour supply, however, the overall effect on labour supply is negative, suggesting that the negative effects of corruption outweigh the positive effects of improved regulatory quality, wages, and higher consumption. Our findings imply that in order to reduce the negative effect of corruption on labour supply, governments need to develop a comprehensive approach to not only combatting corruption itself but also working on improving regulation and promoting policies that decrease activities in the shadow economy.","[Cooray, Arusha] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia; [Cooray, Arusha] Ctr Poverty Anal, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Dzhumashev, Ratbek] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Monash University,"Cooray, A (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.",Arusha.Cooray@unsw.edu.au; ratbek.dzhumashev@monash.edu,"Dzhumashev, Ratbek/H-9207-2019; Cooray, Arusha/X-1507-2019","Dzhumashev, Ratbek/0000-0003-2428-2762; Cooray, Arusha/0000-0001-8809-9188",,,,,68,18,19,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

J,"Feng, Q; Wu, GL",,,,"Feng, Qu; Wu, Guiying Laura",,,On the reverse causality between output and infrastructure: The case of China,ECONOMIC MODELLING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Infrastructure; Productivity; Chinese economy,ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; INVESTMENT; FIRMS,"After the 2008 global financial crisis, promoting public infrastructure investment as a growth engine has been revived by economists. China has been considered as such a successful example of enhancing economic growth by massive infrastructure investments in the past decades. However, the literature has provided conflicting empirical results on the productivity effect of public infrastructure using aggregate data, mainly due to reverse causality. Thus, the estimated productivity effect could be either upward or downward biased. In this paper we rely on the institutional background of infrastructure investment in China, and explore several alternative ways to mitigate the reverse causality. Using China's provincial-level data over 1996-2015 and within the framework of an aggregate production function estimation, we find that an upward bias dominates when estimating output elasticity of public infrastructure, and that weak evidence is found on the productivity effect of public infrastructure. This finding highlights the necessity of using alternative identification strategies or data types.","[Feng, Qu; Wu, Guiying Laura] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Feng, Q (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, Singapore, Singapore.",qfeng@ntu.edu.sg,"Feng, Qu/A-9628-2016","Feng, Qu/0000-0003-1306-9632; Wu, Guiying Laura/0000-0002-5102-9837",MOE AcRF Tier 1 Grant [M4011642],MOE AcRF Tier 1 Grant,"We would like to thank the editor Paresh Narayan, associate editor Russell Smyth and three anonymous referees for their constructive comments and suggestions.

Based on Greek mythology, I consider that all brain-power professionals in civil society are the descendants of Athena, whereas the rapidly developing AI and robots are the ultimate descendants of Prometheus. In this context, in order to foresee the possible future of economic research in the coming AI revolution, I introduced the recent attempt by Marcus Berliant and myself to develop a formal framework for modeling the operational process of economic research. Then, I have suggested that if real humans and AI work together through such a framework while amplifying mutual comparative advantages, creativity in economic research as a whole will be vastly enhanced.","[Fujita, Masahisa] Konan Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Konan University,"Fujita, M (通讯作者)，Konan Univ, Higashinada Ku, 8-9-1 Okamoto, Kobe, Hyogo 6588501, Japan.",fujitam@center.konan-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,14,2,2,3,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

To address both questions, we show it is crucial to account for consumer mileage heterogeneity. We use product-level data for a panel of European countries and exploit fuel cost variation by engine. Despite a modest undervaluation of fuel costs, fuel taxes are more effective in reducing fuel usage than product taxes. They also perform better in terms of welfare, even when usage demand is held fixed. The reason is that fuel taxes better target high mileage consumers to purchase fuel efficient cars.

This equilibrium approach reveals an excessive use of market-value accounting: corporate performance measures rely excessively on the information generated by other firms' asset sales and insufficiently on the realization of a firm's own capital gains. This dries up market liquidity and reduces the informativeness of price signals, thereby making it more costly for firms to overcome their agency problems.","[Plantin, Guillaume] Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France; [Tirole, Jean] Univ Toulouse, TSE, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Tirole, Jean] Univ Toulouse, IAST, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Plantin, G (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",guillaume.plantin@sciencespo.fr; jean.tirole@tse-fr.eu,,,"ERC of the European Union [249429, 66 9217]; joint research grant Autorite des Normes Comptables-Caisse des Depots et Consignations; ESRC [ES/R009724/1, ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI; European Research Council (ERC) [249429] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",ERC of the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); joint research grant Autorite des Normes Comptables-Caisse des Depots et Consignations; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC),"This paper was accepted to the AER under the guidance of Jeff Ely, Coeditor.

The consumption changes in the productive sectors and households have been decomposed into five effects. These are the intensity, the inverse of labour productivity, the structural, the standard of living and the activity effects. The energy intensity effect has been defined from a physical perspective in order to eliminate the possible effects brought about by causes unconnected with the energy process (the evolution of the market, the variation of productivity, etc.) that usually affect the energy intensity indicator when measured from a macroeconomic perspective. The results show that the activity, the living standard of private transport and sectoral intensity effect are those that contribute most to the increase of energy consumption in this period, whereas the inverse of labour productivity, the structural and the intensity effects in private transport contribute to reducing the final energy consumption. The results obtained for the sectoral intensity (except for non-private transport) and the residential intensity effects lead us to recommend that it is necessary to focus on a more effective and intensive policy in the matter of energy efficiency in Spain than that developed in the period of analysis.

One common assumption of two-stage DEA models is the homogeneity of the values of the intermediate measures, i.e., the weights given to the intermediate measures are the same regardless of whether they are outputs or inputs. However, this assumption may not apply in some situations such as when one stage values the intermediates more than the other. This is the case in the application we address in this paper where we use a network model to develop performance measures for sustainability of the U.S. fossil-fuel power stations. We show that the resulting two-stage DEA model is a nonlinear program that is a particular case of indefinite fractional bilinear problems (IFBPs). To solve it, we propose an efficient algorithm that involves solving several univariate linear equations in each iteration. This model is then used to construct a comprehensive sustainability performance measure for the fossil-fuel power stations. Using nonparametric tests we also provide statistical evidence to show that neither existing two-stage DEA models nor traditional efficiency ratios adequately account for the environmental and social impacts of fossil-fuel power generation sources.

User-driven innovation (U.D.I.) aims to incorporate user needs by giving users an active role in the innovation process. Despite the growing interest of researchers in U.D.I., empirical evidence remains scarce, because of a lack of a psychometrically sound instrument to enhance insight into U.D.I. This paper derives an integrative definition of U.D.I. from different U.D.I. research streams and proposes a model with three distinctive dimensions of U.D.I.: user involvement, searching feedback and design orientation. Three consecutive studies result in a 13-item U.D.I. scale with appropriate reliability, dimensionality, convergent and discriminant validity. Pilot studies include researchers, entrepreneurs and practitioners. The main study comprises data of 357 S.M.E.s. The analyses confirm the multidimensionality of the proposed construct. This study contributes to existing research of U.D.I. in entrepreneurship by addressing the multidimensional nature of U.D.I. with a new research instrument.

The results suggest that there exist asymmetric effects of unemployment on suicide rates. An economic recession (in terms of an increase in unemployment rate) is more likely to increase the suicide rate among an old age group (55-64 years old) than among other age groups, while an economic expansion (in terms of a decrease in unemployment rate) is more likely to reduce the suicide rate of young (15-24 and 25-34 years old) and middle age groups (35-44 and 45-54 years old) than their counterpart. Therefore, policy implications generated from our results include the following: that intervention to prevent suicidal behaviour should be directed more towards the older age group during economic recession and that we may expect that an economic expansion may not result in a great reduction of suicide rates for the old age (55-64 years) group.","[Lin, Yu-Hui] Nan Kai Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm, Caotun, Nantou, Taiwan; [Chen, Wen-Yi] Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan",Nan Kai University Technology; National Taichung University of Science & Technology,"Chen, WY (通讯作者)，Natl Taichung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Senior Citizen Serv Management, Taichung, Taiwan.",chenwen@nutc.edu.tw,,,,,,,42,11,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

An Analysis with Mexican Manufacturing Firms Located in Mexico",TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,international trade; heterogeneity of firms; firm behavior,MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS; INVESTMENT; COLOMBIA; GRAVITY,"Background: There is little research that examines the patterns of trade countries around the world exhibit, and even more so for developing countries. Where is it possible for companies to export? Why do firms prefer a sales destination to another? What firms sell more once they export and how many of them trade in foreign markets? Those questions have implications for public policy, both in the increase in foreign sales and in the diversification of exports in foreign markets. Methodology: Using a partial equilibrium model of heterogeneous firms inspired by Melitz (2003), different hypotheses are derived to answer the questions. The evaluation is carried out using a panel built with information on trade flows and production data of a sample of manufacturing firms located in Mexico from 2004 to 2010. Results: It is more likely that exporters will sell to large markets, although this possibility is restricted by the transportation costs to reach those destinations. Firms with higher productivity and size are more likely to export to more countries. The selection of the export destination at the firm level is influenced by the firm's size and productivity, as well as by demand in destination country and export experience in a particular market. A growth of 10% in productivity would increase by 4.2% the possibility of firms choosing the Latin American market instead of the North American. With this increase, it is possible that it increased the probability of exporting to Europe or Asia by 2.5 or 2.4%, in relation to selecting the North American market. On the other hand, a 10% increase in global demand would cause a decrease between 2.8 and 12.2% in the probability of selecting other sales destinations regarding the North American market. Conclusions: Increases in productivity and the size of export firms would presuppose an increase in their level of sales abroad. In terms of diversification of foreign sales, substituting trade with the North American market is complicated; however, the most reasonable destinations would be Europe and Asia. The strategy to expand exports to other countries in small and medium firms should focus on increasing both their productivity and size, and improving their access to these areas. For larger firms, improving access would not only be an indispensable strategy, but one that could very possibly give results in a shorter time.","[Cardoso-Vargas, Carlos-Enrique] Secretaria Finanzas Ciudad Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",,"Cardoso-Vargas, CE (通讯作者)，Secretaria Finanzas Ciudad Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",ccardoso@finanzas.cdmx.gob.mx,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,2,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Banks hold some fractions of deposits and money injections as liquidity buffers. The higher the fraction kept as reserves, the less liquid the money is. Unexpected money injections raise output and lower nominal interest rates if and only if the newly injected money is more liquid than the initial money stocks. If banks hold no liquidity buffers, liquidity effects are eliminated. In an extended model with temporary shocks, we show that failure to withdraw state-contingent money injections does not make the stabilization policy neutral, though the economy may undergo higher short-run fluctuations than otherwise.

Applying structural vector autoregression (SVAR) and linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM), we find that wheat price fluctuation is a root cause of conflict events in Sudan.

We develop a model with optimal default and monetary-union exit decisions of a small open economy. Our model can account for the behavior of sovereign bond spreads in the eurozone with the arrival of the news of Greece potentially exiting the euro in the near future. In our theoretical framework, belonging to the monetary-union entails a strong exchange rate peg, which can be abandoned only if the country exits the union. Exit is costly and the cost of exit remains unknown until the first country leaves the union. The theoretical mechanism we explore reveals that while a high expected exit-cost could improve the credibility of a monetary union, uncertainty governing exit-cost realizations could make the monetary-union members prone to surges in interest rates when rumors of a member state exiting arise. We solve the model numerically and quantify that a Grexit-rumors type of shock can triple the default likelihood of an a-priori financially healthy member state. Our framework thus provides a novel and quantitatively important explanation for the eurozone crisis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the rise in the French Delalande tax, which is paid by private firms if they lay off older workers. This reform was restricted to large firms and therefore allows us to use a difference-in-differences strategy. In ECHP data, we find that the change in the perceived probability of layoffs induced by the higher Delalande tax improved the subjective job security of older (protected) workers, but at the cost of a negative externality on other workers. The changes in job security in both groups are of similar size, but as unprotected workers are the large majority of the sample, the population effect of the tax on layoffs was to reduce job security.","[Georgieff, Alexandre] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France; [Lepinteur, Anthony] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics,"Georgieff, A (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",alexandre.georgieff@psemail.eu; anthony.lepinteur@psemail.eu,"LEPINTEUR, Anthony/GZH-0314-2022","Lepinteur, Anthony/0000-0002-5929-8628",Labex OSE; Universite Paris 1 - Panthe on Sorbonne,Labex OSE; Universite Paris 1 - Panthe on Sorbonne,This work was funded by the Labex OSE and the Universite Paris 1 - Panthe on Sorbonne.,,34,6,6,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This paper characterises optimal monetary policy analytically in a New Keynesian economy with capital and a financial accelerator. In addition to stabilising inflation, there is an incentive to smooth volatility in the net worth of borrowers and this presents a trade-off for monetary policy. This trade-off can be eliminated if policymakers can additionally choose an optimal transfer to borrowers. Enriching the model with fire sales and countercyclical bankruptcy costs, there is also an incentive to smooth volatility in default and the capital stock. An optimal transfer to borrowers is not sufficient to eliminate the trade-off in that case. With fewer instruments than targets, optimal transfers are state contingent and countercyclical, while monetary policy stabilises inflation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The empirical test is based on German data and includes years before and after the extension of German codetermination law in 1976. The estimates determine the productivity of labor and relative bargaining power of capital and labor. It turns out that codetermination does not affect productivity, but leads to a significant increase in workers' bargaining power and the distribution of rents.

In particular, we derive a condition that quantifies the amount of ambiguity necessary for efficient implementation. We further show that under some natural assumptions on the preferences, this necessary amount of ambiguity becomes sufficient.

J,"Wagner, G; Weitzman, ML",,,,"Wagner, Gernot; Weitzman, Martin L.",,,Potentially large equilibrium climate sensitivity tail uncertainty,ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate change; Climate sensitivity; Fat tails,ECONOMICS,"Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), the link between concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and eventual global average temperatures, has been persistently and perhaps deeply uncertain. Its 'likely' range has been approximately between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Centigrade for almost 40 years (Wagner and Weitzman, 2015). Moreover, Roe and Baker (2007), Weitzman (2009), and others have argued that its right-hand tail may be long, 'fat' even. Enter Cox et al. (2018), who use an 'emergent constraint' approach to characterize the probability distribution of ECS as having a central or best estimate of 2.8 degrees C with a 66% confidence interval of 2.2-3.4 degrees C. This implies, by their calculations, that the probability of ECS exceeding 4.5 degrees C is less than 1%. They characterize such kind of result as renewing hope that we may yet be able to avoid global warming exceeding 2[degrees C]. We share the desire for less uncertainty around ECS (Weitzman, 2011; Wagner and Weitzman, 2015). However, we are afraid that the upper-tail emergent constraint on ECS is largely a function of the assumed normal error terms in the regression analysis. We do not attempt to evaluate Cox et al. (2018)'s physical modeling (aside from the normality assumption), leaving that task to physical scientists. We take Cox et al. (2018)'s 66% confidence interval as given and explore the implications of applying alternative probability distributions. We find, for example, that moving from a normal to a log-normal distribution, while giving identical probabilities for being in the 2.2-3.4 degrees C range, increases the probability of exceeding 4.5 degrees C by over five times. Using instead a fat-tailed Pareto distribution, an admittedly extreme case, increases the probability by over forty times. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Previous research has shown wide application of the data envelopment analysis (D.E.A.) model for productivity comparison. The D.E.A. model may be used to compare both partial and total factor productivity. However, aggregation of the separate partial factors into a single D.E.A. model is still not sufficiently investigated. The purpose of this paper is to suggest the integration of two methods - DEA and Delphi Expert Panel - to solve this problem. A model was developed and experimentally tested with 15 major European Union airports. The results show that the suggested model could be efficiently used to compare the airports' productivity, which is expressed by a large set of attributes. The main conclusion is that model can be successfully used to compare airports by different criteria through integrating the DEA and Delphi Expert Panel techniques. The model can be used for any set of airports to compare productivity. The research could be useful to airport managers and investors, as well as to researchers in the area of D.E.A. application.","[Jarzemskis, Andrius; Jarzemskiene, Ilona] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Logist & Transport Management Dept, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Jarzemskis, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Logist & Transport Management Dept, Vilnius, Lithuania.",andrius.jarzemskis@vgtu.lt,"Jarzemskis, Andrius/JXM-4617-2024","Jarzemskiene, Ilona/0000-0003-2361-1894",,,,,32,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In our model, education quality and student outcomes are determined endogenously by the interaction of parents, schools and policy-makers deciding educational resources. Immigration decisions are based on economic factors, immigration policy, as well as on parental motivation (parents' concerns about their children education achievement). The model yields results that are consistent with central empirical regularities of the school effects of immigration: (1) there is a negative effect of immigrant pupils on native students; (2) the increasing shares of immigrant students are associated with the decline of school resources and quality; (3) the school performance of immigrant children is positively associated with immigration costs; and (4) school achievement increases in parental motivation and those immigrant children with highly motivated parents tend to outperform native children. Importantly, our analysis clarifies under which conditions these empirical regularities take place and emphasizes that the effect of immigration on native pupils is mediated by the way the school system reacts to changes in class composition.","[Albornoz, Facundo] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Albornoz, Facundo] CONICET IIEP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Cabrales, Antonio] UCL, Dept Econ, London, England; [Hauk, Esther] CSIC, IAE, Barcelona Grad Sch Econ, Campus UAB, Barcelona, Spain",University of Nottingham; University of London; University College London; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE),"Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England.;Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，CONICET IIEP, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",facundo.albornoz@nottingham.ac.uk; a.cabrales@ucl.ac.uk; esther.hauk@iae.csic.es,"Cabrales, Antonio/AAC-1805-2020","Cabrales, Antonio/0000-0003-0209-0399; Hauk, Esther/0000-0002-3089-9307; Albornoz, Facundo/0000-0001-8123-0550",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through CICYT from the project government of Catalonia [ECO2012-37065],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through the Severo Ochoa Program for Centers of Excellence in RD(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through CICYT from the project government of Catalonia,"We thank Paula Calvo for excellent research assistance.

In this paper, we investigate whether aggregate persistence can be traced back to individual remitting behaviour, as a result of migrants' intertemporal choices. We propose a dynamic random-effects double hurdle model based on micro data from the German Socio-Economic Panel dataset. Our results show that there is significant state dependence in remitting behaviour, but in steady-state neither the probability to remit nor the transferred amounts are particularly large, thus suggesting that long-term intertemporal planning is rather sporadic. On these grounds, the medium-long term counterbalancing effect of remittances on the brain drain appears to be weak.","Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy; MoFiR, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Bettin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",g.bettin@univpm.it,"BETTIN, GIULIA/AAF-4345-2021; Lucchetti, Riccardo/O-9754-2015","BETTIN, GIULIA/0000-0001-6711-0253; Lucchetti, Riccardo/0000-0002-0401-3445",,,,,53,4,4,2,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Unlike previous Korean GA studies, we compute retrospective GA, assessing the value of net taxes paid in the past combining this with traditional forward-looking GA, appraising the rest-of-life net tax burden to obtain full lifetime accounts (FLGA). FLGA cover the entire life for all the cohorts. We find that the fiscal policies of Korea bring about generational inequity. The net tax burden of future generations should be raised to an unbearable level, higher than 40% of lifetime income, to service government spending under the current policies. In addition, we show that parametric reforms to resolve the problem have only limited effects even under the demographic assumptions that subsidy to childbirth and childcare and open-door immigration policy substantially reverse population aging and reduction, which indicates the requirement of many fundamental reforms.","[Chun, Young Jun] Hanyang Univ, Div Econ & Finance, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Song, Ji Eun] Natl Assembly Futures Inst, 222,2F,Members Off Bldg 1 Uisadang Daero, Seoul 07233, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Chun, YJ (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Div Econ & Finance, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",yjchun@hanyang.ac.kr; zzsongji@gmail.com,"Song, Jie/JXK-0735-2024",,Hanyang University [HY-2014-N]; Korea Institute of Public Finance [17-02],Hanyang University; Korea Institute of Public Finance,This paper is the product of revision of the research report Fiscal Sustainability Analysis Using Generational Accounting (Policy Analysis 17-02) of the Korea Institute of Public Finance.

The macroeconomic impact of such adjustments will depend importantly on whether a decline in government consumption increases or decreases the marginal utility of private consumption. Employing a cointegration-panel approach, we estimate the intratemporal elasticity of substitution between private and government consumption in 24 African countries. Our estimates suggest that for plausible values of the relevant intertemporal elasticity, private and public consumption are Edgeworth substitutes in private utility. Countries facing fiscal consolidation can therefore expect some degree of demand-side offset to reductions in public consumption, and some resulting moderation in the impact of austerity on real GDP. In the presence of fungibility, our results also imply a labor-supply offset to declines in foreign aid for public investment. Country-level analysis suggests that these impacts of declines in public consumption may be heterogeneous across countries.","[Dawood, Taufiq Carnegie] Syiah Kuala Univ, Econ & Business Dept, Darussalam 23111, Banda Aceh, Indonesia; [Francois, John Nana] West Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, 2501 4th Ave, Canyon, TX 79015 USA",Universitas Syiah Kuala; Texas A&M University System; West Texas A&M University,"Francois, JN (通讯作者)，West Texas A&M Univ, Coll Business, 2501 4th Ave, Canyon, TX 79015 USA.",taufiq.dawood@unsyiah.ac.id; jfrancois@wtamu.edu,,"Dawood, Taufiq/0000-0002-8216-4468; Francois, John/0000-0001-5764-8201",,,,,53,13,13,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Many adults are also victims of trauma. Using data drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, we examine the link between self-reported happiness, a broad gauge of subjective well-being, and four types of traumatic victimization that may occur at various points in the life cycle. In particular, we consider the association between home violence, sexual assault, community violence, and stalking and subsequent victims' adult happiness. For females and males, we find that each of these traumas significantly reduces self-reported happiness later in the life course, and for both women and men, the estimated impact of home violence is greatest. Furthermore, we find that the adverse effects of trauma on happiness are comparable to the impact of critical socioeconomic developments on happiness. Moreover, we find that experiencing more than one type of these four traumas has a greater negative impact on subsequent happiness than experiencing only one type. Our findings are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls, and the influence of trauma on subsequent happiness is independent of personal and family characteristics. Since happiness and mental health are closely related, our work suggests that traumatic victimization undermines overall health and well-being in the U.S.","[Diette, Timothy M.; Goldsmith, Arthur H.] Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Econ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA; [Hamilton, Darrick] New Sch Social Res, Milano Sch Int Affairs Management & Urban Policy, Dept Econ, Econ & Urban Policy,New Sch, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Darity, William, Jr.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Publ Policy African & African Amer Studies, Durham, NC USA; [Darity, William, Jr.] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Econ, Durham, NC USA",Washington & Lee University; The New School; Duke University; Duke University,"Goldsmith, AH (通讯作者)，Washington & Lee Univ, Dept Econ, Lexington, VA 24450 USA.",GoldsmithA@wlu.edu,"Diette, Tim/J-9643-2019","Diette, Tim/0000-0002-5071-7283",Lenfest Summer Research Grant; Lenfest Sabbatical Fellowship program,Lenfest Summer Research Grant; Lenfest Sabbatical Fellowship program,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Lenfest Summer Research Grant.

We use a spatial panel data approach to control both individual effects and interaction among geographical units. The exploratory spatial data analysis detects strong spatial dependence and clusters of high per capita income in northern, central and southern Africa. Our empirical results find the existence of beta convergence and suggest that dependence between economies has an adverse impact in the convergence speed for African countries. We also find the existence of spatial spillover effects.

This paper incorporates tax foresight into a framework of time-varying structural vector autoregression models with stochastic volatility to account for both types of biases. This reveals the effects of changing degrees of tax foresight on U.S. tax policy. Two findings stand out: First, anticipated and unanticipated tax shocks show considerable time variations, suggesting that some tax reforms were more anticipated than others. Second, the time-varying bias reveals that tax foresight was higher during the 1980s and 1990s than during the 1960s and 1970s.

The modern electronic marketplace has revolutionized the possibilities for consumers to gather detailed information about products and services before purchase. Specifically, a consumer can easily - through a host of online forums and evaluation sites - estimate a product's quality based on either (i) what other users say about the product (stated preferences) or (ii) how many other users that have bought the product (revealed preferences). In this paper, we compare the causal effects on demand from these two signals based on data from the biggest marketplace for Android apps, Google play. This data consists of daily information, for 42 consecutive days, of more than 500,000 apps from the US version of Google play. Our main result is that consumers are much more responsive to other consumers' revealed preferences, compared to others' stated preferences.

Further, the turning points measured for income and the capital-labor ratio indicated that the effect of income on energy intensity is increasing while the capital-energy is turning out to be as the substitutes. Furthermore, urbanization could significantly reduce energy intensity. The forecast results indicated that energy intensity and its components may be predicted with a prediction error of less than 0.35%. Finally, EE and SC can be predicted more accurately based on the ANN-based models while the regression models can predict the EI index more precisely. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Although a number of factors appear to have been involved in this development, an important explanation is also to be found in the change in the balance of power in favour of employers and against workers and unions. As changes in industrial relations laws have contributed substantially to this imbalance, a return to the earlier laws may be necessary to restore the institutional mechanism for wages growth.","[Isaac, Joe] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Isaac, J (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",,,,,,,,44,10,10,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

This paper develops an economic state-dependent (SD) approach to evaluate carbon market Value-at-Risk (VaR) that incorporates information from macroeconomic fundamentals into carbon return VaR modeling and forecasting. This method implements an economic SD sampling scheme that utilizes historical carbon return observations from the relevant economic states to predict future carbon market VaR. Applying this SD method to the European Union (EU) carbon market, we confirm that the EU fundamental economy has two distinct states that correspond to expansion and recession periods and that the carbon returns have different distributions in the two states. We find that the SD method outperforms the traditional non-SD methods in out-of-sample VaR forecasts, and this is particularly evident when the carbon market experiences large-scale economy-driven structural breaks.

Our design varies the level of liability uncertainty, as well as the cost and quality of the information service. We find that, in the absence of an information service regime, the behavioral response to past audits, whether penalizing or not, is to report a lower tax liability. However, with an information service present (regardless of whether it is accessed), behavioral responses to past audits are no longer found. Interestingly, information service acquisition decreases modestly in response to a penalizing audit, although as the experiment progressed a larger proportion of participants were compliant, offsetting this effect. Mirroring the few experimental studies that have investigated tax liability information services, we find that providing these services has a strong and positive effect on tax compliance.","[McKee, Michael] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Siladke, Caleb A.; Vossler, Christian A.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Vossler, Christian A.] Univ Tennessee, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Vossler, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.;Vossler, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Howard H Baker Jr Ctr Publ Policy, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",cvossler@utk.edu,"Vossler, Christian A/A-5453-2010",,IRS [TIRNO-09-Z-00019],IRS,The authors thank Michael Jones for excellent software development.

Francois Bourguignon and Branko Milanovic have written insightful and timely books on global inequality, emphasizing the role of globalization. The books are complementary: Milanovic provides an ambitious broad-brush picture, with some intriguing hypotheses on the processes at work; Bourguignon provides a deep and suitably qualified economic analysis. This paper questions the thesis of both books-that globalization has been a major driving force of inequality between or within countries. The paper also questions the robustness of the evidence for declining global inequality, and notes some conceptual limitations of standard measures in capturing the concerns of many observers in the ongoing debates about globalization and the policy responses.","[Ravallion, Martin] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Ravallion, M (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,75,70,77,4,54,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

It is argued that the level of intragenerational redistribution in public pension plans is related to a country's cultural background. The level of intragenerational redistribution is measured by Krieger and Traub's Bismarckian factor. The countries' cultural background is operationalized using cultural dimensions developed by Hofstede. The empirical results are in line with our hypotheses. Uncertainty avoidance appears to have a significant, positive association with the Bismarckian factor (low intragenerational redistribution in public pensions), whereas the relation with individualism is negative (high intragenerational redistribution). Moreover, a positive association is found between the Bismarckian factor and inflation shocks in the first half of the 20th century. While the sample size is limited, the results are robust to the inclusion of different economic, institutional, and demographic control variables as well as to using alternative model specifications. These findings have important public policy implications. We argue that pension reform proposals suggesting a transformation of public to private pension provision should consider the cultural background of countries.

(2009) Commission, this paper proposes the use of a new methodology to measure the joint distribution of households' income, consumption and wealth. Based on a multi-dimensional extension of the generalized mean framework, the paper justifies the application of this methodology based on a set of standard and acknowledged properties. The derived multi-dimensional index has an intuitive structure, which allows evaluating the overall material conditions of households under different perspectives and with varying sensitivity to distributional issues. Under its general form, the index encompasses a class of sub-indices that impose various restrictions on its parameters; the paper discusses the extent to which different restrictions on parameters affect the multi-dimensional assessments of various population groups, and provides some empirical illustrations using those different specifications. The question addressed by the multi-dimensional measure presented here is whether the joint consideration of household income, consumption and wealth modifies substantially the picture of material living standards of different individuals and groups relative to the one provided by income alone. Based on the dataset used here, the paper provides strong evidence on the importance of such a multi-dimensional assessment.","[Ruiz, Nicolas] OECD, Econ Dept, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Ruiz, N (通讯作者)，OECD, Econ Dept, Paris, France.",nicolas.ruiz@oecd.org,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We first consider a simple model with utility functions linear in consumption and featuring heterogeneous utility for wealth. In this case, there are no transitional dynamics, the steady-state is reached immediately and has finite elasticities of capital with respect to the net-of-tax rate. This allows for a tractable optimal tax analysis with formulas expressed in terms of empirical elasticities and social preferences that can address many important policy questions. These formulas can easily be taken to the data to simulate optimal taxes, which we do using U.S. tax return data on labor and capital incomes. Second, we show how these results can be extended to the case with concave utility for consumption. The same types of formulas carry over by appropriately defining elasticities. We show that one can recover all the results from the simpler model using a new and non standard steady state approach that respects individual preferences even with a fully general utility function.","[Saez, Emmanuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, 530 Evans Hall 3880, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Stantcheva, Stefanie] Harvard Univ, 1805 Cambridge St,Littauer 232, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University,"Stantcheva, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, 1805 Cambridge St,Littauer 232, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",saez@econ.berkeley.edu; sstantcheva@fas.harvard.edu,,,MacArthur Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,MacArthur Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,"We thank Alan Auerbach, Stephen Coate, Emmanuel Farhi, Mike Golosov, Henrik Eleven, Thomas Piketty, Joel Slemrod, Daniel Waldenstrom, Matthew Weinzierl, Nicolas Werquin, and numerous seminar and conference participants for useful discussions and comments.

Taking advantage of the unique Hukou system in China, we innovate a quasi-experiment method to elicit the two effects, employing the 2013 wave dataset of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). We find strong evidence supporting our two-effect theory, and the magnitudes of both effects are sizable and similar in scale. The assimilation effect reduces the migrant's risk aversion measurement by 0.606, while the self-selection effect reduces it by 0.715 on average. Overall, urbanization improves migrants' risk appetite, and mediated by this improvement, migrants are more likely than their rural peers to engage in economic activities under uncertainty, as indicated by the evidence that presents when we apply the two-effect theory to investigate how a household decides on risky financial asset investment.","[Shi, Xiaojun] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Yan, Zhu] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Shi, XJ (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",sxjstein@ruc.edu.cn; yanzhuruc@163.com,,"Shi, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3676-7786","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673281, 71172014]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71673281, 71172014) supports this work financially.

Though the literature on fertility has clearly delineated the importance of income, female labor force participation and infant mortality as key determinants of fertility rates (FRs), the empirical findings from previous studies remains at best mixed. This study therefore identifies the determinants of female fertility for the countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand (ASEAN-5 countries), spanning the period 1980-2010. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) cointegration and causality techniques, the main findings of the study are summarized as follows: First, a long-run (LR) stable relationship is evident between female fertility, female labor force participation, income and infant mortality for ASEAN-5. Second, there is a deviation of FRs from the short-run (SR) to the LR equilibrium for ASEAN-5, with the highest and lowest speed of adjustment recorded for Malaysia and Thailand, respectively. Third, FR and economic stability are found to be complementary in the LR for ASEAN-5. When the joint LR and SR causalities are considered, we found that female labor force participation, income and infant mortality have dynamic relationships with FR for all the five ASEAN countries.","[Subramaniam, Thirunaukarasu] Univ Malaya, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Subramaniam, Thirunaukarasu] Univ Warwick, Warwick Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Loganathan, Nanthakumar] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Management, Johor Baharu 81310, Johor, Malaysia; [Devadason, Evelyn S.] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; University of Warwick; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Malaya,"Subramaniam, T (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.;Subramaniam, T (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",stkarasu@um.edu.my; n4nantha@yahoo.com; evelyns@um.edu.my,"Loganathan, Nanthakumar/I-7325-2012; SUBRAMANIAM, THIRUNAUKARASU/B-9957-2010; Devadason, Evelyn/B-5329-2010","Loganathan, Nanthakumar/0000-0002-3221-6629; SUBRAMANIAM, THIRUNAUKARASU/0000-0003-4334-8026; Devadason, Evelyn/0000-0003-0697-0190",University of Malaya [RG265-11HNE],University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya),"The authors wish to thank the University of Malaya for the financial support provided under the University of Malaya Research Grant (RG265-11HNE).

To adequately handle the complexity and uncertainty associated with real-world market problems, forecasting needs to be capable of handling complex situations. The steel industry is a strategic one for Iran playing a critical role in the national economy. Using time series models, this study aims to forecast the future trend of Iran's crude steel consumption. Although autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are regarded as the most important time series models and are extensively employed in forecasting financial markets, they are hampered by certain limitations that detract from their popularity. They are based on the assumption that a linear relationship holds between future values of a time series and its current and past values. Moreover, they depend heavily on a large amount of historical data to provide the desired results. To overcome the limitations in such conventional models, fuzzy autoregressive integrated moving average models have been proposed as improved versions of the ARIMA models. Unfortunately, the former are also plagued by very wide forecasted intervals in cases where there are outliers that create instability in the data. The present paper proposes a hybrid model which is a combination of computational intelligence tools and soft computing techniques. In such a form they take advantage of their unique properties which, when exploited, can provide more accurate financial forecasts. The main objective of the proposed model is to identify nonlinear patterns with probabilistic classifiers to obtain narrower intervals than would be otherwise possible under the traditional FARIMA models. The empirical results obtained from applying the proposed model to forecasting Iran's steel consumption provide significantly improved accuracy. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

However, evaluation access to service in a broader sense is often difficult and expensive. In this study we use a field experiment to investigate if the reception from the business development community differs contingent on the gender of the client. In the experiment, identical email requests were sent to actors in the enterprise promotion system. The result is that response frequency and time were independent of the gender of the sender. However, the male sender was more often given an explicit invitation to book a time slot. To delve further into the responses, we use sentiment analysis, a 'big data' method, to analyse the replies. The analysis reveal that replies to the female sender is more positive. Our conclusion is that even if there are some gender differences we would not consider it to be a systematic discrimination. However, the unconsciousness from public servants should be included in training to increase awareness of this issue. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We also determine dynamic behaviour of web sales and page-clicks using category aggregated daily time series with various marketing activities as intervention pulses. Findings show higher elasticities for increased marketing efforts, peaking at highest discounts and maximum levels of advertising. Price elasticities have been found to be 0.32 to -2.64, while advertising elasticities were between 0 and 0.32. Analysis of dynamics of both marketing activities and carryover effects confirm an immediate effect of discounting on sales and a lagged effect of 1 period of advertising. The decay of advertising effect is faster than discounting and neither of the two has a carryover effect.","[Bratina, Danjel] Univ Primorska, Fak Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia",University of Primorska,"Bratina, D (通讯作者)，Univ Primorska, Fak Management Koper, Koper, Slovenia.",danijel.bratina@fm-kp.si,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Through UQR on the EU-SILC data, the analysis achieves two purposes: (1) understanding the primary forces of the wage and wage inequality generating process; (2) evaluating the changes over time in the marginal quantile of wage distribution and the changes in inequality at different points of the distribution. The results highlight the role of the occupational patterns in wage dynamics. France and Germany show decreasing patterns of wage inequality, despite having opposite changes in wages. Their respective well-defined structures (upgrading of occupations and job polarisation) have an equalising effect on the wage distribution. The United Kingdom and Italy show increasing patterns of wage inequality although maintaining opposite changes in wages. While the relative upgrading in the United Kingdom has only slowed inequality growth, the more hybrid pattern of Italian employment structure has contributed to raise the overall inequality.","[Castellano, Rosalia] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Management & Quantitat Studies, Via Gen Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Musella, Gaetano; Punzo, Gennaro] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Via Gen Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Musella, G (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Legal Studies, Via Gen Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",lia.castellano@uniparthenope.it; gaetano.musella@uniparthenope.it; gennaro.punzo@uniparthenope.it,"Musella, Gaetano/M-4959-2019; Punzo, Gennaro/AEQ-9908-2022","Musella, Gaetano/0000-0002-7871-3751; Punzo, Gennaro/0000-0001-6861-9553; Castellano, Rosalia/0000-0001-6461-3007",,,,,100,7,7,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2018,46.0,2,,,,,249,304,,10.1007/s10663-017-9397-z,0.0,,,56,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HT8TD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000464836700003,0

We build an equilibrium model of FOA with players averse to arbitral uncertainty to study three important issues: the role of FOA in incentivizing negotiated settlements, the convergence of final offers, and the normative effect of diversity of arbitrator opinion. We show that increase in arbitral uncertainty increases the likelihood of negotiated agreements, and make the final offers converge to each other. Risk aversion is not necessary for convergence of offers. Precision and mean of arbitral uncertainty matter differently and can be controlled separately. Moreover, as also argued by the industry practitioners, carefully selected level of diversity (of opinion) in the arbitrator roster increases the welfare of negotiating parties.

We develop a dynamic, two-country model, where home producers differ in terms of the quality of their products. Quality is not fully observed by foreign consumers initially but known once the product is consumed. We show that this lack of information generates an information cost of exporting, over and above the usual fixed costs used in standard heterogeneous firm models. We use the model to examine the role played by intermediaries in alleviating quality uncertainty. In the process, we uncover a positive externality of using intermediaries.

However, setting certain defaults and thereby influencing current decisions, may also affect choices in later, similar decisions. In this article, we explore experimentally whether the default bias can be reinforced by providing good defaults. We show that people who faced better defaults in the past are more likely to follow defaults than people who faced random defaults, hurting their later performance. This malleability of the default bias explains certain marketing practices and serves as an insight for libertarian paternalists.","[de Haan, Thomas] Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Maastricht University,"de Haan, T (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",thomas.dehaan@nhh.no,,"Linde, Jona/0000-0002-4930-6129; de Haan, Thomas/0000-0001-8658-3232",University of Amsterdam Research Priority Area in Behavioural Economics; University of Stirling; VIDI grant from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [452-11-005],University of Amsterdam Research Priority Area in Behavioural Economics; University of Stirling; VIDI grant from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"We thank Gary Charness (UCSB), Joep Sonnemans, our colleagues from the Center of Research in Experimental Economics and Political Decision making (CREED), the Human Capital research group at the University of Amsterdam, the Economics of Innovative Change group at the Friedrich Schiller Universitat and the Max Planck Institute of Economics, Jena and the participants of the 2011 CCC-workshop in Nottingham, the 2011 ESA world conference and the NYU/CREED graduate student conference 2011 for their helpful comments.

We combine the expanding-variety growth model through horizontal innovations with a hierarchy of basic and applied research. The former extends the knowledge base, while the latter commercializes it. Two-way spillovers reinforce the productivity of research in each sector. We establish the existence of balanced growth paths. Along such paths the stock of ideas and the stock of commercialized blueprints for intermediate goods grow with the same rate. Basic research is a necessary and sufficient condition for economic growth. We show that there can be two different facets of growth in the economy. First, growth may be entirely shaped by investments in basic research if applied research operates at the knowledge frontier. Second, long-run growth may be shaped by both basic and applied research and growth can be further stimulated by research subsidies. We illustrate different types of growth processes by examples and polar cases when only upward or downward spillovers between basic and applied research are present. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we analyze the cost savings and benefits of collaborative abatement in the context of China by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. Specifically, we establish 63 collaborative abatement scenarios by dividing the Mainland China into six main regions, and then estimate the costs savings in each collaboration abatement scenario. Through investigating the gains for each region in various scenarios, the best collaborative partners for each region are suggested from perspectives of benefit maximization. Furthermore, the contribution of each region to collaborative abatement cost saving is also differentiated with the Shapley value approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium network is not socially optimal because workers impose negative externality on each other by forming more links. The degree of inequality is larger in the equilibrium than what would be socially optimal. In the equilibrium, high-skilled individuals overinvest in networking while low-skilled individuals underinvest, which enlarges the impact of differences in interpersonal skills.

As we show, the nucleolus is the only RS bilaterally consistent (or RS conversely consistent) rule satisfying equal treatment of equals and last-agent cost additivity. In addition, we introduce a game exploiting the two properties to strategically justify the nucleolus. Our results, together with the axiomatization and strategic justification of the Constrained Equal Benefits (CEB) rule in Hu et al.

That is, under EADAM or DA-TTC, there are market situations in which a stronger affirmative action policy may result in a Pareto inferior assignment for the minority students. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we propose a new heuristic which we term the Bayesian Peer Influence (BPI) heuristic. The BPI accords with Bayesian updating for all (conditionally) independent information structures. More generally, the BPI can be used to analyze the effects of correlation neglect on communication in networks. We analyze the evolution of beliefs and show that the limit is a simple extension of the BPI and parameters of the network structure. We also show that consensus in society might change dynamically, and that beliefs might become polarised. These results contrast with those obtained in papers that have used the DeGroot heuristic.

This problem could be solved through investments in energy-efficient technologies. However, network externalities create a coordination problem for farmers. We develop a framed field experiment to study the effects of group size, leading by example, and payoff structures on the ability to coordinate technology adoption investments. The experiment is based on a game that combines features of a step-level public goods game and a critical mass game. Our findings show that smaller groups more frequently coordinate on payoff-superior equilibria and that higher payoffs lead to more investments. Contrary to previous studies, leading by example reduces investments but has no effect on efficiency. Building on this analysis, we discuss possible bottom-up solutions to the energy crisis in rural India.","[Mueller, Malte] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Rommel, Jens] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res, Muncheberg, Germany; [Kimmich, Christian] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Kimmich, Christian] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic","Humboldt University of Berlin; Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Masaryk University Brno","Müller, M (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Agr Econ, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",malte.mueller@hu-berlin.de,"Rommel, Jens/HJI-1990-2023; Rommel, Jens/J-1291-2019; Kimmich, Christian/X-3374-2019; Müller, Malte/L-9518-2019","Rommel, Jens/0000-0002-0693-8134; Rommel, Jens/0000-0002-0693-8134; Kimmich, Christian/0000-0001-8638-8808; Müller, Malte/0000-0002-3393-4112",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"We are grateful to Markus Hanisch and Julian Sagebiel for their help in developing the project and the experiment.

Central bank control over the long-run inflation rate depends on whether fiscal policy is Ricardian or Non-Ricardian. The optimal monetary policy follows a generalized Friedman rule that eliminates the liquidity premium on scarce treasury debt. We derive conditions for determinacy under both fiscal regimes and show that they do not necessarily correspond to the Taylor principle. In addition, Non-Ricardian regimes may suffer from multiplicity of steady-states when the government runs persistent deficits. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, our work aims at defining both early warning indicators for crises and policy precautionary measures based on the endogenous credit network dynamics. The model is calibrated on a sample of firms and banks quoted in the Japanese stock-exchange markets from 1980 to 2012. Both empirical and simulated data suggest that credit and connectivity variations could be used as early warning measures for crises. Moreover, targeting banks that are central in the credit network in terms of size and connectivity, the capital-related macro-prudential policies may reduce systemic vulnerability without affecting aggregate output.","[Catullo, Ermanno; Palestrini, Antonio; Grilli, Ruggero; Gallegati, Mauro] Univ Politecn Marche Univpm, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Dises, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60124 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Catullo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche Univpm, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Dises, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60124 Ancona, Italy.",ermanno.catullo@gmail.com; ants.pal@gmail.com; r.grilli@univpm.it; mauro.gallegati@univpm.it,,,"European Union [612955, 611875]",European Union(European Union (EU)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union, Seventh Framework Programme FP7, under grant agreement FinMaP no: 612955 and Symphony no: 611875.",,46,3,3,0,16,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY EVIDENCE FROM A POLICY EXPERIMENT IN INDIA,BULLETIN OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,english language ability; regression discontinuity; right to education (RTE) act; tutoring,PATTERNS; DEMAND,"Empirical evidence has shown that returns to English language ability are substantial in India. Research has also focused on the impact of private tutoring in the context of developing economies to find evidence that remedial teaching leads to better student achievement and higher test scores. In this paper I analyze whether private tutoring helps in developing English language ability. Simple OLS estimates suggest statistically significant effects but estimated coefficients are rather small at 0.2 percentage points. Presence of confounders and selection bias may potentially understate the true effects of private tutoring on English language ability. To address this issue, I exploit a unique policy experiment in India in a regression discontinuity framework to identify cohorts eligible for private tutoring and compare their outcomes to the ineligible. I use this potentially exogenous policy variation as an instrument for private tutoring and find significant increases in English language ability estimated at 16 percentage points which is much larger than the simple OLS effects. Since standard academic curriculum is not directed towards improving foreign language ability, private tutoring as an input in the education production function seems to offer high marginal returns. From a policy perspective, this implies that private tutoring should be encouraged for enhancing English ability even though there are concerns that this provides disincentives for teachers to teach in school.","[Chatterjee, Somdeep] Indian Inst Management, Business Environm Econ Grp, IIM Rd, Lucknow 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Business Environm Econ Grp, IIM Rd, Lucknow 226013, Uttar Pradesh, India.",somdeep@iiml.ac.in,,"Chatterjee, Somdeep/0000-0002-9825-2227",,,,,14,5,5,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

In four experiments penalty framing actually increased the job offer acceptance rate relative to bonus framing I rule out a number of explanations, most notably self -commitment motives do not seem to explain the finding.

This paper provides a model that sheds light on the relationship between the degree of firm innovativeness and stock returns, the movements of which capture expectations on firm's profitability and growth. The model is grounding on Neo-Schumpeterian growth models and relies on the crucial assumption of radical innovation, characterized by ambiguity or Knightian uncertainty: due to its uniqueness and originality, no distribution of probability can be reasonably associated with radical innovation success or failure. Different preferences (alpha-maxmin, Choquet) are here compared. Results show that the assumption of ambiguity-aversion is crucial in determining higher returns in the presence of radical innovation and that the specific definition of expected utility shapes the extent of the returns. This result holds also in the case of endogenous innovation; risk attitude plays no role.","[Grieco, Daniela] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Grieco, D (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",daniela.grieco@unibocconi.it,"Grieco, Daniela/HZL-6205-2023; Grieco, Daniela/ABD-1355-2020","GRIECO, DANIELA/0000-0003-1196-8685",,,,,76,2,2,3,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

An important question is whether including conditional components in NDCs might enhance the agreement's effectiveness. We report the results of a closely controlled laboratory experiment-based on a mixed sequential-simultaneous public good game with one leader and three followers-that helps answer this question. The experiment investigates how two factors influence the effectiveness of leadership based on intrinsically conditional commitments. Measuring effectiveness in terms of followers' and total contributions, we find that it may help if the conditional promise is credible and if its implementation influences followers' welfare substantially. Importantly, however, for both factors we find a significant effect only if the leader does not reap disproportionate gains from the group's efforts.

This article conducts a meta-analysis based on 130 primary econometric-based studies to better understand the conflict among the existing estimates on the effect of warming on agriculture. We find that differences in the latitude of the study sample, the temperature measure that was used, and the econometric approach that was applied can explain why the primary studies disagree. We also have evidence of publication bias where negative effects of warming are more likely to be published than positive effects are. Finally, we find that the disagreement could be reduced if the studies account for adaptation by using a yearly temperature measure and the hedonic approach.","[Huang, Kaixing] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Nankai Qu 300071, Peoples R China; [Huang, Kaixing; Sim, Nicholas] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Nankai University; University of Adelaide,"Huang, KX (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Nankai Qu 300071, Peoples R China.;Huang, KX (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",kaixing.huang@nankai.edu.cn,"huang, kaixing/HZH-8458-2023",,"Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [ADP/2010/070, ADP/2011/039]; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy [CICCE/2017/09]",Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy,"This work was supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research [grant numbers ADP/2010/070, ADP/2011/039]; and the Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy [grant numbers CICCE/2017/09]",,28,4,4,3,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The experimental task resembles a common process in agricultural production. The sharecropping contract is a piece rate scheme framed as a profit-sharing agreement. Sharecropping output was about 12 percent smaller than the fixed rent output. Surprisingly, it is statistically indistinguishable from the fixed wage output, despite substantial piece rates. This effect is driven by real-life sharecroppers. Their sharecropping output was smaller than that of non-sharecroppers, especially in a region where a controversial land reform took place. We argue that our subjects dislike sharecropping contracts because of the unfair profit sharing and the disputed allocation of land. Fairness concerns, therefore, may be another impediment to efficiency under the sharecropping contract.","[Kemper, Niels] KfW Dev Bank, Competence Ctr Dev Governance & Peace, Frankfurt, Germany; [Czura, Kristina] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Munich, Germany; [Schumacher, Heiner] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",University of Munich; KU Leuven,"Kemper, N (通讯作者)，KfW Dev Bank, Competence Ctr Dev Governance & Peace, Frankfurt, Germany.",niels.kemper@kfw.de; kristina.czura@econ.lmu.de; heiner.schumacher@kuleuven.be,,"Czura, Kristina/0000-0002-2406-3992",Stiftungsfond of the Deutsche Bank,Stiftungsfond of the Deutsche Bank,"We express our gratitude to the Stiftungsfond of the Deutsche Bank for funding this field research and to Rainer Klump from the Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, for assistance in writing the research proposal.

The identification of a suitable indicator quantifying the distance between the model and the data would help and guide model selection and output validation. This paper proposes the use of a new criterion, called GSL-div and developed in Lamperti (Econ Stat, 2017. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosta. 2017. 01.006), to assess the degree of similarity between the dynamics observed in the data and those generated by the numerical simulation of models. As an illustrative application, this approach is used to distinguish between different versions of the well known asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs proposed in Brock and Hommes (J Econ Dyn Control 22(8-9): 1235-1274, 1998. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-1889(98)00011-6). Once the discrimination ability of the GSL-div is proved, model's dynamics are directly compared with actual data coming from two major stock market indexes (EuroSTOXX 50 for Europe and CSI 300 for China). Results show that the model, once calibrated, is fairly able to track the evolution of both the two indexes, even though a better fit is reported for the Chinese stock market. However, I also find that many different combinations of traders' behavioural rules are compatible with the same observed dynamics. Within this heterogeneity, an emerging common trait is found: to be empirically valid, the model has to account for a strong trend following component, which might either come from a unique trend type that heavily extrapolates information from past observations or the combinations of different types with milder, or even opposite, attitudes towards the trend.","[Lamperti, Francesco] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Lamperti, Francesco] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Lamperti, F (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.;Lamperti, F (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",f.lamperti@sssup.it,,"Lamperti, Francesco/0000-0003-4862-646X","European Unions 7th FP for research, technological development and demonstration [603416]","European Unions 7th FP for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU))","The author acknowledges financial support from European Unions 7th FP for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement No. 603416-Project IMPRESSIONS (Impacts and risks from high-end scenarios: Strategies for innovative solutions).",,54,19,19,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

The identification strategy produces fully nonparametric dynamic average treatment effects for every treatment path.

This prediction is at odds with the 1970s experience of slow productivity growth and high unemployment in industrial countries. We show that introducing nominal price rigidity helps in reconciling the model's prediction with experience. Faster growth is shown to lead to lower unemployment when inflation is relatively high, as was the case in the 1970s. In general, the sign of the effect of growth on unemployment is shown to depend on the level of steady-state inflation. There is a threshold level of inflation below (above) which faster growth leads to higher (lower) unemployment. The prediction of the model is supported by an empirical analysis based on US and European data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The literature of the 90' s also considered its effects on high tech. Method: We take 46 activities grouping industries in 15 subsectors (3 digits) and 31 branches (4 digits) accounting for total industrial GNP in 2014. We estimate the importance of value added and exports in association to the taxonomy of Pavitt (1984) to distinguish four types of technology industries. Using cluster analysis, two groups of states are identified in terms of importance of technology intensive industries. Results: There are two types of Mexican states in the role of technology intensive activities, which in term is related to the capacity to export. The 11 states of better performance are more diversified in their industrial structure. On the whole, the impact of NAFTA on innovation has been very limited. Conclusions: There is a limited effect of NAFTA on the development of technological capabilities for Mexico. There is a lag on R&D investment and GNP is more inclined to mature manufactures along the period. Nevertheless, the group of states in the northern border, central Mexico and a few in Bajio show a better performance in both the economic and exports numbers.","[Unger, Kurt] CIDE, Div Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

It seeks to respond to two key questions: Is there a structural bonus in the growth of labor productivity in industry on a global scale?, and if this is indeed the case, in which countries or sectors does this occur? Methods: Through a shift-share type technique used by other similar empirical studies, the evolution of the indicator is broken down in structural effects of the relocation of employment and in an intrinsic component associated with technological and organizational change within each branch of activity. Results: The main result is to confirm the absence of an aggregated structural bonus in the growth of labor productivity in industry on a global level. When structural effects have a significant weight in the evolution of the indicator, this appears to be related to the development of backward structures or with highly specialized productive patterns. Furthermore, the statistical evidence indicates greater international dynamism in terms of the efficiency of chemical and automotive industry activities. Conclusions: Innovation and the emergence of new sectors have triggered a structural transformation whose possibilities have been partially blocked, especially in developing countries, both because of the scarce diffusion of innovations and the inability of the most dynamic sectors to increase their participation in total employment.","[Vazquez Lopez, Raul] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"López, RV (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",ravazz@hotmail.com,,"Vazquez-Lopez, Raul/0000-0001-8098-1336",,,,,35,0,0,0,6,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

However, the effectiveness of these measures is still obscure. This paper first adopts the spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model to evaluate the effect of the Central Rise Policy on CO2 emissions at the stage of operation in road sector in the six provinces in central China, then explores whether there is CO2 rebound effect diminishing the effect of the Central Rise Policy based on the Linear Approximation of the Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) model. The results show that, first, the impact of the Central Rise Policy on CO2 emissions at the stage of operation in road sector proves relatively weak during 2006-2015. Second, the energy intensity and, total turnover of the road sector, highway mileage, fuel mixture and population density produce negative spatial spillover effect, whereas the per capita CO2 emissions of the road sector shows the opposite. Finally, the CO2 rebound effect is an important factor for the effect of Central Rise Policy on CO2 emissions at the stage of operation in road sector, and the average total CO2 rebound effect for the road sector is 8.01% in the six central provinces.","[Zhang, Yue-Jun; Liu, Zhao; Zhou, Si-Ming; Qin, Chang-Xiong; Zhang, Huan] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Jun; Liu, Zhao; Zhou, Si-Ming; Qin, Chang-Xiong; Zhang, Huan] Hunan Univ, Ctr Resource & Environm Management, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yue-Jun] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, China Energy Grp, Energy Anal Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Zhang, Yue-Jun] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, China Energy Grp, Environm Assessment Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Hunan University; Hunan University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Liu, Z (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",zyjmis@l26.com; liuzhao@hnu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Yue-Jun/A-8850-2012","Zhang, Yue-Jun/0000-0001-7687-9267",National Social Science Fund of China [16BGL142],National Social Science Fund of China,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Social Science Fund of China (nos. 16BGL142).

The 1992-1995 conflict was harmful for ethnic diversity. Yet, two decades later, where it still exists, ethnic diversity gives rise to positive economic consequences. After controlling for other influences, the authors find lower probabilities of respondents in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods being in the lowest income categories but higher probabilities of being in medium and higher income categories. The largest effects are the reduced probabilities of respondents reporting no income, and are thus particularly relevant to poverty reduction. At the limit, their estimates imply an income gap of more than 20 per cent between a counter-factual completely heterogenous environment and a counter-factual completely homogenous environment. Policy makers in this post-conflict country, and in similar environments elsewhere, should take into consideration the economic costs of policies supporting ethnic homogeneity over diversity.","[Efendic, Adnan] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Pugh, Geoff] Staffordshire Univ, Stoke On Trent, Staffs, England",University of Sarajevo; Staffordshire University,"Efendic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Business & Econ, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",adnan.efendic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Pugh, Geoffrey/AAG-5009-2019; Efendic, Adnan/AAE-4740-2019","Pugh, Geoffrey/0000-0002-9596-1757; Efendic, Adnan/0000-0003-0241-0938",,,,,58,7,8,0,4,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 28,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201817.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-17,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GB0AI,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000428704500001,0

In this paper, we focus on this population using a French national survey and we derive measures for the non-take-up of French basic income support. Our findings indicate that there is a substantial rate of non-take-up among the homeless, but that this rate is lower than that for the general population: approximately 18% of eligible homeless persons do not claim benefits compared to 35% of the general population. Using a large set of variables, we investigate the determinants of non-take-up. We show that although some of these determinants are shared with the general population, as identified in the literature, the homeless population exhibits some particularities. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the poorest of the homeless have a larger non-take-up rate than other homeless.","[Chareyron, Sylvain; Domingues, Patrick] Univ Paris Est, Creteil, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC),"Chareyron, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est, ERUDITE, 61 Ave Gen Gaulle,TEPP FR3435, Creteil, France.",sylvain.chareyron@univ-paris-est.fr,,,,,,,30,13,13,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Based on the empirical evidence obtained, we conclude there is no single model of success factors for a creative incubator, since incubating new undertakings is a highly flexible process, aiming for different objectives.

The international concept of insurance operations brings certainty and helps to balance the economic results. Purpose of the article: The aim of the paper is to compare the efficiency of life insurance of commercial insurance companies in the Czech Republic and Poland using the Data Envelopment Analysis model (DEA). Methods: The methods used in the paper are descriptive statistics, DEA model and Tobit regression model. DEA models are nonparametric quantitative models for efficiency assessment. They use linear programming to transform multiple inputs into multiple outputs. The efficiency of the subjects analyzed is assessed based on the efficiency scores. Findings & Value added: The subject of our analysis was 17 commercial insurance companies in the Czech Republic and 26 commercial insurance companies in Poland. Ten insurance companies were efficient on the common Czech-Polish insurance market. The share of efficient insurance companies was approximately equal. The arithmetic mean of the efficiency scores was higher in Poland than in the Czech Republic. The variability of the efficiency scores of Czech insurance companies was greater than the variability of the efficiency scores of Polish insurance companies. The correlations with efficiency score as the dependent variable and with market share as the independent variable of Tobit regression were very low.","[Grmanova, Eva] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska 3, Trencin 91101, Slovakia; [Pukala, Ryszard] Bronislaw Markiewicz State Higher Sch Technol & E, Jaroslaw, Poland",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Grmanová, E (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska 3, Trencin 91101, Slovakia.",eva.grmanova@tnuni.sk,"Grmanová, Eva/HKE-0610-2023; Pukala, Ryszard/N-4753-2018","Grmanová, Eva/0000-0003-2269-1677;",,,,,25,17,18,1,23,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

If there is an evidence of weak linkage between various markets, then there are potential benefi ts that could arise from international diversifi cation. However, if we analyse the relationship between two markets that are different in terms of their economic development, and if there is a strong connection between them, market shocks from the developed markets can have an impact on the frontier/emerging markets. Market integration can be indicated with returns linkage and transmission of shocks and volatility between markets. Hence, this can have implications for investment strategies. It is found that there is statistically signifi cant regional spillover between countries of the Western Balkan region. Also, there is global spillover between developed markets and this region as well. Furthermore, there is evidence that Western Balkan's markets are late in response to important market events, and that can be used when formulating investment strategy.","[Latinovic, Milica; Bogojevic Arsic, Vesna] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Dept Financial Management & Accounting, Belgrade, Serbia; [Bulajic, Milica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Dept Operat Res & Stat, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade,"Latinovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Dept Financial Management & Accounting, Belgrade, Serbia.",latinovicm@fon.bg.ac.rs; bogojevic-arsic.vesna@fon.bg.ac.rs; bulajic.milica@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Arsic, Vesna Bogojevic/AAN-1387-2020; Bulajic, Milica/AAM-9182-2020; Latinovic, Milica/Q-2277-2018","Arsic, Vesna Bogojevic/0000-0003-2204-0807; Latinovic, Milica/0000-0002-3942-0585; Bulajic, Milica/0000-0003-1356-4078",,,,,30,4,4,0,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

There are two worker types and two occupations, which are subject to correlated fluctuations in output. The equilibrium is characterized by occupational mismatch which is associated with a wage penalty. Every worker has a fixed number of social contacts in the network. The fraction of contacts of the same occupational type defines homophily of the social network, so this paper investigates the optimal level of network homophily. Workers are risk-neutral and take aggregate variables as given, so their optimal individual choice is full homophily. This is different from the social planner's perspective. The planner internalizes external effects of workers' network choices on aggregate variables, so there exists a unique interior value of network homophily maximizing the present value of income. On the one hand, higher homophily is associated with lower occupational mismatch. But on the other hand, higher homophily separates the two groups of workers, prevents exchange of information about open vacancies, and leads to more unemployment, especially in recessions. So it is the trade-off between these two effects and not the desire to reduce income volatility, as in standard portfolio theory, which gives rise to network diversification. Comparative statics shows that optimal network homophily is lower and diversification is stronger with a lower wage penalty from mismatch, lower unemployment benefit and negative correlation in output fluctuations.

They use uncertainty to justify options benefiting themselves over others, they avoid information that may encourage them to give, and they avoid the ask itself.

We investigate whether merely alerting individuals to an upcoming prosocial ask - that is neither avoided nor occurs in an environment with flexibility - results in reduced prosocial behavior. That is, we investigate whether individuals use time to quickly find ways to decline prosocial asks and thus whether surprising individuals with prosocial asks increases compliance.

To this end, a panel cointegration analysis is conducted, augmented by a forecast exercise. In the latter, repeated sampling techniques are used in order to avoid arbitrary sample splits. In line with the theoretical reasoning, we find that broad price- and cost-based indicators are to be preferred to narrow price-based measures such as CPI- or PPI-deflated real exchange rates. Furthermore, the evidence points towards using world trade as external activity variable instead of GDP- or real imports-based measures.","[Fischer, Christoph; Hossfeld, Oliver; Radeck, Karin] Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hossfeld, Oliver] Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Hossfeld, O (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.;Hossfeld, O (通讯作者)，Leipzig Grad Sch Management, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",oliver.hossfeld@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,34,3,4,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

This paper shows that a judiciously designed toll applied to a portion of the lanes of a highway can generate a Pareto improvement before using the revenue, a sufficient condition being that drivers with a high value of time travel at the peak of rush hour. I obtain these new theoretical results by extending a standard dynamic congestion model to reflect an important additional traffic externality: extra traffic does not simply increase travel times, but also introduces frictions that reduce throughput. The analysis draws attention to a practical policy that may help overcome the widespread opposition to road pricing.","[Hall, Jonathan D.] Univ Toronto, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Hall, JD (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, 150 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G7, Canada.",jonathan.hall@utoronto.ca,,"Hall, Jonathan/0000-0003-3835-9097",,,,,71,30,31,0,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0047-2727,,,J PUBLIC ECON,J.

Specifically, the paper exploits a major reform of the wage bargaining system in the Danish manufacturing sector, a reform that changed the wage-setting process from a highly centralized bargaining system at the national level to a decentralized system with a strong emphasis on firm-level wage bargaining. The results show that under the centralized wage bargaining system, displaced workers' income losses were small, whereas under the decentralized wage bargaining system, these income losses increased substantially, particularly because displaced workers experienced worse wage growth under the decentralized system. The effect persists after controlling for a variety of macroeconomic indicators, and displaced workers' income losses did not increase in sectors that were not affected by a comparable change in the wage bargaining system.

Second, the monetary authorities of these countries have responded to oil price changes caused by oil-market specific demand shocks.

Since such a dichotomous measurement of the employment, we are unable to observe structural and qualitative changes of a developing economy during its industrialization process. An improved measure thus is needed to represent the multiple characteristics of employment quality and describe its gradations on the continuum of industrialization process. In this paper, the authors construct and evaluate multi-component variables to measure employment quality in China. The paper also evaluates its validity by using a panel data regression model to examine the changes between 1990 and 2014. The results indicate that employment quality is significantly associated with an industrialization process, while political and institutional barriers constitute major constraints for the development of the employment quality.

This is part of a larger research program that sees non-cognitive skills as drivers of educational attainment and labor market outcomes. However, data on these important non-cognitive traits is not always available and, when available, researchers have raised concerns on potential biases in self-reported measures. In this paper, we use data collected from the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative internet panel, to study the validity of measures of non-cognitive traits, including novel measures based on survey effort. We propose that surveys can be viewed as performance tasks and that respondents provide meaningful information about relevant non-cognitive traits based on the effort they put forward in completing them. In particular, we examine the extent to which respondents provide careless answers or intentionally skip questions.

The EMD algorithm is used to decompose the carbon price into simple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue, which are identified as the components of high frequency, low frequency and trend by using the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is used to forecast the high frequency IMFs with ARCH effects. The LSSVM model with kernel function prototype is employed to forecast the high frequency IMFs without ARCH effects, the low frequency and trend components. The forecasting values of all the components are aggregated into the ones of original carbon price by the LSSVM with kernel function prototype-based nonlinear ensemble approach. Furthermore, particle swarm optimization is used for model selections of the LSSVM with kernel function prototype. Taking the popular prediction methods as benchmarks, the empirical analysis demonstrates that the proposed model can achieve higher level and directional predictions and higher robustness. The findings show that the proposed model seems an advanced approach for predicting the high nonstationary, nonlinear and irregular carbon price. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings of a decline in drachma clustering, but lack of switch to euro effects supports the case for clustering being a trading feature that is slow to transfer to new pricing regimes.

The analysis is based on original survey data for a large industrial Italian region (Emilia-Romagna), which offer various views on ICT and EI relationships. This survey contains information on the adoption of environmental innovations and some detailed information on ICT issues and other technological-organisational processes. Our main findings suggest that, overall, complementarity does not seem to characterize the relationship between ICT and other innovation processes as a force behind environmental innovation, but some important exceptions emerge. Complementarities exists, for instance, between technological innovation and both adoption of ICT management systems and ICT for cooperation with clients. Interestingly, restricting the analysis to a sub-sample of more polluting firm, both complementarity and substitutability emerge more evidently.","[Antonioli, Davide; Gilli, Marianna; Mazzanti, Massimiliano; Nicolli, Francesco] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara,"Mazzanti, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, Ferrara, Italy.",mzzmsm@unife.it,,"mazzanti, massimiliano/0000-0002-6538-7942; Gilli, Marianna/0000-0001-6754-2005",European Union [283002]; Italian National Research Project PRIN-MIUR [2010S2LHSE_002],European Union(European Union (EU)); Italian National Research Project PRIN-MIUR,"This paper is based on work carried out in the EMInInn research project, funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme for Research (Grant Agreement No. 283002, www.emininn.eu).; The authors acknowledge financial support of the Italian National Research Project PRIN-MIUR 2010-11 Climate changes in the Mediterranean area: scenarios, mitigation policies and technological innovation (2010S2LHSE_002).

However, although the literature on volunteering is extensive, knowledge on how life's discontinuities (life and financial shocks) affect volunteering is limited because most studies work with static (cross-sectional) data. To reduce this shortcoming, we use longitudinal data from Australia (HILDA) that track the same individuals over time to assess how individuals from different income and wealth groups respond to life and financial shocks with respect to volunteering. Although both income and wealth can act as buffers against life shocks by providing stability and reducing vulnerability - which decreases the need to actually change behaviour patterns - we observe more heterogeneity than expected and also stickiness at the lowest income levels. Response delays in post-shock volunteering also suggest that volunteering habits may be driven and influenced by strong commitment and motivation that are not shattered by life or financial shocks. In fact, the amount of time spent volunteering tends to increase after negative income shocks and decrease after positive income shocks.","[Beatton, Tony] Univ Queensland, Inst Social Sci Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Torgler, Benno] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Queensland Behav Econ Grp QuBE, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Torgler, Benno] CREMA Ctr Res Econ Management & Arts, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Torgler, B (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Queensland Behav Econ Grp QuBE, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Torgler, B (通讯作者)，CREMA Ctr Res Econ Management & Arts, Zurich, Switzerland.",benno.torgler@qut.edu.au,"Torgler, Benno/W-4556-2019; Beatton, Tony/AAF-9320-2020","Torgler, Benno/0000-0002-9809-963X; Beatton, Tony/0000-0002-6742-4508",Australian Research Council [FT110100463]; Australian Research Council [FT110100463] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors acknowledge financial support from the Australian Research Council: [Grant Number FT110100463].,,50,4,4,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Contact zones refer to daily interactions in social spaces where culture and class meet and negotiate with each other.

Executives say they design defaults with passive members in mind, but they seem to overlook some key factors. For example, plan executives set high risk exposure in default investment strategies. Executives also assume motivations for defaulting that do not match those reported by members. Most plan executives think of passive members as uninterested in their retirement savings but passive members say they trust their plans, and lack skill rather than interest. The heterogeneity, trust and low skill of passive members make opting out of the default less likely and smart defaults more appealing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We study the time series with a wide set of models characterized by a Markov switching heterogeneity. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for a broader spectrum of possible models since the estimation of the moments of the parameters is done using the finite mixture distribution MCMC method, without relying on assumptions about large sampling and mathematical optimization. This is particularly relevant for emerging markets' financial data because of its special characteristics, like being more susceptible to jumps and changes in volatility caused by exchange rate swings, financial crises and oil and commodity prices. For model comparison, we use the marginal likelihood approach and the bridge sampling technique. The best representation of the data is given by a switching model with three states rather than any other autoregressive linear or non-linear model. The periods of volatility found by the model coincide with different financial crisis. Whereas other studies of volatility for the same market impose the Markovian model that captures changes in volatility, we let our model to be defined in an endogenous way.","[Cabrera, Gustavo; Coronado, Semei] Univ Guadalajara, Dept Metodos Cuantitat, Zapopan, Mexico; [Rojas, Omar] Univ Panamer, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Zapopan, Mexico; [Romero-Meza, Rafael] Univ Alberto Hurtado, Fac Econ & Negocios, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Guadalajara; Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico; Universidad Panamericana - Guadalajara; Universidad Alberto Hurtado,"Rojas, O (通讯作者)，Univ Panamer, Escuela Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Zapopan, Mexico.",orojas@up.edu.mx,"Coronado, Semei/CAJ-1493-2022; Rojas, Omar/G-2910-2010; Coronado, Semei/AAN-9732-2021","Coronado, Semei/0000-0002-7945-7155; Rojas, Omar/0000-0002-0681-3833; Coronado, Semei/0000-0002-7945-7155; Cabrera Gonzalez, Gustavo/0000-0002-7728-0712; Romero-Meza, Rafael/0000-0001-5108-2681",,,,,37,2,5,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Aspirations and Performance in Young Mexicans,TRIMESTRE ECONOMICO,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,stereotype; school performance; aspirations; teenagers; gender; Mexico,INEQUALITY,"Background: Recent literature shows that, in Mexico, skin color is relevant for life outcomes and for social mobility. A possible transmission channel is explicit discrimination. Another possible channel is that the effort and aspirations may be affected by negative stereotypes attributed to dark-skinned individuals. Since society values certain physical traits (social identity), affected individuals can modify their behavior and expectations. Methods: We conducted a field experiment with middle school itudents in Mexico City. Each student solved a cognitive test and a questionnaire about future aspirations. The experimental design consisted of randomly revealing information before performing the test. The control group did not receive any information. Treatment 1 received twelve images of public characters with light or white skin prior taking the test, treatment 2 received a color palette to self assess skin color and treatment 3 received both the mosaic of images and the palette of colors. Results: Results presented in here indicate that social identity and skin color stereotypes affect the aspirations and performance of young people in Mexico. The group that received the intervention invoking social identification by skin tone and its possible relation with life results, presented a lower level of aspirations towards the future (0.26 standard deviations), compared with the students in the control group. These effects come from women, suggesting that they are more sensitive to the negative effect of stereotypes. Conclusions: These results imply that cultural aspects in Mexico affect how young people behave and make decisions. Therefore, differences in life outcomes and social mobility for individuals with different skin color, but otherwise equal, could also be explained by the existence of negative stereotypes against darkskinned people.","[Campos Vazquez, Raymundo M.; Medina Cortina, Eduardo M.] El Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudio Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Vázquez, RMC (通讯作者)，El Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudio Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx; emedina@colmex.mx,,,,,,,37,4,5,1,12,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

This method has at least two advantages. First, it is flexible to explore the true nonlinearity in the energy demand system via neural network structure. Second, it is able to describe the whole conditional distribution of energy demand via quantile regression. In the empirical study on China's energy demand, QRNN outperforms several classical methods in terms of forecast accuracy both in-sample and out-of-sample. Considering China's economic and social environment, we set a scenario for predictors and forecast the conditional density of China's energy demand from 2015 to 2020. The empirical results show that the conditional density curve moves to right and its dispersion increases over time, which indicates that the energy demand in China will keep growing with an average annual rate of 9.672% and its uncertainty is enlarged with 42.210%.","[Cao, Shubo] Tianjin Univ, Dept Management & Econ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Xu, Qifa; Jiang, Cuixia; He, Yaoyao] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Hefei University of Technology,"Jiang, CX (通讯作者)，Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",jiangcuixia@hfut.edu.cn,"He, Yaoyao/HLG-6280-2023","He, Yaoyao/0000-0001-5059-5151; Jiang, Cuixia/0000-0002-6900-8049",,,,,26,4,4,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Informal commitments, in contrast to formal commitments, are ad hoc personal rules of behavior that are not always observable. Moreover, the effectiveness of these rules in constraining future choices is often dependent on the decision-maker. We model informal commitments using an extension of a standard planner doer model, after Thaler and Shefrin (1981). Taking a preference over menus (i.e. formal commitments) as an observable, our main results show how to elicit and partially identify this model. Our model can explain evidence on self-control behavior that cannot be represented by the Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) model of self-control nor by any of its recent extensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) scales of gambling addiction, we find evidence of a positive association between gambling behaviour and depression. Further, disaggregating the effects by gambling venue, our results suggest that online gambling poses a significant mental health risk compared to gambling in venues or outlets.

We conduct an empirical verification of two research hypotheses using EBRD and World Bank data on 27 post-communist economies over the 1996-2014 period. The first hypothesis suggests that corruption is rooted in the communist past, when these countries embraced communist institutions, social norms, as well as low-development structural factors broadly defined as initial conditions. The second hypothesis is that the flawed transition process led corruption to increase because politics and business were never separated. The elites pushed measures that preserved their status while obstructing reform policies that might endanger their interests. Our empirical results demonstrate that both hypotheses are valid to a limited extent, while revealing a more complex view of the reforms and initial conditions. Corruption seems to be related to the natural resource curse, to the lack of small-scale privatisation and to a long history of underdevelopment that could have preceded communism.","[Cieslik, Andrzej; Goczek, Lukasz] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Cieslik, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",cieslik@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Goczek, Lukasz/Q-2725-2019; Cieslik, Andrzej/AAJ-7497-2020","Goczek, Lukasz/0000-0001-5391-9131; Cieslik, Andrzej/0000-0002-7834-7384",National Science Center [2013/09/B/HS4/01229],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",This work was supported by the National Science Center [Grant number 2013/09/B/HS4/01229].,,43,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,1,,,,,36,55,,10.1080/14631377.2017.1361693,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS6KV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000419907200003,0

The long-run player can nevertheless control the evolution of this signal, and thus affect the market's belief. The public signal has an additive structure, and noise is Brownian. I derive conditions for an ordinary differential equation to characterize equilibrium behavior in which the long-run player's actions depend on the history of the game only through the market's correct belief. Using these conditions, I demonstrate the existence of pure-strategy equilibria in Markov strategies for settings in which the long-run player's flow utility is nonlinear. The central finding is a learning-driven ratchet principle affecting incentives.

When dynamic panel estimation techniques are used to address issues of persistence and endogeneity, we find a large, positive, statistically significant and stable relationship between inequality of schooling and income inequality, especially in emerging and developing economies and among older-age cohorts. The relationship between income inequality and average years of schooling is positive, consistent with constant or increasing returns to additional years of schooling. While this positive relationship is small and not always statistically significant, we find a statistically significant negative relationship with years of schooling of younger cohorts. Statistical tests indicate that our dynamic estimators are consistent and that our identifying instruments are valid. Policy simulations suggest that education expansion will continue to be inequality reducing. This role will diminish as countries develop, but it could be enhanced through a stronger focus on reducing inequality in the quality of education.","[Coady, David; Dizioli, Allan] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Coady, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",dcoady@imf.org,,"Gloe Dizioli, Allan/0000-0001-7367-8814",,,,,33,60,70,5,69,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Shortages of staff may be the consequence of uncompetitive pay. In the private sector, employers in different regions can offer different pay rates to reflect local amenities and cost of living. Hospitals in the UK however cannot set the pay for their employees, and as a result they might therefore incur staff shortages. Moreover, occupational groups do not operate in isolation. Shortages of staff may also be the consequence of the competitiveness of pay of an alternative group of staff. This is investigated using two distinct groups of nursing staff: assistant nurses (ANs) and registered nurses (RNs) working in English hospitals in 2003-2005 using national-level data sets. We find that an increase by 10% of the pay competitiveness of RNs decreases the shortage of both the RNs and of ANs by 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.","[Combes, Jean-Baptiste] Univ Rennes, EHESP, CNRS, ARENES UMR 6051, Rennes, France; [Elliott, Robert Francis; Skatun, Diane] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen, Scotland",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sante Publique (EHESP); University of Aberdeen,"Combes, JB (通讯作者)，Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ, 2 Ave Gaston Berger, F-35043 Rennes, France.",Jean-Baptiste.COMBES@ehesp.fr,"Combes, Simon Jean-Baptiste/AAD-1978-2022","Combes, Simon Jean-Baptiste/0000-0001-6594-8458",Medical Research Council [G0800113-2],Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),This work was supported by the Medical Research Council under grant number G0800113-2.,,18,3,3,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

One of the main problems in efficiency analysis is to determine the environmental variables that have an impact on the production process. In particular, employing data on the European and Central Asian health systems, the article demonstrates that bias corrected Data Envelopment Analysis is most appropriate measuring efficiency than traditional Data Envelopment Analysis. Bias correction, implies a higher potential resources reduction, affects the ranking of health systems and allows variables influencing efficiency which would be undiscovered with non-corrected estimation. The second stage determines that lifestyle factors, policy organization and location of countries affect the efficiency results and cause differences among the countries. The contribution of these results is particularly useful facing the decision making by governments. Their strategies should be oriented to implementing active policies to struggle against smoking and promoting health policies aimed at increasing the level of immunization in order to be more effective improving management efficiency.","[Concepcion Perez-Carceles, Maria; Candido Gomez-Gallego, Juan] San Antonio Catholic Univ, Dept Business & Adm, Murcia, Spain; [Gomez-Gallego, Maria] San Antonio Catholic Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Murcia, Spain",Universidad Catolica de Murcia; Universidad Catolica de Murcia,"Pérez-Cárceles, MC (通讯作者)，San Antonio Catholic Univ, Dept Business & Adm, Murcia, Spain.",mcperez@ucam.edu,,"Perez-Carceles, Maria Concepcion/0000-0002-7262-3413",,,,,59,6,6,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Gender gaps in workforce participation have a direct negative effect on market, while gender gaps in entrepreneurship affect negatively market output not only by reducing wages and labor force participation but also by reducing the average talent of entrepreneurs and aggregate productivity. We estimate the effects of these gender gaps for 37 European countries, as well as the United States, and find that gender gaps cause an average loss of 17.5% in market output and 13.2% in total output, which also includes household output. Interestingly, the total output loss would be similar (12%) in a model without household sector, since the market output loss is larger when the female labor supply is endogenous. Eastern Europe is the region with the lowest income fall due to gender gaps, while Southern Europe is the region with the largest fall. Northern Europe is the region with the largest productivity fall, which is due to the presence of high gender gaps in entrepreneurship.","[Cuberes, David] Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA; [Teignier, Marc] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Teignier, Marc] BEAT, Barcelona, Spain",Clark University; University of Barcelona,"Cuberes, D (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",dcuberes@clarku.edu,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-66701-R]; Generalitat of Catalonia [SGR2014-493],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat of Catalonia,"We would like to thank the editor, Tiago V. de V.

We model the spot market using a system of seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) where the regressions are the 24 hours of the day. Wind has a negative impact on the system marginal price, with every MWh increase in wind generation (equal to about 0.2% of the average wind generation in our sample) leading to a decrease of the system marginal price of 0.018 MWh, or about 0.3% of its average value. We use time series models to analyse the balancing market and show that wind generation increases balancing payments, as do the forecast errors of demand and wind. Every MWh of additional wind generation is associated with an increase in constraint payments of (sic)3.2, or about 0.01%. Lack of storage increases the impact of wind on balancing payments whereas the lack of interconnection has no effect. Overall, wind decreases costs through its effect on the electricity price more than it increases constraint payments, even when storage is on outage. The effect of wind remains positive after including the cost of subsidies given to wind generation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In those models, two parameters play a key role: technological progress and the elasticity of substitution. Recent estimates of those parameters are affected, in our opinion, by a specification problem: technological parameters are inherently long-run but their estimates are based on short-run data. Looking deeply into the estimation procedure, we show that the misspecification issue present in the estimates gives rise to a spurious regression bias (high R-2, low DW), because the standard approach does not incorporate frictions and rigidities. Our modeling strategy takes account of them.

Recent literature on trade with heterogeneous firms has emphasized the third of these effects, while the first two effects are ruled out when using a Pareto distribution for productivity with a support that is unbounded above, and no fixed costs. The goal of this paper is to restore a theoretical role for product variety and pro-competitive gains from trade by using a bounded Pareto distribution for productivity, and to demonstrate their empirical importance. For the U.S. economy over 1992-2005, we find that product variety and the reduction in markups jointly contribute about 75% to the increase in welfare resulting from trade expansion, whereas an upper bound to the selection effect is that it contributes the remaining 25% to the increase in U.S. welfare.

The findings indicate that while the relative wealth concentration level has increased in recent times, it is not extraordinarily high from a historical perspective. In contrast, the absolute wealth concentration level is most likely higher than has ever previously occurred, due to the growth of per capita wealth holdings and the population size of high net worth individuals (HNWIs). The available data also suggest that HNWIs recovered very quickly from the losses that they experienced in the financial crisis of 2008. As a result, HNWIs' wealth holdings in 2013 were at least 30% higher than they were in 2007. The post-crisis recovery of billionaires was even stronger, with their 2014 net wealth holdings more than 85% higher than 2007 levels.","[Goda, Thomas] Univ EAFIT, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad EAFIT,"Goda, T (通讯作者)，Sch Econ & Finance, Carrera 49 7 Sur 50, Medellin, Colombia.",tgoda@eafit.edu.co,,"Goda, Thomas/0000-0002-4209-9657",,,,,65,4,4,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This article tests the importance of such risk segmentation, using administrative information on DI benefits and opting-out decisions of a panel of about 250,000 Dutch firms between 2007 and 2011. We find strong selection into private insurance of firms with low recent DI inflow rates and low current sickness rates. Accordingly, private insurers succeeded in attracting firms with low anticipated DI benefit costs in the first years to come. Our results also suggest that these effects are transitory that is, firms that opted out have DI risks that are not structurally lower.","[Hassink, Wolter H.

We estimate that UI expansions during the Great Recession prevented more than 1.3 million foreclosures and insulated home values from labor market shocks. The results suggest that policies that make mortgages more affordable can reduce foreclosures even when borrowers are severely underwater.

Vulnerabilities associated with the public debt structure and liquidity may play an important role in derailing a stable debt trajectory and thus contribute to debt distress. Financial developments may also contribute to the building in sovereign debt vulnerabilities, as deterioration in financial stability indicators can affect the balance sheet of the national treasury. Based on the experience during 37 debt distress events in countries with market access between 1993 and 2010, this article identifies early warning indicators of sovereign debt distress and defines thresholds - for the whole sample and for different regions - at which these latter have been associated with distress in the past. This approach allows us to assess indicators on an individual basis, and to develop a composite indicator of debt vulnerabilities as well.","[Jarmuzek, Mariusz; Vesperoni, Esteban R.] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19 St, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Jarmuzek, M (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19 St, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mjarmuzek@imf.org,,,,,,,26,2,2,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Literature analysis discloses this process being complex in nature. Value for money (VfM) assessment is acknowledged as the main decision-supporting tool to assess whether to implement investment project (IP) as a PPP. However, due to its multifaceted nature, this process is challenging and demanding, while results can be very different depending on the approach and assumptions applied, which, in turn, also causes criticism on very PPP. To get reliable results, the rational public sector's comparator (PSC) model and the financially viable and affordable PPP model should be constructed as well as their rational comparison should be done. To satisfy these requirements, there is a need of rational comparative tools presenting complex approach to the VfM assessment. Accordingly, the main objective of the research was to create an integrated complex model of evaluating the possibilities provided by the PPP to optimize investments in public infrastructure as well as to assess its suitability to be used in solving issues related to this assessment. Theoretical background of the research was based on the scientific literature analysis, synthesis, comparison and generalization, while the model was created by using methods of statistical analysis, financial analysis and modeling and logical analysis. The model consists of five stages: 1) preparation of the initial IP; 2) selection of IP for the assessment of PPP; 3) PPP structuring and feasibility analysis; 4) VfM assessment of actual bids, and; 5) VfM monitoring, which includes ex-ante, actual and ex-post assessment. The model was assessed in the hypothetical case study, where its suitability to be used in solving the issues related to the assessment of PPP's possibilities to optimize investments in public infrastructure in both economic and social-based PPPs have been demonstrated. The results obtained allow arguing it as enabling to make reasoned decisions for the most efficient ways of IP implementation.","[Jasiukevicius, Linas] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Vasiliauskaite, Asta] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Ateities St 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Mykolas Romeris University,"Jasiukevicius, L (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",linas.jasiukevicius@gmail.com; avasil@mruni.eu,,,,,,,57,8,10,0,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The use of varying methods could alter the ranking of a particular country. In this paper, Southeast European countries are ranked according to the World Bank, the UNDP and the I-distance method. The aim of the paper is to provide a comparison between the ranking results obtained with those methods for the period 2007-2012. The principal objective of the study is the ranking of SEE countries using the I-distance technique - a multivariate statistical method for ranking entities - and to discover whether this method gives a better ranking of countries than income per capita and the HDI. To answer this question, similar variables of economic development are used within the research methods. Due to the observed period, some government finance variables are also included. Despite certain limitations, such as lack of data for SEE countries, the results show that the ranks of countries are highly similar regardless of the method used. Nevertheless, there are some differences in the countries' rankings in some years: there are small differences from year to year both in terms of HDI and GNI per capita. However, the I-distance method shows greater differences between countries.","[Jednak, Sandra; Kragulj, Dragana; Bulajic, Milica] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Jednak, S (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",sjednak@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Jednak, Sandra/AAD-6572-2021; Bulajic, Milica/AAM-9182-2020","Bulajic, Milica/0000-0003-1356-4078; Jednak, Sandra/0000-0001-7265-1249",,,,,58,2,2,0,3,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Most empirical studies analyzing the relationship between trade integration and business cycle synchronization use gross trade data which suffer from double-counting. Double-counting distorts the empirical results on the estimated relationship between trade integration and business cycle synchronization. This paper explores the relationship using value-added trade data to be free from distortions caused by double-counting. Design/methodology/approach - Gross trade data on exports and imports are decomposed into sub-categories following Koopman et al. (2014). Then, value-added data on exports and imports without double-counted terms are built to measure value-added bilateral trade intensity and value-added intra-industry trade intensity. Using this value-added trade intensities, the author run panel regressions for Europe and East Asian countries to examine how value-added trade intensities are correlated with output co-movements. Findings - The paper finds that for European countries, the positive association between trade and business cycle co-movements is more evidently observed and the role of intra-industry trade increasing the business cycle synchronization is also more clearly revealed by value-added trade data. On the other hand, for East Asian countries, value-added trade data reveal that it is very uncertain whether increased trade contributes to stronger synchronization of business cycles and intra-industry trade is truly the major factor which deepens the business cycle co-movements. Research limitations/implications - First, the paper examines the relationship only by running static panel regression. There is a need to employ different methodologies such as instrumental variable regression or dynamic panel regression. Second, financial integration and policy coordination within a region are also other relevant factors which influence the intra-regional business cycle synchronization. There is a need to examine the relationship using value-added trade data with the variables measuring the degree of financial integration and policy coordination. Third, value-added trade data used in this paper has limited coverage of East Asian countries. There is also a need to extend the value-added data set to cover more countries and industries. Originality/value - Most empirical literature studying the relationship between trade integration and business cycle synchronization rely on gross trade data. This paper would be the first attempt to study the relationship using value-added trade data. Duval et al. (2014) also use value-added data, but their value-added data are not supported by a solid accounting framework which decomposes a country's gross exports into various value-added components by source and additional double-counted terms. Value-added data in this paper computed based on Koopman et al. (2014) are the total domestic value exports that are ultimately consumed abroad via final and intermediate exports. The author believes that value-added data in this paper are most relevant in estimating the relationship between trade integration and business cycle synchronization.","[Jeon, Jong Kyou] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Studies, Global Campus, Yongin, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Jeon, JK (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Studies, Global Campus, Yongin, South Korea.",jkjeon@khu.ac.kr,"Jeon, Jong-Kyou/AAP-5528-2021","Jeon, Jong-Kyou/0000-0003-4617-8931",,,,,23,4,4,2,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The results indicate that i) a single-directional causality from growth to economic policy uncertainty shocks in the shorter term and a strong bi-directional causality in the longer term between economic policy uncertainty shocks and economic growth using a conditional mean analysis, ii) the nonlinear causal relationship between economic policy uncertainty shocks and economic growth is time-varying in different quantiles and different timescales, and iii) a significant single-directional nonlinear causality from growth to economic policy uncertainty shocks for some t-quantiles in D1-D4. The results of this paper show that economic policy uncertainty not only provides a new method to predict economic growth, but also warns us that the accumulation of economic policy uncertainty would increase economic crisis. Thus, it is vital for the policymakers to reduce economic policy uncertainty so as to keep the stability of economic growth. Overall, this paper offers a new methodological perspective, from different timescales and different quantiles, to deeply analyze the causality between macroeconomic variables.","[Jiang, Yonghong; Meng, Juan; Nie, He] Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yonghong; Meng, Juan; Nie, He] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yonghong] Univ Wisconsin, Econ Dept, Eau Claire, WI 54701 USA",Jinan University; Jinan University; University of Wisconsin System,"Nie, H (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Nie, H (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",ojyh@jnu.edu.cn; juanur@126.com; heniexka@gmail.com,,,Guangdong Social Sciences Discipline Construction Project [GD16XYJ12]; 13th Five-Year Plan of 2017 Philosophy and Social Sciences Project in Shenzhen [135B011],Guangdong Social Sciences Discipline Construction Project; 13th Five-Year Plan of 2017 Philosophy and Social Sciences Project in Shenzhen,"This work is supported by grants from the Guangdong Social Sciences Discipline Construction Project (No. GD16XYJ12) and the 13th Five-Year Plan of 2017 Philosophy and Social Sciences Project in Shenzhen (No. 135B011).

The history of the EMH provides a telling example of the way quantitative analyses can supply different perspectives on the qualitative history of this hypothesis or complement it. For instance, since the EMH was proposed, several criticisms emerged. In addition, the definition and the scope of this hypothesis have been modified several times. Although the qualitative history of the EMH refers to these criticisms and these alternative definitions and scopes, qualitative tools cannot provide a clear measure of the impact of these criticisms and these modifications among economists. By studying the dissemination of the EMH, its major criticisms, and the answers economists provided, citation analysis sheds a different light on the history of the EMH.","[Jovanovic, Franck] TELUQ Univ, Sch Adm Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jovanovic, Franck] CIRST, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jovanovic, Franck] Univ Orleans, LEO, Orleans, France",University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ; Universite de Orleans,"Jovanovic, F (通讯作者)，TELUQ Univ, Sch Adm Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Jovanovic, F (通讯作者)，CIRST, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Jovanovic, F (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, LEO, Orleans, France.",franck.jovanovic@teluq.ca,"jovanovic, franck/B-1016-2019",,,,,,92,7,11,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

It indicates that the adopted approach is based on the concept of Expectations Based Management (EBM). The author discusses in this paper the manner of developing measures for the needs of the EBM concept and assessing their usefulness in the conditions of the capital market in Poland. In particular, the aim of this paper is to assess the creation of value for owners of listed companies - in the expected and sufficient manner. From the theoretic and methodical perspective the sub goal is to expand the field of perception of the market value added measure by introducing the concept of the excess value. At the utility perspective the sub-goal is to verify the effectiveness of excess market added value in the evaluation process of the created value to equity (value for shareholders, owners). The analysis comprises 20 listed companies (the sectors: energy, chemical industry, fuel and raw materials), whose shares are listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. These are the main creators and destroyers of value added. The test period covered the years 2008-2013. The article proves three research hypotheses, and the general conclusion is that excess market value added provides a more reliable description of capital market changes (companies market capitalisation) as classic market value added, taking into account owners (shareholders) expectations.","[Kaczmarek, Jaroslaw] Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka St 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Kaczmarek, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Rakowicka St 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",kaczmarj@uek.krakow.pl,"Kaczmarek, Jarosław/V-2912-2018","Kaczmarek, Jarosław/0000-0002-2554-814X",,,,,49,6,6,0,7,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Theoretical models do not explain clearly the impact of the stronger protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) on trade. Thus, more empirical research in this area is needed. The results show that the threat of imitation is an important factor influencing exports from the most advanced economies to all countries of the world. In the case of high and upper middle-income importers, the stronger threat of imitation (resulting from low IP protection and strong imitation abilities) results in increased exports from the five advanced economies, especially in the case of high tech goods. Regarding low and lower middle-income importers, when the threat of imitation rises, the exports, especially of non-high-tech goods from the G-5 economies, decreases.","[Kuznar, Andzelika; Folfas, Pawel] Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Int Econ, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Kuznar, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Inst Int Econ, Warsaw, Poland.",,"Folfas, Paweł/GLT-3505-2022; Kuznar, Andzelika/GLR-0750-2022","Kuznar, Andzelika/0000-0002-7042-4592; Folfas, Pawel/0000-0002-6052-7125",,,,,24,0,0,1,14,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts Wang et al.'s (2013) gross exports decomposition method to trace foreign values in bilateral trade between major pharmaceutical producers, using the 2014 WIOT database. Findings The paper shows that as in other sectoral value chains, the pharmaceutical value chain is heavily regional. The paper identifies a strong European regional value chain, and a less intensive, Asian regional value chain. Korea is positioned in the middle of the Asian value chain, and is connected to the European regional value chain as a second-tier supplier. Originality/value The paper documents the vertical specialization structure of the global pharmaceutical value chain through gross exports decomposition method, making use of the World Input-Output Table Database 2014 which disaggregates pharmaceuticals in its industry classification for the first time.","[Lee, Changsoo] Kyung Hee Univ Global Campus, Coll Int Studies, Yongin, South Korea; [Yun, Mikyung] Catholic Univ Korea, Sch Int Studies, Bucheon Si, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Catholic University of Korea,"Yun, M (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Korea, Sch Int Studies, Bucheon Si, South Korea.",mkyun@catholic.ac.kr,,,,,,,19,3,3,1,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Application of the bias-corrected Malmquist index showed a labor-saving technical change against all the remaining inputs for the three crops under analysis.

In particular, this report focuses on whether multinational firms transfer freedom of speech (FOS) to local workers in China. Using a large source of individual survey data, it is found that those who work in foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), especially non-Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (non-HMT) invested enterprises tend to prefer FOS. This is in contrast to enterprises that do not work in FIEs. Such patterns are also observed in other related human rights and cultural measures common to Western democracies, but not China's political and local culture. Using policies on FDI as exogenous instruments, and other complementary identification strategies, a causal link for such an ideological transfer is established.","[Lin, Faqin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing Shi, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Lin, FQ (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing Shi, Peoples R China.",linfaqin@cufe.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503281, 71773148]; program for innovation research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Young Elite Teacher Project of Central University of Finance and Economics",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); program for innovation research in Central University of Finance and Economics; Young Elite Teacher Project of Central University of Finance and Economics,"The author is grateful to the Editor, Professor Alexandra Roulet and also to the anonymous referees for their invaluable comments that helped to improve this paper.

The inhibition against collection of expectations data has gradually lessened, generating a substantial body of recent evidence on the expectations of broad populations. This paper first summarizes the history leading to development of the modern literature and overviews its main concerns. I then describe research on three subjects that should be of direct concern to macroeconomists: expectations of equity returns, inflation expectations, and professional macroeconomic forecasters. I also describe work that questions the assumption that persons have well defined probabilistic expectations and communicate them accurately in surveys. Finally, I consider the evolution of thinking about expectations formation in macroeconomic policy analysis. I favorably observe the increasing willingness of theorists to study alternatives to rational expectations assumptions, but I express concern that models of expectations formation will proliferate in the absence of empirical research to discipline thinking. To make progress, I urge measurement and analysis of the revisions to expectations that agents make following occurrence of unanticipated shocks.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Manski, CF (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,,,,,173,57,65,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

Unlike previous studies, the patient population is not restricted to Medicare patients, but covers all ages and insurance types. After controlling for unobserved hospital quality and endogenous HIT adoption, our results suggest that a hospital's severity-adjusted mortality decreases by 0.3 percentage points. When restricted to the Medicare patients, we find HIT adoption lowers a hospital's severity-adjusted mortality rate by 0.5 percentage points.

In the model, formal workers commute every day to the Central Business District (CBD) to work in formal firms. Informal workers choose their commuting frequency knowing that they either can work at home and save on commuting costs, or have a higher remuneration at the CBD but incur commuting costs. We demonstrate that the difference in urban costs between formal and informal workers is a mechanism through which improvements in accessibility lead to lower informality rates. Next, we use the model to compare the impact and efficiency of four policy options: a hiring-costs subsidy and a transport subsidy for either all workers, formal workers, or informal workers. We find that a transport subsidy targeted at informal workers is undesirable. We also find that a hiring-costs subsidy is superior to transport subsidies in reducing informality.","[Moreno-Monroy, Ana I.] OECD, Paris, France; [Posada, Hector M.] Univ Antioquia, Econ Dept, Medellin, Colombia",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Universidad de Antioquia,"Moreno-Monroy, AI (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",ana.morenomonroy@oecd.org; hector.posada@udea.edu.co,,"Moreno Monroy, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-8282-4067; Posada, Hector M./0000-0002-9600-561X",Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme [PEIF-GA-2013-627114]; University of Antioquia; Colciencias; Conalpe,"Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); University of Antioquia; Colciencias(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Conalpe","Moreno-Monroy gratefully acknowledges financial support from a Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship (PEIF-GA-2013-627114) within the 7th European Community Framework Programme.

To this end, we investigate the relationship between investor sentiment and stock market returns for the G7 countries from June 1987 to February 2014. We propose an empirical non-linear panel data specification based on the panel switching transition model to capture the investor sentiment-stock return relationship, while enabling investor sentiment to act asymmetrically, non-linearly, and time varyingly according to the market state and investor attitude towards risk. Our findings are twofold. First, we show that the hypotheses of efficiency, rationality, and representative agent do not hold in reproducing stock market dynamics. Second, investor sentiment affects stock returns significantly and non-linearly, but its effects vary with the market conditions. Indeed, the market appears predominated by fundamental investors in the first regime. In the second regime, investor sentiment effect is positively activated, increasing stock returns; however, when their overconfidence sentiment exceeds some threshold, this effect becomes inverse in the third regime for a high threshold level of market confidence and investor over-optimism.","[Namouri, Hela; Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] EconomiX, Evry, France; [Ftiti, Zied] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France; [Hachicha, Nejib] Univ Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia",Universite Paris Saclay; Universite de Sfax,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France.",Fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,"Ftiti, Zied/J-6533-2019","Ftiti, Zied/0000-0002-6216-1104; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,44,15,15,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results of the analysis provide new empirical evidence on the MCI's ability to capture the monetary policy developments. Furthermore, we employ Granger causality to infer the extent of external influences on the overall monetary conditions of analysed countries.

Population structures are changing significantly, and the demands placed on individual social systems are increasing. In the context of expert discussion, continuous attention is being devoted to issues surrounding long-term pension system sustainability and, in recent years, attention has also focused on social services and health care issues. The lessons learned so far have identified that the social services system is not prepared for the consequences of an ageing population. Many social service providers are already facing a shortage of social workers and in most regions waiting times for placement in residential facilities are increasing, field social services are not being further developed and the support provided by carers is insufficient. The aim of this paper is to attempt at least to provide an outline quantification of the expected increase in the need for skilled workers in the social services sector in order that these services will continue to be provided at a high quality level. Performed calculations show that by 2050, the number of workers in the social services sector would have to be approximately doubled, with the greatest personnel growth to be made by 2035.","[Prusa, Ladislav] Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000, Czech Republic",Research Institute for Labour & Social Affairs,"Prusa, L (通讯作者)，Res Inst Labour & Social Affairs, Delnicka 213-12, Prague 17000, Czech Republic.",ladislav.prusa@vupsv.cz,,,Czech Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs (RILSA/VUPSV),Czech Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs (RILSA/VUPSV),The research was financially supported by the Czech Research Institute for Labour and Social Affairs (RILSA/VUPSV) in the context of an institutional subsidy for the development of public research institutions.,,11,1,1,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,308,317,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000485363200034,0

We first verify directors' monitoring roles by showing that firms with accounting expert sitting on their audit committees demonstrate stronger accounting conservatism. In our main tests, we find that these firms maintain lower dividend payment level, which are less sensitive to earnings volatility. This suggests directors' advisory roles in financial policy. We further show that our accounting expertise cannot be subsumed by management ability. In additional test, we further examine the baseline results conditional on analyst forecast error.

This helps reduce costs, increase production effectiveness and other characteristics, which can lead to better competitiveness and performance. Finding IE methods that have significant impact on overall business performance is the main purpose of this paper. Another objective was to determine whether the impact of industrial engineering methods applies to all industries in the Czech Republic or whether it applies only to selected industries. The data was obtained through an online questionnaire survey, the survey focused on a wide range of manufacturing companies (N=235) from different industries, different sizes and ages. For comparing the overall business performance among individual respondents, a ROE 1 (Return on Equity) indicator was selected. To measure this indicator from the impact of the tax, investment and credit policy, a modified ROE indicator (ROE 2 calculated first with EBITDA - Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and then ROE 3 calculated with EBIT - Earnings before Interest and Taxes) was used. The results show that the use of IE methods in manufacturing plants is limited to a few selected methods. Similarly, only a few industrial engineering methods are typically used in high performance firms and can therefore be said to be involved in increasing performance. The statistically significant relationship between specific IE method and the higher performance measured by ROE 1 or ROE 2 was observed only for standardization, 5S, JIT, APS and six sigma. Presented research also shows that this influence of methods does not apply to individual IE methods globally in all the sectors studied, but only in some of them.","[Rajnoha, Rastislav] Pan European Univ, Tomasikova 20, SK-82102 Bratislava, Slovakia; [Galova, Katerina] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, CZ-76001 Zlin, Czech Republic; [Rozsa, Zoltan] Sch Econ & Management Publ Adm Bratislava, Furdekova 16, Bratislava 85104 5, Slovakia",Pan-European University; Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Rajnoha, R (通讯作者)，Pan European Univ, Tomasikova 20, SK-82102 Bratislava, Slovakia.",rastislav.rajnoha@paneurouni.com; kgalova@utb.cz; zoltan.rozsa@vsemvs.sk,"Rózsa, Zoltán/GZK-6056-2022; Rozsa, Zoltan/E-1043-2013; Rajnoha, Ing.

These heterodox theories of money all have as common starting point an analysis of credit-debt relations in which production is a central feature, with these economies organized along capitalistic design. The Keynesian-Marxian framework describing the process of monetary circulation, traditionally referred to as the theory of the monetary circuit (TMC), perhaps best represents this comprehensive vision. This broad TMC analytical framework is compatible with institutionalist theories of money that also point to the importance of credit-debt relations. The question, however, is whether this more unified heterodox theory of money, which describes sequentially monetary relations under capitalism, can be used to understand pre-capitalistic monetary institutions. By conceptualizing money as a means of payment rather than medium of exchange, Karl Polanyi's analysis offers social scientists crucial insights to understanding monetary relations in all types of societies in which credit-debt relations have emerged historically.","[Seccareccia, Mario] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Correa, Eugenia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",University of Ottawa; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Seccareccia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We link resilience to the quality of countries' economic structures. The paper finds robust evidence that sound labour and product markets and conditions for doing business increase the resilience towards adverse shocks and reduce the incidence of crises more generally. In the presence of a common shock, a country with weak economic structures can on average suffer up to twice the output loss in a given year compared to a more adaptable economy. From a policy perspective, this implies the need to push forward structural policies in countries with lower quality economic structures to increase resilience in case of future shocks.

The study focuses on (1) inflation forecasts published by selected central banks, i.e. headline inflation and core or monetaty policy-relevant (MPR) inflation, which are made on the assumption of endogenous instrument rate, (2) one-year consumer inflation expectations, and (3) repo rate decisions. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether MPR and core inflation forecasts (in addition to headline inflation forecasts) are useful tools in implementing IFT. The authors take into consideration differences between forecasts deviations from the inflation target, dependencies between forecasts and consumer inflation expectations and relationships between repo rate decisions and forecasts. The methodology used includes nonparametric tests and statistics (Sign Test, Wilcoxon Matched Pair Test, Nonparametric Correlation coefficients) and forecast errors analysis. The results are sufficiently positive to conclude that the implementation of IFT in central banking practice should be supplemented by forecasts of core inflation. The paper contributes to the literature on implementing monetary policy under the concept of IFT.

The covering strategy for developing the cold chain value-added service between the two countries is proposed. Design/methodology/approach The author expounds the driving power for developing cold chain logistics between the two countries basing on the trade data of agricultural exports and imports, the tariff liberalization agreement of China-Korea FTA and the short distance between the two countries. It analyzes the value-added service of cold chain logistics with exemplary cases from four aspects (customized service, integrated service, consultation/solution and strategic alliance service), and its value-added mechanism for the enhancement of core competences of the entire cold chain. Then, by considering the drawbacks of the current cold chain logistics practices, between the two countries, the author proposes certain measures for fostering the cold chain value-added services between them. Findings There are apparent mutual benefits in developing cold chain value-added service between the two countries, but there exists some shortcomings which impede the sound development of the cold chain logistics, such as low circulation rate and insufficient cold chain facility in China, shortage of integrated and compatible information platform between the two countries, few integrated cold chain service and strategic alliance service and occurrence of some trade frictions. Originality/value The enforcement of China-Korea FTA will greatly reduce the tariff and increase the import and export volumes between the two countries; with the proximity between them, development of cold chain logistics between the two countries holds tremendous potential. This paper thoroughly discusses the mechanism of the value-added service of the cold chain logistics, and brings into focus the development of the value-added service in the two countries.","[Wang, Shuyun] Yantai Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Yantai, Peoples R China",Yantai University,"Wang, SY (通讯作者)，Yantai Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Yantai, Peoples R China.",wsyyt@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [NSFC-71672166]; Shandong Social Science Planning [17BGLJ02],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Social Science Planning,This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China in 2016 (NSFC-71672166) and from Shandong Social Science Planning in 2017 (17BGLJ02).,,31,10,11,5,62,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This study explores what impacts both vertical and horizontal incentives have on local governments' tax efforts in China. For consistency with the literature, we first include typical economic and institutional factors in our analysis. We find that the effects of economic factors on local tax efforts are significant, but the effects of institutional factors tend to be weak. Fiscal decentralization, as a vertical incentive, has a significantly positive effect on tax efforts at the provincial level. Meanwhile, fiscal interaction, as a horizontal incentive, is also taken into account in a spatial specification to explain tax competition among local governments. The results show that local tax effort in China also depends on the horizontal incentive. Hence, to improve local tax effort, the central government should let the locals have more autonomy in collecting taxes and evaluate local tax effort by referring to tax collection in adjacent provinces simultaneously.","[Xing, Weibo] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qinghua] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qinghua] Peking Univ, Inst Econ Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; Peking University; Peking University,"Xing, WB (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xingweibo@uibe.edu.cn,,"Xing, Weibo/0000-0002-1703-0674","National Nature Science Foundation of China [71673044]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [CXTD7-01]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of MOE, China [15YJA790070]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE; Humanities and Social Science Fund of MOE, China","This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China [71673044]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in UIBE [CXTD7-01]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of MOE, China [15YJA790070]",,36,8,8,4,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The sample for the study was collected from participants who worked in a public organisation providing sports and physical activity services. The results of the study showed statistically significant relationships among leader-member exchange, mobbing, and employee turnover intentions. More specifically, leader-member exchange was found to have a significant negative relationship with mobbing and employee turnover intentions. Mobbing, on the other hand, had a significant positive relationship with employee turnover intentions and mediated the relationship between leader-member exchange and employee turnover intentions.

Following the end of communism there was a fifteen year process of transition which ended in 2004 with eight post-communist countries joining the European Union (EU) of which Poland was the largest. As part of the EU these countries now face the challenge of the common EU strategy Europe 2020, which has set the target of achieving R&D expenditure to GDP ratio (called the R&D intensity) of 3% by 2020 for the Union as a whole in an effort to increase the competitiveness of the region. Poland, like the other post-communist countries, faces a lower target of R&D intensity, set at 1.7%. Nevertheless, the challenge is immense, since the country is still at only half that level and has little experience in developing policies to help achieve it. In this paper we tested two possible policy options to achieve the target: (1) to increase government expenditures on R&D and; (2) to provide tax relief on R&D to businesses. The method applied to assess the options is a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Poland with an explicit link between productivity and R&D stock. The results show that achieving the R&D intensity target via the use of tax relief is 2.5 times more costly to the government budget, but it has a greater impact on the economy in terms of a higher GDP growth. Tax relief proved efficient in the short run while in the long run the government expenditure policy provides better value for money. (C) 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling.

The break dates are associated to major historical or economic events such as sociopolitical crisis, commodity price fluctuations on international market, the discovery and the exploitation of mineral deposits or unfavourable environmental and climatic conditions.

Players choose strategies to play indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemmas; the strategies are represented by finite automata, and complexity costs are imposed. Players update their strategies based on the successfulness of the strategies. Using both theoretical analysis and computational experiments, I show that the presence of noise dramatically changes the system dynamics. The effect of noise interacts with the benefit of cooperation: noise can increase cooperation, but only when its level is low and the benefit of cooperation is high. In the noise-free environment, I observe constant oscillations between cooperation and defection. In contrast, the presence of noise makes Win-Stay Lose-Shift (WSLS) a successful strategy when the benefit of cooperation is sufficiently high, making cooperation relatively stable and leading to an efficient outcome.

In particular, we show that: (i) taxes have negative influence in the consumption share, being higher the marginal effect of the labour-income tax; (ii) for any given government expenditure share, an increase (a decrease) in financial-assets tax decreases (increases) the labour-income tax; (iii) only the financial-assets tax affects negatively the R&D intensity and the skill-premium; thus, to reduce the skill-premium the financial-assets tax must increase; (iv) ignoring the effect on wage inequality and on R&D intensity, taxes are substitutes.","[Afonso, Oscar] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEFAGE UBI, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Afonso, Oscar; Magalhaes, Manuela] OBEGEF, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Bandeira, Ana Maria] Polytech Inst Porto, Porto Accounting & Business Sch, CEPESE, Oporto, Portugal; [Bandeira, Ana Maria] CEOS PP, Oporto, Portugal; [Magalhaes, Manuela] Univ Portucalense, CEFAGE UBI, Oporto, Portugal; [Magalhaes, Manuela] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEFAGE UBI & OBEGEF, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Universidade Portucalense Infante D.

The survey focuses on how the various models have faced the issues implied by adopting a bottom-up approach in a traditionally aggregative structure and highlights the additional insights coming from this modeling strategy.

We explore how international risk-sharing can be achieved through portfolio diversification in each of these asset market configurations. We also look at how these holdings would change as China gradually rebalanced its production with a larger share of labor income, and as the productivity gap between China and the United States narrowed.

The paper proposes an indicator of the level of technological sophistication based on revealed comparative advantages and uses it to investigate the relation between technological advance, factor endowments and supply chain trade. It is shown that supply chain-trade does not facilitate technological transfer. On the contrary: FDI appears to have significant and negative spill-over effects on technological change.

The main findings are: (1) Chinese couples do deliberately coordinate their time use to gain more synchronous time in household work and leisure. (2) Non-couples also synchronize their activities if they live in the same household, but their time synchronization is much weaker than that of couples. (3) Couples' synchronous time is significantly correlated to the husband's and the wife's labor supply and job characteristics, including wage rates, employment status, and occupation, as well as other personal characteristics and household demographics. This correlation differs between urban and rural couples. Generally speaking, urban couples are more similar to their Western counterparts.

The provision of UI is motivated by the worker's inability to perfectly insure against income shocks, but at the same time UI introduces distortions into workers' search intensity decisions and firm vacancy creation. I find that equilibrium effects are important. When the UI level is raised 25%, they constitute around one-third of the increase in total unemployment. However, even with limited savings by workers, optimal UI is close to zero. It is further shown that ignoring the possibility of self-insurance greatly affects the optimal UI level.","[Vejlin, Rune] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Vejlin, Rune] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Aarhus University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Vejlin, R (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Nordre Ringgade 1, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",rvejlin@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,35,1,2,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We use the issuing of cards (red and yellow) and the number of sanctions (fouls) as a conflict proxy, plus macro-level national identity markers to determine between team variations. Our results indicate that national identity is robustly significant in the prediction of conflict, whereas the match-specific variables seem to be of less importance.

Moreover, we find that tacit collusion is less sustainable if the government of the importing country imposes a lower (higher) tariff on the more (less) efficient exporting firm.

A trade model between a rural area and an urban area is used to show that transport costs increase volatility in rural markets when this volatility is due to local supply or demand shocks in the rural area. We provide empirical support to this proposition by exploring a dataset of monthly maize price series across 28 markets over the 2004-2014 period in Burkina Faso. Travel time, kilometric distance and road pavement are used as proxies for transport costs. We estimate an autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model to investigate the statistical effect of these proxies on maize price volatility. We find a robust and positive effect of transport costs on maize price volatility. Our findings suggest that enhancing road infrastructure in landlocked countries would strengthen the link between rural and urban markets, thereby smoothing grain price volatility.","[Le Cotty, T.; d'Hotel, E.

Continental European countries, with their low job finding rates, exhibit the lowest TFPs. Nordic countries display the highest levels of TFP due to their high job finding rate relative to the separation rate. TFP in Anglo-Saxon countries stands in-between the two groups. The paper further studies the effect of hiring subsidies on TFP and the labor market.

With imperfect substitutability between asset classes, portfolio rebalancing in the context of quantitative easing (QE) affects bond yields, stock prices, the exchange rate and the private sector's saving decision. QE as announced in January 2015 generates 0.4% effective euro depreciation and raises real GDP in the euro area by 0.2% and prices by 0.3% by 2017 in the model.

Three different data sets and several types of specifications are used. The study suggests three main points. First, in all cases there is a clear indication of an inverted-U relation in which happiness-inequality first increases with mean happiness, reaches a peak, and then declines. Moreover, the estimated turning-point occurs at a fairly late stage, and 35% to 40% of the countries lie in the increasing-inequality segment. Second, a possible policy implication is that there may be need to address accentuation of happiness-inequality at early stages of increase in average happiness. Third, the estimates indicate that the predominant sentiment in the literature toward a negative relation between mean happiness and happiness-inequality is probably based on oversimplified linear models.","[Ram, Rati] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA",Illinois State University,"Ram, R (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rram@ilstu.edu,,,,,,,28,10,10,1,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

To this aim we analyze the control problem of a social optimum with waste, abatement and productive capital stocks. Consumption generates waste. We have two main results: (1) An environmental Keynes-Ramsey rule showing how along the transitional path, consumption dynamics is affected by capital and waste. One crucial implication is that faster waste emissions do not always call for faster abatement investment, and this effect can generate an overshooting in waste and productive capital stock, not present in the standard Keynes-Ramsey model. (2) In the steady state both productive capital stock and output are unchanged relative to the standard Ramsey model; nonetheless, the output composition changes since, to make room for abatement investment, steady state consumption must be reduced. We stress that, when abatement activities are treated as flows, the benefits and costs of abatement capital are greatly undervalued. It is the marginal impact of the whole abatement stock that impinges upon waste accumulation and current consumption, not only the additional unit of abatement activity.","[Saltari, Enrico] Sapienza Univ Roma, Dipartimento Econ & Diritto, Fac Econ, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Travaglini, Giuseppe] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Econ Soc Polit, Fac Econ, Via Saffi 42, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Urbino,"Travaglini, G (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Dipartimento Econ Soc Polit, Fac Econ, Via Saffi 42, I-61029 Urbino, PU, Italy.",enrico.saltari@uniroma1.it; giuseppe.travaglini@uniurb.it,"Travaglini, Giuseppe/HPC-2911-2023","Travaglini, Giuseppe/0000-0003-1943-096X",,,,,50,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Firstly, we estimate average treatment effect on the individual sectors to identify the unexplained part of gender pay gap. To identify the possible causes of observed variability in unexplained gender wage differences, we use a linear regression model. Using European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data for 24 European Union (EU) members, we conclude that the unexplained gender pay gap in the individual sectors varies both within the individual EU countries and among the countries. The most important factors in explaining the differences in the gender pay gap among the individual sectors are ownership and the proportion of women in the sector. On the other hand, the proportion of female managers and the proportion of small companies are not statistically significant factors for the explanation of the variation in the sector-specific gender pay gaps. To the best of my knowledge, this study is the first to present fully comparable estimates of the unexplained sector-specific gender pay gap for the 24 EU countries and to identify the causes of the differences in the unexplained gender pay gap at the sectoral level.","[Hedija, Veronika] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Econ Studies, Jihlava, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Hedija, V (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Econ Studies, Jihlava, Czech Republic.",veronika.hedija@vspj.cz,"Hedija, Veronika/AFO-7966-2022","Hedija, Veronika/0000-0002-5353-1505",College of Polytechnics Jihlava [1200/4/61353],College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"This work was supported by the College of Polytechnics Jihlava [grant number 1200/4/61353, The Relationship Among Firm Size, Firm Growth and Gender Characteristics].",,24,8,8,11,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The band widths reflect, in the best case, the precision of the average signal and, otherwise, the precision of a single private signal.","Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA; Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Melbourne,"Bossaerts, P (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Eccles Sch Business, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",peter.bossaerts@utah.edu,"Bossaerts, Peter/AAZ-9851-2020; Bossaerts, Peter/O-9964-2015; Asparouhova, Elena/AAB-6913-2020","Bossaerts, Peter/0000-0003-2308-2603;","National Science Foundation [SES-1061844, SES-1061824]; Banque de France Foundation; Moore Foundation; Development Fund of the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Banque de France Foundation; Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); Development Fund of the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah,"Financial support from the National Science Foundation (Asparouhova: SES-1061844, Bossaerts: SES-1061824), the Banque de France Foundation, a Moore Foundation grant to Caltech (2006-13) in support of Experimentation with Large, Diverse and Interconnected Socio-Economic Systems, and the Development Fund of the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah is gratefully acknowledged.

A little knowledge of the total cost of cash advances indicates a vulnerable consumer who may be unable to be aware of when and which financial institution to acquire a cash advance. Methods: This paper seeks to determine the characteristics of consumers and financial institutions that may be related to a greater or lesser knowledge of the total cost paid in cash advances. Results: The results of a hierarchical logistic regression shows that low knowledge of the total cost paid in a cash advance is associated with segments of consumers who do not use the total cost of cash advance as a signal of quality, older consumers, women and those who are not customers of the financial institution that offers the cash advance. The results also suggest that price advertising is effective only for consumers with a low use of the total cost as signal of quality (interaction effect). The other variables examined were not significant. Conclusions: This article shows that poor knowledge of the total cost paid in cash advances is not homogeneous between consumers and the financial institutions that offer these cash advances.","[Farias, Pablo] Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Dept Adm, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Farías, P (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Fac Econ & Negocios, Dept Adm, Santiago, Chile.",pfarias@fen.uchile.cl,"Farías, Pablo/J-8668-2014","Farías, Pablo/0000-0001-6083-7492",,,,,42,0,0,0,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Participation elasticities with respect to expected earnings range between 0.8 and 1.3 and about -0.05 and 0.01 with respect to changes in recent income. While recent earnings affecting participation is at odds with the standard neoclassical model, the magnitude of the effect is small, suggesting that the neoclassical model is a good approximation of the labor supply behavior of boat owners in southern India.

This paper studies how violators' aversion to lying affects the design and merit of enforcement regimes that require self-reporting. Even when a self-reporting requirement produces costs of lies and enjoys no economic advantage in the absence of lie aversion, I find that self-reporting improves enforcement efficiency. With lie aversion, self-reporting enables greater deterrence of violations at a lower cost of monitoring. Corollaries to this result are that (1) the presence of lie aversion enhances social welfare; (2) enforcement regimes that elicit more noxious lies when false reports are made-for example, a compulsory versus voluntary self-reporting feature-are advantageous; and (3) under an optimal enforcement regime, lying generally occurs and the self-reporting sanction is higher than the average sanction for a false report.","[Innes, Robert] Univ Calif, Econ, SSHA, Merced, CA 95343 USA",University of California System; University of California Merced,"Innes, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif, Econ, SSHA, Merced, CA 95343 USA.",rinnes@ucmerced.edu,,,,,,,64,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Four basic financial assets are available on the financial market: a money market account (the cash), a real consumption good, a financial stock index and a bond with constant maturity. In this incomplete framework, we provide the general solution of the expected utility maximization. We compute the monetary loss from not having access to an inflation-indexed bond, in order to be hedged against the inflation risk. We show that this latter one usually reaches high levels (more than 1% per year). Thus, the magnitude of such costs reaches those of management fees or transaction costs.

We propose a clear interpretation of the debt: households lend unconsumed income to firms to finance their investments, and money creation is not necessary. We offer a detailed description of the economic collapse and analyse its causes thanks to numerical experiments. The crisis is triggered by profits squeezed by wages and not by debt overhang. We test alternative assumptions on the investors' behaviour to show that behaviour at very low profits is fundamental.

We construct a new semiannual series on financial distress in 24 OECD countries for the period 1967-2012. The series is based on assessments of the health of countries' financial systems from a consistent, real-time narrative source, and classifies financial distress on a relatively fine scale. We find that the average decline in output following a financial crisis is statistically significant and persistent, but only moderate in size. More important, we find that the average decline is sensitive to the specification and sample, and that the aftermath of crises is highly variable across major episodes. A simple forecasting exercise suggests that one important driver of the variation is the severity and persistence of financial distress itself. At the same time, we find little evidence of nonlinearities in the relationship between financial distress and the aftermaths of crises.","[Romer, Christina D.; Romer, David H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Romer, CD (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",cromer@econ.berkeley.edu; dromer@econ.berkeley.edu,,,"Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California, Berkeley","Center for Equitable Growth at the University of California, Berkeley","C.

Data involving substituted soccer players of the German Bundesliga indicate only weak evidence of a negative effect of ex ante heterogeneity on effort; in contrast, intermediate information, measured by goal difference at the time of substitution, significantly affects effort. Players exert the greatest effort when their team is leading by one goal and reduce their effort when it is trailing. When intermediate information suggests the contest is already decided, players from both teams reduce effort. This behavior is in line with loss aversion, such that players weight potential losses more than potential gains and adjust their effort accordingly.","[Schneemann, Sandra] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Sports Sci, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Deutscher, Christian] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Sports Sci, Sports Econ, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld; University of Bielefeld,"Schneemann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Sports Sci, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",sandra.schneemann@uni-bielefeld.de; christian.deutscher@uni-bielefeld.de,"Deutscher, Christian/AAN-8104-2020","Deutscher, Christian/0000-0002-3714-3326; Schneemann, Sandra/0000-0001-9375-1994",,,,,44,13,13,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Employment fluctuations of startups are procyclical, they persist into later years, and cohort-level employment variations are largely driven by differences in firm size, rather than the number of firms. An estimated general equilibrium firm dynamics model reveals that aggregate conditions at birth, rather than post-entry choices, drive the majority of cohort-level employment variation by affecting the share of startups with high growth potential. In the aggregate, changes in startup conditions result in large, slow-moving fluctuations in employment.","[Sedlacek, Petr] Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Sterk, Vincent] UCL, Dept Econ, Drayton House,Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Bonn; University of London; University College London,"Sedlácek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Dept Econ, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",sedlacek@uni-bonn.de; v.sterk@ucl.ac.uk,,"Sedlacek, Petr/0009-0004-1421-5843",,,,,34,74,87,6,37,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

We focus on heterogeneity caused by different labor market histories and the resulting wealth inequality they generate. We show that this inequality implies wage rigidity relative to a complete insurance economy. The fraction of wealth poor agents prevents real wages from falling too much in recessions, since small decreases in income imply large losses in utility. Analogously, wages rise less during expansions than in models with homogeneous workers as small increases are enough for poor workers to accept job offers. This mechanism reduces the volatility of wages but generates more volatile employment levels.","[Shao, Enchuan] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, Arts 811,9 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada; [Silos, Pedro] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, 1301 Cecil B Moore Ave,Ritter Annex 879, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",University of Saskatchewan; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Shao, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Econ, Arts 811,9 Campus Dr, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5A5, Canada.",enchuan.shao@usask.ca; pedro.silos@temple.edu,,,,,,,30,3,4,2,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The approach incorporates price effects, food quality variation across income deciles, and consistent aggregation over income deciles and food qualities. The approach is based on a simple demand approach for four food categories. It relies on data on food availability, complemented by own-price and income elasticities and food price data. Beyond consistent aggregation, the framework exhibits desirable characteristics: food quality is increasing with income; price and income responses become less sensitive with income; and increasing income inequality decreases average per capita food consumption. The proposed approach is illustrated for Tanzania. We assess future food insecurity in Tanzania using the calibrated model and evaluate the impact of safety net policies and their budgetary costs. Food-insecure population is estimated as well as the implied food gap expressed in calorie per day per food-insecure person as well as in total annual food volume in grain equivalent. The food gap measure gauges the depth of the chronic food insecurity. (C) 2017 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

When lobbies work to disrupt trade agreements, a Nash reversion punishment scheme must balance two conflicting objectives. Longer punishments help to enforce cooperation by increasing the government's costs of defecting, but, because the lobby prefers the punishment outcome, this also incentivizes lobbying effort and with it political pressure to break the agreement. Thus the model generates an optimal length for Nash reversion punishments, and it depends directly on the political influence of the lobbies. Trade agreement tariffs are shown to be increasing in the political influence of the lobbies, as well as their patience levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we look at two types of extrinsic motivation: small rewards and some encouragement and examine which does a better job to motivate students. We find in this study that the promise of a reward leads to improvement in scores during the treatment period, however, encouragement improves student performance in the post-treatment period (during the national primary school leaving examination).","[Cheo, Roland] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",Shandong University,"Cheo, R (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China.",blangah@live.cn,,"Cheo, Roland/0000-0001-5654-2624",,,,,13,2,3,6,33,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

As a result, the allocation that a planner would choose cannot be reached as a competitive equilibrium outcome (neither for infinitely lived agents nor for overlapping generations): the market remuneration to capital and labor is too low. The planner's allocation can nonetheless be implemented by a fiscal policy subsidizing the returns to savings and the wage rate as needed. The exact policy differs depending on whether only past investment or total output influences productivity: in the first case only capital returns need to be subsidized, whereas in the second case labor income needs to be subsidized too.

The empirical analysis is implemented for the USA, where the dynamics in income inequality is mainly driven by the variation in the top one percent of the income distribution. The paper uses the inequality measures that represent the whole income distribution. The distributive effect of monetary policy is evaluated in the cases of different frequency data. To identify a monetary policy shock, the paper applies the contemporaneous and the long run identification methods. In particular, a cointegration relation is determined among the considered variables and the vector error correction methodology is used for the identification. The obtained results indicate that contractionary monetary policy decreases income inequality. These results can have important implications for the design of policies to reduce income inequality by giving more weight to monetary policy.","[Davtyan, Karen] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, AQR IREA, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Davtyan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometr Stat & Appl Econ, AQR IREA, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",karen.davtyan@ub.edu,"Davtyan, Karen/AAB-4283-2021","Davtyan, Karen/0000-0001-8766-0922",,,,,53,27,30,2,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Due to its range of applications in operations management, this problem has drawn much interest in recent years. Various articles have tried to reconcile the newsvendor problem with loss aversion under ad hoc assumptions on the underlying reference point. We, instead, argue that the newsvendor problem is an application of the well-studied compromise effect. As the compromise effect is based on violations of the IIA axiom, we argue that models of context-dependent behavior, such as salience theory, better explain newsvendor-like behavior than loss aversion-based models. We conduct a novel experiment which allows us to clearly distinguish between the role of loss aversion and salience, and find strong support for the latter. Thereby, we also add to the agenda of comparing loss aversion-based models and salience theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate how investment behavior changes when investment is subject to time-to-build versus when it is not. We characterize equilibrium investment strategies under several information structures and compare results to the social optimum. We offer some new results. The model predicts that, controlling for demand, and production and investment costs, investments and outputs can be higher in progressive industries (which often exhibit time-to-build) than in fast-paced industries (where time-to-build is insignificant). Furthermore, for both investment types (investment with or without time-to-build) we offer a novel equilibrium in which firms incrementally invest. This behavior is driven by demand uncertainty and capacity constraints. Also, expected outputs are lower than Cournot outputs as firms face uncertainty. Moreover, the amount of uncertainty has different effects over investment types.","[Genc, Talat S.] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON, Canada",University of Guelph,"Genc, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, Guelph, ON, Canada.",tgenc@uoguelph.ca,"Genc, Talat/HJH-2596-2023; Genc, Talat/HJH-0604-2022",,,,,,28,6,6,1,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-1889,1879-1743,,J ECON DYN CONTROL,J.

Second, localization is observed for all patent technology classes, and the extent of localization has a positive relationship with the level of technology measured by R&D investment.

It is a critical case study as Australia's widening gender wage gap is contrary to other developed nations. Using four different estimation methods, we find that reducing the gap by 10% can boost per capita output up to 3%. To check the robustness of our findings, we also control for the effects of both physical and human capital. Our results suggest there exists a strong business case for eliminating the gender wage gap. Given the tangible benefits to both equity and efficiency, such a goal should be of paramount importance for policy makers. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Under a pooling equilibrium there is a wedge between the borrower's true default risk and the default risk priced in debt, and its size differs with the maturity of debt. Safe borrowers tilt their debt maturity towards short-term - relative to the optimal choice under perfect information - since long-term debt pools more default risk that is not inherent to them. Risky borrowers mimic their behavior of safe borrowers to preclude the market from identifying their type. In times of financial distress, spreads increase and the default risk wedge of long-term debt relative to short-term debt increases, which makes borrowers shorten their debt maturity. Data on bond issuances for a panel of countries show that, consistent with the model, maturities co-vary negatively with spreads and that this co-movement is stronger in those situations in which informational asymmetries are larger.

In particular, what are the welfare consequences of government debt reductions? We answer these questions with the help of an incomplete markets economy with production. Households are subject to uninsurable income shocks. We make several contributions. First, by targeting the skewed wealth and earnings distribution of the US economy in our calibration, we identify inequality as the major driver of the welfare effects of public debt/GDP changes. Second, we show that in order to fully gauge the welfare consequences and the political feasibility of government debt changes, it is crucial to consider the transitional dynamics between stationary equilibria. Our results therefore have important implications for the design of debt'reduction policies. Since the skewed wealth distribution generates a large fraction of borrowing-constrained households, a public debt reduction should be non-linear, such that the tax burden is postponed into the future.

Considering for cross-sectional dependence and parameter heterogeneity across space and over time, we identify a significant and negative human capital-energy consumption relationship in China. Specifically, we find that a 1% increase in human capital reduces energy consumption by a range between 0.18% and 0.45%. Furthermore, this negative relationship can be attributed to stronger accumulation of post-school human capital in eastern China. This finding suggests that energy conservation in China could be achieved by improving, post-school human-capital components such as on-the-job training, experience and learning-by-doing.

Although most of Britain's establishment backed remaining in the European Union, 52 percent of voters disagreed and handed a surprise victory to the leave campaign. Brexit, as the act of Britain exiting the EU has become known, is likely to occur in early 2019. This article discusses the economic consequences of Brexit and the lessons of Brexit for the future of European and global integration. I start by describing the options for post-Brexit relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union and then review studies of the likely economic effects of Brexit. The main conclusion of this literature is that Brexit will make the United Kingdom poorer than it would otherwise have been because it will lead to new barriers to trade and migration between the UK and the European Union. There is considerable uncertainty over how large the costs of Brexit will be, with plausible estimates ranging between 1 and 10 percent of UK per capita income. The costs will be lower if Britain stays in the European Single Market following Brexit. Empirical estimates that incorporate the effects of trade barriers on foreign direct investment and productivity find costs 2-3 times larger than estimates obtained from quantitative trade models that hold technologies fixed.","[Sampson, Thomas] London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sampson, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, London, England.",t.a.sampson@lse.ac.uk,"Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023",,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,53,110,120,3,75,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Agents are heterogeneous in the size of captured ambiguity, endowment and preference for risk and ambiguity. Preferences are of variational type A la Maccheroni et al.

These decisions provide a clear test of the predictions of the standard economic model of insurance choice in the absence of choice frictions because plans were priced so that nearly every plan with a lower deductible was financially dominated by an otherwise identical plan with a high deductible. We document that the majority of employees chose dominated plans, which resulted in excess spending equivalent to 24% of chosen plan premiums. Low-income employees were significantly more likely to choose dominated plans, and most employees did not switch into more financially efficient plans in the subsequent year. We show that the choice of dominated plans cannot be rationalized by standard risk preference or any expectations about health risk. Testing alternative explanations with a series of hypothetical-choice experiments, we find that the popularity of dominated plans was not primarily driven by the size and complexity of the plan menu, nor informed preferences for avoiding high deductibles, but by employees' lack of understanding of health insurance. Our findings challenge the standard practice of inferring risk preferences from insurance choices and raise doubts about the welfare benefits of health reforms that expand consumer choice.","[Bhargava, Saurabh; Loewenstein, George] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Wisconsin Sch Business, Madison, WI USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Bhargava, S (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,"Loewenstein, George/G-7616-2014",,NBER Household Finance Grant,NBER Household Finance Grant,"We thank Andrei Shleifer and anonymous referees for editorial guidance as well as numerous others for their generous feedback including Alan Auerbach, Ned Augenblick, Linda Babcock, Zarek Brot-Goldberg, Ryan Bubb, David Card, Raj Chetty, David Coughlin, Stefano DellaVigna, Keith Ericson, Joe Farrell, Ben Handel, Hilary Hoynes, Botond Koszegi, Prasad Krishnamurthy, David Laibson, Brigitte Madrian, Ulrike Malmendier, Daniel McFadden, Katy Milkman, John Miller, Sendhil Mullainathan, Ted O'Donoghue, Devin Pope, Matthew Rabin, Alex Rees-Jones, Emmanuel Saez, Joshua Schwartzstein, David Sraer, Lowell Taylor, Richard Thaler, and Kevin Volpp. We additionally thank seminar participants at Baylor University, Behavioral Economic Annual Meetings (BEAM), Boston University, Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western University, Cornell University, Georgia State, Harvard Business School, Harvard University, the Harvard Kennedy School, the LDI CHIBE Behavioral Economics and Health Symposium at the University of Pennsylvania, the London School of Economics, MIT, Ohio State University, Oxford University, RAND, UC Berkeley, UCLA Anderson School of Management, USC Marshall School of Business, and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Oil prices have been breaking new historical price records since second quarter of 2014, especially from last quarter of 2015 to first quarter of 2016, which have gradually put pressure on political, geographical, and currencies risks in the Middle East and Eastern European countries. Similarly, because Turkish economy has been experienced serious current account deficit problems especially since 2002, the effect of decline in oil prices and increased volatility has been worth of investigating. For 2003M1-2015M7 period, export-import ratio, real exchange rate index, realized volatility in oil prices calculated based on monthly OPEC basket price, industrial production index, and consumer price index were collected to analyze these effects and causality relationship among these variables. Test results of unit root test with and without structural break, ARDL bound test and co-integration test were sorted out among variables. Initial result is that price volatility increases and total import decreases more sharply than total export after the decline in oil prices; thus, export-import ratio increases. Another is that there is a negative relationship between real exchange rate index and export-import ratio for real economy because of low oil substituents. As expected, inflation has an adverse effect on foreign trade ratio. Consequently, because of lower pressure of energy-induced inflation, economy policy makers will have some ability to change their priorities from inflation issue to other structural problems.","[Degirmen, Suleyman] Mersin Univ, Dept Econ, TR-33343 Mersin, Turkey; [Saltik, Omur] Toros Univ, Dept Business, TR-33440 Mersin, Turkey",Mersin University; Toros University,"Degirmen, S (通讯作者)，Mersin Univ, Dept Econ, TR-33343 Mersin, Turkey.",suleymandegirmen@gmail.com; omursaltik09@gmail.com,"degirmen, suleyman/AAN-5497-2020","degirmen, suleyman/0000-0001-8750-652X",,,,,35,2,2,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

We analyze whether public expenditures in neighboring municipalities influence local spending decisions within a comprehensive set of expenditure categories. Our analysis is based on panel data covering the universe of Colombian municipalities from 2000 to 2010. We offer a quasi-experimental identification strategy exploiting exogenous variation in municipalities' exposure to changes in the world market price of oil, depending on the municipalities' endowment with oil resources and controlling for municipality fixed effects. While we find evidence of strong spatial autocorrelation of total local public spending as well as in almost all expenditure categories, the quasi-experimental approach reveals that there are no significant causal fiscal interaction effects between municipalities. This highlights the importance of using additional sources of exogenous variation for the identification of fiscal interactions. In the developing country context, our findings suggest that fiscal decentralization policies do not lead to a race to the bottom in local public expenditures.","[Fossen, Frank M.] Univ Nevada, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Fossen, Frank M.] DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Fossen, Frank M.] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Mergele, Lukas; Pardo, Nicolas] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Pardo, Nicolas] Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Humboldt University of Berlin; Hertie School,"Pardo, N (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.;Pardo, N (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany.",nicolas.pardo.gomez@hu-berlin.de,"Fossen, Frank/S-5861-2019","Fossen, Frank/0000-0002-5908-8049",,,,,58,6,7,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Using GMM and Logit QMLE, we found strong evidence that the regional variation in the capital structure of listed firms is linked to growth indicator (the Market-to-Book value, MB), EBIT ratio, size of the firm and tangible assets (the value of Net Property, Plant and Equipment, PPE). In the process of economic recovery, there was apparent regional variation in the speed of adjustment in capital structure, i.e. the fastest adjustment in capital structure was found in East China while that of West China followed and that of Mid China the slowest, that is to say within a given period the leverage ratio of listed firms in East China rises or falls faster than in the other two regions.","[Mai, Yong; Meng, Lei; Ye, Zhiqiang] East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai, Peoples R China",East China University of Science & Technology,"Mai, Y (通讯作者)，East China Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",maiyong1151@163.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [14BJY177, 71301052]; Foundation of Chinese Ministry of Education [NW1422009]","National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Foundation of Chinese Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, China)",The authors are grateful to National Social Science Foundation of China for providing research funding (Project no.14BJY177 & Project no. 71301052); Foundation of Chinese Ministry of Education (Project no.

The analysis is carried out episode by episode, by means of a large-scale time-varying parameter model. We find that recessionary effects are triggered by oil price hikes and, in some cases, also by oil price slumps. In this respect, the post-2009 run-up likely contributed to sluggish growth, while uncertainty and real interest rate effects are the potential channels through which the 2014 slump has depressed aggregate demand and worsened financial conditions. Also in light of the zero interest rate policy carried out by the ECB, in so far as the Quantitative Easing policy failed to generate inflationary expectations, a more expansionary fiscal policy might be required to counteract the deflationary and recessionary threat within the expected environment of soft oil prices.","[Morana, Claudio] Univ Milano Bicocca, CeRP Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy; [Morana, Claudio] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Morana, C (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Econ Metodi Quantitativi & Strategie, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",claudio.morana@unimib.it,"Morana, Claudio/F-1680-2013","MORANA, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-8624-3158",European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [3202782013-2015],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no. 3202782013-2015.

The framework consists of suppliers with heterogeneous capabilities who must engage in a relation-specific investment to customize intermediate inputs upon a transfer payment by final producers. An outsourcing contract with better technologically endowed suppliers requires a lower transfer and generates a higher surplus. Stronger IPR enforcement leads firms to self-select into better quality suppliers on average by reducing their outside option. Weak legal institutions instead make it possible for a larger range of suppliers, including the less capable ones, to form partnerships by granting them a larger outside option. A better IPR environment is more likely to harm lagging countries where the technology distribution is characterized by less capable suppliers.","[Tsai, Yingyi] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan; [Naghavi, Alireza] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Peng, Shin-Kun] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung; University of Bologna; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Tsai, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, 700 Kaohsiung Univ Rd, Kaohsiung 811, Taiwan.",yytsai@nuk.edu.tw,,"Tsai, Yingyi/0000-0002-8011-9946",Academia Sinica; National Science Council [NSC-102-2410-H-001-001-MY3]; Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 103-2923-H-390-001-MY2]; MIUR (PRIN),"Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); MIUR (PRIN)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN))","The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees for their valuable feedback and insights, which greatly helped us to improve the paper.

If medical expenses can be sizeable early in retirement, full annuitisation at retirement is no longer optimal because agents do not have enough time to build a liquid wealth buffer. Furthermore, large deviations from optimal annuitisation levels lead to small utility differences. Our results suggest that health cost risk can explain a large proportion of empirically observed annuity choices. Finally, allowing additional annuitisation after retirement results in welfare gains of at most 2.5% when facing health cost risk, and negligible gains without this risk.","[Peijnenburg, Kim; Nijman, Theo; Werker, Bas J.

We use data from the second wave of the impact evaluation of the Zambia Child Grant model of the Social Cash Transfer programme.

The NBP's FG constitutes a unique case study as this measure in its'Odyssean'form was not introduced to overcome the limits offurther policy rates cuts. It allowed us to verify the FG's credibility and time-inconsistency by applying OLS and GMM estimated contemporaneous and forward looking Taylor type rules with interest smoothing. Our empirical evidence reveals that the annual period of FG in Poland was perceived as a credible promise by consumers. We found that time-consistency could have been an additional factor enhancing the considerable credibility of FG. The satisfying results of the NBP's FG appear to be especially interesting, in particular, when contrasted with the often unfavourable experience with time-contingent FG of prominent central banks. We suppose that to achieve this, the central bank should act with caution and the NBP indeed did so by specifying carefully the short horizon of the commitment to be able to abandon FG when the circumstances change. We also discuss FG by opposing its advantages and the drawbacks indicated in the subject literature.","[Ryczkowski, Maciej] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Ryczkowski, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Fac Econ Sci & Management, Torun, Poland.",maciej.ryczkowski@wp.pl,"Ryczkowski, Maciej/AAF-1544-2019","Ryczkowski, Maciej/0000-0003-2156-6823",,,,,69,3,3,0,1,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This paper discusses informal SBR and their effect on economic growth. It does so while accounting for various institutional settings, arguing that studying the interaction between informal SBR and existing institutions is important in this regard. This is done both theoretically and empirically. Two questions are being tackled. The first is: which institutions-specifically governance institutions-help informal SBR in realizing higher levels of economic growth? The second is: can informal SBR correct the institutional deficiencies of some institutions and lead to better economic outcomes? After a theoretical discussion, an OLS cross-sectional regression model is used to answer the research question. The obtained results suggest that informal SBR do have a positive effect on investment (and ultimately economic growth) when good institutions are established. In this paper, those institutions are suggested to be voice and accountability, control of corruption/cronyism, and government effectiveness. The results also suggest that informal SBR, by building trust, can overcome some institutional impediments such as ethnic fractionalization and (with less certainty) some hierarchical cultures, leading ultimately to more investment and economic growth.","[Sabry, Mohamed Ismail] Bremen Univ Appl Sci, Int Business Dept, Werderstr 73, D-28199 Bremen, Germany; [Sabry, Mohamed Ismail] Philipps Univ Marburg, Marburg, Hessen, Germany",Bremen University of Applied Sciences; Philipps University Marburg,"Sabry, MI (通讯作者)，Bremen Univ Appl Sci, Int Business Dept, Werderstr 73, D-28199 Bremen, Germany.;Sabry, MI (通讯作者)，Philipps Univ Marburg, Marburg, Hessen, Germany.",misabry@hotmail.com,,"Sabry, Mohamed/0000-0002-0638-5488",,,,,64,5,5,3,20,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Such peak price may incur significant cost to building operation. With the vehicle-to-building (V2B) technology, electric vehicle battery can be used as temporal energy source for the building load for a short period, which leads to a possible solution for reducing the energy cost during peak price periods. In this paper, the problem of reducing the energy cost due to the peak price is approached from the prospective of risk management. A regime-switching based risk management scheme is proposed for the V2B operation based on the availability of electric vehicles (EV) plugged in the parking lots attached to the building. In the low risk regime, the objective is to minimize the EV charging cost. While in the high risk regime, the objective is to reduce the potentially high energy cost due the peak price via the power stored in EV batteries. Based on Markov regime-switching model, the operation minimizes the conditional value at risk involved. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can greatly reduce the energy cost against the electricity peak prices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

At the micro level, firm behavior is characterized by lumpiness, and the standard production-smoothing theory is empirically rejected. To account for this, a nonconvex cost function is assumed in our model. It might be expected that even if the microeconomic behavior is lumpy, the effect disappears at the aggregate level because of the law of large numbers. However, we show that if there exist interactions among firms, a regular endogenous cycle emerges at the aggregate level given that the degree of the interaction effect exceeds a critical point. That is, the randomly behaving microeconomic agents generate deterministic collective behavior via interactions.

Learning about job loss leads to consumption decreases and spousal labor supply increases. This suggests existing willingness to pay estimates for UI understate its value. But it yields new estimation methodologies that account for and exploit responses to learning about future job loss. Although the new willingness to pay estimates exceed previous estimates, I estimate much larger frictions imposed by private information. This suggests privately traded UI policies would be too adversely selected to be profitable, at any price.","[Hendren, Nathaniel] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Hendren, N (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Littauer Ctr, 1805 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",nhendren@fas.harvard.edu,,,"NSF; NBER under National Institute of Aging [T32-AG000186]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NBER under National Institute of Aging; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","I am very grateful to Daron Acemoglu, Raj Chetty, Amy Finkelstein, Jon Gruber, Luigi Pistaferri, Rob Townsend, and a long list of seminar participants for their comments.

But is this effect due to a one-time knowledge transfer or does it rely on continuous injections of knowledge? To shed light on this question we focus on divestments, that is, foreign affiliates that are sold to local owners. To examine the effect of the ownership change we combine a difference-in-differences approach with propensity score matching. We use plant-level panel data from the Indonesian Census of Manufacturing covering the period 1990-2009. We consider 157 cases of divestment, where a large set of plant characteristics is available two years before and three years after the ownership change and for which observationally similar control plants exist. The results indicate that divestment is associated with a drop in total factor productivity accompanied by a decline in output, markups, as well as export and import intensities. The findings are consistent with the benefits of foreign ownership being driven by continuous supply of headquarter services from the foreign parent.","[Javorcik, Beata] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Poelhekke, Steven] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Poelhekke, Steven] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Oxford; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Javorcik, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",beata.javorcik@economics.ox.ac.uk; steven.poelhekke@eui.eu,,"Poelhekke, Steven/0000-0001-9256-7853",European Tax Policy Forum; University of Oslo,European Tax Policy Forum; University of Oslo,"The authors wish to thank Marina Bellani, Michael Devereux, Octavio Escobar, Cristina Jude, Helen Miller, Bruno Merlevede, Daniele Paserman, Veronica Purice, Nadine Riedel, Joel Rodrigue, Claudia Steinwender, and four anonymous referees as well as seminar participants at Erasmus University Rotterdam, De Nederlandsche Bank, ESG Management School, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, University of Oxford, University of Nottingham, VrijeUniversiteit Amsterdam, University of Sussex, Bilkent University, ETPF IFS 2014 Workshop, AEA Meetings 2015 in Boston, CESifo Global Economy Workshop 2015, Empirical Investigations in International Trade Conference 2014 in Eugene, Ljubljana Empirical Trade Conference 2014 in Izola, Workshop on Trade and Innovation 2014 in Ferrara, Workshop on Applied International Trade and Trade Facilitation in Ankara, 2015 Comparative Analysis of Enterprise Data Conference in Istanbul, and Workshop on Regions, Firms, and FDI in Ghent for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Importantly, however, we can improve upon ordinal rules. We show that we can design an incentive compatible cardinal rule which achieves higher utilitarian social welfare than any ordinal rule.

With longitudinal data from China, we estimate hazard models of dropping out of school in young adulthood with two dynamic measures of childhood poverty: poverty spell indicators that distinguish poverty in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence, and poverty indices that measure the depth of poverty and distinguish chronic from transient poverty. Four main results emerge: 1) Children who experience spells in poverty leave school at a higher rate than others, even adjusting for poverty in later periods; 2) Transient poverty is more widespread, and shows a greater negative association with school-leaving, than chronic poverty; 3) Early childhood poverty shows greater negative associations with education outcomes than poverty in later periods; and 4) Girls may be more susceptible than boys to early poverty. We further test two possible mechanisms of impact: early nutrition poverty and school fees. While lower protein intake at an early stage of life is related to poorer educational outcomes in young adulthood, adjusting for nutritional deprivation does not attenuate the associations of early transient income poverty, Results do not suggest that cohorts that experienced school-fee abolishment policies experienced different poverty effects than other cohorts.

However, alternative approaches pointed to the current-account imbalances within the eurozone, and the flaws in the architecture of the eurozone system. In this study, based on the argument that these flaws and resulting trade imbalances had been responsible for a credit-fueled asset-price speculation among deficit countries, we aim to establish empirically the close association of asset-price growth with credit creation. As imbalances continued, asset prices grew dependent on credit expansion, and once it was disrupted, the collapse came. For our purpose, we examine the impacts of credit expansion on asset prices and use dynamic panel estimations for eleven countries in the eurozone over the period 1990-2011. We find that the credit expansion and asset prices are closely associated in countries with chronic trade deficits whereas no significant correlation is observed for countries with trade surpluses.","[Ozgur, Gokcer] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Ozgur, Gokcer] Hacettepe Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Memis, Emel] Ankara Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Hacettepe University; Ankara University,"Özgür, G (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Memiş, Emel/AAA-2091-2020; Memiş, Emel/AAH-6471-2020","Memiş, Emel/0000-0002-9087-4726; Memiş, Emel/0000-0002-9087-4726",,,,,53,3,3,2,17,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

We also empirically test the relationship between zombie firms and over-capacity, finding that zombie firms cause and worsen over-capacity by crowding out healthy firms.","[Shen, Guangjun; Chen, Binkai] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Shen, GJ; Chen, BK (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hnshgj@126.com; chenbinkai@cufe.edu.cn,,"Shen, Guangjun/0000-0002-2840-7174",Natural Science Foundation of China [71603296]; National Social Science Foundation [14ZDB120]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"We are grateful to Justin Yifu Lin, Changwen Zhao, Zhaoyuan Xv and seminar at School of Economics, Central University of Finance and Economics.

The research question is whether the timely undertaking of fiscal policy measures would have shortened the length of the financial crisis? Based on data from Leaven and Valencia (2012), we employ OLS with robust standard error and ordered logit model in order to examine the countercyclical effect of fiscal policy during the systematic banking crisis. We find out that countercyclical fiscal policy measures have a positive effect in shortening the length of the financial crisis. The results suggest that fiscal expansion can shorten the length of the financial crisis by nine months in those countries. The countercyclical fiscal measures of income tax cuts are more effective than government consumption in shortening the duration of the crisis. In addition, the results show the effect of income tax cuts become weaker or lose their effect after the output recovery, i.e., after the crisis. Thus, it holds that public investments have the strongest positive effects on economic growth in the medium term and decomposition of fiscal policy matters.","[Fetai, Besnik] South East European Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Tetovo, Macedonia",,"Fetai, B (通讯作者)，South East European Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Tetovo, Macedonia.",b.fetai@seeu.edu.mk,,"Fetai, Besnik/0000-0002-6321-0246",,,,,18,6,7,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using a panel data approach, we find that life insurance demand is influenced differently by institutional indicators from the Worldwide Governance Indicators database, in emerging and transition markets compared to developed ones. The sound legal environment of developed countries, where the level of the rule of law is very homogeneous and very high, makes it non-significant for life insurance demand. For developing countries the enforceability of contracts, the independence of justice and the time efficiency of the judicial process positively influence the decision of citizens to buy life insurance contracts. The effect of income distribution over life insurance density varies across these two categories of countries. For transition and emerging markets we find a positive relationship between life insurance density, income distribution and level of urbanisation. In developed countries, because of the high levels of income, life insurance became a common good, not a luxury one, which makes income distribution an insignificant factor. For emerging and transition countries policymakers should concentrate more on strengthening trust in the insurance sector for reducing the gap with developed countries.","[Dragos, Simona Laura; Muresan, Gabriela Mihaela] Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Dragos, Simona Laura; Dragos, Cristian Mihai] Univ Orleans, Fac Droit Economie & Gest, Lab Econ Orleans, Orleans, France; [Mare, Codruta; Dragos, Cristian Mihai] Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Stat Forecasting & Math, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Universite de Orleans; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dragos, SL (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Dept Finance, Cluj Napoca, Romania.;Dragos, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, Fac Droit Economie & Gest, Lab Econ Orleans, Orleans, France.",simona.dragos@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Muresan, Gabriela Mihaela/AAT-9575-2020; Dragos, Simona Laura/B-4689-2016; Dragos, Cristian/IAO-9689-2023; Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/C-6609-2011; MARE, Codruta/AAZ-9390-2020; Mare, Codruta/ADC-6680-2022","Dragos, Simona Laura/0000-0002-3037-3401; Dragota, Ingrid-Mihaela/0000-0002-4864-7503; MARE, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; Mare, Codruta/0000-0002-4920-7462; Dragos, Cristian Mihai/0000-0003-1552-0490; Muresan, Gabriela Mihaela/0000-0001-6715-7406","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0745]; Study of Romanian Life Insurances in International Context: Innovation, Spatial and Behavioural Modelling; Impact of Institutional Factors","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI; Study of Romanian Life Insurances in International Context: Innovation, Spatial and Behavioural Modelling; Impact of Institutional Factors","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0745: Study of Romanian Life Insurances in International Context: Innovation, Spatial and Behavioural Modelling; Impact of Institutional Factors.",,39,18,19,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Both argue that disadvantaged youth suffer worse consequences as a result of risky behavior and therefore stand to gain the most from interventions. While the authors develop strong arguments for adolescent interventions, the existing evidence on their effectiveness is less compelling. To reconcile the promise with the reality, I argue that growing up in environments of significant uncertainty reduces the returns to forward-thinking behavior in the daily lives of disadvantaged youths. Interventions to develop adolescent decision-making skills so as to reduce risky behavior will not be effective if they are inconsistent with the incentives generated by a local environment that is often characterized by uncertainty.","[Aizer, Anna] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Aizer, Anna] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Aizer, A (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Aizer, A (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,65,4,6,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

By employing the non-linear factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model with simulation methods, we could trace the effects of exchange rate appreciation and depreciation on a wide array of macroeconomic variables through the impulse response function (IRF). The main findings are: ( 1) In response to dollar depreciation, import price index (IMP), producer price index (PPI) and CPI increase significantly. The pass-through ratio declines along the distribution chain. (2) Merchandise trade balance, current account balance and output improve facing dollar depreciation. (3) Savings decreases in response to dollar depreciation. (4) Employment and average hourly earnings increase in times of exchange rate depreciation and vice versa.

As central banks increasingly recognize that low public informedness limits their ability to communicate with the general public, several have begun to explicitly tailor their communication strategies for a broader audience. Most research focuses on central bank communication with financial markets, but several recent strands of literature address aspects of communication with households. I survey the literature addressing the rationales and efficacy of central bank communication with households, supplementing this with new evidence from an assortment of consumer survey data. I draw from the literature on rational inattention, financial literacy, and political communication to suggest explanations for limited household receptiveness to central bank communications. Finally, I focus on one specific aim of central bank communication, which is to anchor inflation expectations. Previous literature finds that the announcement of an explicit inflation target helps anchor expectations among financial market participants. Using U.S. consumer survey data, I show that consumers' expectations are imperfectly anchored and that the anchoring of more informed consumers' expectations increased more than the anchoring of less informed consumers' expectations following the Fed's announcement of a 2% inflation target.

By considering that each agent chooses how to allocate a given amount of resources between medical and non-medical consumption, we characterise the scheme of taxes and health treatments that maximises social preferences. These preferences allow the planner to make welfare assessments when it is acceptable to compensate agents who have changed their preferences and/or who are endowed with a bad medical disposition. We show that the optimal tax scheme does not only pay additional treatments for those who are not in a good health state, but also protectively induces agents to reduce their non-medical consumption in order to limit a possible future regret.","[Calo-Blanco, Aitor] Univ A Coruna, Dept Anal Econ & Admon Empresas, Campus A Coruna, La Coruna 15071, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"Calo-Blanco, A (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Anal Econ & Admon Empresas, Campus A Coruna, La Coruna 15071, Spain.",aitorcalo@gmail.com,"Calo-Blanco, Aitor/J-2784-2017","Calo-Blanco, Aitor/0000-0003-3957-4741","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-22919, ECO2014-57413-P]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"I would like to thank Juan D.

We investigate whether and why observers of the game can predict the trustworthiness of hand-written communications. Observers report their perception of the trustworthiness of messages, and make predictions about the senders' behavior. Using observers' decisions, we are able to classify messages as promises or empty talk. Drawing from substantial previous research, we hypothesize that certain factors influence whether a sender is likely to honor a message and/or whether an observer perceives the message as likely to behonored: the mention of money; the use of encompassing words; and message length. We find that observers have more trust in longer messages and promises; promises that mention money are significantly more likely to be broken; and observers trust equally in promises that do and do not mention money. Overall, observers perform slightly better than chance at predicting whether a message will be honored. We attribute this result to observers' ability to distinguish promises from empty talk, and to trust promises more than empty talk.

Individuals are heterogeneous in skills, with an endowment in capital/wealth increasing in skill. Individuals aspire to a socially determined consumption level, with a constant marginal propensity to consume out of income above this level. We also study three variants of the model: one with a higher rate of return for large capitals than for smaller ones, one with a capital levy financing a lump sum transfer, and one with social mobility. We calibrate the model to the US economy and obtain that a steady state exists in all variants, and we obtain convergence to the steady state from the 2012 US wealth distribution. The reduction in the level of the aspirational consumption level is the only way to create wealth for the bottom half of the distribution.","[De Donder, Philippe] Univ Toulouse Capitole, CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France; [Roemer, John E.] Yale Univ, POB 208301, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Yale University,"De Donder, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, CNRS, Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31015 Toulouse 6, France.",philippe.dedonder@tse-fr.eu; john.roemer@yale.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

High local unemployment is found to reduce the probability of re-employment for someone who was employed prior to a period of unemployment. However, individual factors such as age, education and experience are more important predictors of re-employment.

Paradoxically, educated women appear to have benefitted the most, particularly in the lower half of the firm average earnings distribution. By contrast, women who did not complete primary education did not benefit on average, and even lost ground in the upper end of the earnings distribution. Minimum wage increases were thus associated with exacerbated gender pay gaps among the least educated, and reduced gender gaps among the best educated production workers. Unconditional quantile regression analysis attests to wage compression and lighthouse effects.

To correct for potential selection bias caused by women's labor force participation, we employ the Heckman's two-step procedure to estimate the female wage function. A large proportion of the gender wage gap is unexplained by differences of productive characteristics of individuals. Even though women have higher level of education attainments on average, they receive lower wages than men.

This change brought about significant changes in the organisation of services. The private operator RegioJet introduced new rolling stock, a regular and more frequent timetable, peak and off-peak pricing, and additional on-board services. The results were remarkable, with passenger ridership increasing by 156% in 3 years. The article aims to compare the performance of public and private operators on this line in order to identify the reasons for the increased ridership. A customer survey was conducted and passengers were asked questions about their former and present travel behaviour. Based on data from the survey, a logit model was estimated in order to identify the factors behind increased usage and satisfaction. The results indicate that all passengers most highly valued the speed and comfort of the rail services. The new passengers valued highly reliability and quality of the improved service. These factors appealed especially to women, students, and car owners who were newly attracted to rail commuting.","[Jurikovic, Martin; Tomes, Zdenek] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Tomes, Z (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic.",tomes@econ.muni.cz,"Tomes, Zdenek/AAB-5013-2021","Tomes, Zdenek/0000-0002-6759-1293",,,,,36,2,2,2,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5993,1446-9022,,REV NETW ECON,Rev.

After falling by 50 percent since its peak in 1997, the number of public corporations is now smaller than 40 years ago. These corporations are now much larger and over the last twenty years have become much older; they invest differently, as the average firm invests more in R&D than it spends on capital expenditures; and compared to the 1990s, the ratio of investment to assets is lower, especially for large firms. Public firms have record high cash holdings and, in most recent years, the average firm has more cash than long-term debt. Measuring profitability by the ratio of earnings to assets, the average firm is less profitable, but that is driven by smaller firms. Earnings of public firms have become more concentrated-the top 200 firms in profits earn as much as all public firms combined. Firms' total payouts to shareholders as a percent of earnings are at record levels. Possible explanations for the current state of the public corporation include a decrease in the net benefits of being a public company, changes in financial intermediation, technological change, globalization, and consolidation through mergers.","[Kahle, Kathleen M.] Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Finance, Tucson, AZ USA; [Stulz, Rene M.] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, Banking & Monetary Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Stulz, Rene M.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Arizona; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kahle, KM (通讯作者)，Univ Arizona, Eller Coll Management, Finance, Tucson, AZ USA.",kkahle@eller.arizona.edu; stulz@fisher.osu.edu,,,,,,,22,99,117,2,20,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Consumers are interested only in a specific product category, but do not know before inspection which products belong to this category. An intermediary knows each consumer's preferred product category and which products belong to it. It makes personalized product announcements to consumers. Such targeted advertising reduces overall advertising costs and, as a direct effect, maximizes industry profits. However, as we show in this paper, when consumers form reference prices and are loss averse, announcing additional products relaxes competition between firms. As a result, firms may earn higher profits from de-targeting; i.e., when the intermediary deliberately informs about some products and their price quotes from outside a consumer's preferred product category.

Third, two calibration approaches are established to improve the undercoverage issue of the EL method; these two approaches are augmented EL and bootstrap-calibrated EL.

We identify a measure of potential output with that rate of growth consistent with a constant unemployment rate, and we estimate the effects of GDP growth rates on the latter in 13 Latin American and 18 OECD countries during the period 1981-2011. The results of both parametric (OLS/IV and a panel estimator that allows for parameter heterogeneity and cross-section dependence) and nonparametric (a penalized regression spline estimator) econometric techniques show that the measure of potential output experiences positive (negative) changes in periods of high (low) growth in the majority of countries. However, in contrast to the sample of OECD countries, we find that less than half of the sample of Latin American countries experience statistically significant changes in this measure of potential output in periods of low growth.","[Mendieta-Munoz, Ivan] Univ Kent, Canterbury, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Mendieta-Muñoz, I (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Keynes Coll, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",iim3@kent.ac.uk,"Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/AAC-5221-2020","Mendieta-Muñoz, Ivan/0000-0003-0018-5642",,,,,101,4,4,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

But innovation economics itself has been evolving, and a new approach centred on entrepreneurial market discovery has begun to separate from the classical innovation economics based on diagnoses of market failure in R&D investment. We argue that agricultural economics is still largely tied to the classical model, as are therefore its research programs and policy prescriptions. We furnish an overview of this new innovation literature that, among other things, better represents the complex aspects of risk management and niche competition in modern agricultural markets. This leads us to propose some new directions for the research program that emphasises a shift from market failure to collective action models of the innovation problem, and from government-led to industry-level solutions for industrial organisation in agriculture.

Using panel data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) over the period 1989-2009, I find that China is less mobile than most developed countries. Then, I employ five different approaches to investigate the distributional pattern of China's intergenerational mobility across income levels. The results suggest that poor families have relatively high mobility, indicating opportunities for the poor children to escape poverty. Finally, I show that while wealthy fathers are likely to pass on their favorable economic status to their sons, rich sons come from a very wide range of family economic backgrounds.","[Yuan, Weici] Univ Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Yuan, WC (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, 308 Cate Ctr Dr,Room 230 CCD1, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",sullivanyuan@ou.edu,,,,,,,29,7,7,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Among the largest corporations in 2015, some had private security forces that rivaled the best secret services, public relations offices that dwarfed a US presidential campaign headquarters, more lawyers than the US Justice Department, and enough money to capture (through campaign donations, lobbying, and even explicit bribes) a majority of the elected representatives. The only powers these large corporations missed were the power to wage war and the legal power of detaining people, although their political influence was sufficiently large that many would argue that, at least in certain settings, large corporations can exercise those powers by proxy. Yet in economics, the commonly prevailing view of the firm ignores all these elements of politics and power. We must recognize that large firms have considerable power to influence the rules of the game. I call attention to the risk of a Medici vicious circle, in which economic and political power reinforce each other. The possibility and extent of a Medici vicious circle depends upon several nonmarket factors. I discuss how they should be incorporated in a broader Political Theory of the firm.","[Zingales, Luigi] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Entrepreneurship & Finance, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Zingales, L (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Entrepreneurship & Finance, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",Luigi.Zingales@ChicagoBooth.edu,"Zingales, Luigi/AAY-8081-2020","Zingales, Luigi/0000-0002-6804-1883",Stigler Center; George Rinder Research fund at the University of Chicago,Stigler Center; George Rinder Research fund at the University of Chicago,"I thank Mark Gertler, Gordon Hanson, Enrico Moretti, and Timothy Taylor for very useful comments and Steve Haber for educating me on the multiple ways in which Google lobbies.

When the economy has access to international borrowing and lending, a temporary commodity price boom brings about the standard wealth effect that stimulates demand and has long-run implications on the sectoral allocation of labor. If dynamic productivity gains are concentrated in the traded good sector, the commodity boom crowds out the traded sector and delays convergence to the world technology frontier. Financial openness by stimulating current demand, amplifies the crowding out effect and may even lead to a growth trap, in which no resources are allocated to the traded sector.

We systematically explore these effects by exploiting exogenous variation in giant oil and mineral discoveries and permanent democratization. Using a global dataset of 77 countries over the period 1970-2012 we find that resource discovery has very little effect on revenue decentralization but induces expenditure centralization. Oil discovery appears to be the main driver of centralization and not minerals. Resource discovery leads to centralization in locations which have not experienced permanent democratization. Tax and intergovernmental transfers respond most to resource discovery shocks and democratization whereas own source revenue, property tax, educational expenditure, and health expenditure do not seem to be affected. Higher resource rent leads to more centralization and the effect is moderated by democratization. Journal of Comparative Economics 45 (2017) 366-382.

Results in the empirical literature have been mixed. Using local projection techniques, I estimate the impulse responses of real output and real government spending to a shock to military spending. I also estimate the responses of real output and real tax revenues to a shock in taxes. In both cases, I allow for nonlinearity in the effects according to whether the unemployment rate is above or below a given threshold value. I find that raising the threshold unemployment rate incrementally leads to a higher multiplier on government purchases in the bad state of the world, though it is not significantly greater than 1.

Only the connected buyer-seller pairs can engage in trade. We search for trade mechanisms that are efficient, strategy-proof, bilateral trade stable and individually rational. In general, there does not exist a trade mechanism simultaneously satisfying these properties. The tension between strategy-proofness and bilateral trade stability is generated by the intersection between sets of competitors of a buyer at different sellers. Such intersections often allow the buyer to manipulate (via demand reductions) the prices paid in the network. The observed tension can be resolved if and only if the underlying network is cycle-free. In such a case, there is a unique trade mechanism which satisfies our four properties, a generalized Vickrey auction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Intervention erodes the value of an investor's private information by weakening the link between the initial state and the asset payoff. Informed investors are reluctant to make large, informative trades in the bad state, undermining the market's informativeness and the welfare gains generated by the possibility of a corrective intervention. Fundamentally, the authority faces a tradeoff between eliciting information from the asset market and using the information so obtained. The authority can generate a Pareto improvement if she commits to intervene less often when the market suggests that intervention is most beneficial and more often when the market suggests that intervention is unwarranted. She thus may benefit from imperfections in the intervention process or from delegating the decision to intervene to a biased agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, much of the existing formal literature sees dictators' behavior as determined by one type of opposition actor alone and disregards the potential role played by other types of actors. We develop a contest model of political survival with a ruler, the elite and the opposition, and show how the ruler needs to respond to revolutionary pressures while securing the allegiance of his own supportive coalition. We find that the ruler's reliance on vertical and horizontal repression is antithetically affected by the country's wealth and the optimal bundle of vertical and horizontal repression has important consequences for the regime's political vulnerability. Our hypothesis about the impact of wealth on repression is strongly borne out by the empirical results, which are robust to endogeneity concerns. Journal of Comparative Economics 45 (2017) 410-428.

There appear to be good reasons to do so: Sterilization neutralizes the monetary impact of reserve accumulation, which is an endogenous consequence of sustained capital inflows under some degree of management of exchange rates. A pooled sample of Asian economies incorporating Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, for 1994-2012 is employed. We find that this method does help to directly uncover the determinants of sterilization, and while capital inflows do not appear to influence the sterilization directly, there is substantial evidence to suggest it does so indirectlyparticularly through domestic interest rates.","[Cavoli, Tony] Univ South Australia, UniSA Business Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of South Australia,"Cavoli, T (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, UniSA Business Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",tony.cavoli@unisa.edu.au,,"Cavoli, Tony/0000-0002-5821-3469",,,,,23,2,2,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The potential gains from coordination depend on how much importance is given to the output gap in the macroprudential mandate. Coordination conflicts can be avoided by assigning similar importance to this common objective in the respective mandates of both policies.

In particular, this condition is shown to be more general than various approaches that have been proposed to handle the shortcoming of the Lebesgue unit interval as an agent space. We illustrate the minimality of the nowhere equivalence condition by showing its necessity in deriving the determinateness property, the existence of equilibria, and the closed graph property for equilibrium correspondences in general equilibrium theory and game theory.","[He, Wei] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiang] Wuhan Univ, Dept Math Econ & Finance, EMS, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiang] Wuhan Univ, Res Ctr Behav Sci, EMS, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yeneng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Chinese University of Hong Kong; Wuhan University; Wuhan University; National University of Singapore,"He, W (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",he.wei2126@gmail.com; xiangsun.econ@gmail.com; ynsun@nus.edu.sg,"Sun, Yeneng/E-4271-2012; SUN, Ye/KBC-8159-2024; Sun, Xiang/L-8210-2017; Sun, Xiang/HDM-0121-2022; He, Wei/L-1299-2017","Sun, Xiang/0000-0002-7447-0078; Sun, Xiang/0000-0002-7447-0078; He, Wei/0000-0002-6830-6765","NUS [R-122-000-159-112, R-146-000-170-112]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [11401444]",NUS(National University of Singapore); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to Edward Green, Ali Khan, Jiangtao Li, Yifei Sun, Satoru Takahashi, Bin Wu, Nicholas C.

It is against this background that the paper studies the determinants of inflation differentials in the euro area. We start by using the New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) to explain inflation differences for a panel of countries. Exchange rate movements and expected inflation in particular play an important part in bringing about diverging inflation dynamics, while lagged inflation does not. The Incomplete Competition Model (ICM) adds explanatory power to the NKPC in describing inflation dynamics across countries. The latter model does not encompass ICM, and the variables proposed by the ICM are statistically significant: the growth in nominal Unit Labour Cost and the long-run disequilibrium between prices and costs explain inflation differentials.","[Lagoa, Sergio] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIACET IUL, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Lagoa, S (通讯作者)，ISCTE Inst Univ Lisboa, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",sergio.lagoa@iscte.pt,,"Lagoa, Sergio/0000-0003-2790-6518","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Ministerio da Ciencia e Tecnologia, Portugal","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Ministerio da Ciencia e Tecnologia, Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","I thank Stephen G.

We define and prove existence of equilibrium, and provide sufficient conditions for positive assortative matching that build on restricting the slope and curvature of the marriage payoff function to generate single-peaked preferences in age and therefore convex matching sets. Payoff functions that are incompatible with positive sorting by age include all strictly increasing functions and constant flow payoffs enjoyed for some finite period.","[Sautmann, Anja] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Sautmann, A (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Box B, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",anja_sautmann@brown.edu,,"Sautmann, Anja/0000-0003-2453-5926",,,,,38,1,1,0,10,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

In some markets, such as US health exchanges, each plan is responsible for the full expenses of those who buy it ( total pricing). In other markets, such as the privately supplied Medigap top-ups to traditional government-provided Medicare, premium providers are only responsible for the incremental expenses they top up ( incremental pricing). For parameter values calibrated to health exchanges, the shift from total to incremental pricing reduces the welfare loss from adverse selection by an order of magnitude.","[Weyl, E.

Deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets are likely sources of instability for the period mid-1994 to mid-2001. Additionally, inventory behavior may have had a smoothing effect over instability caused by natural gas prices during the recent U.S. shale boom.

The experiment's setup allows us to investigate the issue of effort coordination between signatories and non-signatories to a climate agreement under the threat of a catastrophe. Motivated actors may signal willingness to lead by committing a share of investments to a 'clean' but less remunerative project. The game is parametrized such that the externality cannot be fully internalized by the coalition, so that some effort on the part of the second-movers is required if the catastrophic losses are to be avoided. We manipulate both the relative returns of two investments and the extent to which the gains from leadership diffuse to second-movers. We find that the likelihood of reaching a sizeable coalition of early investors in the clean technology is higher when the benefits are appropriated by the coalition. Conversely, spillovers can entice second-movers' adoption.","[Bosetti, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Bosetti, Valentina] Ctr EuroMediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, Milan, Italy; [Heugues, Melanie] Fdn Eni Enrico Mattei, Milan, Italy; [Tavoni, Alessandro] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AZ, England",Bocconi University; Fondazione Mattei; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Tavoni, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London WC2A 2AZ, England.",a.tavoni@lse.ac.uk,"Tavoni, Alessandro/AAB-3998-2019","Tavoni, Alessandro/0000-0002-2057-5720",IEFE Bocconi; European Research Council [ERC-2013-StG 336703-RISICO]; Marie Curie fellowship INTCOP; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,IEFE Bocconi; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Marie Curie fellowship INTCOP(Marie Curie ActionsEuropean Union (EU)); Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy - United Kingdom's Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was supported by IEFE Bocconi and the European Research Council grant [ERC-2013-StG 336703-RISICO to V.B.].

Several studies corroborate the existence and importance of positional concerns and suggest, without demonstrating it, that negative emotions such as envy to be responsible for guiding positional preferences. A question remains: Are emotions, and particularly negative emotions, responsible for leading agents to exhibit positional preferences? We examine experimentally the impact of emotions on participants' preferences for status. We run three conditions. Under one condition, we elicit participants' preferences for status by asking them to answer a variant of the Solnick and Hemenway's (1998) questionnaire so as to elicit their status preferences without inducing any emotion. Under the two other conditions, we first induce experimentally emotions (either joy or anger) and secondly, we ask participants to fill the same questionnaire. We find that emotions cause a significant change in participants' preferences. We observe that inducing joy shifts significantly participants' preferences. However, we fail at observing a significant impact of anger on participants' preferences. In particular, we find that the negative emotion of anger is not to blame for being positional.

Additionally, I find that states that pay TANF recipients twice a month do not have this effect on threats of violence.

Both have been used in service industries with high fixed costs to price discriminate without setting a reference price. Their participatory and innovative nature gives rise to promotional benefits that do not accrue to posted-price sellers. We explore the nature and effects of these benefits and compare PWYW and NYOP using controlled lab experiments. We show that PWYW is a very aggressive strategy that achieves almost full market penetration. It can be profitable if there are promotional benefits and if marginal costs are low. In contrast, NYOP can be used profitably also if marginal costs are high and if there are no such benefits. It reduces price competition and segments the market. In a second experiment, we generate promotional benefits endogenously. We show that PWYW monopolizes the follow-up market but fails to be profitable. NYOP is less successful in penetrating the market but yields much higher profits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To capture most of the possible interactions, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model that we calibrate on Luxembourg data. Results show that the financial multiplier (ratio of a change in output to a change in the financial sector value added) is above 2 in the medium run and largely above 1 in the long run. The main transmission channels are net exports (expenditure approach) or capital income (income approach) in the medium run and investment in the long run. Moreover, the global demand for financial services has substantial implications for public finances. These findings also mean that a sudden loss of confidence towards a specific international financial center might have dramatic consequences for its whole economy.","[Marchiori, Luca; Pierrard, Olivier] Cent Bank Luxembourg, 2 Blvd Royal, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Marchiori, L (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Luxembourg, 2 Blvd Royal, L-2983 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",Luca.Marchiori@bcl.lu; Olivier.Plerrard@bc1.1u,,"Marchiori, Luca/0000-0003-4256-2311",,,,,75,2,3,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

For the purpose, we analyzed firm size distribution (FSD) and estimated the PL exponents, on the right tails of FSD, of the service and manufacturing industries in Korea for the period 2008-2012 using the Business Activity Survey dataset created by the Korean National Statistical Office As a result, we observed that the estimates of the PL exponents for the service industry are lower than those for the manufacturing industry (alpha(Service) < alpha(Manufacturing)) regardless of size variable, year, and dataset. This relationship may be related to the weaker negative relationship between the size and growth of the service industry, which made the slope of the PL distribution in the right tail of the FSD smoother. This finding implies that size heterogeneity may be more distinctive in the service industry than in the manufacturing industry. In addition, the PL exponents of sales were larger than those of assets and smaller than those of employees (alpha(Asset) < alpha(Sales) < alpha(Employee)) regardless of industry, year, and dataset.

This study empirically investigates the agency problem encountered in a capital injection program implemented in Japan. We hypothesize that the operations requirement to reduce workforce lead banks to overstate the extent of downsizing by reassigning older workers to bank subsidiaries. We implement a difference-in-differences analysis using a panel of Japanese banks from 1990 to 2010. We also employ propensity score matching to control for sample selection bias. The result shows that injected banks exhibit workforce rejuvenation relative to non-injected banks. Among injected banks, the average employee age falls by approximately 1 year, which is equivalent to a reduction of approximately seventy 65-year-old workers. On an unconsolidated basis, the number of employees in injected banks decreases as a response to the injection. However, on a consolidated basis, which accounts for subsidiary employment, the number of employees does not decrease. Our finding suggests that the Japanese practice of lifetime employment (LTE) survived, albeit in a limited form, among restructured banks.","[Osada, Takeshi] Saitama Univ, Fac Econ, Sakura Ku, Shimookubo 255, Saitama 3388570, Japan; [Osada, Takeshi] Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Sakura Ku, Shimookubo 255, Saitama 3388570, Japan; [Onji, Kazuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyamacho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Vera, David] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Econ, 5245 N Backer Ave M-S PB20, Fresno, CA 93740 USA",Saitama University; Saitama University; Osaka University; California State University System; California State University Fresno,"Onji, K (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyamacho, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",takeshiosada@mail.saitama-u.ac.jp; kazuki.onji@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp; dvera@csufresno.edu,"Onji, Kazuki/CAF-5594-2022","Onji, Kazuki/0000-0002-0717-2951",Australia-Japan Research Centre; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26780188]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26780188] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Australia-Japan Research Centre; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Onji would like to acknowledge research support provided by the Australia-Japan Research Centre and Jenny Corbett.

From an RBC model with recursive utility, I show that it is not the degree of relative risk aversion, but the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), that governs the movements of the variables of the model in the log linearized environment. The Bayesian estimation results based on Korean data from the period 1987 to 2013 suggest that there are some elements of success in describing the Korean economy based on the simple RBC model both with the EIS larger than one and with an error term for the real interest rate equation. An EIS larger than one improves the performance of the simple RBC model mainly in the direction of raising the volatility of consumption relative to output. Simulation results show that the error term for the real interest rate process mostly reflects the endogenous channel of financial frictions where the domestic real interest rate depends negatively on the expected (transitory) productivity shock.","[Rhee, Wooheon] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Rhee, W (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Econ, 25 Kyungheedae Ro, Seoul 130701, South Korea.",wrhee@khu.ac.kr,"Rhee, Wooheon/AAI-4368-2020","Rhee, Wooheon/0000-0001-9259-160X",,,,,25,4,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This study uses theory and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of taxpayer service programs that endeavor to resolve uncertainty over tax liability. To do so, we induce uncertainty over tax liability and investigate the effects of both service accuracy and reliability. We find participants are less likely to file when tax liability is uncertain but the provision of information offsets this effect; furthermore, it appears that simply providing a service, even one that imperfectly reveals liability, increases the propensity to file and the accuracy of the filing. When a service that promises to resolve uncertainty completely is requested but not delivered, the result is underreporting even more severe than in a setting where no service is available.

It argues that the existing Structural Funds are relatively small, but remain important for some locations. The evidence of their past effectiveness in reducing spatial inequalities or contributing to increased national growth is mixed. Any replacement for the Structural Funds should be aligned with current spatial interventions such as the 'City Deals' and 'Northern Powerhouse'. The evidence for the existence of agglomeration economies suggests that a growth maximizing policy should focus on the development of cities. On the other hand, political economy considerations suggest that reducing regional disparities may trump efficiency, particularly where many of the regions gaining most from European support were also strong supporters of leaving the EU.","[Bell, David N.

The first is international spillovers in uncertainty, which arise even in large countries like the United States and particularly in smaller countries like Australia. Second, that the main channel for uncertainty to impact gross domestic product growth is through investment, which responds much more strongly and rapidly than consumption expenditure. This is possibly because firms are more forward-looking than consumers, so respond more strongly to changes in future expectations of business conditions. Third, I discuss how recently uncertainty has spiked in three waves: the great recession of 20082009, the fiscal crises in the United States and Europe from 2010 to 2012 and recently after the Brexit and Trump votes.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Bloom, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nbloom@stanford.edu,"Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,7,40,45,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

Spending norms in the electorate shifted to expand the scope of the government budget to promote economic security and macroeconomic stability. Simultaneously, norms for elected office shifted to careerism. Both norms were later codified into formal rules as legislation creating entitlement programs, macroeconomic responsibility, and organizational changes to the fiscal policy process. This institutional evolution increased demand for federal expenditures while creating budgetary commons, thus imparting strong motivations to spend through deficit finance in normal times. Despite the last four decades of legislative attempts to constrain spending relative to taxes, the informal norms have trumped the formal constraints. While the empirical literature on deficits has examined the constraining effects of informal rules, this paper offers a novel treatment of shifting norms as having expansionary effects on deficits.","[Calcagno, Peter T.] Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29401 USA; [Lopez, Edward J.] Western Carolina Univ, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA",College of Charleston; University of North Carolina; Western Carolina University,"Calcagno, PT (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Charleston, SC 29401 USA.",calcagnop@cofc.edu; ejlopez@wcu.edu,,"Calcagno, Peter/0000-0002-8440-0188",Mercatus Center at George Mason University,Mercatus Center at George Mason University,"We thank two anonymous referees and the editors for valuable comments that significantly improved the paper.

We consider two types of organizations, namely relative performance and cooperative regimes, and show that, with sufficient information regarding common shocks, a cooperative organization can be optimal even if outputs are highly correlated. The model is then embedded in a Walrasian general equilibrium model in which choices regarding organizations and investment in information on common shocks are jointly determined. Numerical results reveal that both cooperative and relative performance regimes can coexist in equilibrium but only cooperative organizations invest in full observability of common shocks. Changes in the cost of information and aggregate wealth can affect substantially the types of organizations operating and the matching patterns of heterogeneous agents in these organizations.

The model of the present paper has two stages. First of all, there are two types of continua of agents, the deaf and the non-deaf. In the first stage, the non-deaf agents become either bilinguals or monolinguals. In the second stage, agents are classified into deaf people, bilinguals and monolinguals. They are then randomly matched to form a trio to play a three-person bargaining game with infinite horizon, random proposers and language constraints. Two bargaining games are considered. The first one is a majority bargaining game where only two out of three can agree to implement a bargaining outcome. The second one is a unanimity bargaining game where all three agents are required to reach an agreement. The majority game exhibits strategic complementarity, while the unanimity game exhibits strategic substitutability. This paper also takes an inductive approach to examine how prejudice against people with disability may emerge.","[Matsui, Akihiko] Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Matsui, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.",,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19GS0101, 24223002]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19GS0101] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Financial support from the Scientific Research Program (Creative) (19GS0101) and the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) (24223002) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science is gratefully acknowledged.

For that purpose, two lines of research are taken as a reference point: first, the Bhaduri-Marglin Model, which explains growth in terms of the effect that factor shares have on aggregate demand; and second, recent empirical analyses that also use the functional distribution to explain the evolution of the top income shares and the Gini index. After reviewing the literature on the growth-inequality relationship, the paper identifies several relationships between primary and interpersonal distributions of income in each of the Bhaduri-Marglin Model's growth regimes. It finds multiple causal relationships between growth and inequality as well as inequality and growth, clarifying their implications for economic and social stability. The paper offers final reflections on the way the scheme can further the understanding of current economic and social crises.","[Molero-Simarro, Ricardo] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Econ Aplicada 1, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Molero-Simarro, Ricardo] Univ Loyola Andalucia, Dept Econ, Seville, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad Loyola Andalucia,"Molero-Simarro, R (通讯作者)，Calle Energia Solar 1,Edificio G,2a Planta, Seville 41014, Spain.",rmolero@ucm.es,"Molero-Simarro, Ricardo/A-4716-2015","Molero-Simarro, Ricardo/0000-0002-6157-322X",Universidad Complutense de Madrid,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,"The author wishes to acknowledge that the research leading to this article was funded with a pre-doctoral research fellowship granted by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Recent research conducted in China showed that, contrary to the case in Western countries, ability bias is large in estimating the return to education. It is argued that the low rate of return in China is in part due to the competitive and exam-oriented education system, which is similar to the system in Japan. The empirical results in our study show that the estimated rate of return to education using the sample of identical twins in Japan is 9.3 percent even after omitted ability bias and measurement errors in self-reported schooling were corrected.

We estimate a time-varying Taylor-type rule for the BM, using a Markov-switching (MS) model and a Threshold model. The general finding is that the behaviour of the BM can be characterised by two regimes. In regime 1, only changes in inflation trigger a reaction by the monetary authority. This behaviour is prominent after the establishment of the monetary policy committee in 2007 (CPMO). In regime 2, the BM reacts aggressively both to cool off the economic activity and to curb inflationary pressures. Regime 2 occurred most frequently during 2000-2006, when the fiscal policy might have played an important role in output stabilization. After the establishment of the CPMO, regime 2 occurred in the context of a steep rise in fuel and food prices in 2007-2008 and in 2010. Both the MS model and the Threshold model show similar asymmetric effects. We find evidence that inflation is viewed more seriously by the monetary authorities when it is accompanied by a high output-gap in the previous period, which triggers a more aggressive response from the monetary authorities.","[Nicolau, Joao] ISEG Math, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal; [Nhapulo, Gerson] Bank Mozambique, Res & Stat Dept, Cent Bank Mozambique, Maputo, Mozambique; [Nicolau, Joao] Univ Lisbon, ISEG Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, Lisbon, Portugal; [Nicolau, Joao] CEMAPRE, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa,"Nicolau, J (通讯作者)，ISEG Math, Rua Quelhas 6, P-1200781 Lisbon, Portugal.",nicolau@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Nicolau, Joao/B-5857-2009","Nicolau, Joao/0000-0001-5401-0309",FCT/MEC [CEMAPRE - UID/MULTI/00491/2013],FCT/MEC,Joaao Nicolau was partially supported by the Project CEMAPRE - UID/MULTI/00491/2013 financed by FCT/MEC through national funds.,,54,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Two hypotheses are tested. First, the paper investigates the impact of the two variables on productivity growth when simultaneously considered, assessing whether the basic Kaldorian and Schumpeterian models can be combined. Second, it examines whether research intensity impacts on the magnitude of returns to scale, assessing if countries with higher research intensity benefit from higher returns to scale. The tests reported in the paper provide strong evidence of the importance of demand growth for productivity growth, and on the existence of increasing returns to scale in manufacturing, while also recognizing the relevance of research intensity for productivity growth. Most importantly, the test results suggest that research intensity has a more relevant impact on the magnitude of returns to scale than on productivity growth directly.","[Romero, Joao P.; Britto, Gustavo] Univ Fed Minas Gerais UFMG, Dept Econ FACE, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais,"Romero, JP (通讯作者)，Fac Ciencias Econ, Av Presidente Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Pampulha, Brazil.",jpromero@cedeplar.ufmg.br,"Romero, João/AAE-9771-2022; Romero, João/AFE-9467-2022; Britto, Gustavo/K-2334-2016","Romero, João/0000-0003-1254-0074; Romero, João/0000-0003-1254-0074; Britto, Gustavo/0000-0002-5285-3684",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES-Brazil) [0257-11-7]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG) [CSA-PPM00456-14],Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES-Brazil)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)),"Financial support from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES-Brazil), process number 0257-11-7, and from the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG), project CSA-PPM00456-14, is gratefully acknowledged.",,75,25,26,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Bank and insurer insolvency cases generated numerous adverse economic effects and also promoted academic efforts to design solvency-related taxation methods.

Based on the previous literature, a complex empirical model of the interactions between capital formation, asset growth and solvency risk is presented, and panel data results are compared for banks and insurance companies. A comparison with international empirical results is also possible, although it may only be of limited relevance due to some differences in solvency measurement. The paper also aims to highlight the potential differences between banking and insurance.

This study utilises panel ARDL models to estimate the long-run and short-run relationships between export instability and commodity concentration and geographic concentration. The datasets cover the 2004-2014 period for the trade of all the CEE countries with 10 East Asian marketplaces.

We propose a nonparametric decomposition of the conditional variation of output per capita across countries to capture different channels over which the variation might be increasing. We find that OECD countries have experienced diminishing conditional variation while other regions have experienced increasing conditional variation. Our decomposition suggests that most of these changes in the conditional variance of output are due to unobserved factors not accounted for by the traditional growth determinants. In addition to this we show that these factors played very different roles over time and across regions.,"[Amini, Shahram] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24601 USA; [Battisti, Michele] Dipartimento Studi Polit Diritto & Soc, Palermo, Italy; [Battisti, Michele] CeLeG LUISS, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Parmeter, Christopher F.] Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Miami,"Parmeter, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Dept Econ, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",shahram@vt.edu; mbattisti@unipa.it; cparmeter@bus.miami.edu,,,,,,,61,1,1,0,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

In order to solve the common knowledge problem, this paper proposes to unify game theoretic thought with an analysis of public representations propositions to summarize salient features of the recursive/emergent states of play. From this perspective the paper tries to reconcile differences in three accounts of institutions: endogenous outcome, exogenous rules and constitutive rules accounts. Then, the unified approach is applied to comparative and historical cases of Tokugawa Japan and Qing China. Specifically it sheds new light into the coalitional nature of the Tokugawa Baku-Han regime nesting the fundamental Samurai-village pact as well as the tendency toward decentralization of political violence and fiscal competence to the provincial level toward the end of Qing China. From these new historical interpretations, endogenous strategic forces and associated public propositions leading to institutional changes through the Meiji Restoration and the Xinhai Revolution are identified and compared.

We first analyze the effects of a discovery in a two-sector small open economymodel with a resource sector. We then estimate the effects of giant oil and gas discoveries on a large panel of countries. Our empirical estimates are consistent with the predictions of the model. After an oil or gas discovery, the current account and saving rate decline for the first five years and then rise sharply during the ensuing years.

Many previous studies have accordingly estimated national inflation equations with measures of global output gaps. We use three and a half decades of subnational data from China's provinces to test the global slack hypothesis. Using tests for non-nested regressions, for many provinces we can reject a Phillips curve with a province-level measure of economic slack against a model with China's national output gap, which is consistent with the hypothesis. We also show that the real exchange rate matters for inflation dynamics in many Chinese provinces, in particular those most open to international trade. In addition to supporting the global slack hypothesis, our results emphasise the importance of cross-border factors for China's inflation developments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The present paper shows that this result is sensitive to the presence of the outside good and is, in fact, reversed in its absence: foreign technological advance always improves home welfare in the Melitz model without the outside good. Improvement in home welfare occurs via changes in the numbers and prices of domestic and imported varieties. For quantitative analysis of welfare effects, we calibrate an international trade model for the United States and its major trading partners. US is found to gain less from foreign technological improvements than its trading partners from US improvements. In either case, the magnitude of gains is modest.","[Choudhri, Ehsan U.] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Marasco, Antonio] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan",Carleton University; Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Choudhri, EU (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",ehsan_choudhri@carleton.ca,,"Marasco, Antonio/0000-0002-9593-998X",,,,,19,0,0,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

For this purpose, first we estimate the possible nonlinear data-generating processes of the real interest rate differential series and using these estimates determine which panel unit root test is better for analyzing the RIPH. To this end, smooth transition autoregressive and threshold autoregressive (TAR) models are estimated for two different panels of countries: G7 and post-Soviet transition economies. The results show that the data displays both strong asymmetry and high transition speed. Therefore, secondly, we propose a new panel unit root test where the alternative is stationary with asymmetric TAR adjustment, and provide their empirical power properties. Finally, we demonstrate that our newly proposed test is able to provide conclusive evidence in favor of the RIPH in contrast to the other panel unit root tests considered.","[Corakei, Aysegul] Cankaya Univ, Dept Econ, Eskisehir Yolu 29 Km, TR-06810 Ankara, Turkey; [Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan] Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey; [Omay, Tolga] Turk Hava Kurumu Univ, Dept Management, Bahcekapi Mahallesi Okul Sokak 11, TR-06790 Ankara, Turkey",Cankaya University; Gazi University; Turk Hava Kurumu University,"Emirmahmutoglu, F (通讯作者)，Gazi Univ, Dept Econometr, TR-06500 Ankara, Turkey.",aeruygur@cankaya.edu.tr; furkan@gazi.edu.tr; tomay@thk.edu.tr,"Corakci, Aysegul/ABE-3469-2021; Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan/B-2267-2019","Corakci, Aysegul/0000-0002-0684-4103; Emirmahmutoglu, Furkan/0000-0001-7358-3567",,,,,67,20,20,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2017,44.0,1,,,,,91,120,,10.1007/s10663-015-9312-4,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EJ2NV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393048000004,0

Our estimation strategy-which links the average permanent productivity of workers' peers to their wages-circumvents the reflection problem and accounts for endogenous sorting of workers into peer groups and firms. On average over all occupations, and in the type of high-skilled occupations investigated in studies on knowledge spillover, we find only small peer effects in wages.

A key point for a stable insurer is its capital structure, i.e. the choice between equity, debt and provisions in financing its operations. Based on earlier work a quickly developing literature has directly applied capital structure theories (in particular trade-off and pecking order) from corporate finance to insurers' financing choices. Corporate finance concepts used herein however, are developed for industrial firms. In this paper we provide an overview of the literature on the capital structure of insurers, but contribute by systematically clarifying how to account for the specificities of insurers when transferring the trade-off and pecking-order logic from an industrial to an insurer context. This way, we add several new insights on an insurer's choice between equity, financial debt and provisions. In particular, we are able to explain why, as compared to industrial firms, insurers use less financial debt, and why insurers focus so strongly on self-financing. Finally, we identify multiple avenues for future research.","[Dhaene, Jan; Van Hulle, Cynthia; Wuyts, Gunther] Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accountancy Finance & Insurance, Leuven, Belgium; [Schoubben, Frederiek] Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Financial Management, Leuven, Belgium; [Schoutens, Wim] Univ Leuven, Dept Math, Fac Sci, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Schoubben, F (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Financial Management, Leuven, Belgium.",frederiek.schoubben@kuleuven.be,"Dhaene, Jan/I-9656-2019; Dhaene, Jan/K-6178-2012","Dhaene, Jan/0000-0003-4314-8809; Wuyts, Gunther/0000-0002-8955-4979; Van Hulle, Cynthia/0000-0002-0079-8505; Schoubben, Frederiek/0000-0001-6692-9750",,,,,108,4,7,1,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, typically the service flow that a computer generates over its useful life is roughly constant, which contradicts the geometric model of depreciation. A one hoss shay model of depreciation seems to be more appropriate for computers. The paper uses Australian data on computer investment over the past 25 years to construct one hoss shay estimates of computer capital stocks and flows and considers how best to approximate these more realistic models of depreciation with a geometric model. The paper shows that under certain assumptions, a geometric model can provide an exact approximation to an underlying one hoss shay model. This exactness result is extended to a more general model of depreciation, the Constant Efficiency Profile model. Finally, the paper shows how well the geometric approximation fits a one hoss shay model when the assumptions are not satisfied.","[Diewert, Erwin] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Diewert, Erwin] UNSW Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wei, Hui] Australian Bur Stat, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of British Columbia; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Diewert, E (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sch Econ, Vancouver, BC V6N 1Z1, Canada.",diewert@econ.ubc.ca,,,Australian Research Council [LP0884095]; Australian Research Council [LP0884095] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors thank Chihiro Shimizu for helpful comments and gratefully acknowledge the financial support of an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant (project number LP0884095).

We consider a situation where the players understand more than the analyst: It is transparent to the players-but not to the analyst-that certain hierarchies of beliefs are precluded. In particular, the players' type structure can be viewed as a strict subset of the analyst's type structure. How does this affect a Bayesian equilibrium analysis? One natural conjecture is that this doesn't change the analysis-i.e., every equilibrium of the players' type structure can be associated with an equilibrium of the analyst's type structure. We show that this conjecture is wrong. Bayesian equilibrium may fail an Extension Property. This can occur even in the case where the game is finite and the analyst uses the so-called universal structure (to analyze the game)-and, even, if the associated Bayesian game has an equilibrium. We go on to explore specific situations in which the Extension Property is satisfied.","[Friedenberg, Amanda] Arizona State Univ, Dept Econ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Meier, Martin] Inst Hohere Studien, Vienna, Austria",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Meier, M (通讯作者)，Inst Hohere Studien, Vienna, Austria.",amanda.friedenberg@asu.edu; meier@ihs.ac.at,,,CRES; Olin Business School; W.P.

In recessions, the stock market falls and all types of investment fall, including employers' investment in job creation. The discount rate implicit in the stock market rises, and discounts for other claims on business income also rise. A higher discount implies a lower present value of the benefit of a new hire to an employer. According to the leading view of unemployment- the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model-when the incentive for job creation falls, the labor market slackens and unemployment rises.

Against this background, a better understanding of energy intensity the ratio of energy use to output and its convergence could be important in the design of policies targeting the reduction in the carbon footprint related to energy use. This paper analyzes the determinants of energy intensity and tests for energy intensity convergence across 14 Swedish industrial sectors. This analysis builds on a nonparametric regression analysis of an intensity index constructed at the industry sector level as well as indices constructed from a decomposition of this index. The latter isolates two key determinants of changes in energy intensity and convergence patterns: the efficiency channel-fundamental improvement in the use of energy and activity channel-structural shifts in the economy. The empirical analysis relies on a detailed sectorial dataset covering the period 1990-2008. The findings indicate that input prices, including the price of energy, have been significant determinants of energy intensity in the Swedish industrial sectors. This effect can primarily be attributed to the efficiency channel and with a less profound influence from the activity channel. We also find evidence of energy intensity convergence among the industrial sectors, and this primarily stems from the activity channel rather than from the efficiency channel. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The investment is irreversible but delayable in a regime-switching economy. The firm issues equity, straight bonds (SBs) and contingent convertibles (CoCos). We provide the closed form prices for the firm's securities and the pricing and timing of the option. Our numerical analyses discover that issuing CoCos instead of SBs induces much less agency cost of debt. The agency cost is higher in a boom economy than in recession but the difference is small. There is a unique CoCos' conversion ratio such that the agency cost arrives at the minimum value zero. The inefficiencies arising from asset substitution and debt overhang are much more significant in recession than in boom. Only if the conversion ratio is not too small, the two inefficiencies disappear during boom periods. While the effects of the conversion rate on optimal capital structure and firm value and those of supervision and jump intensity on optimal CoCos' coupon are ambiguous and weak, the stricter the supervision or the longer the economy remains in recession, the less the option value and the optimal SBs' coupon.

I integrate free entry, product variety and monopolistic competition into a New Monetarist framework, considering preferences that give rise to either constant or variable markups. I find that inflation generally reduces variety. Under CES preferences, firms are inefficiently small, with the inefficiency increasing with product differentiation and the extent of search frictions. The Friedman rule is the best policy under CES preferences. In contrast, with variable elasticity of demand, inflation can increase firm size, reduce markups, and raise welfare, even though output is lower. Under CES preferences, the welfare cost of inflation is high; moreover, this cost increases monotonically with the markup and is higher with endogenous variety than with a fixed product space.

This study is an attempt to improve the accuracy of Philips Curve forecasts. It considers various econometric specifications and estimation methods and different measures of the business cycle. In addition to the traditional New Keynesian open economy PC, we analyze some augmented versions with other information which incorporates the monetary variables such as the price gap. Additionally, we propose two different identifications for PC with time varying coefficients: the Time-Varying Coefficients with Random Walk (TVCR) coefficients and the Time Varying Coefficient (TVC).

We control for the unobserved heterogeneity and the fractional nature of adjustment rate by applying an unbiased dynamic panel fractional estimator on an unbalanced panel data of Pakistani nonfinancial firms listed during 1972-2010. We find that these firms adjust at an annual rate of 24-51% to reach their capital structure targets. We argue that in order to optimize the benefits of FL the government should strengthen financial as well as judicial institutions to enforce the creditors' rights that will enable access to more options to Pakistani firms to raise cheaper external financing.,"[Ahsan, Tanveer] Air Univ, Dept Business Adm, Multan, Pakistan; [Qureshi, Muhammad Azeem] Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Oslo Business Sch, Oslo, Norway",Air University Islamabad; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Qureshi, MA (通讯作者)，Oslo & Akershus Univ Coll Appl Sci, Oslo Business Sch, Oslo, Norway.",Muhammad-Azeem.Qureshi@hioa.no,"Ahsan, Tanveer/K-3044-2019","Ahsan, Tanveer/0000-0002-4332-8298; Qureshi, Muhammad Azeem/0000-0001-5107-2192",,,,,53,11,12,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

New analytical techniques and extensions have allowed a more comprehensive assessment of the economy and expanded its applicability. Nonetheless, the core of the framework has remained unchanged: an annually compiled input-output table, which conveys monetary flows between sectors in a region in a particular year. Hence, the technical coefficients derived from it are average' input compositions, neglecting fluctuations in production capacity, seasonality and temporal shocks within that period. This paper develops a consistent methodology to disaggregate the annual input-output table in its time dimension in order to estimate intra-year input-output matrices with distinct technical structures for a particular year. The main advantages in relation to the annual model are to allow seasonal effects to be studied within the input-output framework, to better understand the process of coefficient change and to offer a more comprehensive dynamic view of production.","[Avelino, Andre Fernandes Tomon] Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Avelino, Andre Fernandes Tomon] Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Avelino, AFT (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Reg Econ Applicat Lab, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Avelino, AFT (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Dept Agr & Consumer Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",fernan17@illinois.edu,"Avelino, Andre Fernandes Tomon/ABD-8293-2020","Avelino, Andre Fernandes Tomon/0000-0002-7941-2766",,,,,52,24,24,5,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The empirical results show that the effect of military spending on external debt is positive, while the effects of foreign exchange reserves and of economic growth on external debt are negative.

One of these approaches today could be incentivizing future quantity and quality of the population through a better understanding of the nature of parental labour. The paper presents the results of theoretical and empirical analysis of the labour-like nature of the parenting process. Official Russian statistics and the results of surveys of current and future parents are analysed. Our research showed that even future parents have a clear understanding that parenting is work that requires many different types of expenditures. Rapidly changing parental labour technologies stimulate parents to continually develop new parental competencies - new knowledge and skills as regards medicine, education, culture, sport and so on. Our results show that the process of having, raising, educating and developing children has all characteristics of labour. There is a particular set of competencies that is relevant to human resources for parental labour. We propose shifting the focus of demographic policy to recognise as the labour-like nature of parenting and the need to implement a special kind of human resource management as its core idea, in order to increase the effectiveness of parental labour.","[Bagirova, Anna] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Bagirova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [16-32-00020/17-OGON],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),"The article is processed as one of the outputs of the research project Integration of the parental labor results in Russian pension system, supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, project no. 16-32-00020/17-OGON.

The empirical analysis reveals that the government should cut the deficits only if they exceed a certain level, to ensure their sustainability in the long-run. Specifically, we find that after public debt exceeds a certain threshold level (above 55% of the gross domestic product), it is negatively correlated with economic activity. In addition to the threshold effect, we confirm the presence of a unidirectional causal relation between debt and growth. (C-) 2016 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We find that after controlling for other factors, incentives-related factors and a hedge fund's specific strategy have the greatest impact on the distribution of fund returns.

In this paper, a fuzzy multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology was proposed to determine the best renewable energy alternatives for Turkey, because type-2 fuzzy sets provide additional degrees of independence to represent the uncertainty and the fuzziness of real world applications. The results showed that wind was the best alternative for Turkey's energy investments, as being followed subsequently by solar, biomass, geothermal, hydraulic and hydrogen.

We analyze a model with two parties bargaining over the allocation to a public good each period. Parties place different values on the public good, and these values may change over time. We focus on budgetary institutions that determine the rules governing feasible allocations to mandatory and discretionary spending programs. Mandatory spending is enacted by law and remains in effect until changed, and thus induces an endogenous status quo, whereas discretionary spending is a periodic appropriation that is not allocated if no new agreement is reached. We show that discretionary only and mandatory only institutions typically lead to dynamic inefficiency and that mandatory only institutions can even lead to static inefficiency. By introducing appropriate flexibility in mandatory programs, we obtain static and dynamic efficiency. This flexibility is provided by an endogenous choice of mandatory and discretionary programs, sunset provisions and state-contingent mandatory programs in increasingly complex environments.

States and local governments aim to determine the geographic footprint and anticipate the economic value created by transportation infrastructure proximity and accessibility since it represents an opportunity to capture some infrastructure costs. Hence, it is desirable to understand the degree of correlation between transportation infrastructure proximity and changes in real property values in a spatial context particularly when defining economic development zones where transportation investments are planned and where governments expect to recover some of the infrastructure cost from increases in real property values. This research applies geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis to determine the geographic footprint and quantify the impacts of transportation infrastructure proximity and accessibility on real property values in El Paso, Texas using a 2013 cross-sectional data set. The presence of spatial nonstationarity and heterogeneity confirms that transportation infrastructure proximity and accessibility might generate premiums on real property values, but that such premiums are not always positive and are occasionally negative. GWR shows that benefits from a transportation facility can be capitalized by non-adjacent parcels. Finally, GWR maps can help better policy development by estimating how much value is added by infrastructure proximity and accessibility throughout particular locations.","[Bujanda, Arturo] Texas AM Transportat Inst, El Paso, TX 79902 USA; [Bujanda, Arturo] Mercator Int, Kirkland, WA 98033 USA; [Fullerton, Thomas M.] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso,"Bujanda, A (通讯作者)，Texas AM Transportat Inst, El Paso, TX 79902 USA.;Bujanda, A (通讯作者)，Mercator Int, Kirkland, WA 98033 USA.",arturobujar@gmail.com,"Fullerton, Thomas/AAF-9255-2020; Fullerton, Thomas M./R-4946-2019","Fullerton, Thomas/0000-0002-5820-0713;",,,,,50,8,8,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Each contributor not only has his contribution refunded in the case of insufficient contributions but also receives a refund bonus proportional to his proposed contribution. As long as the refund bonus pool does not exceed the net value of the public good, in equilibrium the public good is always provided and refund bonuses are never distributed. In this paper, we empirically investigate this extension of the provision point mechanism in a laboratory experiment by testing its properties on allocative and distributive efficiency, equilibrium coordination, and invariance to information distribution. Individuals respond to the incentives induced by refund bonuses as predicted, but systematic deviations exist that are consistent with quantal response equilibrium. Since this simple mechanism has considerable practical potential especially in crowdfunding, these promising initial results call for further experimental work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The author of the research, guided by the logical methods of analysis and synthesis of information, aims to study advertising in terms of its ethics in the conditions of fair competition among business representatives. The progressive development of Russian economy leads to an increase in competition among entrepreneurs, and as a result, there is a constant increase in the volume of the advertising market, emergence of new advertising forms and growth of breaches of advertising legislation at the same time. Thus, the role of legal regulation of advertising increases and there is a need to analyze the practice in the application of Russian legislation on advertising, make recommendations for its improvement. Therefore, the main problems connected with the suppression of unfair advertising and suggested ways of solving them both from an economic and from a legal point of view are brought out in this research.","[Cherkasova, Oksana] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Cherkasova, O (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",o.v.cherkasova@urfu.ru,,,"Act 211, Government of the Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0006]; administration of the Institute of Public Management and Entrepreneurship, Ural federal University","Act 211, Government of the Russian Federation; administration of the Institute of Public Management and Entrepreneurship, Ural federal University","The author is grateful to the colleagues for help and assistance in writing the article - professor, master of sciences -Natalya Menshenina, the head of social interactions management department.

Because of the lack of data about service concept formation, reference was also made to the sources of information about product concept creation. Scientific information on the issues of concept formation was analysed (systematised, structured and synthesised basing on sparse works of other authors) after being assessed in terms of logic and integrity, availability and practical appropriateness for service business. Research findings are used to develop a process model. It consists of the following main components: determining the purposefulness of new service development, concepts designing, concepts assessment according to two different sets of criteria, decision making about service system designing (new service technology designing).

The further step in researching this field may include to monitor and evaluate the management of diverse workforce in the national cultures. HR diversity management aims to recruit, motivate and retain human resources regardless of their origin, nationalities and other personal traits. Employers sometimes believe that HR diversity creates preconditions for sustainable competitiveness. Today, HR diversity management becomes one of HR priorities in the labor market. Due to the limited research among line managers, HR managers and employees in the CR about diversity management, the paper focuses on its rhetoric and the reality in the private sector, i.e., how managers and staff perceive diversity management and which HR practices they prefer in favor of the improvement of performance.","[Dvorakova, Zuzana] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Inst Personnel Management, Winston Churchill 4 Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dvorakova, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Inst Personnel Management, Winston Churchill 4 Sq, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",zuzana.dvorakova@vse.cz,,,"Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02, A03.21.0006]",Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation,"The paper was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract No 02.A03.21.0006.",,15,1,1,1,8,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,338,347,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300033,0

To this aim, the Generalized Cross-Entropy estimator is used. Application of this self-contained procedure to the regional SAM for the Italian region Tuscany leads to empirical results consisting of the estimates of the elasticities of substitution of Constant Elasticity of Substitution and Translog production functions consistent with the theoretical background.

Moreover, sectoral employment multipliers and high regional unemployment differentials unequally transfer these effects into labor market. The purpose of this study is to explore the inter-sectoral sensitivities of regional labor markets in Turkey to changes in the final demand. To do this, we decompose the labor demand by sectors and by regions using input-output methodology. Own employment generation effects and regional employment multipliers of each sector are calculated. Overall findings constitute an employment generation map of Turkey. One of the major findings is the strength of the mutual relationship between agriculture and manufacturing sectors. The biggest spillover effect is created by manufacturing upon mostly agriculture, trade and transportation. Agriculture, social services and trade are the most sensitive sectors to changes in the final demand. At regional level; trade, social services and manufacturing are the most influential sectors on Istanbul. Besides, agriculture, social services and construction sectors have the highest employment generation potentials in South Eastern Anatolia.","[Gunduz, Umut; Kaya, Tolga] Istanbul Tech Univ, Management Engn Dept, Fac Management, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Gündüz, U (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Management Engn Dept, Fac Management, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",gunduzu@itu.edu.tr,"Gunduz, Umut R./AAA-1907-2021; Kaya, Tolga/ABD-2887-2020","Gunduz, Umut R./0000-0003-0450-7223; Kaya, Tolga/0000-0003-4841-482X",,,,,45,4,4,0,8,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

I derive properties of increasing differences related to the precision of signals and use these to characterize the set of equilibria selected by the D1 criterion. These equilibria are either separating (i.e., the sender's choice of signal reveals his private information to the receiver) or fully disclosing (i.e., the outcome of the sender's chosen signal fully reveals the payoff-relevant state). Which of these two cases occurs is determined by the optimality properties of fully disclosing signals. If full disclosure is optimal for all sender types, then the equilibrium is fully disclosing. Otherwise, the equilibrium is fully separating, and incentive compatibility requires the sender to use signals that are strictly more informative than the ones that would be used under symmetric information. Therefore, when full disclosure is suboptimal, the sender incurs a cost in comparison to the symmetric information case, whereas the receiver benefits from better information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This narrow conception can build upon previous findings from evolutionary biology. Broader concepts of evolution allow many or just one adaptive entity, instead of necessarily requiring a population. Thus, an institution or a society can also be understood as an evolutionary entity. Both the narrow and broad approaches have been extensively used in the literature, albeit in different literature traditions. I provide an overview of the conception and development of both approaches to evolutionary modeling, and argue that a generalization is needed to realize the full potential of evolutionary modeling.","[Heinrich, Torsten] Univ Oxford, INET, Oxford, England; [Heinrich, Torsten] Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Bremen, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Bremen,"Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, INET, Oxford, England.;Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Bremen, Germany.",,,"Heinrich, Torsten/0000-0001-8873-0806",,,,,34,3,3,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Using a Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR) model on an expanded dataset, including sectoral balance sheet variables, we show that the balance sheets of various economic agents act as important links in the monetary policy transmission mechanism and affect the impulse response of inflation, output, and unemployment. Balance sheets of financial intermediaries, such as commercial banks, asset-backed-security issuers and, to a lesser extent, security brokers and dealers, shrink in response to monetary tightening, while money market fund assets grow. However, their economic significance in the run-up to the recent financial crisis was small. Furthermore, judging from the magnitude of the interest rate elasticity of house price changes, it seems that large increases in interest rates would have been needed to avert a rapid rise of house prices and an unsustainable increase in leverage. This suggests that financial stability concerns may require some role for other policies such as macroprudential policy. (C) 2016 The Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This article presents a data set on interstate transfers of major weapon systems between 1950 and 2010 building upon Stockholm Peach Research Institute's Arms Trade Register with several improvements. First, it disaggregates land weapons and air weapons into categories reflecting their strategic capabilities. Second, model level characteristics (e.g. age, speed, and range) are drawn from Jane's Defence sources. Additionally, the data set covers a larger range of time and states than previous data sets categorizing arms. To demonstrate the usefulness, this article first presents summary statistics of the data set and then replicates an earlier test to show that the effect of human rights and regime types on United States transfers differs across the categories of arms compared to alternative measures of arms transfers.","[Johnson, Richard A.

Recent empirical studies of business conditions have not helped in this regard because most focus on ascertaining entrepreneurs' attitudes rather than observing their behaviour. During ethnographic fieldwork within a Siberian business, the author found that informants were pessimistic about business conditions, but that they did not expect any improvement and had developed pragmatic approaches to securing their position in the local market and competencies required to generate a profit. Their relations with dominant elites were, moreover, cordial rather than antagonistic. To account for these findings, the author draws on Douglass C.

First, we examine the macroeconomic and bank-specific determinants of NPLs for a panel of 27 banks from the Baltics using annual data for the period 2005-2014. The most important macroeconomic factors are GDP growth, inflation and domestic credit to the private sector. As for the bank-specific determinants, we found that the equity to total assets ratio, return on assets, the return on equity and the growth of gross loans were of importance. Second, we investigate the feedback between NPLs and its macroeconomic determinants. The results suggest that the real economy responds to NPLs and that there are strong feedback effects from macroeconomic conditions such as domestic credit to private sector, GDP growth, unemployment and inflation to NPLs.","[Kjosevski, Jordan; Petkovski, Mihail] Sts Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Management, Skopje, North Macedonia",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje,"Kjosevski, J (通讯作者)，Sts Cyril & Methodius Univ Skopje, Fac Econ, Dept Financial Management, Skopje, North Macedonia.",jordan_kos@yahoo.com,"Kjosevski, Jordan/O-2871-2019",,,,,,53,42,45,2,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

In the model, we utilize a two-period trading market and investors make decisions based on the heterogeneous expectations principle and the sparsity-based bounded rational sentiment. We find that bounded rationality results in mispricing and reduces it in next period. Investor sentiment produces more significant effects than private signals, optimistic investor sentiment increases hedging demand, thus causing prices to soar. Higher-order investors are more rational and attentive to the strategies of other participants rather than private signals. This model also derives the dampening effect of higher-order expectations to price volatility and the heterogeneity expectation depicts inconsistent investor behavior in financial markets. In the model, investors' expectations about future price is distorted by their sentiment and bounded rationality, so they obtain a biased mean from the signal extraction.","[Liang, Hanchao; Yang, Chunpeng; Cai, Chuangqun] South China Univ Technol, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Liang, HC (通讯作者)，South China Univ Technol, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lianghanchao@hotmail.com,,,,,,,38,7,7,0,23,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The supply of houses is inelastic in all 43 LGAs; in contrast, apartment supply is elastic - greater than unity - in about one-third of LGAs. We develop theoretical and empirical models to explain the cross-section variation in supply elasticity across LGAs. For houses, supply elasticity is negatively related to an LGA's population density, the time taken by a local council to process a development application and to different measures of the amount of land in an LGA that is unavailable for new housing development.

They abandon the narrow focus on banks as the creators of money as well as the idea that nonbank financial institutions are mere intermediaries between savers and borrowers. Instead, the authors demonstrate that, similar to banks, nonbank financial institutions and foreign banks (through their cross-border activities) create liquidity endogenously by leveraging over the liabilities of entities hierarchically above them. The authors further elucidate Kregel's concept of fictitious liquidity in the context of the hierarchy of financial liabilities, distinguishing it from true liquidity. By bringing shadow banks and the euro-currency markets into to the pyramid of financial liabilities, they develop a more complete framework of liquidity creation in modern capitalist economies. Their extended pyramid is useful for analyzing not only the fragility that may arise from the interactions between firms, households and banks, but also that which may originate through the interactions between banks, shadow banks and foreign banks.","[Nersisyan, Yeva] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA; [Dantas, Flavia] State Univ New York, Cortland, NY USA",Franklin & Marshall College; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Cortland,"Nersisyan, Y (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",,,"Nersisyan, Yeva/0000-0002-2034-843X",,,,,44,11,11,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

With relatively low level of own revenues country, providing further tasks in the process of decentralization to local governments, uses fiscal transfers such as subsidies and grants (mainly related to the performance of tasks assigned and transferred - adequate for the estimated costs). This means that the educational element of general subsidy does not have to be directly correlated with the costs incurred by local governments for the fulfillment of educational tasks. The study juxtaposed the amount of part of the educational subsidies obtained from the state budget in all city counties in Poland in 2007-2015 with selected categories of educational expenses effected in them in the analyzed period. The study used, among others, measures of central tendencies (median, mode, arithmetic mean, quartiles) and measures of dispersion (range). The research has shown that the educational subsidy not only does not guarantee financing of the implementation of educational tasks assigned to the surveyed cities, but even, in most of the units, it does not provide coverage of the cost of employment of teachers. Thus, a question arises whether it is right to apply the existing algorithm as a basis for the allocation of funds for educational activities.","[Olejniczak, Jaroslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Econ Sci Fac, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Olejniczak, J (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Econ Sci Fac, Dept Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",jaroslaw.olejniczak@ue.wroc.pl,"Olejniczak, Jarosław/F-7780-2014","Olejniczak, Jarosław/0000-0003-2028-8446",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,98,106,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000426486500011,0

Spatial Economic Analysis. This paper further develops a new methodology to estimate the wider, indirect impacts of major disasters, and applies it to the 2013 heavy flooding of southern and eastern Germany. We model the attempts of economic actors to continue their usual activities, as closely as possible, by minimizing the information gain between the pre- and post-disaster pattern of economic transactions of the economy at hand. Findings show that government support of local final demand substantially reduces the indirect losses of the floods, while having a disaster at the top of the business cycle increases them. Moreover, we find that assuming fixed trade origin shares and fixed industry market shares, as in all multiregional input-output models, leads to implausibly large estimates of the indirect losses.","[Oosterhaven, Jan] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Toebben, Johannes] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Syst Anal & Technol Eva, Julich, Germany",University of Groningen; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Többen, J (通讯作者)，Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Syst Anal & Technol Eva, Julich, Germany.",j.oosterhaven@rug.nl; johannes.tobben@ntnu.no,"Oosterhaven, Jan/ABA-1136-2021",,,,,,45,31,34,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1742-1772,1742-1780,,SPAT ECON ANAL,Spat.

We estimate the marginal propensity to consume out of a transitory shock and find that the consumption response of HtM households is larger compared to the non-credit-constrained group, posing a threat to macroeconomic stability. Using discrete choice models with fixed effects, we also find that a household that acquire more real estate assets is more likely to become wealthy HtM when its income is relatively lower or its indebtedness is relatively higher.

Monte Carlo experiments are used to generate industry data for market structures such as perfect competition, monopoly, monopsony, bilateral imperfect competition with an integrated processor/retailer, bilateral imperfect competition with separate processor and retailer, and bilateral imperfect competition with four adjacent upstream and downstream markets. Then, new empirical industrial organization models are estimated using the data with models that match the market structure under which the data were generated (true) and with models that reflect alternative market structures (alternative). The general model is derived using the production function approach without imposing the fixed proportion assumption. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the general model is preferred to alternative models that presume competitive behaviour by processors in primary input procurement and by retailers in the output market.

Business income, which served as the inequality enhancing component in 1988, has turned into an inequality reducing force in 1995 and 2002.

Cognitivism, understood as 'symbolic information processing,' provided the first cognitive psychology foundation to bounded rationality. Has bounded rationality since then fully followed the development of cognitive psychology beyond symbolic information processing in the post-Simonian era? To answer this question, this paper focuses on Simon's opposition during the 1990s to a new (paradigmatic) view of cognition called situated cognition, which has since put into question the entire view in cognitive psychology of humans as symbolic information processors. This paper then reads the cognitivism/situated cognition debate through the lens of current bounded rationality research in economics, in order (i) to inquire into whether it has tackled the issues in that controversy; (ii) to envisage possible new foundations for a cognitive psychology-based bounded rationality.","[Petracca, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Petracca, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy.",enrico.petracca2@unibo.it,,,,,,,106,12,13,6,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The implementation of threshold cointegration with asymmetric adjustment enables detecting the changes in the non-linear pollutant-income relationship in the long-run, and in consequence allows to identify the non-linear causal link among CO2 emissions, GDP and energy consumption in a more comprehensive way and formulate more reliable recommendations for energy policy. The main contribution of the paper lies in testing the standard EKC hypothesis and its extended version by adding energy consumption and time trend for the CEE countries in order to test the robustness of the results. We also concentrate on the identification of the short-run and long-run causal relationship between per capita CO2 emissions and per capita income using threshold error correction models (T-ECM) and momentum threshold error correction model (M-TECM). There is significant evidence that the inverted U-shape (EKC) holds between per capita CO2 and GDP per capita for the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania meaning that economic growth decouples from CO2 emissions. This finding can be interpreted in terms of effective environmental policy directed into the reduction of CO2 emissions in these countries. We also find that temporary disequilibrium from the long-run EKC is corrected in an asymmetric fashion for Romania, Slovenia, Estonia in the framework of the standard EKC model, and additionally for the Czech Republic and Bulgaria (besides Slovenia and Estonia) based on the extended specification of EKC model.","[Pilatowska, Mariola] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Torun, Poland; [Wlodarczyk, Aneta] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Czestochowa, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Technical University Czestochowa,"Pilatowska, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Torun, Poland.",,"Włodarczyk, Aneta/AAS-8945-2020","Włodarczyk, Aneta/0000-0002-8726-4556; Pilatowska, Mariola/0000-0002-9284-7190",,,,,82,10,10,0,7,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

PPPs are, however, often characterized by lengthy tendering periods, defined as the difference between contract notice and financial close. Tendering periods are important because they account for a significant proportion of overall project delivery time. Slow tendering deters bidders and thus reduces competition for contracts. We source data on 670 PPP projects in the United Kingdom and use a duration analysis model to empirically examine factors that impact tendering period duration. Our results reveal significant sectoral variation with projects in the health and housing sectors taking significantly longer to reach financial close. We also show that, after controlling for other factors, projects with higher capital values and projects that overlap with the timing of general elections are associated with significantly longer tendering periods. We further examine the impact of the competitive dialogue procurement method and find evidence that tendering periods have increased since 2006; the year competitive dialogue was introduced. We do, however, observe a significant reduction in the time between appointment of preferred bidder and financial close post-2006. This suggests that competitive dialogue is effective in reducing the scope for negotiations by preferred bidders holding quasi-monopoly advantages.","[Reeves, Eoin; Palcic, Donal; Flannery, Darragh] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Econ, Limerick, Ireland; [Geddes, R.

This paper considers how the business cycle affects emissions forecasts and shows the implicit assumption in current forecasts, that the elasticity of emissions is constant with respect to GDP, is wrong. In the United States, emissions fall more sharply when GDP declines than they rise when GDP increases. This is partly due to a decrease in industrial energy intensity as GDP declines. A simulation shows that accounting for the business cycle results in 5% lower cumulative emissions through 2050 relative to the baseline forecast. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper empirically investigates the relative dynamic socio-economic efficiency of thirty OECD countries using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology. As an extension to the basic output-oriented DEA models with variable returns-to-scale, window analysis is employed. The appropriate design of window length is also proposed in the study. In the first step, the relative efficiency of the countries was measured by four economic indicators. In the second step, four new indicators were added, covering social, institutional and environmental dimensions. It has been found that, in some cases, performance rankings change very significantly and that the overall relative performance of the OECD countries increases when the set of economic indicators is extended.","[Skare, Marinko] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Econ, Zagrebacka 30, Pula 52100, Croatia; [Rabar, Danijela] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Zagrebacka 30, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula; University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic Pula, Econ, Zagrebacka 30, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr; drabar@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Rabar, Danijela/0000-0003-4302-7783",Croatian Science Foundation [9481],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 9481 Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.

Russian government used these initiatives to develop and diversify exports, increase employment, attract foreign direct investment (FDI), and launch technology and knowledge sharing processes. The neoclassical approach, political economy approach, heterodox school, and industrial cluster model have been relied on to evaluate the role of the state in the implementation of these initiatives and identify essential factors for sustainable development. This study reveals that government approach in developing SEZs and IPs implied high state interference into the business processes preventing healthy competition and collaboration within the economic zones. Also, lack of funding, political instability and overall business uncertainty were the main prevent factors for the sustainable growth of the economic zones. The paper suggests that for the development of SEZs and IPs in the Russian context, the important factors are personal networks between private investors, regional managers and federal government, as well as appropriate state regulations and general investment climate of the country.","[Sosnovskikh, Sergey] Univ Greenwich, Old Royal Naval Coll, 30 Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England",University of Greenwich,"Sosnovskikh, S (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Old Royal Naval Coll, 30 Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England.",s.p.sosnovskikh@greenwich.ac.uk,"Sosnovskikh, Sergey/V-6727-2017","Sosnovskikh, Sergey/0000-0002-3744-740X",,,,,14,1,1,0,9,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1470,1480,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000455325300147,0

In this paper I provide a theoretical and a quantitative answer to this question by incorporating distortions to the allocation of labor across sectors into a Ricardian trade model. Applying the model to data for a diverse set of countries I find that (1) gains from trade for net exporters in sectors with low marginal product of labor are overstated in models that abstract from intersectoral distortions since in those countries trade tends to exacerbate the effect of domestic frictions; (2) the gains from implementing optimal tariffs are substantial in the presence of domestic frictions because trade policy can offset some of their negative effect; and (3), mitigating domestic frictions has a much larger potential payoff for countries when they are open to international trade.

The frameworks of the spillover effect of FDI, which follow the past studies (Alfaro, 2004) and (Alfaro, 2009), describe the effect of FDI on economic growth of each province. The Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator in the intermediate goods market is used as same as product variety model, which is used in Romer's study (1992). The main purpose of those studies is that showing FDI can have a negative effect on province economic growth because of the gap between domestic technology level and foreign technology level. The co-integrated effect between FDI and productivity perform their positive significant on economic growth. The empirical results are conducted by using Different-General Method of Moments (GMM) (Blundell and Bold, 1998) and Fixed effect GLS (Fixed-EGLS) (Wooldridge, 2010) with Vietnamese provinces panel data. Those two methods, which are recently used by many researchers, are highly recommended in this study. Before policy makers apply researcher's suggestions for their country's economy, understanding FDI spillover and its effect on economic growth are very importance.

The amount of municipal waste generated by residents shows their level of environmental awareness and behaviours they choose. Differentiation of the amount of waste generated per capita in the EU countries is very high, which has a direct impact on the waste management. In the case of municipal waste it is also extremely important to examine how they are developed. The concept is to collect, transport, recover and dispose of waste, and to supervise these activities and places of waste disposal. Depending on the adopted waste management model, there will be other economic consequences and other costs for the environment.

The focus group study was composed of representatives from 32 Czech companies chosen from the database of firms that publicly acknowledge the use of Industrie 4.0. The groups were divided based on the size of the companies. An evaluation using the method of content analysis produced a list of twelve main attributes that can be identified as essential marketing innovations connected with digitalisation. These determined attributes were briefly explained and electronically compared among the representatives of the participating companies, a necessary step given that the composed attributes uncovered latent information learned from the focus group. The responsible company representatives approved the resulting list and they also added a scale of importance. Following a statistical evaluation, a ranking of importance was compiled and subsequently statistically tested. The tests demonstrated that statistically significant differences exist among three attributes; the tests concerned the dependence of responses on the size of the companies. The results from the study showed that the representatives of companies with headquarters in the Czech Republic are aware of the content of Industrie 4.0.

For economies with public goods, we define a simple market-like mechanism in which the strong Nash equilibria yield the Lindahl allocations and prices. The mechanism satisfies critical out-of-equilibrium desiderata that previously-introduced mechanisms fail to satisfy, and always (weakly) yields Pareto improvements, whether in equilibrium or not. The mechanism requires participants to communicate prices and quantities, and turns these into outcomes according to a natural and intuitive outcome function. Our approach first exploits the equivalence, when there are only two participants, between the private good and public-good allocation problems to obtain a two-person public-good mechanism, and then we generalize the public-good mechanism to an arbitrary number of participants. The results and the intuition behind them are illustrated in the familiar Edgeworth Box and Kolm Triangle diagrams. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In response to the increasing use of the concept 'smart', the main aim of this paper is to provide an accurate definition of 'smart' which would be applicable in different areas of modern economy. A standardized definition could be used as an 'umbrella' for the development of other relevant topics. This conceptual paper also introduces the 'smart' framework, which incorporates all the components of the definition: challenges, environment, orchestration and sustainable welfare. The 'smart' framework was built by integrating different concepts and principles, such as technology reference models (TRM), open systems interconnection principles (OSI), etc. It reveals the peculiarities of 'smart' performance and application under the conditions and challenges of modern economy.","[Vasauskaite, Jovita; Teufel, Stephanie; Teufel, Bernd] Univ Fribourg, Int Inst Management Technol, Blvd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Vasauskaite, J (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Int Inst Management Technol, Blvd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",jovita.vasauskaite@unifr.ch; stephanie.teufel@unifr.ch; bernd.teufel@unifr.ch,"Teufel, Bernd/S-5835-2019","Teufel, Bernd/0000-0003-3468-1759; Teufel, Stephanie/0000-0003-0427-3148","Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland, through the smartlivinglab project at the University of Fribourg","Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland, through the smartlivinglab project at the University of Fribourg","This work was funded by the Canton of Fribourg, Switzerland, through the smartlivinglab project at the University of Fribourg.

This paper quantifies the distributional effects in the context of demographic transition using an integrated recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model with top-down behavioral microsimulation. The results of the poverty and inequality index indicate that population aging has a negative impact on the reduction of poverty while its impact is positive with regard to equality. In addition, elderly rural households are experiencing the most serious poverty, and their inequality problems compared with other household groups and within-group inequality worsen with demographic transition. These findings not only advance the previous literature but also deserve particular attention from Chinese policy-makers.","[Wang, Xinxin] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kevin Z.] IFPRI Beijing Off, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Robinson, Sherman] IFPRI, Washington, DC USA; [Huang, Zuhui] Zhejiang Univ, Chinese Acad Rural Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Zhejiang University,"Chen, KZ (通讯作者)，IFPRI Beijing Off, Beijing, Peoples R China.",k.chen@cgiar.org,"Covey, Kevin/AAE-3599-2020; Chen, Kevin/GYU-8963-2022","Covey, Kevin/0000-0001-6914-7797;","Zhejiang University Major Project of Humanities and Social Science Research projects [2013QN046]; Natural Science Foundation of China [70673035, 71403236]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [LY17G030023]; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets","Zhejiang University Major Project of Humanities and Social Science Research projects; Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets","We would like to acknowledge support from Zhejiang University Major Project of Humanities and Social Science Research projects [grant number 2013QN046]; Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 70673035, 71403236]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang [grant number LY17G030023]; the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions and Markets led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).",,59,7,7,5,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Proponents of these policies believe that race-based preferences are needed to create a diverse student body that facilitates effective learning and social inclusion. Opponents of such policies contend that racial preferences are inherently discriminatory and eliminating them would yield a more able student body. Whereas race-based preferences have garnered the most attention, elite colleges regularly employ other types of preferences, including those for alumni and talented athletes. To inform this important policy debate, we develop a simple model comprised of a rational college administrator that maximizes a linear combination of student body ability and the college endowment through the choice of race, legacy and merit admission shares. We find that relaxing the racial-preferences constraint can produce a less-able' student body even when the college administrator places greater weight on student body ability than she does on the college endowment. The change in admissions policy may serve only to increase the number of admissions that can be sold' to wealthy alumni through legacy preferences and thereby foster the growth of weeds in the Ivy.","[Weisman, Dennis L.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Li, Dong] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Sci, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",Kansas State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Weisman, DL (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",weisman@ksu.edu,,,,,,,21,2,3,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Evidence from manufacturing listed companies in China,APPLIED ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Cost stickiness; cost behaviour; earnings management; manufacturing listed company; M41; D21,STICKINESS; BEHAVIOR,"Recent studies on cost behaviour have proved that cost increase caused by business expansion is larger than cost decrease caused by business downsizing. This cost stickiness behaviour contradicts the traditional theoretic assumption that cost level and business size change in a linear way. This article investigates the existence or non-existence of cost stickiness using a sample of China's manufacturing listed companies during the period 2010-2014. First, our findings show that cost stickiness is a pervasive phenomenon and overestimated in the manufacturing industry. Second, we find that cost stickiness varies greatly across industries and in different regions. Finally, we find that cost stickiness is affected by the economic growth. Specifically, cost stickiness increases with the macroeconomic growth. Our results from China's manufacturing listed companies provide evidence on asymmetric cost behaviour and contain important implications for both cost accounting research and financial accounting research.","[Xu, Jian] Dankook Univ, Dept Accounting, Yongin, South Korea; [Sim, Jae Woo] Ansan Univ, Dept Tax Accounting, Ansan, South Korea",Dankook University; Ansan College,"Sim, JW (通讯作者)，Ansan Univ, Dept Tax Accounting, Ansan, South Korea.",simsn@ansan.ac.kr,"Xu, Jian/G-4382-2014","Xu, Jian/0000-0002-0350-5202",,,,,32,16,16,3,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The conclusions are as follows. (1) There exists a long-term cointegration relationship and bidirectional causality relationship between coal prices at home and abroad, and the influences of foreign coal markets on the domestic coal markets are stronger than the influences of domestic coal markets on foreign coal markets, and thus the interaction between the two markets leads to asymmetric linkage effects. (2) Compared with the VEC model, the MS-VEC model can reflect the nonlinear feature of price co-movement effects. (3) There exists an inherent adjustment mechanism between domestic and foreign coal markets, i.e. the coal prices will be self-revised continuously until a long-term equilibrium state is achieved when a deviation from the equilibrium state occurs. (4) There exists a co-movement effect which varies with the change of regime among the three coal prices, and the self-maintenance is strong and the status transfer phenomenon is clear in different regimes.","[Xue, Ye; Huang, Yiting] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Taiyuan, Peoples R China",Taiyuan University of Technology,"Huang, YT (通讯作者)，Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Econ & Management, Taiyuan, Peoples R China.",huangyiting125@126.com,"huang, yiting/HDM-3648-2022",,Program for the Top Young Academic Leaders of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (TYAL); Program for the Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (PSSR) [2014314],Program for the Top Young Academic Leaders of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (TYAL); Program for the Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (PSSR),This research is financially supported by Program for the Top Young Academic Leaders of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (TYAL) and by Program for the Philosophy and Social Sciences Research of Higher Learning Institutions of Shanxi (PSSR) [No. 2014314].,,22,1,2,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.
