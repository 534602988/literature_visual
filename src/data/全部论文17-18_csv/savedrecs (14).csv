Our experimental results suggest: In a simple bargaining game with an exogenous mediation proposal, the likelihood of conflict is independent of the balance of power. If bargaining involves endogenous demand choices, however, the likelihood of conflict is higher if power is more imbalanced. Even though endogenous bargaining outcomes reflect the players' unequal fighting strengths, strategic uncertainty causes outcomes to be most efficient when power is balanced. In turn, the importance of exogenous mediation proposals depends on the balance of power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Does parental involvement in matchmaking help ensure their needs are better taken care of by married children? This paper finds supportive evidence using a survey of Chinese couples. In particular, parental involvement in matchmaking is associated with having a more submissive wife, a greater number of children, a higher likelihood of having any male children, and a stronger belief of the husband in providing old age support to his parents. These benefits, however, are achieved at the cost of less marital harmony within the couple and lower market income of the wife. The results render support to and extend the findings of (Becker et al., 2015) where parents meddle with children's preferences to ensure their commitment to providing parental goods such as old age support.

It is shown that the expected return on nonrenewable resource stocks incorporates both short-run and long-run risk factors. The short-run risk factor is associated with shocks to current surplus consumption growth. The long-run risk factor reflects the investor's desire to hedge against long-run shocks to future surplus consumption prospects (long-run habit risk premium). The model is tested using energy commodities index and US aggregate real per capita consumption data, and the results confirm that habit enters significantly in the pricing equation by entertaining a long-run time-varying risk coefficient. Compared to results obtained with a no-habit formation model (time-separable preferences), we found that long-run future prospects of surplus consumption constitute a forward-looking risk factor to be taken into account in explaining the dynamics of energy prices under uncertainty.

The global bidder wants to win both licenses to enjoy synergies; therefore, she bids more than her stand-alone valuation of a license. This exposes her to the risk of losing money even when she wins all licenses. We determine the optimal bidding strategies in the presence of an exposure problem. By using simulation methods, first, we show that the probability of inefficient allocations in the simultaneous ascending auction can be up to 9 percent. Second, we show that the global bidder can end up with a loss with 6 percent probability depending on the distribution. We also investigate the relation between inefficient allocation and the revenue of SAA and VCG auctions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To fill this gap and to compare collusive tax evasion with independent tax evasion, this paper develops a simple noncooperative game-theoretic model and confirms the model's predictions in a laboratory experiment. Because collusive tax evasion involves social interaction, this paper focuses on the effect of social norms and theoretically and empirically demonstrates that the tax compliance norm has a stronger negative effect on the magnitude of collusive tax evasion than on independent tax evasion. The reason for this result is that in a collusive tax evasion game with multiple equilibria social norms affect the range of equilibria and act as an equilibrium selection device, whereas social norms need to be strongly internalized to change the behavior of taxpayers who evade taxes unobservedly.","[Abraham, Martin; Lorek, Kerstin; Richter, Friedemann; Wrede, Matthias] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Sch Business & Econ, POB 3931, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Wrede, M (通讯作者)，Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg FAU, Sch Business & Econ, POB 3931, D-90020 Nurnberg, Germany.",matthias.wrede@fau.de,,"Wrede, Matthias/0000-0001-8376-517X",FAUs Emerging Fields Initiative (University of Erlangen-Nurnberg),FAUs Emerging Fields Initiative (University of Erlangen-Nurnberg),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the FAUs Emerging Fields Initiative (University of Erlangen-Nurnberg).

Even so, I believe that the role of economists in these public policy discussions has often been misguided because it has typically relied upon best practices, stated in the form of  general guidelines or even universal principles. However, best practices are not best if the specific situation does not conform with the assumptions that underlie the advice. So my first conclusion is a cautionary, and negative, one: Specific circumstances differ so profoundly across individuals, firms, markets, countries, and time that most any attempt to define  best practices that apply in all circumstances will lead to profoundly misleading public policy recommendations. However, even if economics cannot identify the truth, it can often identify a truth. So my second conclusion is a more positive one: Economists should continue to develop multiple theories that inform public policies, but we should also focus our efforts on identifying and testing the critical assumptions that drive the results of these theories, recognizing that the validity of any assumptions will depend intimately on specific circumstances. I illustrate these two main conclusions with specific examples from my own work. I conclude with some  best practices recommendations of my own, recognizing the obvious irony of such an effort.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 6823 St Charles Ave,208 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Tulane University,"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 6823 St Charles Ave,208 Tilton Hall, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu,,,,,,,69,5,5,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The solution is to transform public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure as well as the classic model of multilateral development banks. Instead of thinking of PPPs as bilateral contracts between a private concession operator and a government agency, we argue that they should be conceived as partnerships that also involve a development bank and long-term institutional investors as partners. We propose a new model for development banks, which is to transform them into originate-and-distribute banks for PPP infrastructure projects.

We find that more able and higher income parents invest more, particularly at younger ages when investments have the greatest impacts.

The experiment took place in several European countries in the 3 weeks before the 2014 elections for the European Parliament. This paper focuses on the Italian data. Firstly, we show that the behaviour of Italian respondents is consistent with the empirical findings at the European level. Then, we exploit the change from open list to closed list elections implemented in Italy in 1993 to investigate whether and how preferences over institutions are affected by experience. We find that respondents who voted using the open list system in Italy are more likely to prefer closed list systems, and that the effect is stronger the higher the number of open list elections the respondents have faced.","[Bettarelli, Luca] Coll Europe, Dept European Econ Studies, Dijver 11, B-8000 Brugge, Belgium; [Iannantuoni, Giovanna; Manzoni, Elena] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Piazza Ateneo Nuovo 1, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Rossi, Francesca] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Verona,"Rossi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane 24, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",francesca.rossi_02@univr.it,"Rossi, Francesca/AAZ-1857-2020","Manzoni, Elena/0000-0003-0223-8760",,,,,19,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

It is shown that statistical methods are good at the basics (distinguishing some type of peg from some type of float), but less helpful in other respects, such as determining whether a float is managed, particularly for countries that are not very remote from their main trading partners.

We control for question difficulty using a second section of the same course taught by the same instructor. We also build a simple model to explain the findings. We find hedging propensities increase with the question number, suggesting that fatigue plays a role in students' decisions.

This paper explores the rationales for national innovation policies, as laid out in the existing literature on the subject, and considers what the lessons and challenges for theory and practice in this area are. Innovation policy attempts to influence innovation activity, often with the purpose of increasing economic growth. But it can also have more specific aims such as preventing unwarranted climate change, improving national health, and so on. The increasing attention given to innovation policy at the national level from the 1990s onwards went hand in hand with the development of a new, systemic understanding of innovation, which in a better way than before accounted for the stylised facts' of innovation activity as identified by empirical work. The system approach, as the paper shows, came to have a significant influence on the subsequent policy discourse. Drawing on recent advances in innovation-systems theory, a synthetic framework for the analysis of innovation policy is developed and used to highlight issues of particular relevance for the conduct of innovation policy and future scholarly work in this area.","[Fagerberg, Jan] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; [Fagerberg, Jan] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Fagerberg, Jan] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Aalborg University; University of Oslo; Lund University,"Fagerberg, J (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark.;Fagerberg, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.;Fagerberg, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden.",jan.fagerberg@tik.uio.no,,,"OBEL foundation; FORFI, Norges Forskningsrad [201017/D00]","OBEL foundation; FORFI, Norges Forskningsrad","Earlier versions have been presented at the symposium 'Innovation policy - can it make a difference?', Aalborg, Denmark, 13-14 March 2014; the 2014 EU-SPRI conference 'Science and innovation policy: Dynamics, Challenges, Responsibility and Practice', Manchester, UK, 18-20 June, 2014; and the 'Atlanta conference on science and innovation policy', Atlanta, 16-19 September, 2015.

In the context of developing countries, fears about foreign investment leaving the country are often used as an argument not to address industry emissions through emission taxes. This paper develops a Cournot model with product differentiation in the presence of abatement efforts where host and foreign firms are subject to an emission tax. The analysis indicates that abatement efforts and differences in pollution intensity coefficients across firms may play a significant role in the characterization of optimal policy. The analysis also suggests that the government may opt to encourage foreign, less pollution-intensive firms via higher taxation. Additionally, this paper examines how an optimal emission tax may be adjusted as products become more differentiated; industry emissions may fall/rise as a result of more differentiated products. One important contribution of this paper is that it emphasizes the role of abatement efforts, product differentiation, and differences in pollution intensity coefficients across firms in the characterization of the optimal emission tax.","[Gautier, Luis] Univ Texas Tyler, Dept Social Sci, 3900 Univ Blvd, Tyler, TX 75799 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at Tyler,"Gautier, L (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Tyler, Dept Social Sci, 3900 Univ Blvd, Tyler, TX 75799 USA.",lgautier@uttyler.edu,,"Gautier, Luis/0000-0002-9373-2512",,,,,43,8,8,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

We used the SVAR method to measure the magnitude and timing of each province's response to monetary policy shocks when considering the influences of spillover effects among provinces. Then we also explored the regional effects of monetary policy employing multiple linear regressions. The results confirm that provinces respond differently to monetary policy actions. It was found that in the short run, the influence of spillover effects on a province's response is very important, but in the long run, the negative influence of deposit transfers overtake the positive impact of the spillover effect. For the factors causing the regional effects on monetary policy, the results show that the interest rate channel is rather weak at the regional level in China. The bank lending channel can explain the regional effects of monetary policy to some extent. Thus in China, the bank lending channel is more effective than the interest rate channel at the regional level.","[Guo, Xiaohui] Hebei Univ, Baoding, Peoples R China; [Masron, Tajul Ariffin] Univ Sains Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia",Hebei University; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Guo, XH (通讯作者)，Hebei Univ, Sch Econ, Wusi Donglu 180, Baoding City 071002, Hebei Province, Peoples R China.",nlmh6@126.com,"MASRON, TAJUL ARIFFIN/B-9724-2011","MASRON, TAJUL ARIFFIN/0000-0002-8564-2402",Social Science Research Program of High Learning Institution in Hebei Province [SQ15094]; Major Social Science Research Program of Educational Department of Hebei Province [ZD201511]; Project of Enhancing the Comprehensive Strength of Universities in the Middle and Western China; Research on the Use of Financial Resources in Beijing Economic Cycle and the Development of Hebei (Hebei University),Social Science Research Program of High Learning Institution in Hebei Province; Major Social Science Research Program of Educational Department of Hebei Province; Project of Enhancing the Comprehensive Strength of Universities in the Middle and Western China; Research on the Use of Financial Resources in Beijing Economic Cycle and the Development of Hebei (Hebei University),"The author declares that this paper has been supported by the 2015 Social Science Research Program of High Learning Institution in Hebei Province (Program Name: The Effects of Monetary Policy on the Coordinated Development of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei in China.

We first present empirical evidence in support of non-Ricardian fiscal policy, and then discuss the fiscal theory of the price level in a world with financial frictions. After illustrating how the financial friction influences the price level, we provide a theoretical explanation to our empirical findings.

This paper considers the likely consequences of Brexit for this sector. A 'soft' Brexit, whereby the UK leaves the EU but remains in the single market, would be a lower-risk option for the City than other Brexit options, because it would enable financial services firms to continue to rely on regulatory passporting rights. Under a 'hard' Brexit scenario, where the UK leaves the single market, the UK might in principle be able to benefit from the EU's third country 'equivalence' frameworks for financial services, but these are cumbrous and incomplete alternatives to passporting. UK firms would find it considerably more costly to export to the EU. This would also be a loss to the EU27, because the UK specializes in capital markets services for which the EU, over-reliant on banking, recognizes a need. However, much of this 'UK' activity is provided by subsidiaries of US-headquartered groups. In the event of hard Brexit, these firms may be able to compete just as effectively from New York as from London. If soft Brexit proves politically impossible, it seems highly desirable that the UK push for a transition period of continued EU membership pending at the very least completion of equivalence determinations and, more usefully, the conclusion of a suitable bilateral agreement.","[Armour, John] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Armour, John] European Corp Governance Inst, Brussels, Belgium",University of Oxford; European Corporate Governance Institute,"Armour, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.;Armour, J (通讯作者)，European Corp Governance Inst, Brussels, Belgium.",john.armour@law.ox.ac.uk,"Armour, John/AAG-2758-2019; Greene, Lilli/JRW-8947-2023","Armour, John/0000-0001-6903-926X;",,,,,41,34,35,3,75,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Third, we discuss some implications of recent advances in machine learning methods for causal effects, including methods to adjust for differences between treated and control units in high-dimensional settings, and methods for identifying and estimating heterogenous treatment effects.","[Athey, Susan; Imbens, Guido W.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Imbens, Guido W.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Athey, Susan; Imbens, Guido W.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Athey, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Athey, S (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",athey@stanford.edu; imbens@stanford.edu,"imbens, guido/P-2333-2019","Athey, Susan/0000-0001-6934-562X",,,,,141,522,625,22,289,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

These functions are restricted to be linear for two-sided testing problems, but may be nonlinear for one-sided testing problems. In the most common case, this function selects a subvector of the parameter, such as a single component. The new inference method we propose controls asymptotic size uniformly over a large class of data distributions and improves upon the two existing methods that deliver uniform size control for this type of problem: projection-based and subsampling inference. Relative to projection-based procedures, our method presents three advantages: (i) it weakly dominates in terms of finite sample power, (ii) it strictly dominates in terms of asymptotic power, and (iii) it is typically less computationally demanding. Relative to subsampling, our method presents two advantages: (i) it strictly dominates in terms of asymptotic power (for reasonable choices of subsample size), and (ii) it appears to be less sensitive to the choice of its tuning parameter than subsampling is to the choice of subsample size.","[Bugni, Federico A.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Canay, Ivan A.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Shi, Xiaoxia] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Duke University; Northwestern University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Bugni, FA (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",federico.bugni@duke.edu; iacanay@northwestern.edu; xshi@ssc.wisc.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1123771, SES-1123586]",National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the editor and two anonymous referees whose valuable suggestions helped greatly to improve the paper.

Additional increases in drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality particularly among those with a high school degree or less are responsible for an overall increase in all-cause mortality among whites. We find marked differences in mortality by race and education, with mortality among white non Hispanics (males and females) rising for those without a college degree, and falling for those with a college degree. In contrast, mortality rates among blacks and Hispanics have continued to fall, irrespective of educational attainment. Mortality rates in comparably rich countries have continued their premillennial fall at the rates that used to characterize the United States. Contemporaneous levels of resources particularly slowly growing, stagnant, and even declining incomes cannot provide a comprehensive explanation for poor mortality outcomes. We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next-in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education. This account, which fits much of the data, has the profoundly negative implication that policies even ones that successfully improve earnings and jobs, or redistribute income-will take many years to reverse the increase in mortality and morbidity, and that those in midlife now are likely to do worse in old age than the current elderly. This is in contrast to accounts in which resources affect health contemporaneously, so that those in midlife now can expect to do better in old age as they receive Social Security and Medicare. None of this, however, implies that there are no policy levers to be pulled. For instance, reducing the overprescription of opioids should be an obvious target for policymakers.","[Case, Anne; Deaton, Angus] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University,"Case, A (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",,,,National Institute on Aging through the National Bureau of Economic Research,National Institute on Aging through the National Bureau of Economic Research(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"We are grateful to our editor, Janice Eberly, and to our discussants, David Cutler and Adriana Lleras-Muney, as well as to Jonathan Skinner and participants in the Spring 2017 Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, and to the National Institute on Aging for funding through the National Bureau of Economic Research.

We prove that in these models and under some regularity conditions the Wold innovations are a martingale difference sequence (mds) if and only if the structural shocks are fundamental. This simple but powerful characterization suggests an empirical strategy to assess invertibility. We propose a test based on a generalized spectral density to check for the mds property of the Wold innovations. This approach does not require the specification and estimation of the economic agent's information flows or the identification and estimation of the structural parameters and the noninvertible roots. Moreover, the proposed test statistic uses all lags in the sample and it has a convenient asymptotic N(0, 1) distribution under the null hypothesis of invertibility, and hence, it is straightforward to implement. In case of rejection, the test can be further used to check if a given set of additional variables provides sufficient informational content to restore invertibility. A Monte Carlo study is conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of our test. Finally, the proposed test is applied to two widely cited works on the effects of fiscal shocks by Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and Ramey (2011).","[Chen, Bin] Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Choi, Jinho] AMRO, Memphis, TN USA; [Choi, Jinho] Bank Korea, Seoul, South Korea; [Escanciano, Juan Carlos] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of Rochester; Bank of Korea; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Chen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",binchen@rochester.edu; choi.jinho@amro-asia.org; jescanci@indiana.edu,"; Escanciano, Juan Carlos/R-1878-2018","Chen, Bin/0000-0001-7201-2359; CHOI, JINHO/0000-0002-1875-3954; Escanciano, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-6559-416X",Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I [ECO2014-55858-P],Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I(Spanish Government),"We thank the editor and three anonymous referees for constructive comments.

Together with markets, queues and waiting lists are universal procedures for allocating goods and services. We designed our queuing game to disentangle motivations of outcome-oriented egoistic preferences, outcome-oriented distributional (inequality aversion) preferences and outcome-independent procedural preferences. In a series of treatments, we introduce a market element and allow two of the three players to bargain over a queue jump, thus violating the queuing procedure. A third player is able to engage in peer punishment to sanction queue jumping. We provide evidence that a simple model of procedural preferences is able to explain the behavior of a share of the subjects in our experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

More importantly, we find that both good and bad news have significantly more impact on volatility if structural breaks are accounted for in a model. Thus, previous studies have significantly underestimated the impact of news on volatility as they have inadvertently ignored these structural breaks in volatility. Our empirical results suggest that it is best to include both asymmetric effects and structural breaks in a GARCH model to accurately estimate oil price volatility dynamics. Our results have important practical implications not only for option valuation and hedging decisions but also have major consequences for broader financial markets, the energy industry, and the overall economy.

As SSA exports remain dependent on these large markets, SSA countries could undergo important economic impacts. Using a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium Model, we find that mega-deals would have a negative impact on the welfare of SSA countries. Regional integration (through the negotiation of the 'Tripartite' FTA, which gathers, 26 African countries) might limit these losses, but SSA countries that are not involved still undergo negative consequences. A continental regional trade agreement involving all SSA countries would counterbalance the negative impacts of the mega-deals.

During the Doiinki farm festival, rural areas become a showcase for the state and a stage for lauding market socialism in agriculture.

The seller can then recommend the appropriate or an inappropriate quality. Since the buyer has no means to verify the correctness of the recommendation but has to rely on the honesty of the seller, such goods are called credence goods. Markets for credence goods are typically plagued by incentives for fraudulent behavior and by inefficiencies caused by actual or expected fraud, covering overprovision and overcharging. Although highly policy relevant, a carefully controlled analysis of the provision of credence goods through the use of experiments has only recently taken off. Here, we provide an overview about recent laboratory and field experiments on the economics of credence goods and discuss important implications and directions for future research.","[Kerschbamer, Rudolf; Sutter, Matthias] Univ Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria; [Sutter, Matthias] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Sutter, Matthias] CESifo Munich, Munich, Germany; [Sutter, Matthias] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Innsbruck; University of Cologne; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Kerschbamer, R (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.",,"Sutter, Matthias/R-2018-2018","Sutter, Matthias/0000-0002-6143-8706; Kerschbamer, Rudolf/0000-0002-7666-7157","Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P20796, P26901, SFB 63]; Australian Research Council (ARC) [DP110103653]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P20796, P26901] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"This paper is based on Sutter's keynote at the CESifo area conference on employment and social protection, 16 May 2015, in Munich.

However, while superior group performance in economic experiments has primarily been shown for face-to-face decision making, this has ceased to be the prevalent form of communication in many IT-based organizations. We conduct a social learning experiment to compare group rationality under conditions of virtual and face-to-face communication. Group matching is conducted based on cognitive abilities to determine its impact on group rationality. Despite the more challenging transmission of information, we find that virtual communication does not reduce overall group rationality. There is no evidence that group performance is driven by a cognitively superior group member, which hints at the relevance of the process of group discussions. Our results have methodological implications for the further study of group performance in experimental economics, as well as practical consequences for the choice of communication structures and team composition within decentralized organizations.

This division has brought many changes in portfolios of pension funds in Slovakia. Currently, six pension funds management companies manage six bonds, six equity, five indexed and three mixed funds. Purpose of the article: The aim of this article is to monitor the composition of assets during 2009 and 2014 and describe relation between equity and mixed pension funds' profit and components of assets they own. The results of this research contribute to a better understanding of the importance of certain types of financial assets owned by equity and mixed funds and their impact on pension funds' profit. Last, but not least, this article helps to improve the legislative management of pension funds and their impact on macroeconomic situation in Slovakia, because pension funds are still concentrating higher and higher amount of financial assets from government bonds to companies' stocks. Methods: This relation will be described by linear mixed- effects model with random effects of years and pension funds management companies. Random effects also help to identify the impact of changes during the period studied, and in case that profit is significantly different across the pension funds management companies Findings & Value added: The underlying model data will be chosen from annual balance sheets, income statements and notes of Slovakia- based equity and mixed funds during the period studied.","[Papik, Mario] Comenius Univ, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Papík, M (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10,POB 95, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",mario.papik@gmail.com,"Papík, Mário/AGO-3306-2022; Papík, Mário/E-8585-2016","Papík, Mário/0000-0003-2563-7799",,,,,15,2,2,1,11,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

The empirical part is based on a collection of more than 800 estimates of ICT payoff effects from more than 70 studies written in the last 20 years. The meta-analysis reveals a strong presence of publication bias within the ICT productivity literature and, using a mixed effect multilevel model, estimates the ICT elasticity to be only 0.3%, which is more than ten times smaller than what was reported by a previous meta-analysis from 10 years ago.

Each player receives a private signal and chooses whether and when to invest. Bunching occurs when a subgroup of the players make decisions contingent on their signals, while the rest of the players wait regardless of their signals. We focus on asymmetric pure strategy equilibria, where players' private information is revealed gradually through bunching. When players become patient enough, the most efficient equilibrium contains no herding of investing, while the least efficient equilibrium resembles the outcomes in an exogenous timing model. When players' discount factors differ, less patient players will bunch earlier than more patient players. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we establish that foot voting can internalize the cost of negative externalities. Workers have to accept the wage and rent, however high or low these values are in equilibrium, if they cannot relocate. In reality, workers are mobile and they can effectively influence the equilibrium wage and rent to reflect the externalities by threatening to walk away if the current externalities are at an intolerable level. In an economy with free mobility, firms indirectly pay for the damage in the form of an increased labor or land cost and thus the externalities are partially internalized. We specify the condition under which a mobile economy is efficient in the presence of externalities, and discuss potential policy implications of our findings.","[Watanabe, Hiroki] Lamar Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA",Texas State University System; Lamar University,"Watanabe, H (通讯作者)，Lamar Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Beaumont, TX 77710 USA.",watanabe.wustl@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

However, Sun et al.'s estimator is inconsistent when heteroskedasticity is present - a circumstance that is more realistic in certain applications. In this study, we propose a kind of semi-parametric generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator that is not only heteroskedasticity robust but also takes a closed form written explicitly in terms of observed data. We derive the asymptotic distributions of our estimators.

We exploit rich data that provide variation in the location of inventors within multinational firms across industries and countries to control for confounding firm-time and industry factors. We find that a 10% increase in the use of foreign inventors leads to a 1.9% increase in the use of domestic inventors.

The paper offers a description of the main features of the models and of the variables that influence service quality, and estimates their effect using a balanced panel data for 9 European Countries. We observe that when companies increase their remuneration by 1%, the duration of interruptions falls by approximately 1%. Regarding the regulatory models, price-cap, revenue-cap and cost plus are seen as the most efficient models for increasing the quality of service (given other resources such as revenues and incentives).

The timing of deceleration and decline in the rates of marital dissolution interestingly coincides with a period of substantial growth in wage inequality. This paper establishes a novel connection between the two phenomena and discusses potential explanations for the underlying link. Using female marital histories in a duration analysis framework combined with regional and temporal variation in the pattern of male wage dispersion, I show that inequality has a significant stabilizing effect on the marriage. Quantitatively, increases in male wage dispersion can roughly explain up to 30% of the fall in the mean separation probability between 1979 and 1990. Several plausible explanations are discussed: changes in spousal labour supplies, female wage inequality, income uncertainty, social capital as well as a hypothesis where inequality renders the option to divorce less attractive by making remarriage more difficult.","[Bellou, Andriana] Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Bellou, Andriana] IZA, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Bellou, A (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Econ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.;Bellou, A (通讯作者)，IZA, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",andriana.bellou@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,36,3,3,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Using data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) 2013 Economically Active Population Survey (EAPS), we find that temporary workers lost their job more than others during this period. However, salaried workers have higher average levels of satisfaction in 2007-2010, possibly due to the lower requirements of workers. We find a positive relationship between the unlikeliness of keeping a job and low job satisfaction levels in data from the Survey of Quality of Life at Work (2010) through a correspondence analysis. A linear model with a level of job satisfaction as a dependent variable shows negative coefficients for a level of job satisfaction if the probability of keeping the job is somewhat unlikely or very unlikely. Finally, an ordinal probit regression finds that the estimated likelihood to reach high job satisfaction is lower in temporary workers.","[Carmen Sanchez-Sellero, Maria] Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ 2, Fac Econ & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain; [Sanchez-Sellero, Pedro] Univ Zaragoza, Sch Engn, Dept Business Adm, Zaragoza, Spain; [Montserrat Cruz-Gonzalez, Maria; Javier Sanchez-Sellero, Francisco] Univ Vigo, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Business Adm, Vigo, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; University of Zaragoza; Universidade de Vigo,"Sánchez-Sellero, MC (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Dept Appl Econ 2, Fac Econ & Business Adm, La Coruna, Spain.",c.sanchez@udc.es; pedross@unizar.es; mcruz@uvigo.es; javiss@uvigo.es,"cruz-gonzalez, maria-montserrat/ABE-6241-2021; Sánchez-Sellero, Pedro/H-4257-2015","cruz-gonzalez, maria-montserrat/0000-0001-5803-2863; Sánchez-Sellero, Pedro/0000-0002-6475-0578; Sanchez Sellero/0000-0003-3730-8415",MINECO-FEDER [ECO2012-36290-C03-01]; DGA-FSE [S125],MINECO-FEDER; DGA-FSE,The authors acknowledge the funding received from MINECO-FEDER (Project ECO2012-36290-C03-01) and DGA-FSE (Project S125: Compete Research Group).,,49,15,17,1,19,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The estimation technique takes advantage of the panel nature of the Survey of Professional Forecasters' dataset to exploit both its time series and cross-section dimensions, and to control for unobservable individual heterogeneity across forecasters. The estimation results suggest that euro-area inflation forecasts have reacted less to unemployment forecasts after the start of the financial crisis but another cost measure (energy inflation) remains significant. This finding is consistent with a flatter Phillips Curve in the euro area after 2007. However, the reasons suggested by the International Monetary Fund for this finding, namely a better anchoring of inflation expectations and increases in structural unemployment do not seem to find support in the survey data. Instead, the expectations for compensation per employee submitted by professional forecasters are consistent with the existence of downward real-wage rigidities in euro-area labour markets.","[Lopez-Perez, Victor] Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencias Empresa, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"López-Pérez, V (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena, Dept Econ, Fac Ciencias Empresa, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Spain.",victor.lopez@upct.es,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2017,44.0,1,,,,,147,174,,10.1007/s10663-016-9314-x,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EJ2NV,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393048000006,0

This is the design hypothesis. The alternative is that change occurred in many features of society over a long period and that the 1688-1701 reforms were just one element in a deep ongoing evolutionary process. The paper presents evidence of two distinct types. First, legal history shows that the high-level institutional measures of 1688-1701 can be characterized primarily as either durable and endorsing the status quo or path-breaking and ephemeral. This is evolutionary trial and error. Second, patterns in structural breaks in myriad data sets reveal that widespread socioeconomic change was under way before 1688 and continued thereafter. Because England's early development provides a popular paradigmatic example for economists, the paper's verdict on the nature of English history is pertinent to debates on transition and development, on the importance of critical junctures, and on the relative roles of culture and institutions.

Moreover, the analysis allows some conclusions regarding the effects of introducing a pension systems and/or a more explicit role of public investment in capital accumulation.","[Rosenbaum, Eckehard] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ispra, Italy; [Ciuffo, Biagio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, Ispra, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Ciuffo, B (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, Ispra, Italy.",eckehard.rosenbaum@ec.europa.eu; biagio.ciuffo@jrc.ec.europa.eu,,"Ciuffo, Biagio/0000-0003-3734-4264",,,,,44,0,0,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,FEB,2017,68.0,1,,,,,147,184,,10.1111/meca.12130,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EI4SU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000392484400006,0

Evidence from Austria,EMPIRICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,Human capital; Employment growth; Convergence; Smart city hypothesis,SMART CITIES; PRODUCTIVITY; CONVERGENCE; GROWTH,"Studies conducted for the US have found a positive effect of human capital endowments on employment growth, with human capital endowments diverging at the same time. In contrast, studies for European countries have found convergence of human capital endowments. This paper tests these relationships for the 99 Austrian districts for the observation period 1971-2011 by estimating how the presence of high-skilled employment affects total, low-skilled and high-skilled employment growth. To this end, OLS, fixed-effects and first-difference regressions are estimated. The results indicate continuous convergence of high-skilled employment which, however, slowed down significantly since the 1990s. In contrast to previous studies, evidence for positive effects of high-skilled on total and low-skilled employment is only weak and varies over time. Furthermore, the results show that total and high-skilled employment in suburban areas grew faster than in other regions, while districts which bordered the Eastern Bloc were disadvantaged. Nevertheless, spatial neighbourhood effects within Austria are only weak.","[Sardadvar, Sascha; Reiner, Christian] WU Vienna, Inst Econ Geog & GISci, Welthandelspl 1-D4, A-1020 Vienna, Austria; [Reiner, Christian] Inst Adv Studies, Stumpergasse 56, A-1060 Vienna, Austria",,"Sardadvar, S (通讯作者)，WU Vienna, Inst Econ Geog & GISci, Welthandelspl 1-D4, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",sascha.sardadvar@wu.ac.at; christian.reiner@ihs.ac.at,,"Sardadvar, Sascha/0000-0001-6402-4405",City of Vienna WU Jubilee Fund,City of Vienna WU Jubilee Fund,"This work was supported by the City of Vienna WU Jubilee Fund as part of the research project Wien als Migrationsziel von Humanressourcen''.

Deep discounts are welcomed, high Standing Offers are not. But price discrimination is unremarkable in economics. Indeed, in industries where fixed & sunk costs represent a significant portion of total cost, discriminatory pricing is usually welfare enhancing. Conversely, theory predicts and empirical evidence confirms that regulatory efforts to cherry-pick differential prices in asymmetric markets will damage consumer welfare. In this article, we analyse differential retail electricity offer prices in the Australian States of Victoria and Queensland and contrast these with industry average total cost and the marginal cost of retail supply. We find deregulated Victoria displays high price dispersion with Standing Offer tariffs 10% above industry average total cost and marginal offers at break-even prices (i.e. 20% below average total cost). In the semi-regulated Southeast Queensland market where a regulated price-cap exists, there is lower dispersion but marginal offers include a 6.7% retail mark-up. Efficient pricing requires the marginal unit produced to be priced at marginal cost and Victoria meets this criteria- but we identify an episode of inter-consumer misallocation due to high Standing Offers. We conclude policy initiatives designed to help firms shift vulnerable households from Standing Offer tariffs is desirable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The entry barriers generate local rents that have unexpected but significant implications. First, the home market effect is magnified. Second, when countries are sufficiently unequal in size and rents are sufficiently large, symmetric reductions in trade costs reduce welfare in the small country. Third, entry barriers increase the large country's market size and, surprisingly, can increase its welfare. Fourth, a unilateral increase in trade protection shifts foreign rents to the home country. This rent-shifting effect amplifies the standard production relocation motive for trade policy intervention.","[Tobal, Martin] Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, 5 Mayo 18, Mexico City 06059, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,"Tobal, M (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, 5 Mayo 18, Mexico City 06059, DF, Mexico.",martin.tobal@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,62,0,0,2,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

This study investigates the impact of aid volatility, especially on savings and investment, with a particular focus on the role of institutional quality in 45 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries over the period from 1990 to 2013. We used the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique combined with a measure of volatility, namely an averaged data method involving six 4-year sub-periods. Our results suggest that while aid is positively associated with savings and investment, its volatility is harmful to savings and investment. However, when higher quality institutions exist, the volatility of aid has a less negative impact on savings and investment. The policy implications are diverse; first, donors and SSA aid-dependent countries need to take into account the diversity of shocks to which aid can respond in mitigating its unpredictability. Secondly, SSA countries should be encouraged to establish the conditions for better quality institutions to mitigate the negative effects of the volatility of aid on macroeconomic aggregates such as savings and investment.","[Afawubo, Komivi] Univ Franche Comte France, Univ Lorraine France, CRESE, CEREFIGE, Nancy, France; [Mathey, Samuel] Sacre Coeur III Pyrotech, BEM Business Sch, BP25 208, Dakar Fann Senegal, Senegal",Universite de Franche-Comte; Universite de Lorraine,"Mathey, S (通讯作者)，Sacre Coeur III Pyrotech, BEM Business Sch, BP25 208, Dakar Fann Senegal, Senegal.",samuel.mathey@fafedeafrique.org,,,,,,,93,5,5,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The survey was conducted on a sample of 40 managers in the form of structured interviews using the Focus Groups method and supported by questionnaires. The condition for inclusion in the survey was completing one of the following personal development programs: Managerial skills development, Coaching method, Silva method and Neuro-linguistic programming. Equilibrium, mental agility, independence and antifragility were chosen as the evaluation criteria for the analysis of the selected personal development models. These criteria reflect the requirements for the level of competences of present-day professional managers from the perspective of Cognitive management. It turns out that the least developed of the observed personal development models are personal traits related to the development of managers ' antifragility. In the context of this finding, we view the Connatural Management approach to be one of the possible answers to the need of developing managerial education towards the development and cultivation of people ' s natural potentials.

A pilot study of four English universities was undertaken via a process of document review and semi structured interviews. A modified form of Grounded Theory was employed to analyse the outcomes of the document reviews and the interviews. The results indicate that international strategies in the four English universities have gone through three phases, as their approaches to this phenomenon have matured and progressed from operational to strategic. The findings have led to the development of a model which conceptualises the main stages of the internationalisation of English (and, by implication, UK) universities.

However, research of in-work poverty in the post-communist EU members is still rather scarce. This paper contributes to filling that gap. Using EU-SEC microdata, supplemented by various country-level statistics, this paper has two aims. Firstly, it maps the development of in-work poverty in the post-communist EU and compares it to western countries. Secondly, it identifies factors that may influence the probability of becoming a member of the working poor. Using multilevel regression techniques it reveals that individual factors play a considerably larger role in influencing the In-work Poverty (IWP) than institutions. Additionally, the findings show that there were three institutional barriers which prevented workers from becoming poor before the crisis: parental leave, unemployment benefits and union density.

Moreover, thanks to increasing returns in manufacturing, export expansion and international competitiveness would interact so as to create vicious or virtuous circles of cumulative causation. A few years later Kaldor, having found a positive correlation between the time changes of the main industrial countries' relative manufacturing export shares and that of their relative unit costs-a correlation that became known as the 'Kaldor paradox'-dismissed his original cumulative causation theory and adopted a version close to Harrod's 'foreign trade multiplier'. The purpose of this paper is to reaffirm the Kaldorian cumulative causation theory in its original version, by providing a firmer analytical basis and showing that, contrary to the 'Kaldor paradox', time changes in export performance must be 'explained' by levels rather than by changes in unit costs.","[Boggio, Luciano; Barbieri, Laura] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Barbieri, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",,,,"PRIN 'Heterogeneous Sectors, Growth and Technical Change'","PRIN 'Heterogeneous Sectors, Growth and Technical Change'","Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore.

Reflecting on the inherent flaws of traditional mainstream economics, this paper puts forward a macrofinance proposition as a new paradigm for macro financial analysis. As a scientific methodology based on systematic logic, the major feature of the macrofinance framework is that we must analyze the financial system as a core part of a complete and endogenous analytical framework, instead of only focusing on the money or credit. The goal of macrofinance is to return to scientific economic methodologies by analyzing the inherent laws of modern financial systems to set up a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies the financial sector with the real economy and combines theory and policy practice.","[Chen, Yulu] Peoples Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jack W.] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jack W.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Econ, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Ma, Yong; Zhang, Chengsi] Renmin Univ China, Financial Res Ctr, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China",People's Bank of China; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Renmin University of China,"Hou, JW (通讯作者)，Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Hou, JW (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Econ, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [12ZD089]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71150003]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [15XNI001],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71150003), National Social Science Foundation of China (12&ZD089), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. 15XNI001).",,35,2,2,2,6,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2017,64.0,5,,,,,547,570,,10.2298/PAN151201036C,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS7TI,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000422611300002,0

The price dynamic is, therefore, reminiscent of fire-sales and hot-potato trading. Traders who intermediate the object arise endogenously and make a positive profit. The profit-earning intermediaries are not necessarily traders with many connections; for the case of multilayer networks, they belong to the path that reaches the maximum number of potential buyers using the minimal number of intermediaries.

Evidence from domestically focused firms in emerging economies,ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Innovation; competition; industrial organisation; local rivalry,PRODUCTIVITY; GROWTH; POLICY; MODEL; SIZE,"This paper explores the relationship between the level of competition and innovation output for domestically focused businesses in emerging economies in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It uses survey data from 5054 businesses from the fifth Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey. A multivariate probit estimation of the likelihood of different innovation types finds that higher levels of competition are associated with greater likelihood of innovation, but this rises at a decreasing rate as competitor numbers grow. Also, firms operating in economies where competition policy is more effectively enforced are more likely to innovate. However, there is a point where 'too much' competition leads to less innovation - suggesting a tipping point effect. This suggests that policies to maximise competition, as measured by number of competitors, may not be optimal for promoting innovation in emerging economies. This requires a need for more nuanced competition policy approaches. The paper also finds that businesses relying on local markets are significantly less likely to introduce innovations than businesses trading domestically outside their local area, but increased competition in local markets increases the likelihood of businesses introducing product innovation. This points to a local rivalry effect.","[Crowley, Frank; Jordan, Declan] Univ Coll Cork, Aras Laoi, Sch Econ, Coll Rd, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork,"Jordan, D (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Aras Laoi, Sch Econ, Coll Rd, Cork, Ireland.",d.jordan@ucc.ie,"Crowley, frank/ABC-3203-2021","Crowley, frank/0000-0003-3626-203X; Jordan, Declan/0000-0002-2446-0111",,,,,50,21,22,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Flow results are then generated using the fundamental traffic equation relating speed, flow and density. A ranking of the impacts on highway traffic of the different incident types based on incident frequency as well as impact size demonstrates that for the real case studied, the incidents with the greatest cumulative effect are (in order of magnitude) vehicle breakdown, collisions and rain.","[de Grange, Louis; Gonzalez, Felipe] Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Ingn Civil Ind, Santiago, Chile; [Troncoso, Rodrigo] Univ Desarrollo, Fac Gobierno, Santiago, Chile; [Odeh, Nicolas] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ingn Transporte & Logist, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales; Universidad del Desarrollo; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"de Grange, L (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Escuela Ingn Civil Ind, Santiago, Chile.",louis.degrange@udp.cl,"Troncoso, Rodrigo/AAW-5842-2021","Troncoso, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9449-5678; Gonzalez, Felipe/0000-0002-2174-0900",Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS) [Conicyt/Fondap/15110020],Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS),"This work was supported by the Centro de Desarrollo Urbano Sustentable (CEDEUS), [Conicyt/Fondap/15110020].",,51,0,0,2,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that optimal outcomes in terms of reduction and formalisation of informal jobs across the three countries examined are achieved with the combination of lower payroll taxes for permanent contracts and higher inspection rate for firms operating in the informal sector. Coupling lower firing costs with more frequent labour inspections also reduces informality, but this comes at the cost of an increased ratio of temporary to total employment.","[Di Porto, Edoardo] Univ Naples Federico II, CSEF, Naples, Italy; [Di Porto, Edoardo] UCFS Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Elia, Leandro] European Commiss, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Tealdi, Cristina] Sch Adv Studies, IMT, Lucca, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Elia, L (通讯作者)，European Commiss, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",leandro.elia@jrc.ec.europa.eu,,"Elia, Leandro/0000-0001-7687-284X; Tealdi, Cristina/0000-0002-2696-6845",Marie Curie Career Integration Grant (CIG) [322305],Marie Curie Career Integration Grant (CIG)(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by the Marie Curie Career Integration Grant (CIG) [322305] to Cristina Tealdi.,,43,8,8,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The size of oil resources is unknown, new bearings are constantly being discovered and their exhaustion is constantly a threat, a so-called peak oil - a moment, when extraction reaches its peak and begins to fall. A solution to this question largely depends on whether the oil is renewable and non-renewable resource. Two hypotheses of how the oil was formed - biological and chemical. The oldest hypothesis is chemical (Mendeleev). In the 20th century the biological hypothesis was preferred and oil was considered a fossil fuel. But the latest discoveries in space speak in favour of the chemical hypothesis, in that case oil would be unlimitedly available renewable source.

The motivation is the process of convergence experimented by Spanish regions based on the strong economic growth experienced by the country until 2008, which could results in different emissions responsibilities because of different lifestyles and production structures. We examine in depth the relationships between a representative household in each region and its patterns of consumption. Although we do find a relationship between per capita income and regional responsibility for pollution generation, it is based on a demand scale effect, which overlaps the effects of the regional consumption patterns. Thus, in the richest regions (Madrid, Northeast, East), despite their having a less polluting pattern than other regions, the level of per capita embodied emissions is higher, due to their higher level of consumption. This scale effect, and the linkages between regional responsibilities for emissions and household consumption patterns are analyzed using linear models based on Social Accounting Matrices. The basis of the estimations is the regional emission intensity (average emission per euro spent by each type of regional home).","[Duarte, Rosa; Sanchez Choliz, Julio] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Zaragoza, Spain; [Duarte, Rosa; Sanchez Choliz, Julio] Univ Zaragoza, Agrifood Inst Aragon IA2, Zaragoza, Spain; [Mainar-Causape, Alfredo J.] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Sustainable Resources D, Econ Agr Unit, Seville, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Mainar-Causapé, AJ (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Sustainable Resources D, Econ Agr Unit, Seville, Spain.;Mainar-Causapé, AJ (通讯作者)，Joint Res Ctr Seville, Edificio Expo,C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",Alfredo.MAINAR-CAUSAPE@ec.europa.eu,"Duarte, Rosa/F-4239-2016; Mainar Causapé, Alfredo José/F-1205-2016","Mainar Causapé, Alfredo José/0000-0003-2032-9658",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2013-41353-P]; Government of Aragon; FEDER (Consolidated Group) [S10],Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); FEDER (Consolidated Group),The authors wish to thank the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (ECO2013-41353-P) and the Government of Aragon and FEDER (Consolidated Group S10 in 2015) for their financial support.,,33,9,10,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The tax policies may affect the decision of foreign and domestic entrepreneurs to establish their own business activity, because taxes are part of the costs, which entrepreneurs have to pay regularly. In a tax-competitive world, business founders, may easily register their companies in tax paradises, offering them zero or low corporate tax rates. Policy makers may adjust the tax policies by lowering taxes, with expectations of the increase in new business registrations. The objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between the corporate income tax rate and the new business formation in the Czech regions, during the period of years 2000-2015.

We build on these studies by (a) examining the decision to stop exporting among African manufacturers and (b) investigating whether these decisions can be linked to institutional dimensions (such as corruption). Consistent with previous studies, we observe that a significant fraction of African firms stop exporting every year. Using product complexity as a measure of an industry's sensitivity' to corruption, we find that firms in more corruption-sensitive' industries are more likely to stop exporting if there is an increase in overall corruption in the exporting country. Firm characteristics (such as size and productivity) also seem to influence the decision to stop exporting. Our finding about the relationship between corruption and the decision to stop exporting supports the conventional wisdom that corruption is detrimental to economic performance.","[Faruq, Hasan A.] Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, 3800 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA",University System of Ohio; Xavier University,"Faruq, HA (通讯作者)，Xavier Univ, Dept Econ, 3800 Victory Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45207 USA.",faruqh@xavier.edu,,,Xavier University,Xavier University,"I would like to thank an anonymous referee and the editor for their valuable comments.

These trades are made on second basis that implies possibility of price changes in a very short time frame, so financial markets produce loads of data. Consequently, there is higher probability to face an outlier and standard methods are not able to process them correctly. ARMA processes are well known and widely used in the financial sector. One of the important steps is to estimate an order of the process and outliers often cause bias in the order estimation. In time series theory there exist several outlier models such as additive outliers (AO), replacement outliers (RO) or innovations outliers (IO). We show importance of robust methods for ARMA order estimating via simulation study. Several robust methods are compared with standard methods.

Thus, frictions (barriers to mobility) in one or both of these markets can impede the net transfer of capital between countries, produce the Feldstein and Horioka (1980) finding of high-saving-investment correlations and prevent real interest rates from being equalized across countries. Moreover, frictions in global goods markets can explain why real exchange rates deviate from purchasing power parity (PPP) for extended periods of time and can therefore also explain the PPP puzzle.

I analyse how the provision of labour market relevant information by former coworkers affects the employment probabilities and, if hired, the wages of male workers who have previously become unemployed as the result of an establishment closure. To identify the causal effect of an individual worker's network on labour market outcomes, I exploit exogenous variation in the strength of these networks that is due to the occurrence of mass layoffs in the establishments of former coworkers. The empirical analysis is based on administrative data that comprise the universe of workers employed in Germany between 1980 and 2001. The results suggest a strong positive effect of a higher employment rate in a worker's network of former coworkers on his re-employment probability after displacement: a 10 percentage point increase in the prevailing employment rate in the network increases the re-employment probability by 7.5 percentage points. In contrast, there is no evidence of a statistically significant effect on wages.","[Glitz, Albrecht] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Glitz, Albrecht] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Glitz, Albrecht] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Empresa, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; Pompeu Fabra University,"Glitz, A (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.;Glitz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Empresa, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",albrecht.glitz@upf.edu,"Glitz, Albrecht/D-6736-2013","Glitz, Albrecht/0000-0002-7324-6082","Barcelona GSE Research Network; Government of Catalonia; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2008-06395-005-01, ECO2011-30323-C03-02]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in R D [SEV-2011-0075, ECO2014-52238-R]; Spanish Ministery of Education, Culture and Sport through Jose Castillejo Programme","Barcelona GSE Research Network; Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in R D(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministery of Education, Culture and Sport through Jose Castillejo Programme","I am greatly indebted to the IAB and, in particular, Marco Hafner for the support with the data.

While the Czech banking sector demonstrated relatively high resistance towards financial pressures during the crisis, the systemic credit risk monitoring still remains underresearched. We address this research gap by analysing the components of the most frequently used credit risk indicator - the non-performing loans ratio (NPLR). We contribute to the existing literature by dismantling the NPLR components - the non-performing loans and client loans and analyse them through various economic sectors. For the purpose of the analysis, we construct a large factor-augmented VAR model (FAVAR) of the Czech economy which is not limited to number of variables used as in standard VAR models. We find that there are some striking differences among sectors in their response to lending rate innovations. Our evidence shows that the sectoral differences cannot be disregarded or even neglected in financial stability analysis.","[Hodula, Martin; Melecky, Ales] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Hodula, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",martin.hodula@vsb.cz; ales.melecky@vsb.cz,"Melecky, Ales/AAZ-1918-2020; Melecky, Ales/HNP-2751-2023","Melecky, Ales/0000-0002-4495-6296;",VSB-TUO [SP2017/110]; Czech Science Agency [GA16-22540S],VSB-TUO; Czech Science Agency,This paper greatly benefited from a data support provided by the Czech National Bank.

Using the powerful Kim and Perron (2009) unit root test and real GDPs over the period 1992-2014 as the study sample, results indicate the presence of a break for all economies that corresponds to the Asian financial crisis. Additionally, allowing for a break leads to the rejection of the unit root hypothesis for Taiwan only. Important implications are provided. First, considering the presence of a break in testing for nonstationarity is important or false conclusions can be drawn. Second, given the stationarity of GDP found for Taiwan only, investors should look beyond any local economic shocks and focus more on world economy development when investing in Taiwan. By contrast, investors in Mainland China and Hong Kong should pay attention to any shock because it is likely to be persistent. Third, relevant authorities should recognize that any government policy intended to promote long-run economic growth may be ineffective in Taiwan whereas it can be more effective in Mainland China and Hong Kong.","[Hong, Hui; Chen, Naiwei] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Inst Financial Res, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Normal University,"Chen, NW (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Normal Univ, Int Inst Financial Res, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",906218956@qq.com,"Hong, Hui/C-7459-2016",,"Jiangxi Normal University, China","Jiangxi Normal University, China","This work was supported by the Jiangxi Normal University, China.",,9,0,0,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

A seller posts prices to screen a buyer over time, and the buyer may receive an outside option at a random time. We consider two information regimes: one in which the arrival of the outside option is public and one in which the arrival is private. A public arrival of the outside option works as a commitment device that forces the buyer to opt out immediately. This effect leads to a generically unique equilibrium in which the Coase conjecture holds. In contrast, a private arrival of the outside option may lead to additional delay and equilibrium multiplicity. The Coase conjecture fails in some equilibria. The buyer's preference about transparency is time-inconsistent: she prefers to commit to making arrivals public, but she is unwilling to disclose her outside option after the arrival. Moreover, the seller benefits from having the buyer privately observe her outside option. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Cars with lower are required because of environmental taxes, which are mainly oriented on passenger cars. These taxes are usually based on level of emissions of car and can motivate people to buying an environmentally friendly car.

To bring these numbers into accordance with the Millennium Development Goals, there are at least a dozen of different programmes operating around the world. Microcredit, being one of those programmes, is considered superior to the rest for being the only participatory approach and for being general enough to cater for a number of policy interventions. Microcredit or credit to the poor is provided under two very different mechanisms; the welfarist mechanism and the institutionalist mechanism. Each of these mechanisms has its advocates, as well as, its critics. The current paper empirically evaluates the two approaches in a systematic way. By using purposively collected data from the North West Pakistan and vigorous methodologies, we show that commercialization of microfinance institutions has indeed shifted the focus from either poverty reduction or women's empowerment. Instead, the focus is now on more secure and profitable advances. Moreover, we also show that the welfarist approach in eradicating poverty and empowering women is superior to the now popular financial system approach.","[Khan, Wajid; Shaorong, Sun] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Ikram] Pakistan Inst Dev Econ, Islamabad, Pakistan",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; Pakistan Institute of Development Economics,"Khan, W (通讯作者)，Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wajiduomm@gmail.com,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023","Ullah, Ikram/0000-0003-3675-0738; Khan, Wajid/0000-0001-9600-3721","National Natural Science Foundation of China [70871080, 71171134]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors feel highly indebted to the National Natural Science Foundation of China for providing necessary funding for the research via grants numbers 70871080 and 71171134.,,37,19,20,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Based on the operational Australian Industrial Ecology Lab, a particularly important feature of this cloud environment is a highly detailed regional and sectoral taxonomy called the 'root classification'. The purpose of this root is to serve as a feedstock from which researchers can choose any combination of regions and economic sectors to form a model of the economy that is suitable to address their particular research questions. Thus, the Global MRIO Lab concept enables enhanced flexibility in MRIO database construction whilst at the same time saving resources and avoiding duplication, by sharing time-and labour-intensive tasks amongst multiple research teams.

We provide evidence that banks use interest- and non-interest income (non-II) as substitutes rather than complements, with non-II representing an indirect competition instrument by the more efficient banks used in place of direct competition with their peers through prices on loans and deposits. This behaviour is explained by further decomposing the non-II into the relatively stable fees component and the volatile trading income. Moreover, we provide evidence that the net-interest income is primarily affected by the banks' market power and their operating costs, while more efficient banks exploit their core deposit base to lever their non-II. Finally, macroeconomic developments affect both income components, which are found to be procyclical with respect to economic activity. In particular, the two income components are affected differently from inflation implying that non-II provides a natural hedge against adverse effects from deflation on interest income.","[Louzis, Dimitrios P.] Bank Greece, Econ Anal & Res Dept, Athens, Greece; [Vouldis, Angelos T.] European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Stat, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; European Central Bank,"Vouldis, AT (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Stat, Frankfurt, Germany.",Angelos.Vouldis@ecb.int,,,,,,,52,2,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The article shows how in the case of innovation, successful policies that have led to radical innovations have been more about market shaping and creating through direct and pervasive public financing, rather than market fixing. The paper reviews and discusses evidence for this in three key areas: (i) the presence of finance from public sources across the entire innovation chain; (ii) the concept of 'mission-oriented' policies that have created new technological and industrial landscapes; and (iii) the entrepreneurial and lead investor role of public actors, willing and able to take on extreme risks, independent of the business cycle. We further illustrate these three characteristics for the case of clean technology, and discuss how a market-creating and -shaping perspective may be useful for understanding the financing of transformative innovation needed for confronting contemporary societal challenges.","[Mazzucato, Mariana] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Mazzucato, Mariana] UCL, London, England; [Semieniuk, Gregor] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, London, England",University of Sussex; University of London; University College London; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Mazzucato, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England.;Mazzucato, M (通讯作者)，UCL, London, England.",m.mazzucato@sussex.ac.uk; gs53@soas.ac.uk,"Mazzucato, Mariana/H-4456-2011; Semieniuk, Gregor/ABM-4335-2022","Mazzucato, Mariana/0000-0001-9183-5000",EU Horizon 2020 grant: DOLFINS [640772]; EU Horizon 2020 grant: ISIGrowth [649186],EU Horizon 2020 grant: DOLFINS; EU Horizon 2020 grant: ISIGrowth,"We have received many very useful comments from the following: the referees for this volume; the participants in a seminar at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU); the participants at the ESRC Workshop on Financing Innovation that we personally organized at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) headquarters; and the editors of this special issue and the participants at the Oxford Review's editorial seminar.

A notable feature of the recent financial crisis is the extent to which assets that had hitherto moved mostly independently suddenly moved together resulting in joint losses in most advanced markets. This provides grounds to uncover the relative potential of African markets to provide diversification benefits by means of their correlation with advanced markets. Therefore, we examine the dependence structure between advanced and emerging African stock markets using copulas. Several findings are documented. First, dependence is time-varying and weak for most African markets, except South Africa. Second, we find evidence of asymmetric dependence, suggesting that stock return comovement varies in bearish and bullish markets. Third, extreme downward stock price movements in the advanced markets do not have significant spillover effects on Africa's emerging stock markets. Our results, implying that African markets, with the exception of South Africa, are immune to risk spillover from advanced markets, improves the extant literature and have implications for portfolio diversification and risk management.

The price of WTI was always a little larger than that of Brent for a long time. However, the price of WTI has been surpassed by that of Brent since 2011. The new market circumstances and volatility of oil price require a comprehensive re-estimation of risk. Therefore, this study aims to explore an integrated approach to assess the price risk in the two crude oil markets through the value at risk (VaR) model. The VaR is estimated by the extreme value theory (EVT) and GARCH model on the basis of generalized error distribution (GED). The results show that EVT is a powerful approach to capture the risk in the oil markets. On the contrary, the traditional variance-covariance (VC) and Monte Carlo (MC) approaches tend to overestimate risk when the confidence level is 95%, but underestimate risk at the confidence level of 99%. The VaR of WTI returns is larger than that of Brent returns at identical confidence levels. Moreover, the GED-GARCH model can estimate the downside dynamic VaR accurately for WTI and Brent oil returns.","[Mi, Zhi-Fu; Guan, Dabo] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Mi, Zhi-Fu; Wei, Yi-Ming; Tang, Bao-Jun; Yu, Hao; Cao, Hong; Guan, Dabo] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yi-Ming; Tang, Bao-Jun; Yu, Hao; Cao, Hong] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yi-Ming; Tang, Bao-Jun; Yu, Hao; Cao, Hong] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Elect Vehicles Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cong, Rong-Gang] Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark; [Cong, Rong-Gang] Lund Univ, Ctr Environm & Climate Res CEC, Lund, Sweden",University of East Anglia; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Aarhus University; Lund University,"Tang, BJ (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, 5 Zhongguancun South St, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Cong, RG (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.",tbj@bit.edu.cn; rc@envs.au.dk,"Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019; Mi, Zhifu/P-1027-2019; cong, ronggang/AAJ-4639-2021; Cong, Rong-Gang/C-3691-2017; Cong, Rong-Gang/F-5489-2012","Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Mi, Zhifu/0000-0001-8106-0694; Cong, Rong-Gang/0000-0003-3506-2095","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602603, 2016YFA0602604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71521002, 71020107026, 71573013, 41328008]; UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1]; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1]; British Academy [AF150310]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L016028/1] Funding Source: UKRI; NERC [NE/N00714X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); British Academy; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),"This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2016YFA0602603, 2016YFA0602604], National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71521002, 71020107026, 71573013 and 41328008], the UK Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/L016028/1], Natural Environment Research Council [grant number NE/N00714X/1] and British Academy Grant [grant number AF150310].",,42,20,20,0,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Short-, medium- and long-run equilibria are considered. In the long-run case, the expectations of sales growth governing investment change adaptively, and this, combined with the autonomous growth rate of exports, produces convergence of the actual rate of capacity utilization to its normal rate. It is demonstrated that some aspects of the main Kaleckian results can be preserved not only in the short or medium run but also in the long run, in the sense that both (1) a decrease in the propensity to save, and (2) a change in income distribution favoring labor, bring about higher average rates of production growth and capital accumulation. However, the impact of a change in the profit share is shown to be subjected to the condition that the responsiveness of the real exchange rate with respect to the profit share has to be bounded from above, confirming that the scope for wage-led demand or wage-led growth can be limited by open-economy considerations, even within the supermultiplier context.","[Nah, Won Jun] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea; [Lavoie, Marc] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lavoie, Marc] Univ Paris 13, CEPN, Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Villetaneuse, France",Kyungpook National University; University of Ottawa; Universite Paris 13,"Nah, WJ (通讯作者)，Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea.",,,,,,,,30,29,31,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Few studies have examined this question in detail due to the difficulty of measuring corruption and paucity of consistent data over an adequate time span. I use a cross-country panel data-set spanning 1995-2014 to examine how domestic corruption reacts to the culture of corruption amongst a country's regional neighbors. I find evidence that a reduction in regional corruption can actually lead to a worsening of corruption within a country, and vice versa. If in an open economy, regional graft lowers the level of income that a rent-seeking government can tax, a reduction in regional corruption can increase the marginal benefit of imposing a more extractive domestic policy by increasing the pool of exploitable funds.

In order to evaluate the state of cluster development in the country and the stage of economic development, the authors used the secondary data from the World Economic Forum (WEF), published in The Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014. Although the stage of economic development is influenced by many economic and political factors, the authors assume that the stage of economic development predominantly depends on the decision and willingness of political and business leaders to lead the country to higher stages of economic development and sustainable economic growth. Their decision has an impact on cluster development in the country, and therefore influences the possibility of clusters to improve economic development and national competitiveness, especially in emerging markets and developing economies.","[Parausic, Vesna] Inst Agr Econ, Belgrade, Serbia; [Domazet, Ivana] Inst Econ Sci, Belgrade, Serbia; [Simeunovic, Ivana] Belgrade Banking Acad, Belgrade, Serbia",Institute of Economic Sciences,"Parausic, V (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ, Belgrade, Serbia.",,"Paraušić, Vesna/HGD-1274-2022; Domazet, Ivana S/M-4633-2018","Paraušić, Vesna/0000-0001-6193-5297; Domazet, Ivana S/0000-0002-3493-4616","Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [III46006, III47009, OI179015]","Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This paper is a part of research projects III46006, III47009 and OI179015 financed by the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.",,64,6,6,0,15,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Different ethnic groups are characterized by their own formal and informal economic structures which largely define the lifestyle of their representatives. The aim of the research is to evaluate interdependency between ethnic - social processes and formation of innovative development in the region using the example of national subjects of the Russian Federation. The main task of the conducted analysis was to identify the interconnection between random variables by means of dot and interval evaluation of double correlation coefficients, calculating and checking the importance of multiple correlation and determination coefficients. The results of conducted analysis provided empirical data to supported several hypotheses: the hypothesis on the level of title influence influencing innovation development; natural barriers of informal institutions' influence on smaller ethnos' activities lead to slower innovation development; the share of country title population indicator is positively correlated with all innovation development indicators. As a result of conducted research authors got the quantitative evaluation of ethnic-social processes influence degree on the level of regional innovation development. Obtained results can be used for prognosticating innovation activities development and consequently for managing knowledge formation process in ethnic regions.","[Popov, Evgeny; Vlasov, Maksim; Kengurogov, Nikolay] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Popov, Evgeny; Vlasov, Maksim] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Ural Branch, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences,"Popov, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.;Popov, E (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Inst Econ, Ural Branch, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",epopov@mail.ru; Mvlassov@mail.ru; ken-graf@yandex.ru,"Vlasov, Maxim/K-5206-2017; Попов, Евгений Васильевич/H-3358-2015",,"Russian Science Foundation at Udmurt State University (Izhevsk, Russia) [15-18-00049]; Institute of Public Administration and Entrepreneurship Ural Federal University; Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation [02.A03.21.0006]","Russian Science Foundation at Udmurt State University (Izhevsk, Russia)(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Institute of Public Administration and Entrepreneurship Ural Federal University; Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation","The study was financially supported by the Russian Science Foundation at Udmurt State University (Izhevsk, Russia) project No 15-18-00049.; The study was financially supported by the Institute of Public Administration and Entrepreneurship Ural Federal University project Innovative behavior state the enterprises during crisis; The work was supported by Act 211 Government of the Russian Federation, contract. 02.A03.21.0006.",,14,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1263,1273,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300126,0

The author develops a conceptual framework and a series of propositions, grounded on previous studies of user resistance to information systems (IS) and post-acceptance usage. The framework proposes that three individual-level variables (loss of power, change in decision-making approach, change of job or job skills), four corporate-level variables (information culture, communication, user training, service quality) and a technology-related variable (system issues) can be attributed to fuel user resistance towards BIS post-acceptance usage stages. A series of propositions is offered that aims to stimulate empirical research in this topical subject. Despite wide acknowledgement of the importance of user resistance for IS implementation success, this area has been under-researched in the field of BIS. This article draws insights from theoretical and empirical studies to shed some light on this area. A framework is presented which transcends previous works on user resistance to IS by looking at the context of BIS use within the voluntary use environment.","[Popovic, Ales] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Popovic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",ales.popovic@ef.uni-lj.si,"Popovič, Aleš/H-1399-2012","Popovič, Aleš/0000-0002-6924-6119",Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS [J5-7287]; Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2014-09-3729],Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS; Croatian Science Foundation,This work was supported by Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS [grant number J5-7287]; and the Croatian Science Foundation [grant number IP-2014-09-3729].,,54,9,11,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In the literature on the subject, the view which prevails is that the more sophisticated methods, i.e. those taking into account the discounting process, are characterised by higher valuation accuracy. However, the results of the present analysis show that Polish analysts achieve more accurate valuations using the market approach than the DCF model. Nevertheless, the highest level of accuracy is achieved by the target price, which in most cases is the value of the weighted average of valuations obtained via a market valuation and discounting methods. In terms of the multiples which are taken into account in this research, the highest accuracy is achieved with the use of EV/EBIT, although there are no statistically significant differences between the valuations calculated using this multiple and the results obtained with the P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples. Valuations prepared with the use of individual multiples usually generate greater errors compared to the DCF model and the market approach, which uses the weighted average of the valuations achieved with individual multiples.","[Prusak, Blazej] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Prusak, B (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dept Econ Anal & Finance, Gdansk, Poland.",pb@zie.pg.gda.pl,"Prusak, Błażej/G-3090-2018","Prusak, Błażej/0000-0002-6526-0407",,,,,28,5,5,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In this research we used monthly data for the time period from July 1995 to June 2016, and thus, in this way total 252 observations have been considered. Time series have been made stationary by applying ADF and PP tests at first difference. Johansen multivariate conintegration approach was used to test the long-term association amongst the considered macroeconomic variables. The results indicated that CPI and COP significantly affect KSE100 index returns that indicated CPI along with COP have foreseen power to impact KSE100 index. In contrary, the results of WPI and COP do not have long run relationship with KSE100 index in case of Pakistani economy. Results of variance decomposition exhibited that the index of LKSE100 was realistically rarer exogenous in connection to distinctive factors, as around 92.31% of its variation was explained due to its own specific shocks. It is concluded that CPI and COP can impact the KSE100 index returns. It is confirmed by the results of impulse response function that there is a positive and long run relationship between KSE100 returns and consumer price index (proxy of inflation) and international crude oil prices.","[Raheem Ahmed, Rizwan; Ghauri, Saghir Pervaiz] Ind Univ, Fac Management Sci, Block 17, Karachi 75500, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G 6, LT-4422 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Ahmad, Nawaz] Inst Business Management, Fac Management Sci, Creek Rd, Karachi 75190, Pakistan",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G 6, LT-4422 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@lsu.lt,"Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/J-5017-2019; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020","Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/0000-0002-6029-7868; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912;",,,,,89,5,5,0,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Production costs are independently distributed and privately learned by the producer in each supply chain. I provide a rationale for outsourcing that relies on procurement and subcontracting mechanisms being designed in a sequentially rational way but not on cost savings. I show how my rationale extends to the case with cost savings and I discuss the sellers' incentives to engage in nested outsourcing. The driving force behind my rationale is that outsourcing makes the distribution of a seller's cost of providing the product more dispersed.

The results show a significant positive correlation between the rule of law, corruption control with economic growth and stock market turnover rate proxy. The examination through an artificial neural network resulted in a higher determination coefficient and less average standard error. This, in turn, reveals that the fitting power and efficiency of this method is higher than the panel data regression model.

The argument is built on the idea that the more help an agent receives when performing a task, the less informative the score on that task will be relative to the agent's ability to perform it. If an agent is confident, he tends to benefit from more cooperation opportunities simply because he is likely to be perceived as being more skilled. As a result, he remains confident because the future signals he will observe will contain very little information regarding his ability. On the contrary, if the agent is not confident, he will receive more informative scores, which will help him learn his true ability faster.

We apply two clustering methods. The first one is the k-means algorithm, which belongs to centroid-based clustering.

Testing normality is a fundamental step before using statistical methods based on assumption of normality. Many approaches to testing normality have been proposed (parametric or nonparametric). If the assumption is not fulfilled, the methods could lead to inaccurate inferences. Parametric tests are based on estimates of the theoretical moments, disadvantage of these tests is the sensitivity of sample moments on outliers. Sample moments are inappropriate estimates of the theoretical moments in that situation and also in case of the small samples. There is a high probability of incorrect rejection of the hypothesis that sample comes from normal distribution. It is recommended to use more robust measures instead of sample moments. L-moments are used in this paper instead of sample moments. The aim of this paper is to compare the accuracy of tests of normality based on L-moments with classical parametric and nonparametric tests like Jarque-Bera or Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The comparison is performed for various situations (different sizes of a sample, various number of outliers in a sample and various distance of outliers from other observations).

The results of the recursive VAR models suggest that the exchange rate and credit channels play a major role in the monetary transmission process, whereas this is not true in the case of the interest rate channel. However, the results of the non-recursive VAR models show that the role of the exchange rate has diminished over time. On the other hand, the credit channel has become much more influential. Thus, if one of the overriding objectives of adopting the explicit inflation targeting regime is to enhance the importance of other channels apart from the exchange rate channel, which could make monetary policy more effective in achieving price and financial stability, the switch to the inflation targeting regime is justified.","[Stojanovic, Danilo; Stojanovic, Dusan] PKF Ltd, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Stojanovic, D (通讯作者)，PKF Ltd, Belgrade, Serbia.",dds.mpek@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2017,29.0,1,,,,,117,137,,10.1080/14631377.2016.1238083,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EL2KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394448800007,0

The result is a balance of losses and benefits in terms of illegal migration in Germany, and in long run it also deals with the returns of governmental spending on integration of immigrants into society.","[Strunz, Herbert] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Management & Dev Human Resources, Trencin, Slovakia; [Strunz, Herbert; Tupa, Magdalena; Kordos, Marcel] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska 3, Trencin 91150, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin; Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Strunz, H (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Management & Dev Human Resources, Trencin, Slovakia.;Strunz, H (通讯作者)，Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska 3, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.",herbert.strunz@gmx.de; magdalena.tupa@tnuni.sk; marcel.kordos@tnuni.sk,"Tupá, Magdaléna/AAR-2100-2021; Kordoš, Marcel/P-4568-2018","Tupá, Magdaléna/0000-0003-4532-2292; Kordoš, Marcel/0000-0002-1833-7096",VEGA agency Balance of economic gains and losses from labor mi-gration [c.1/0679/17],VEGA agency Balance of economic gains and losses from labor mi-gration(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This publication was created within the frame of the project funded by VEGA agency Balance of economic gains and losses from labor mi-gration(c.1/0679/17).,,12,0,0,1,3,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-5233-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,629,635,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0QL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000492966900090,0

This large increase forced producers to invest in improving electricity efficiency. In this paper, the macroeconomic interindustry model of Taiwan (MEIT) is developed to study the economic effects of high electricity prices and consequential improvement in energy efficiency. MEIT describes the structure of 47 industries, from both real and price-income approaches. To resolve inconsistent data, RAS is employed. A technical model is also integrated to consider technical feasibility, which offsets the usual shortcomings of technological analysis in an economic model. The iron and steel industry is taken as a case study. Estimated results indicate that higher electricity prices negatively affect Taiwan's economy. However, improving energy efficiency can reduce some of this effect.","[Su, Yu-Wen; Lin, Chih-Hsun] Ind Technol Res Inst, Ind Econ & Knowledge Ctr, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Yang, Hao-Yen] Natl Taipei Univ Business, Dept & Grad Inst Finance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Chih-Hsun] Natl Cent Univ, Taoyuan, Taiwan",Industrial Technology Research Institute - Taiwan; National Taipei University of Business; National Central University,"Su, YW (通讯作者)，Ind Technol Res Inst, Ind Econ & Knowledge Ctr, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",yuwensu@itri.org.tw,"Su, Yu-Wen/V-4948-2018",,"Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan [103-E0401]","Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan(Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan)","This work was supported by Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan [grant number 103-E0401].",,64,6,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

The aim is to formulate applicable approaches to work with talents and test impact of type of reward on talents' development, and placement in talent programmes. In particular, the article strives to determine whether there are any differences or dependencies among types of employees and their placement in talent programmes and their approaches to work in the organisation. The data were collected by quantitative survey of 134 employees across sectors in the Czech Republic. Descriptive statistics and two-dimensional statistics were used to evaluate the data. The results indicate significance of types of income and their impact on the employee's further development. Employees with individual incomes based on performance are more specialised at development areas. The study is first empirical approach in defined areas.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the perception of the premise that adequate lobbying and transparency of lobbying has the potential to be viewed positively by stakeholders. Data for the study was gathered from a sample of businesses, non-profit organisations, and other institutions in the Czech Republic. Totally, 73 organisation/institution members took part in the survey. One respondent per organisation/institution was questioned. The results show that 80% of respondents perceive transparency of lobbying positively. Remaining 20% of respondents partly disagree with the positive impacts of transparent lobbying. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between three observed groups (business, non-profit and other institutions). Non-profit organisations perceive transparency of lobbying statistically significantly better than respondents from business and other institutions. This article may be considered as a case study of perception of transparency of lobbying in the Czech Republic.

We show that by taking into account consumer entry, the nature of optimal nonlinear pricing contracts changes significantly: compared to the benchmark without costly entry, in our model both quality distortion and market exclusion are reduced, sorting is more likely, and whenever bunching occurs, the bunching interval is necessarily smaller. Additionally, under certain conditions the monopoly solution may even achieve the first best (i.e., production efficiency). We also demonstrate that the optimal monopoly solutions can be ranked according to inverse hazard rate functions of the entry cost, which suggests an interesting dynamic for monopolistic nonlinear pricing with consumer entry.","[Ye, Lixin] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Zhang, Chenglin] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Chengdu, Peoples R China",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Ye, LX (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",ye.45@osu.edu; chenglinzhangecon@gmail.com,"Zhang, Cheng/JAC-5078-2023; zhang, cl/JDW-6549-2023; Zhang, Cheng/GRS-8698-2022; Zhang, Cheng/JAD-2236-2023",,,,,,33,3,4,0,9,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

In the case with endogenous retirement age, a higher fertility rate raises pensions if the fertility rate and costs of raising children are low; otherwise, such a change decreases pensions. Our numerical results indicate that, under a reasonable range of parameterization, raising the fertility rate is more likely to increase pensions in the case with exogenous retirement age, whereas such a change tends to reduce pensions in the case with endogenous retirement age.","[Chen, Hung-Ju] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Chen, HJ (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Econ, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",hjc@ntu.edu.tw,"CHEN, HUNG-JU/M-1077-2018","CHEN, HUNG-JU/0000-0001-7775-8571",,,,,24,10,11,5,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

A pivotal voter determines the equilibrium tax on capital, the revenues from which fund the provision of productive public goods. The taste for status and the distributions of wealth and political power interact to generate stylized versions of oligarchies, middle-class democracies and populist democracies. A rise in the taste for status increases the role of distributional concerns in policy preferences, lowering growth in an oligarchy or populist democracy, but increasing it in a middle-class democracy. In addition, the egalitarian redistribution of wealth or political power causes growth to first rise and then fall as the equilibrium tax rate approaches and then exceeds its growth-maximizing level, generating inverse U-shaped relationships between democracy and growth and inequality and growth.

It also investigates how industry-level wage floor adjustment interacts with changes in the national minimum wage (NMW hereafter). For this, we have collected a unique dataset of approximately 3200 industry-level wage agreements containing about 70,000 occupation-specific wage floors in 367 industries over the period 2006Q1-2017Q4. Our main results are the following. Wage floors are quite rigid, adjusting only once a year on average. They mostly adjust in the first quarter of the year and the NMW shapes the timing of industry-level wage bargaining. Inflation but also changes in past aggregate wage increases and in the real NMW are the main drivers of wage floor adjustments. Elasticities of wage floors with respect to these macro variables are 0.6, 0.4 and 0.3 respectively. Inflation and the NMW have both decreasing but positive effects all along the wage floor distribution.","[Fougere, Denis] CNRS, OSC, Paris, France; [Fougere, Denis] CEPR, Sci Po Paris, LIEPP, Paris, France; [Fougere, Denis] IZA, St Martin Du Fresne, France; [Gautier, Erwan] Banque France, Paris, France; [Gautier, Erwan] Univ Nantes, Nantes, France; [Roux, Sebastien] Inect, Insee, Crest, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); European Central Bank; Bank of France; Nantes Universite,"Gautier, E (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.;Gautier, E (通讯作者)，Univ Nantes, Nantes, France.",denis.fougere@sciencespo.fr; erwan.gautier@banque-france.fr; roux@ensae.fr,,,French National Research Agency's (ANR) Investissements d'Avenir [ANR-11-LABX-0091],French National Research Agency's (ANR) Investissements d'Avenir(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We are grateful to two anonymous referees for their insightful comments and suggestions.

We define the concept of full cost equivalence scales as integrating both monetary and the time use costs and measure it on matched French family budget and time use surveys. These data allow us to define full prices and to estimate equivalence scales conditional to possible substitution through prices. The results show higher full scales than the monetary for the preferred Independent of a Base specification. Relative to the cost of the second adult, the full child cost is also larger than the monetary for matching estimators and the Prais-Houthakker model. It shows households' capacity to substitute domestic production to market activities.

The carbon reductions and economic effects of the policy mix combining investment restrictions with low carbon technology progress measures were also assessed. The results show that investment restriction policies for energy-intensive industries in China effectively accelerate industrial restructuring and have significant carbon reduction effects. However, those restrictions hurt China's economy, causing investment outflow that benefits other countries. Low carbon technology progress realized by investing revenues from investment restrictions in R&D and the sharing of advanced technologies between countries improves the carbon reduction potential of China, but it is difficult to obtain significant reduction in a short time period. Despite this finding, technology progress measures compensate for economic losses and therefore have great significance to carbon governance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A direct link between attitudes (tax morale) and behavior (tax compliance) has long been assumed, despite an extensive social scientific literature attesting to the generally weak congruence between the two. This study builds on an emerging body of work questioning the link between tax morale and compliance. It innovates with a cross-national experimental research design whose results indicate that populations with high levels of tax morale exhibit higher evasion rates than those with low levels of tax morale; thus, the study finds that individual self-reported tax morale cannot predict actual evasion choices. Methodologically, the paper contributes the first results of a laboratory experiment on taxation in Denmark, comparing them to laboratory findings from Italy; while previous research indicates that these two countries lie at opposite extremes in tax compliance and morale, our findings run contrary to culturalist explanations. Our results show that Danes are more likely to evade tax than Italians, and that individuals' attitudes toward tax do not significantly predict their actual evasion choices. Finally, we show that discrepancies in tax behavior between Italian and Danish subjects are affected by gender and risk aversion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a choice problem with a status quo, the agent chooses the alternatives that yield the highest utility net of switching cost. This generates status quo bias and also allows for a wide range of reference effects. We examine the behavior of such agents in Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) games. In a single PD game, switching costs can lead to cooperation. However, across different PD games, it is not anything goes and instead we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation rates to be consistent with our model. We then verify that these conditions are satisfied by Charness et al.'s (2016) experimental data.

Additionally, African governments consider China a vital stakeholder in their plans to transform their economies through technology. This study empirically examines whether China's exports of information and communication technology and high-technology goods and foreign direct investment outflows stimulate growth in Africa. The results demonstrate that China's engagement in trade could lead to a positive and negative shift of steady-state position of real gross domestic product and technological progress, respectively, in Africa. These results predict that China's engagement will contribute to economic growth in African countries through increasing capital per worker efficiency but cause stagnation in their technological progress. Finally, one of the choices that African countries could make as they create policies to increase their technological progress is discussed.","[Habyarimana, Jean-Baptiste; Opoku, Eric Evans Osei] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Habyarimana, JB (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jhabyarim2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; ericopoku2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk,"Habyarimana, Jean Baptiste/JXN-9193-2024; Opoku, Eric Evans Osei/ABF-4983-2020","Opoku, Eric Evans Osei/0000-0002-4961-5984; HABYARIMANA, Jean Baptiste/0000-0002-7993-9242",,,,,43,7,7,1,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

I further investigate the driving forces from an industry perspective using a Bayesian dynamic latent factor model. The common factor that explains common movements across manufacturing industries moves in accordance with gross loan reallocation. However, the factor plays the least important role in driving fluctuations of credit reallocation, while sectoral or idiosyncratic disturbances are the driving forces behind fluctuations in credit reallocation intensity. The findings imply that heterogeneity in industrial credit market dynamics is a key source of the evolution of credit reallocation.","[Hyun, Junghwan] Kwangwoon Univ, Div Int Trade, Kwangwoon Ro 20, Seoul 01897, South Korea",Kwangwoon University,"Hyun, J (通讯作者)，Kwangwoon Univ, Div Int Trade, Kwangwoon Ro 20, Seoul 01897, South Korea.",jhhyun@kw.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017S1A5B8060156],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",I am very grateful to the Editor and anonymous reviewers for valuable comments.

More importantly, we investigate the issue of whether the interaction of trade openness and human capital can explain financial development. Our findings show that, while human capital robustly influence financial development, trade openness robustly matter more for private credit than domestic credit. The interactive terms of openness and human capital are significantly related to financial development. Evaluation of the marginal effects reveal that trade openness (human capital) has greater impact on private (domestic) credit than human capital (trade openness). Our evidence largely suggests that human capital accumulation and trade openness are substitutable in influencing financial development in Africa. (C) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

Whereas a previous agreement had made financial stability explicitly subordinate to the price stability objective, the 2016 agreement specifically allowed for temporary deviations from the inflation target in pursuit of financial stability. I argue this change led the Reserve Bank to overly condition monetary policy on apprehended financial stability risks at the expense of achieving the inflation target, explaining a prolonged undershoot of the central tendency of the RBA's 2%-3% inflation target range. The RBA otherwise characterises financial stability risks as low, implying little benefit from conditioning monetary policy on those risks compared to the costs of undershooting the inflation target. Below target inflation may itself undermine the financial stability objective. I recommend the next federal government revert to the wording of the 2010 Statement on the Conduct of Monetary Policy in describing the relationship between price and financial stability, as well as other measures to re-prioritise the inflation target.

Shocks are identified by imposing block exogeneity and long-run restrictions motivated by an open economy model that includes oil prices. The results show that oil price shocks account for only a small proportion of output fluctuations while productivity shocks have the largest share. Real exchange rate movements are largely driven by demand shocks while monetary shocks explain most of the variability in prices. Economic policies should focus on productivity improvement and capital investment to increase output in the long run, and the conduct of fiscal policy should take into account the impact on real exchange rate volatility.","[Koh, Wee Chian] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, JG Crawford Bldg,Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Koh, WC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, JG Crawford Bldg,Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",wc.koh@anu.edu.au,,"Koh, Wee Chian/0000-0001-8710-5427",,,,,31,0,0,0,2,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Being the lowest echelon of a co-operative's internal governance hierarchy, district councils constitute a link between the membership and the board of directors. Previous research indicates that district council members are often driven by a co-operative conviction and social concerns. The present study challenges this view. On the basis of a survey of all 191 district council members and council chairpersons of a large Swedish agricultural co-operative, it is found that the elected representatives rank low in terms of co-operative conviction and social concerns. They involve themselves mainly in order to get personal benefits; they want to gain access to information, mature personally and obtain inputs to develop their farm enterprises.

Liberalisation of access of migrants to the Russian labour market is a part of a wider problem: competition (on an international scale) for an influx of foreign labour force. In this context, it is worth examining how the crisis which affected the Russian economy influenced the scale of immigration to Russia from the main sending countries, i.e. the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to show the impact of the crisis which affected the Russian economy in recent years on the scale of immigration from the CIS countries to Russia. The main hypothesis is as follows: the factor explaining immigration from the CIS countries to Russia is the difference in the level of income measured by GDP per capita (PPP) between the sending state and the country of destination. Such studies have not been undertaken so far and, due to the role of factors inherent in the concept of post-imperial migration, it becomes relevant to examine whether the factors shaping migration (including the differences in the level of income) recognised in the neoclassical theory of migration are important in explaining the flows in this area. Methods: In order to check the relationship between immigration and the economic crisis in Russia, the analysis of correlation and regression was used. Findings & Value added: It has been shown that despite the decline in GDP in Russia, immigration from the CIS countries to Russia is not decreasing. Therefore, it is a dependence different from the assumptions of the neoclassical theory according to which the reduction of differences in the level of income between the sending state and the country of destination reduces the scale of international migrations. As it has been shown, the scale of migration to Russia may not be explained by the difference in the level of GDP per capita in all CIS countries and, inter alia, political factors, conflicts or naturalisation processes become more important in shaping the scale of migration to Russia.","[Piekutowska, Agnieszka; Fiedorczuk, Monika] Univ Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland",University of Bialystok,"Piekutowska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bialystok, Fac Econ & Management, Ul Warszawska 63, Bialystok, Poland.",piekutowska@uwb.edu.pl,"Piekutowska, Agnieszka/AAM-7184-2021; Piekutowska, Agnieszka/HZK-1397-2023","Piekutowska, Agnieszka/0000-0001-7923-9484; Piekutowska, Agnieszka/0000-0001-7923-9484",,,,,20,7,7,0,5,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

These variations correlate with uncertainty shocks because gold is perceived as a safe haven asset. To control for news-related effects associated with the events we identify uncertainty and news shocks jointly, developing a set-identified proxy SVAR. We find that the popular recursive approach underestimates the effects of uncertainty shocks and delivers responses for economic activity and monetary policy that have more in common with news shocks than with uncertainty shocks.","German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin,"Piffer, M (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Dept Macroecon, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",m.b.piffer@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,51,58,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

The firm's exposure to the public sector (measured as the average of individual exposures of the firm's workforce) produces a wage differential of 13.6%, suggesting that employers are concerned about wage tensions.

To proxy Ottoman legacies, I estimate the length of Ottoman rule across all Ottoman successor states. Conditioning on income per capita, I find a robust adverse effect of both socialist and Ottoman legacies on present day corruption a finding which reconciles two rival accounts of post-socialist corruption from the transition literature. The results are robust to controlling for potential confounders and instrumenting for both per capita income and the length of Ottoman rule. However, the explanatory power of long-run historical determinants of corruption is lower than the contribution of short-run factors. While present day income explains about half of the total variation in corruption across post-socialist countries, Ottoman and socialist legacies jointly account for about one third. Although history does matter, these findings suggest that most of the corruption observed in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Balkans today may not be inherently 'eastern' or socialist. Rather, the data are consistent with an interpretation of corruption predominantly as a manifestation of persistent economic under-development.","[Uberti, Luca J.] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Uberti, LJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",luca.jacopo.uberti@gmail.com,,"Uberti, Luca J./0000-0003-0164-7589",Research Council of Norway [240505]; Graduate Research Committee at the University of Otago (New Zealand),Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Graduate Research Committee at the University of Otago (New Zealand),"This work was partly financed by the Research Council of Norway project Nr. 240505.

I argue that an important mechanism is cultural patronage in the placement of transportation infrastructure. The results show that railroad construction was more intensive between religiously similar places and that religious diversity within regions is negatively correlated with road and rail density. As a secondary mechanism, I argue that regions with more religious diversity enjoyed greater competition in agricultural markets after the elimination of religious discrimination in land tenure institutions. The results support this hypothesis, showing that within regions, religious diversity is negatively correlated with grain prices. The findings highlight the importance of culture and institutions in economic development and are relevant for culturally diverse regional economies today.","[Walker, Sarah] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Walker, S (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",s.walker@unsw.edu.au,,"Walker, Sarah/0000-0002-8956-0359","NASA Land Use and Land Cover Change program [NNX11AE93G, NNX12AG74G]; NASA [NNX11AE93G, 76738, NNX12AG74G, 146250] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",NASA Land Use and Land Cover Change program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"I thank three anonymous referees whose helpful comments have improved the paper markedly.

Charter schools generate larger gains for disadvantaged students, but demand for charters is stronger among more advantaged students. Similarly, gains are inversely related to unobserved preferences for charters. As a result, counterfactual simulations indicate that charter expansion is likely to be most effective when accompanied by efforts to target students who are unlikely to apply.","[Walters, Christopher R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Walters, Christopher R.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Walters, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Walters, CR (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation; National Academy of Education/Spencer Dissertation Fellowship; Institute for Education Sciences [R305A120269],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Academy of Education/Spencer Dissertation Fellowship; Institute for Education Sciences,"I am grateful to Joshua Angrist, Aviva Aron-Dine, David Autor, David Card, David Chan, Sarah Cohodes, William Darrity Jr., Will Dobbie, Susan Dynarski, Maria Ferreyra, James Heckman, Patrick Kline, Michal Kurlaender, Bridget Terry Long, Magne Mogstad, Enrico Moretti, Christopher Palmer, Parag Pathak, Jesse Rothstein, Stephen Ryan, Steven Stern, Xiao Yu Wang, Tyler Williams, and seminar participants at the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management, the Becker Applied Economics Seminar at the University of Chicago, Cornell University, Duke University, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Mathematica Policy Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, the Spencer Foundation, the Stanford Graduate School of Business, the Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics, University of California Berkeley, Davis, and Los Angeles, the University of Chicago Harris School, the University of Michigan, the University of Virginia, Warwick University, and Western Economic Association International for useful comments.

We construct the material and social deprivation indices for each geographical area by applying principle component method on the major proxies of material and social deprivation. The empirical results indicate that life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy gaps between the groups at the ends of the advantaged-disadvantaged continuum are much greater when measured at the individual level. This applies to the population as a whole, to men and women, and to each area-based. Both versions of the index are associated with inequalities in mortality and disability, independent of each other. These findings suggest that material and social deprivation contributes independently to mortality and disability. This contribution increases gradually with the level of deprivation index. The present study may guide policy-makers in formulating conclusive public policies in future plantings to reduce social health inequalities in Tunisia.","[Younsi, Moheddine] Univ Gafsa, Higher Inst Business Adm, Gafsa, Tunisia; [Younsi, Moheddine] Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, St Sidi Ahmed Zarrouk,LP 2112, Gafsa, Tunisia; [Chakroun, Mohamed] Saudi Elect Univ, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Universite de Gafsa; Saudi Electronic University,"Younsi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gafsa, Higher Inst Business Adm, Gafsa, Tunisia.;Younsi, M (通讯作者)，Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, St Sidi Ahmed Zarrouk,LP 2112, Gafsa, Tunisia.",younsimoheddine@gmail.com; chahroun.mohamed2000@gmail.com,"Younsi, Moheddine/ABH-5792-2020; Chakroun, Mohamed/AAF-3344-2020","Younsi, Moheddine/0000-0002-8061-8534; Chakroun, Mohamed/0000-0002-6801-9344",,,,,30,4,4,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

We suggest a hybrid emission control policy pair, which combines a price (penalty) and a quantity control (emissions cap), and is efficient from the regulator's perspective. Regulated companies choose one of the lowest-cost policy options within the pool of efficient hybrid policy pairs, and the regulator also prefers the most popular policy option with the smallest political resistance from the industry. This theoretic analysis provides an opportunity for policymakers to design acceptable regulation structures.","[Yu, Jongmin] Hongik Univ, Dept Econ, 94 Wausan Ro, Seoul 121791, South Korea; [Ryu, Seokjong] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Econ, 111 Wuchuan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Hongik University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Yu, J (通讯作者)，Hongik Univ, Dept Econ, 94 Wausan Ro, Seoul 121791, South Korea.",yucono@hongik.ac.kr,,,Hongik University,Hongik University,"This research was supported by 2015 Hongik University.

Supply-side interventions that limit access to opioids may have the unintended consequence of increasing use of substitute drugs, including heroin. Exploiting cross-state variation in OxyContin exposure, we find that states with the highest initial rates of OxyContin misuse experienced the largest increases in heroin deaths.

We utilize data from GCC countries and their trading partners over the period of 1990:Q1-2014:Q4 to construct a new import cost index that captures changes in both foreign prices and exchange rates. The results indicate that inflation responses to positive shocks in import costs are larger than their responses to negative shocks, confirming the presence of an asymmetric impact of import costs on inflation. This result holds only when the external shocks occur in an Asian or North American country. Furthermore, the results indicate that shocks in import cost pass-through into inflation occur only in periods of economic expansion. According to these results, monetary policy makers should take into account the nature of the shock, the geographical origin of the shock and the state of the domestic business cycle when the shock occurs.","[Alsamara, Mouyad; Mrabet, Zouhair] Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Finance & Econ Dept, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Dombrecht, Michel] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium",Qatar University; University of Antwerp,"Alsamara, M (通讯作者)，Qatar Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Finance & Econ Dept, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.",malsamara@qu.edu.qa,"AL SAMARA, Mouyad/M-9499-2019","AL SAMARA, Mouyad/0000-0002-3753-1361",,,,,47,8,9,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This topic has not been explored thoroughly at the aggregate level, mainly due to endogeneity of remittances and the difficulty in finding instruments to resolve this issue. To address the endogeneity of remittances, I estimate bilateral remittances and use them to create weighted indicators of remittance-sending countries. These weighted indicators are used as instruments for remittance inflow to remittance-receiving countries. Results obtained in this study indicate that remittances raise per capita health expenditures and reduce undernourishment prevalence, depth of food deficit, prevalence of stunting, and child mortality rate. Remittances also raise school enrollment, school completion rate, and private school enrollment. Although there is no difference in the impact of remittances on the health outcome of boys and girls, remittances improve the educational outcome of girls more than the educational outcome of boys. Further, remittances decrease the female labor force participation rate but do not affect the male labor force participation rate.","[Azizi, SeyedSoroosh] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Azizi, S (通讯作者)，Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",sazizi1@niu.edu,"Azizi, Seyedsoroosh/AAK-4515-2021","Azizi, Seyedsoroosh/0000-0002-6651-9855",,,,,66,89,97,3,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

Using data from the Portuguese manufacturing sector, we find that: (1) firms with longer spells of activity in export destinations tend to ship larger quantities at lower prices; (2) older exporters tend to use more expensive inputs; (3) the volatility of output and input prices tends to decline with export experience; and (4) input prices and quantities tend to increase with revenue growth within firms. We develop a model of endogenous input and output quality choices in a learning environment that is able to account for these patterns.

Using a gravity approach to model trade for 66 countries over 24 years with a full set of fixed effects (source-year, target-year, source-target), we find that new connections between banks in a given country-pair lead to an increase in trade flows between these countries in the following year and to trade diversions from countries competing for similar imports. We conjecture that the mechanism for this effect is the role bank linkages play in reducing export risk and present evidence supporting this conjecture. In particular, using industry-level trade data and controlling for country-pair-year and industry fixed effects, we find that new bank linkages have larger impacts on trade in industries which tend to be subject to more export risk. For U.S. banks, we can show that bank linkages are positively associated with foreign letter of credit exposures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that insurgents undermine the state's mandate through electoral violence. We study insurgent violence during elections using newly declassified microdata on the conflict in Afghanistan. Our data track insurgent activity by hour to within meters of attack locations. Our results suggest that insurgents carefully calibrate their production of violence during elections to avoid harming civilians. Leveraging a novel instrumental variables approach, we find that violence depresses voting. Collectively, the results suggest insurgents try to depress turnout while avoiding backlash from harming civilians.

This definition relies on the assumption of free competition, which is not essential in defining long-period prices, the reproducibility of the economic system being the essential condition. A definition of long-period prices based only on reproducibility is then proposed and a model developed. The existence of long-period price vectors is obtained in a variety of situations yielding differential or uniform profits rates. Our analysis shows that the long-period approach is robust with respect to the elimination of the significant but problematic assumption of uniform profit rates. Our model provides also a formalization of Smith's view of domestic and international division of labour.","[D'Agata, Antonio] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Via Vittorio Emanuele 8, I-95131 Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"D'Agata, A (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dipartimento Sci Polit & Sociali, Via Vittorio Emanuele 8, I-95131 Catania, Italy.",adagata@unict.it,,,Universita di Catania [Fondi della Ricerca 2016-2018],Universita di Catania,"Universita di Catania, Grant/Award Number: Fondi della Ricerca 2016-2018",,42,3,4,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2018,69.0,4,,,,,847,861,,10.1111/meca.12221,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW3VZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446838300006,0

The data reveal substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, but even larger within-country heterogeneity. Across individuals, preferences vary with age, gender, and cognitive ability, yet these relationships appear partly country specific. At the country level, the data reveal correlations between preferences and biogeo-graphic and cultural variables, such as agricultural suitability, language structure, and religion. Variation in preferences is also correlated with economic outcomes and behaviors. Within countries and subnational regions, preferences are linked to individual savings decisions, labormarket choices, and prosocial behaviors. Across countries, preferences vary with aggregate outcomes ranging from per capita income, to entrepreneurial activities, to the frequency of armed conflicts.","[Falk, Armin] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Harvard Univ, BRIQ Inst Behav & Inequal, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Inst Labor Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Natl Bur Econ Res, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Bonn; Harvard University; Harvard University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Munich,"Falk, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",,,"Dohmen, Thomas/0000-0002-9321-0319",,,,,87,606,654,24,275,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

It is found that China's classified income tax is helpful to narrow the income gap. WIT plays a very important role in narrowing the income gap, with IBIT and OIT widening the income gap. Such income taxes, especially WIT, cause differences of the tax burden between taxpayers who have the same income amount. Uniform income tax is an indispensable measure to solve the problems. On the basis of the income tax systems of 13 countries, 16 different kinds of personal or household uniform income tax modes were built up. Namibia's household uniform income tax mode is practical to China, because the income adjustment effect of such mode is stronger than that of China's classified income tax, but the average tax rate of it is lower than that of China's classified income tax.","[Hua, Hu] Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Lequn N Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Nankai University,"Hua, H (通讯作者)，Nankai Univ, Sch Econ, Lequn N Rd, Tianjin, Peoples R China.",huhua2009@126.com,,,Project of Central Special Basic Research Business Funds in Nankai University: Research on the Performance Management Model of Local Budget in China [63172009]; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Tianjin in 2013: Research on Fundamental Transformation of Resource Utilization Mode [TJYY13-008]; National Social Science Funds: Reform of the Personal Income Tax under the Perspective of Behavioral Economics [14BJY167]; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy; Training Plan of 100 Young Academic Leaders in Nankai University; Training Project of University Innovation Team in Tianjin,Project of Central Special Basic Research Business Funds in Nankai University: Research on the Performance Management Model of Local Budget in China; Philosophy and Social Science Project of Tianjin in 2013: Research on Fundamental Transformation of Resource Utilization Mode; National Social Science Funds: Reform of the Personal Income Tax under the Perspective of Behavioral Economics; Collaborative Innovation Center for China Economy; Training Plan of 100 Young Academic Leaders in Nankai University; Training Project of University Innovation Team in Tianjin,"Financial support by Project of Central Special Basic Research Business Funds in Nankai University: Research on the Performance Management Model of Local Budget in China (No. 63172009), Philosophy and Social Science Project of Tianjin in 2013: Research on Fundamental Transformation of Resource Utilization Mode (TJYY13-008) and National Social Science Funds: Reform of the Personal Income Tax under the Perspective of Behavioral Economics (14BJY167).

Singapore was the 'core' of the region; Johor and Batam occupied the land, labour, and resource-intensive 'non-core' spaces. During the 1990s, investment flows into the three territories, particularly in the electrical and electronics (E&E) industry, mirrored this division of labour. Through scrutinising trends in E&E firm entries, nationality, and industry branch in Singapore, Johor, and Batam for the 1993-2012/14 period, this article sheds light on the recent evolution of the E&E sector in the Growth Triangle.

We measure bias using class-gender differences in scores between school exams graded by teachers and national exams graded blindly by external examiners. For identification, we rely on the random assignment of teachers and students to classes in primary schools. Our results suggest that assignment to a teacher with a greater bias in favor of girls (boys) has positive effects on girls' (boys') achievements. Such gender biases have also positive impact on girls' (boys') enrollment in advanced level math courses in high school. These results suggest that teachers' biased behavior at early stages of schooling has long run implications for occupational choices and earnings at adulthood, because enrollment in advanced courses in math and science in high school is a prerequisite for post-secondary schooling in engineering, computer science and so on.

Nevertheless, development finance institutions still lack sound and transparent metrics to assess their projects' exposure to climate risks and their impact on global climate action. To attempt to fill this gap, we develop a novel climate stress-test methodology for portfolios of loans to energy infrastructure projects. We apply the methodology to the portfolios of overseas energy projects of two main Chinese policy banks. We estimate their exposure to economic and financial shocks that would result in government inability to introduce timely 2 degrees C-aligned climate policies and from investors' inability to adapt their business to the changing climate and policy environment. We find that the negative shocks are mostly concentrated on coal and oil projects and vary across regions from 4.2 to 22 percent of the total loan value. Given the current leverage of Chinese policy banks, these losses could induce severe financial distress, with implications on macroeconomic and financial stability.","[Monasterolo, Irene] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Monasterolo, Irene] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zheng, Jiani I.; Battiston, Stefano] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland",Vienna University of Economics & Business; Boston University; University of Zurich,"Monasterolo, I (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.;Monasterolo, I (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",irenemon@bu.edu; isabelle.zheng@bf.uzh.ch; Stefano.battiston@uzh.ch,"battiston, stefano/M-1612-2017; battiston, stefano/I-2624-2012","battiston, stefano/0000-0002-0051-973X",Global Development Policy Center at Boston University; Swiss National Fund Professorship [PP00P1-144689]; EU H2020 project ISIGrowth [649186]; Institute of New Economic Thinking through the Task Force in Macroeconomic Efficiency and Stability,Global Development Policy Center at Boston University; Swiss National Fund Professorship; EU H2020 project ISIGrowth; Institute of New Economic Thinking through the Task Force in Macroeconomic Efficiency and Stability,"Irene Monasterolo (corresponding author), Assistant Professor, Vienna University of Economics and Business, Austria and Visiting Fellow, Boston University, USA.

This paper provides empirical evidence on a lesser studied impact of storage infrastructure, viz, agricultural yield. The author exploits potentially exogenous variation generated by the intensity of access to a capital investment subsidy program for construction and renovation of rural godowns in India to identify causal effects of better storage on yield. He finds that the program led to an increase in rice yield by 0.3 tons per hectare, approximately a 20% increase compared to the baseline. A potential mediating channel for such an effect would be reduced storage costs facilitating better investments in productive inputs. As supportive evidence, the author finds that fertilizer consumption increased by 21% in response to the intervention.","[Chatterjee, Somdeep] Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Business Environm Grp, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Lucknow,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management Lucknow, Business Environm Grp, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India.",somdeep@iiml.ac.in,,"Chatterjee, Somdeep/0000-0002-9825-2227",,,,,15,2,3,1,7,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,OCT 25,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,2018-65,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-65,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY7YN,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448834100001,0

The regressions, using a cross-country data between 1980 and 2015, show that a more equal distribution of education contributes significantly to reducing income inequality. Educational expansion is a major factor in reducing educational inequality and thus income inequality. Social benefits spending and price stability contribute to reducing income inequality, while public education spending helps to reduce educational inequality. In contrast, higher per capita income, greater trade openness and faster technological progress tend to make both income and education distribution more unequal. The calibration of empirical results shows that we can attribute the rising income inequality within East Asian economies in recent decades to the unequalizing effects of fast income growth and rapid progress in globalization and technological change, which have surpassed the income-equalizing effects from improved equality in the distribution of educational attainment.","[Lee, Jong-Wha] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Hanol] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Res Inst Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Korea University; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Lee, JW (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jongwha@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Hanol/ABB-3315-2020; Lee, Jong-Wha/I-1076-2016; Lee, Hanol/GYE-2205-2022","Lee, Hanol/0000-0003-2292-0919; Lee, Jong-Wha/0000-0002-3152-4961; Lee, Hanol/0000-0003-2292-0919",Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI); Korea University Grant [K1809161],Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI); Korea University Grant,"The authors thank Isaac Ehrlich, Bihong Huang, Dowon Kwak, Myongjin Kim, Peter Morgan, Naoyuki Yoshino, and seminar participants at the Asian Growth Research Institute and the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics for helpful comments.

To do that, we develop a dynamic CGE-microsimulation model that is able to reconcile the general equilibrium effects of the reform and the individual- and household-specific distributive effects. While the nature of the proposed reforms differs in the two countries, the study underscores the need, in both countries, for reform to generate fiscal savings to boost private investment and increase economic growth. It also shows that the reform alone would further exacerbate poverty through increased consumer prices. However, a modest reinvestment of fiscal savings into cash transfers creates a win-win scenario of reduced poverty without significantly sacrificing the fiscal and growth benefits from the reform. Impacts (prices, growth, fiscal savings, poverty) are greater in Egypt due to the extent of proposed reforms and the fact that a larger share of the energy products concerned are consumed directly by households, while in Jordan the major effects come from the increase in intermediate input costs which generate a fall in the aggregate demand and, so, in labor demand.","[Tiberti, Luca] PEP, Pavillon J-A DeSeve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; Univ Laval, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Tiberti, L (通讯作者)，PEP, Pavillon J-A DeSeve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.;Tiberti, L (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Dept Econ, Pavillon J-A DeSeve, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",luca.tiberti@ecn.ulaval.ca,,"Tiberti, Luca/0000-0003-2305-6704",Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP); Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom (or UK Aid); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC); UNICEF Egypt; CAPMAS; Ministry of Finance; Department of Statistics; Ministry of Social Development,Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP); Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom (or UK Aid); Government of Canada through the International Development Research Center (IDRC); UNICEF Egypt; CAPMAS; Ministry of Finance; Department of Statistics; Ministry of Social Development,"The analysis in Egypt was prevalently conducted in 2013 and in Jordan in 2014.

Global shapes that emerge are fully concave, fully convex, Reverse-S and S-shaped utility functions, using the certainty equivalence method for eliciting risk preferences. Investor clusters show existence of two types of investors, preference towards financial assets (bank deposits, insurance, pension and provident fund, shares and mutual funds) vs traditional assets (chit funds, gold and precious metals, real estate, postal savings, and government bonds). Investors with reverse-S and S-shaped utility functions prefer investment in financial assets, while investors with fully concave and fully convex utility functions prefer traditional assets. Prior studies suggest reverse-S and S-shaped category of investors perceive risk in terms of gains and losses, and financial assets with ready price quotes facilitate such buying and selling. In contrast, fully concave and fully convex utility functions prefer investment in traditional assets that requires long term horizon and stable risk preferences. Among demographics, males with reverse-S shaped utility function are more likely to invest in financial assets, and increase in dependents reduces the possibility to invest in financial assets.","[Ranganathan, Kavitha] TAPMI, Manipal, Karnataka, India",,"Ranganathan, K (通讯作者)，TAPMI, Manipal, Karnataka, India.",kavitha.r@tapmi.edu.in,,"Ranganathan, Kavitha/0000-0002-6877-9079",,,,,74,2,2,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

We argue that this result cannot be extrapolated to all industries: there is substantial heterogeneity regarding the effect of contract enforcement on exports. In particular, we empirically demonstrate that there is a disconnection between judicial quality and exporting in relationship-specific natural resource related industries. Due to the lack of input factor mobility, for such industries, the quality of contract enforcement cannot explain the pattern of trade, but rather other factors that are widely discussed in the literature. We discuss some relevant implications of this disconnection between judicial quality and relationship-specific industries in terms of the natural resource curse and the impact of natural resources trade on economic development.

The sender makes the most demanding voters indifferent between decisions, while the more lenient voters strictly benefit from persuasion. Under individual persuasion, evidence presented to each voter depends only on her state.

It employs sign restrictions to identify four external structural shocks - demand, supply, monetary and commodity shocks, and relates their impact to countries' policy and structural framework. External shocks account for a small share of the variance of GDP, especially at short horizons. However, their relative contribution has risen in recent decades, as the incidence of domestic shocks has declined. Global monetary shocks have become the leading external source of GDP volatility in developing countries. At short horizons, real and financial openness raise the share of volatility attributable to external shocks. At longer horizons, financial openness helps reduce the volatility contribution of global real shocks, but not that of global monetary shocks, thus augmenting the relative role of the latter. Commodity-intensive countries exhibit higher vulnerability to all types of external shocks, not just commodity shocks.","[Barrot, Luis-Diego; Calderon, Cesar; Serven, Luis] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Servén, L (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lserven@worldbank.org,,,,,,,31,20,20,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We argue that the difference between these estimates reflects the congestion externalities predicted by the search literature. Our estimates also indicate that entrepreneurship should be treated as a scarce factor in the determination of labor demand.

By making two key assumptions about the providers in such markets, namely that they are (partly) motivated and have decreasing marginal utility of income, we find, contrary to the existing literature, an unambiguously negative relationship between competition intensity and quality provision.

We distinguish between a non-tradable and a tradable sector which use human and physical capital. We show that the preference for non-tradable consumption in total consumption expenditure and sectoral productivities are crucial factors to determine which country does benefit from integration in terms of economic growth. Short-run and long-run effects of integration may differ, especially when countries are heterogeneous and when there exist high cross border externalities in education. Moreover, an impatient country may lose to integration when it has a comparative advantage in the tradable sector and/or when the preference for nontradable goods is high.","[Davin, Marion] Univ Montpellier, SupAgro, INRA, CEE M,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Gente, Karine; Nourry, Carine] Aix Marseille Univ, AMSE, Cent Marseille, EHESS,CNRS, Marseille, France",Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite,"Davin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, SupAgro, INRA, CEE M,CNRS, Montpellier, France.",marion.davin@umontpellier.fr; karine.gente@univ-amu.fr; carine.nourry@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0164-0704,1873-152X,,J MACROECON,J.

Because imperfect knowledge breaks Ricardian equivalence, the scale and composition of the public debt matter for inflation. High and moderate duration debt generates wealth effects on consumption demand that impairs the intertemporal substitution channel of monetary policy: aggressive monetary policy is required to anchor inflation expectations.

In this study, we tried to look from an empirical perspective, at the impact of governance through some internal mechanisms, on the performance of banks in a developing country like Tunisia. According to Kolsi and Ghorbel (2011), the effect of governance on the financial and stock market performance is still unknown. This result goes in the same direction as that of Adjaoud et al. (journal compilation 15, 2007), leading to the lack of connection between governance and traditional performance measures. The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of eight Tunisian commercial banks listed on the Stock Exchange over the period 2000-2011; we can conclude that there is no standard governance structure and that each bank should adopt the appropriate governance structure to improve the performance of the financial market, in general, and the banking market, in particular. The verification of this central assumption in the Tunisian context, therefore, is the fundamental contribution of this study. It is for this reason that the results we, even modest, have achieved allow enriching the issue of the impact of some governance variables varying according to the chosen performance measurement, which is a neglected theme in the Tunisian context.","[Hajer, Chenini; Anis, Jarboui] Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, Lab Rech Technol Informat Gouvernance & Entrepren, St Airport,Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia",Universite de Sfax; Universite de Monastir,"Hajer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sfax, Fac Econ & Management, Lab Rech Technol Informat Gouvernance & Entrepren, St Airport,Km 4-5,LP 1088, Sfax 3018, Tunisia.",hajer_chenini@yahoo.com; anisjarboui@yahoo.fr,"JARBOUI, Anis/AAX-3227-2021","JARBOUI, Anis/0000-0002-4811-6729",,,,,52,14,16,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

This grand concept is potentially of great significance for China's film industry, among others, which has been included as an important part of the national drive to expand China's cultural influence overseas. OBOR represents a great opportunity for China's film industry to shift the emphasis of its market segmentation from reliance on Western influences to a more Eastern orientation. Its promise of closer economic and cultural ties brings great international marketing potential. China's film industry should embrace this significant opportunity by further addressing the cultural variables in its overseas distribution, creating detailed national taste profiles. The synergic development of the Asian film industries can unlock resources, technology and a very large market, presenting both opportunities and challenges. This study quantifies the cultural distances (CDs) and differences in genre preference between China and other countries involved in the OBOR initiative, based on 2016 box-office data. The analysis reveals an absence of systematic and persistent correlation in CD and genre preference from country to country. In addition, the clustered distribution of genre preference within geographical boundaries makes cultural integration more directional.","[Hao Ye] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Lu Binwei] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Starkey, Guy] Bournemouth Univ, Poole, Dorset, England",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Durham University; Bournemouth University,"Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Media & Commun, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",haoye@sjtu.edu.cn,"Lu, Binwei/AAK-8019-2020","Lu, Binwei/0000-0002-3396-7635","Shanghai Jiao Tong University, intersection of Arts and Science [15JCMY04]","Shanghai Jiao Tong University, intersection of Arts and Science","This work is supported by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, intersection of Arts and Science 15JCMY04",,26,12,13,3,78,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

It combines semi-structured interviews with foreign exchange market participants in Brazil and London and advanced time-series econometrics. In line with Post Keynesian theory and critical realist ontology, the interviews uncover the context-specific expectations and underlying processes and structures that condition exchange rate dynamics in Brazil and emerging economies more generally. The results point to important structural changes in Brazil's financial integration in the form of currency internationalisation and financialisation. Moreover, they show that this internationalisation has been mediated through a structured and hierarchic international monetary system which fundamentally distinguishes exchange rate drivers in emerging economies from those in developed ones.","[Kaltenbrunner, Annina] Univ Leeds, Business Sch LUBS, Econ Div, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Kaltenbrunner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Business Sch LUBS, Econ Div, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",A.Kaltenbrunner@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,92,13,14,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper searches for empirical evidence to support this formulation. We show that travellers who indicate that a shorter trip duration is useful or a longer trip duration is very inconvenient have a higher value of travel time. Furthermore, we show that people who can spend their travel time usefully have a lower value of travel time. Finally, the availability of a computer, laptop etc. during the trip increases the probability of travel time being useful. This study determines the sizes of these effects in a case study for The Netherlands. This is important since the value of travel time is likely to change over time. The outcomes of this paper can be used to estimate the size of the expected reduction in value of travel time as a result of future comfort improvements that increase the possibility to work, read a book, watch a movie and communicate during a trip.","[Kouwenhoven, Marco; de Jong, Gerard] Significance, The Hague, Netherlands; [Kouwenhoven, Marco] Delft Univ Technol, Transport & Logist Grp, Delft, Netherlands; [de Jong, Gerard] Univ Leeds, ITS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Delft University of Technology; University of Leeds,"Kouwenhoven, M (通讯作者)，Significance, The Hague, Netherlands.",kouwenhoven@significance.nl,,,KiM Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment,KiM Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment,This work was funded by the KiM Netherlands Institute for Transport Policy Analysis of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment.,,30,32,37,1,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

This has particularly intensified debates on corporate social responsibility (CSR) not only between business people, but also between pieces of research, industry leaders and government representatives. The ongoing global ecologic crisis quickened discussions about how the alternation of macroeconomic business environment influences the development of CSR. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to investigate how the changes in macroeconomic business environment influence the development of socially responsible activities in Baltic Countries and Slovakia. Methods: A statistical analysis of secondary data was used in order to reanalyse the data for the purpose of gaining new insights. The objectives of statistical analysis in this paper were twofold: firstly, to identify the challenges in macroeconomic business environment; secondly, to explore the development of socially responsible activities in different countries. The research period covered the years 2006-2016. The choice of this period is determined by data availability. Findings & Value added: The authors found that economic conditions may diversely affect the development of different dimensions of CSR. Even in unfavourable macroeconomic conditions companies continue to be involved in socially responsible actions because of long-run CSR benefits. The analysis is useful at an international level because it justified the development of socially responsible businesses in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, and has provided an opportunity to assess the tendencies of CSR development during the different period of economic cycle.","[Krajnakova, Emilia] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Trencin, Slovakia; [Navickas, Valentinas; Kontautiene, Rima] Kaunas Univ Technol, Kaunas, Lithuania",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin; Kaunas University of Technology,"Navickas, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Gedimino Str 50-501, LT-4429 Kaunas, Lithuania.",valentinas.navickas@ktu.lt,"Navickas, Valentinas/I-9119-2018; Kontautiene, Rima/K-2158-2019; Navickas, Valentinas/GPX-0310-2022; Navickas, Valentinas/AAC-9651-2019","Kontautiene, Rima/0000-0002-2647-0110; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410; Navickas, Valentinas/0000-0002-7210-4410",,,,,32,39,39,4,23,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

This controversy continues today in the most recent work of three cliometricians, i.e. Fogel (post 1982) and Ashraf and Galor (2013). We focus on the theories of historical growth relying on biological explanations which have been formulated by these economists, from the specific angle of biological reductionism. We propose a methodological critique of their use of biological variables as determinants of the historical dynamics of economic growth. Based upon the transposition to the field of economics of Ernst Mayr's distinction between functional and evolutionary biology and his definitions of reductionism, we argue that despite some similarities, the questions raised by Fogel's and Ashraf & Galor's theories are of distinct nature. Nonetheless, we stress the need for a careful examination of the biological mechanisms supporting these researches.","[Leviaux, Pierre] Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, LAET, LAST ISH, 14 Ave Berthelot, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Parent, Antoine] IEP Lyon, LAET, Lyon, France",Universite Lyon 2,"Leviaux, P (通讯作者)，Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, LAET, LAST ISH, 14 Ave Berthelot, F-69007 Lyon, France.",pierre.leviaux@laet.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr,"Leviaux, Pierre/HNC-2920-2023","Leviaux, Pierre/0000-0001-8358-570X; PARENT, Antoine/0000-0001-5087-9488",,,,,51,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Using matching with difference-in-differences to address the self-selection bias, we find that inflation targeting has led to a 3-6 percentage point reduction in the foreign currency share of international debt in targeting countries when compared to non-targeting countries, with the effect especially pronounced for sovereign international debt. Differentiating by type of owner, we find a reduction of the foreign currency share in foreign-held total sovereign debt but no effect on domestic-held debt. Furthermore, from the analysis of the US dollar and euro shares, we find that inflation targeting has contributed to a 9 percentage points lower dollar share in international debt in targeting countries compared to non-targeting countries, while the effect on the euro share is negligible. This not only provides evidence that the structural features of international financial markets matter, but also that monetary policy can help developing countries reduce their reliance on foreign currency debt, especially if it is held by foreign investors.

Firms choose incentive compatible mechanisms in which consumers report their utility types; consumption of the good and payments of the numeraire are continuous functions of the reports. Uniform price auctions with reserve prices, reinterpreted as direct mechanisms, are not consistent with equilibrium. However, modified auctions without reserve prices but with type-specific entry fees do constitute an equilibrium of the competing mechanisms game under additional regularity assumptions. When all firms announce fixed prices at the perfectly competitive level, this profile also constitutes an equilibrium of the competing mechanisms game. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The following mini-symposium reflects on three articles that were published by the RRPE during its, and Union for Radical Political Economics' (URPE), first fifty years. These articles are examples of the RRPE's seminal works that affected, and continue to affect, the literature of heterodox economics in various ways. The authors of these articles were asked to provide their reflections on them. This article provides a foundation for appreciating those contributionsboth old and new. In our 1975 RRPE article, we assessed Marx's reserve army thesis that sustained low unemployment in cycle expansions causes labor's share of income to rise, the profit rate to fall and the expansion to end. We found it to be empirically valid. We argued that pro-capitalist macro policy was designed to minimize the profit-squeeze effect. Here, we present evidence that in the neoliberal era the profit-squeeze effect has weakened, primarily because antilabor macro policy normally prohibits sustained full employment, and the reserve army is now globally constituted. The one neoliberal-era expansion with sustained low unemployment did exhibit a strong profit squeeze. The conclusions of the New Interpretation of Marx's theory of value and exploitation follow from the long-period method Marx adopts from Smith and develops. The equalization of the rate of exploitation, the ratio of labor effort to the money wage, through the mobility of labor implies the conservation of unpaid labor time as surplus value. Later critics and defenders of Marx's theory of value neglect the central role of money in Marx's conception, as well as the connection between Marx's theory of value and the long-period method. The inverse transformation problem encapsulates the central idea of Marx's theory. This reflection offers comments about The Financial and Economic Crisis of 2008: A Systemic Crisis of Neoliberal Capitalism, Review of Radical Political Economics 41 (3), Summer 2009. It was written for a symposium with authors of past articles in the Review of Radical Political Economics for the fiftieth anniversary special issue of the Review of Radical Political Economics.","[Schroeder, Susan K.] Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Boddy, Raford] San Diego State Univ, Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Crotty, James] Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Foley, Duncan K.] New Sch Social Res, Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Kotz, David M.] Univ Massachusetts, Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Sydney; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; The New School; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Schroeder, SK (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",susan.schroeder@sydney.edu.au; rboddy@mail.sdsu.edu; jrcrotty@comcast.net; foleyd@newschool.edu; dmkotz@comcast.net,,"Schroeder, Susan/0000-0002-5780-219X",,,,,38,0,0,2,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

This paper tests this theory using aggregate cross-sectional data for Great Britain for the period May 2001 to December 2014. Descriptive analysis found the relationship between sanctions and labour market outcomes was ambiguous, while trends in labour market outcomes were highly correlated with labour market demand. Multivariate SVAR time-series analysis, controlling for labour market demand, found evidence that changes in the threat and use of sanctions had a positive impact on flows into work in the short run but not in the long term, and had no definitive impact on ILO unemployment at all. Interrupted time-series analyses suggest we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the impact of introduction of a new JSA sanctions regime in October 2012 (with higher financial penalties associated with being sanctioned) had no impact on flows into work from JSA. In Britain, intensifying the use of sanctions and introducing harsher penalties associated with being sanctioned has been largely ineffective at increasing flows from JSA into sustainable employment. Given the negative financial and social impacts of sanctions on those affected, and the lack of evidence of a sustained positive impact on employment, the basis for the new sanctions policy is unclear.","[Taulbut, Martin; McCartney, Gerry] NHS Hlth Scotland, Publ Hlth Sci Directorate, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Mackay, Daniel F.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing Publ Hlth & Hlth Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Taulbut, M (通讯作者)，5 Cadogan St, Glasgow G2 6QE, Lanark, Scotland.",martintaulbut@nhs.net,,"McCartney, Gerry/0000-0001-6341-3521",,,,,37,14,15,1,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Market orientation is an approach aimed at external and internal elements and activities leading to performance increase. Services offered by a manufacturer are activities complementing their products. Manufacturers can benefit from the service differentiation and use it to design alternative marketing strategies. Generally, IFC and services - contributes to higher positive effect on business performance. For this reason, it is interesting to know if synergy of IFC and services have a higher positive effect on business performance. Purpose of the article: This article aims to determine how IFC and services at manufacturing companies in the Czech Republic influence business performance. The research question is as follows: Does the synergy of IFC and services in companies producing electrical equipment and electronic components have a higher positive effect on business performance? Methods: Sixty SME's filled in a questionnaire to gather inhumation about IFC and services. for measurement of correlation for two variables, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was chosen. Regression analysis was used for measuring the synergy. Findings & Value added: The main finding shows that the synergy of the quantities observed has not been confirmed, although some of the following relations were approved such as a positive relationship between: a) some items of IFC and items of business performance, b) some items of services and items of business performance and c) items of IFC and items of services. The result of the paper shows further consequences of IFC and services in today's manufacturing companies.","[Tomaskova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Brno, Czech Republic; [Kanovska, Lucie; Bednar, Josef] Brno Univ Technol, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Brno University of Technology,"Tomásková, E (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Law, Dept Financial Law & Econ, Veveri 70, Brno 61180, Czech Republic.",eva.tomaskova@law.muni.cz,"Tomaskova, Eva/D-3973-2014; Bednář, Josef/D-9350-2013; Kanovska, Lucie/AGA-2051-2022","Kanovska, Lucie/0000-0003-2797-7973",,,,,58,0,1,0,6,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

Some interesting conclusions are achieved. First, the CSR firm always produces more than the PM firm. Second, the outputs of both firms (the consumer surplus) under the PM firm's leading position are larger than those under Cournot. Third, the profits of both firms (producer surplus) under the PM firm playing the leading position are less than those under Cournot. Surprisingly, when the PM firm first moves, the PM firm's profits are the lowest while the CSR firm's outputs are the highest in all three cases.

Drawing on fieldwork conducted between 2014 and 2015, the paper explores the varieties of existing Chinese manufacturing investment and the sectors into which Chinese companies are investing. We demonstrate in this paper that Chinese manufacturing investment in Africa is indeed expanding rapidly, yet the official data on investment approvals, both in China and in African countries, significantly overstates the actual number of investments in operation. Several investors do fit the model of Akamatsu's` flying geese': large firms seeking new locations for production as part of global networks and value chains. However, we also identified three other kinds of 'geese': large, strategic, local market-seeking geese; raw material-seeking geese; and small geese travelling together in flocks.

We find a statistically significant, positive association between the share of legislators who attended their states' public institutions and state funding for their entire public higher-education system. We also find a similar positive relationship between the share of state legislators who attended particular campuses of the state's public university system and funding for those campuses. This relationship is more pronounced among publicly educated legislators who represent legislative districts close to their alma mater's district, and becomes most consequential when the legislator's district contains his or her alma mater. We discuss the implications of our findings for academic studies on how politics and legislators' personal experiences influence support for higher education. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The findings are robust to alternative explanations and to common threats to causal identification. Further exploration reveals that our estimates capture a greater reluctance of foundation firms to initiate or rapidly increase shareholder payouts, but not a greater tendency to reduce or eliminate shareholder payouts. Additional analyses suggest managers direct funds that would have been paid out toward executive compensation and capital investment. In light of the fact that firms with foundations are more likely to exhibit a high degree of managerial entrenchment, we interpret these findings as evidence that foundations are both a sign of and vehicle for managerial self-dealing.

Using data for 15 states over the period 1980-2014, we find no evidence that increases in MP salaries are influenced by election cycles. Politicians can increase their salaries at any point during the legislative period without negative consequences. We posit that this may be because even those voters who are most disenchanted with politics likely understand that all politicians benefit from a salary increase and thus do not punish the governing party at the polls.","[Kauder, Bjoern; Krause, Manuela] Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany; [Potrafke, Niklas] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Kauder, B (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany.",kauder@ifo.de,,,,,,,82,3,3,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

Normatively, decision makers should be sensitive to inflation rates when evaluating delayed rewards because the value of a delayed outcome is eroded by inflation. We hypothesised that participants from countries with direct experience of high inflation would be particularly sensitive to inflation rates when making intertemporal choices; i.e. they may be more likely to take into consideration the effect of inflation on future rewards. This study compares intertemporal choices of participants from countries with dramatically different histories of inflation: Argentina and Britain. Participants completed a delay discounting task under two inflation rate conditions (2% and 20%, between subjects). We found that people discounted future rewards more steeply under the 20% inflation rate condition than under the 2% condition. Participants from Argentina, the country with much higher current and historical inflation rates, discounted future rewards more steeply in both inflation rate conditions than participants from the UK.

Rather, the data are more consistent with a demand-side explanation of weakening global economic conditions and demand for commodities, including but not limited to oil. In summary, there is no evidence that the U.S. shale revolution played a significant role in the decline in oil prices since 2014. Rather, the evidence suggests that weakening oil demand played a much stronger role in driving the 2014 decline in oil prices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model also implies path dependence in the evolution of adolescent marriage practices over time and persistent effects on marriage practices from transitory shocks.

Indeed, energy use gives rise to greenhouse gas emissions, which are undesirable side-products of economic growth. In this paper, we present a non-radial multi-sector nonparametric production-frontier approach specially tailored for addressing this issue. Our approach is consistent with previous works and in line with recent policy and regulation implementations. We also make use of second-stage country- and sector-level regression analyses to investigate how the efficiency results are affected by exogenous factors. We apply our method to the case of 10 sectors in 19 European countries. Our results highlight the need for policy and regulation implementations for each sector individually. Indeed, our efficiency and regression results show that there exists a sector heterogeneity and that the room for increasing economic growth/reducing greenhouse gas emissions is clearly different for each sector in every country. Finally, our results highlight two sectors: 1) Agriculture and 2) Electricity, Gas and Water, and that the Europe 2020 objectives are well set since they target the most inefficient countries/sectors.

We further show that compared with the simultaneous first-price auction, the leader's optimal commitment yields the same net utility benefit to both of these bidders. As a result, the two highest valued bidders' incentives are aligned, facilitating coordination and implementation of the commitment.

These groups can have an effect on the process of law enforcement by making upfront investments, such as bribes. We also investigate consequences when a policy maker acts to maximize a bribe instead of social welfare. Thus, this paper presents an inclusive framework for incorporating private law enforcement, corruption and avoidance activities. This article shows that this competition can lead to moderate and more efficient law enforcement activities. This indicates that inefficient law enforcement by authority with harm reduction motivation can be avoided. Additionally, this paper shows that depending on the policy maker's objection between rent-seeking motivation or social welfare maximizer, deterrence effects vary. This paper provides a clear mechanism that the rent-seeking motivated policy maker tends to set less severe enforcement policies than the social welfare level.","[Yahagi, Ken] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan",Waseda University,"Yahagi, K (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishiwaseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",yhgkn@moegi.waseda.jp,,"Yahagi, Ken/0000-0003-2717-5129",,,,,29,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The setting is a pooling equilibrium with three clusters of successive income groups, each cluster having its own present-consumption standard and rank in the present-consumption distribution. In this way the analysis addresses the saving behaviour and welfare of three social classes: the lower, middle and upper class. Explanations are found for the Easterlin paradox and the Kuznets consumption puzzle and it is concluded that rank concerns tend to strengthen the case for more income equality and weaken the standard effect of inequality on aggregate saving.","[Haagsma, Rein] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Haagsma, R (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Wageningen, Netherlands.",rein.haagsma@wur.nl,,,,,,,42,0,1,1,10,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 23,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201846,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-46,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO0UW,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439659400001,0

Indeed, the Swedish economy has responded to the global financial crisis (GFC) in what appears to be a successful manner. This comparativist literature nevertheless omits in-depth analysis of the impact of financialisation, partly due to its neglect of long-term, dialectical processes of change (cf. Ogden et al., 2014). There is a small literature on financialisation in Sweden (e.g. Belfrage, 2008; Forslund, 2008; Kallifatides et al., 2010; Ryner, 2013; Belfrage, 2015; Andersson and Jonung, 2015; Kallifatides, 2016). However, it has not clarified what the dynamics, contradictions and crisis-tendencies of the resulting finance-dominated accumulation regime in Sweden are. Drawing on document analysis and statistics, and based on Regulation Theory (e.g. Aglietta, 1979), this paper does just that. It thus corrects an overly idealised picture of Swedish economy and society, as well as, more broadly, holding the Swedish case up as a critical case study for the sustainability of the financedominated growth regime in Europe. We argue that there is a looming crisis in the Swedish economy today, as the acceleration of financialisation following the GFC is shifting the economy away from being export-led to becoming debt-led and assetbased, and thus moving the economy closer to the UK and US economies. As such, the Swedish case suggests that the finance-dominated growth regime may be unsustainable in Europe more generally.","[Belfrage, Claes] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Chatham St, Chatham L69 7ZH, Kent, England; [Kallifatides, Markus] Stockholm Sch Econ, Ctr Governance & Management, Box 6501, SE-11383 Stockholm, Sweden",University of Liverpool; Stockholm School of Economics,"Belfrage, C (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Chatham St, Chatham L69 7ZH, Kent, England.",c.belfrage@liverpool.ac.uk; Markus.Kallifatides@hhs.se,"Kallifatides, Markus/AAT-7634-2020","Kallifatides, Markus/0000-0002-2039-0339",,,,,85,25,26,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

For the first case, the surplus to sharing information increases with higher volatility of profit flow and lower uncertainty about the investment cost. For the second case, this surplus grows with both mentioned types of uncertainty.","[Dehghani, Mohammad H.] Univ Tehran, Fac Econ, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran,"Dehghani, MH (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Fac Econ, Tehran, Iran.",mh.dehghani@ut.ac.ir,"Dehghani, Mohammad/N-2748-2017","Dehghani, Mohammad/0000-0002-7763-9940",,,,,22,0,0,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

To this end, we derive and estimate a New Keynesian DSGE model embodying a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function for both areas. Our main findings are: (i) capital-augmenting progress is the main source of technical change volatility; (ii) labor-augmenting shocks give a negligible contribution to the variance of output; (iii) technical change (of both types) explains more economic fluctuations in the U.S. than in the euro area; and (iv) historical decomposition of GDP growth over our sample period (1980-2008) shows that capital-augmenting progress is one of the key drivers of the business cycle.","[Di Pietro, Marco; Saltari, Enrico] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Di Pietro, M (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",marco.dipietro@uniroma1.it; enrico.saltari@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,39,0,0,2,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

When firms of the same type share the same brand name, consumers have more observations of past quality and are able to predict quality with greater precision than if brands are private. This effect increases firms' incentive to invest in quality. On the other hand, a shared brand name may motivate free riding on the group's reputation, reducing incentives to invest.

We now consider price dependent incomes, and provide new necessary and sufficient conditions for the ULD to hold for a consumer in an exchange economy. Like Franks and Bryant (2017), these conditions avoid unobservables such as preferences or utility and hence are 'Revealed Preference' in character. Our Theorem 1 establishes that consumers in an exchange economy satisfy the ULD if and only if they consume exactly and only their initial endowment. Interestingly, unless a consumer lives in a state of personal autarky, there will always be a price variation for which their behaviour violates the ULD.

The paradox of debt challenges the very foundation of Minsky's FIH as it maintains that the upward and downward phases of business cycles need not be characterized by processes of respective leveraging and deleveraging. Using a panel of firm-level data and seemingly unrelated regressions we analyse the relationship between debt and investment for 12 Latin American countries for the years 2005 (expansion) and 2009 (contraction). We reject the paradox of debt in favor of the FIH, regardless of our model specification or the choice of external financing. The FIH seems to intensify in expansions with respect to recessions, and its intensification during expansions is explained by a larger fraction of firms acquiring debt and new investment projects, rather than from further leveraging for those firms already engaged in fixed investment.","[Gonzalez, Alejandro] Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Perez-Caldentey, Esteban] ECLAC UN, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"González, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Santiago, Chile.",Agonzalezc@fen.uchile.cl; esteban.perez@eclac.org,"Gonzalez, Alejandro/IXN-9088-2023",,,,,,39,1,2,0,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Technology choice can also indirectly affect environmental performance. We assess the impact of import competition on plants' environmental outcomes. In particular, exploiting a unique combination of Mexican plant-level and satellite imagery data, we measure the effect of tariff changes due to free-trade agreements on three main outcomes: plants' fuel use, plants' abatement expenditures, and measures of air pollution around plants' location. Our findings show that import competition induced plants in Mexico to increase energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and in turn reduce direct investment in environmental protection. Our findings suggest that the general technology upgrading effect of any policy could be an important determinant of environmental performance in developing countries and that this effect may not be captured in abatement data.","[Gutierrez, Emilio] ITAM, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Teshima, Kensuke] ITAM CIE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico; Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Teshima, K (通讯作者)，ITAM CIE, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",emilio.gutierrez@itam.mx; kensuke.teshima@itam.mx,,,Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura,Asociacion Mexicana de Cultura,"All analysis of confidential data was carried out in accordance with Mexican confidentiality laws.

Recent empirical literature has consistently pointed out that consumers may not be good forecasters of their future consumption needs, and may suffer from overestimation or underestimation biases. This paper considers consumers who are heterogeneous in their expected demands arising from heterogeneity in their biases about their forecasted consumption needs. We show that the optimal menu of two-part pricing in this case leads to the lower-expected demand segment getting exactly the same surplus on the average as the higher-expected demand segment, or the higher-expected demand segment getting even lower surplus on the average than the lower-expected demand segment. We show directions of externalities these unbiased, positively-biased, and negatively-biased segments impose on one another, and how they can be different under no price discrimination, and second- and third-degree price discrimination.","[Kolay, Sreya; Tyagi, Rajeev K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Tyagi, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Paul Merage Sch Business, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",skolay@uci.edu; rktyagi@uci.edu,"Tyagi, Rajeev/AFU-5630-2022","Tyagi, Rajeev/0000-0003-2514-4679",,,,,20,0,0,2,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

We first show a lower bound of 2 - 1/n for the scheduling problem with n unrelated machines (formulated as a mechanism design problem in the seminal paper of Nisan and Ronen on Algorithmic Mechanism Design). Our lower bound applies to universally-truthful randomized mechanisms, regardless of any computational assumptions on the running time of these mechanisms. Moreover, it holds even for the wider class of truthfulness in-expectation mechanisms. We then turn to Bayesian settings and show a lower bound of 1.2 for Bayesian Incentive Compatible (BIC) mechanisms. No lower bounds for truthful mechanisms in multidimensional settings which incorporate randomness were previously known. Next, we define the workload-minimization problem in networks. We prove lower bounds for the inter-domain routing setting presented by Feigenbaum, Papadimitriou, Sami, and Shenker.

In this paper we provide a new proof for this remarkable result, based on four steps. We first show that extensive-form rationalizability can be characterized by the iterated application of a special reduction operator, the strong belief reduction operator. We next prove that this operator satisfies a mild version of monotonicity, which we call monotonicity on reachable histories. This property is used to show that for this operator, every possible order of elimination leads to the same set of outcomes. We finally show that backward induction yields a possible order of elimination for the strong belief reduction operator. These four properties together imply Battigalli's theorem.

I construct a rich but tractable general equilibrium model with overlapping generations of heterogeneous individuals, two sectors of production and a government. I derive analytically how fertility choices are affected by changes in household resources and child subsidies and show the numerical results of two policy experiments. A subsidy on childcare favors the birth rates of educated, high-wage individuals. Parents work more so that the subsidy program is partly financed by a rise in labor earnings. In contrast, a lump-sum child allowance stimulates fertility of uneducated, low-wage parents the most. This policy has a larger effect on the average birth rate, but as parents perform most of the care themselves it comes at the expense of a lower supply of labor and a greater tax burden.","[Reijnders, Laurie S.

Some examples include warfare between countries, competition between political parties, team-incentives within firms, and rent-seeking. In order to succeed, members of the same group have incentives to cooperate with each other by expending effort. However, since effort is costly, each member also has an incentive to abstain from expending any effort and instead free ride on the efforts of other members. Contest theory predicts that the intensity of competition between groups and the amount of free riding within groups depend on the group size, sharing rule, group impact function, contest success function, and heterogeneity of players. We review experimental studies testing these theoretical predictions. Most studies find significant over-expenditure of effort relative to the theory and significant heterogeneity of behavior within and between groups. Also, most studies find support for the comparative statics predictions of the theory (with the exception of the group size paradox). Finally, studies show that there are effective mechanisms that can promote within-group cooperation and conflict resolution mechanisms that can de-escalate and potentially eliminate between-group conflict.","[Sheremeta, Roman M.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Sheremeta, Roman M.] Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Chapman University System; Chapman University,"Sheremeta, RM (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.;Sheremeta, RM (通讯作者)，Chapman Univ, Orange, CA 92866 USA.",rms246@case.edu,,,,,,,147,49,50,3,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Hoping to create better and stronger contributions by higher education institutions to the knowledge society, many governments nowadays develop policies of less state control and more autonomy. This contribution focuses on current higher education policies in Lithuania and in Mykolas Romeris University. The paper highlights the economic and social benefits of partnership with universities and public institutions, when this activity may allow a successful achievement of public policy objectives. It is also very important that the university gives attention to public service needs. This relationship with their external environment is one of the dimensions of universities' mission that has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. The academic potential at the university, as specialists of social sciences, law and humanities, corresponding to the highest professional requirements, should be ready to fulfil the needs for society. The stakeholders can use the academic potential for organizing staff training. The cooperation is mutually beneficial: academic staff gain practical knowledge, deepen their experience and establish contacts outside the university. The experience of many institutions indicates that this dimension of service to society is an important part of universities activities.

The policy-maker is assumed to maximise an objective function expressed in terms of a number of aggregate variables, including the excess burden of taxation and a desired debt ratio. Tax policy changes have feedback effects, as a result of incentives and other endogenous influences that impose constraints on the efficacy of those policies.

Comparing lending to the same firm, we find that domestic banks reduced credit supply, increased interest rates on credit granted, and lowered the probability of accepting loan applications more than foreign banks, which were less affected by the sovereign crisis. The credit contraction is the consequence of a largely country-specific effect, not explained by heterogeneity in bank characteristics, but associated to a generalized increase in the cost of funding of Italian banks.

Despite the importance that has been given to this phenomenon, inequalities regarding the ability to trigger and manage the entrepreneurial activity remain. This research aims to describe and account for the entrepreneurship levels, particularly in order to understand what leads certain countries' individuals to display higher levels of initiative to manage or create a high-growth business. In order to achieve this goal, a research program that includes annual assessments of entrepreneurial activity levels in several countries has been used-The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), which is, currently, one of the main international research databases aiming to describe, analyse and compare the entrepreneurial process in a wide range of countries. The database studied in this work is the 2011 NES, containing 144 variables in which 136 are qualitative (97 ordinal qualitative and 39 nominal qualitative). The data were analysed transforming the ordinal qualitative variables in ordinal quantitative, where the answers were given in a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The sample of the database consists of 1852 national and regional entrepreneurship experts selected on the basis of reputation and experience (through a convenience sample approach). Our research used several multivariate analysis techniques, in particular the multiple linear regression analysis, the cluster analysis and the discriminant analysis. In general, our conclusions suggest that individuals who react quickly to opportunities seem to display better abilities of time management and are more willing to start a business. Our results also show that the national culture does not influence the individual ability of managing the personal life.","[Braga, Vitor; Queiros, Maria; Correia, Aldina; Braga, Alexandra] Polytech Porto, Ctr Innovat & Res Business Sci & Informat Syst CI, Rua Curral, P-4610156 Margaride, Felgueiras, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Braga, V (通讯作者)，Polytech Porto, Ctr Innovat & Res Business Sci & Informat Syst CI, Rua Curral, P-4610156 Margaride, Felgueiras, Portugal.",vbraga@estg.ipp.pt; 8120111@estg.ipp.pt; aic@estg.ipp.pt; abraga@estg.ipp.pt,"Correia, Aldina/B-3368-2009; Braga, Alexandra M/B-9292-2018; Braga, Vitor/W-3289-2019","Correia, Aldina/0000-0002-4693-4867; Braga, Alexandra M/0000-0001-7548-9785; Braga, Vitor/0000-0002-3644-3992","FEDER component of the European Structural and Investment Funds, through the Operational Competitiveness and Internationalisation Programme's (COMPETE) [006971 (UID/SOC/04011)]; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) [UID/SOC/04011/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/SOC/04011/2013] Funding Source: FCT","FEDER component of the European Structural and Investment Funds, through the Operational Competitiveness and Internationalisation Programme's (COMPETE); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This research is supported by the FEDER component of the European Structural and Investment Funds, through the Operational Competitiveness and Internationalisation Programme's (COMPETE 2020) Project No. 006971 (UID/SOC/04011) and the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology's (Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia) UID/SOC/04011/2013 Project.

Second, following a fiscal expansion, increasing returns to specialization lead to a positive linkage between real wages and aggregate output, while decreasing returns to specialization result in a negative relationship between real wages and aggregate output.

For policy analysis in such a context, global multi-country macroeconomic models that allow a structural interpretation are needed. In this paper we introduce the European Central Bank's global macroeconomic model: ECB-Global, a semi-structural, global multi-country model for the euro area, the US, Japan, the UK, China, oil-exporting economies, Emerging Asia and a rest-of-the-world block. ECB-Global features rich channels of international shock propagation through trade, oil prices and global financial markets. We illustrate the range of applications of ECB-Global in the context of policy analysis by presenting its predictions for global spillovers from a US monetary policy tightening, a growth slowdown in China, and a drop in oil prices. In contrast to many existing structural models, ECB-Global implies large spillovers from US monetary policy and oil price shocks, which transmit through trade and financial cross-border interlinkages. Compared to these shocks, ECB-Global does not imply large spillovers from a slowdown in China, primarily because of the latter's still limited integration in global financial markets. We also illustrate how ECB-Global can be modified flexibly in order to address evolving questions relevant for policy makers by adding new features in an ad hoc manner.","[Dieppe, Alistair; Georgiadis, Georgios; Ricci, Martino; Van Robays, Ine; van Roye, Bjorn] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Dieppe, A (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany.",alistair.dieppe@ecb.europa.eu; georgios.georgiadis@ecb.europa.eu; martino.ricci@ecb.europa.eu; ine.van-robays@ecb.europa.eu; bjorn.van_roye@ecb.europa.eu,,,,,,,52,8,10,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

This percentage heuristic can lead to different levels of portfolio risk when the same investor is presented with a more or a less risky asset. Using four experiments, we show that asking investors to choose the return distribution for their portfolio while keeping the exact portfolio weights unknown leads to greater similarity in levels of portfolio volatility (across different levels of risk of the risky asset) than asking investors to choose this distribution while additionally facing the portfolio weights. Higher consistency in risk taking is obtained both between and within test subjects.","[Ehm, Christian] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Laudenbach, Christine] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; [Weber, Martin] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany; [Weber, Martin] CEPR London, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim; Goethe University Frankfurt; University of Mannheim,"Laudenbach, C (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.",laudenbach@finance.uni-frankfurt.de,"Weber, Martin/JLL-7207-2023; Weber, Martin/GPW-6095-2022",,Karin Islinger Stiftung,Karin Islinger Stiftung,"We thank Peter Bossaert, Christopher Hrdlicka, Annika Kasparek, Christoph Merkle, Florian Muenkel, Alexandra Niessen-Ruenzi, Andrew Siegel, Stephan Siegel, Olga Tyurina, and Stefan Zeisberger for helpful comments and discussions.

In this study we explore the strength of the relationship between current account imbalances, credit growth and equity returns at global level and document new evidence of a recurring sequencing pattern ahead of global crisis periods where credit booms are preceded by growing external imbalances, and crisis episodes occur at the low end of the contraction phase of equity returns. We use this information to construct a single aggregate measure with the aim of signaling periods of increasing risk of macroeconomic and financial instability at global level. Three major crisis episodes are identified with our global crisis index: the 1929 crisis, the breakdown of the Bretton-Woods system and the recent financial crisis. Since past global crisis episodes at international level culminated with the collapse of existing international monetary systems, the ongoing debate on the reforms needed to enhance the stability of international financial markets indicates the recent global financial crisis as a major turning point in the evolution of the international financial and monetary system.

We are the first to provide estimates that are representative of the internet-using population and cover multiple countries. Based on an online questionnaire with almost 30,000 respondents, we document that one unpaid (first) viewing of a movie displaces about 0.37 units of paid viewings. Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, we show that this implies that unpaid movie viewings reduced movie sales in Europe by about 4.4% during the sample period. Lost sales differ substantially by country: they are in the range of 1.65% for Germany and 10.4% for Spain. We also document that 94% of lost sales are due to unpaid viewings by a small group of only 20% of consumers. This implies that well targeted policies have the most potential to prevent damages of movie piracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Firms can either be profit-maximizing or socially concerned, also pursuing consumer welfare. We use an indirect evolutionary approach to distinguish between the endogenous, profit-maximizing choice of the firms' business objectives and their corresponding market behavior. Our main result is that the prospects of long run survival of firms pursuing social strategies strongly depends on the number of firms in the industry. If a social strategy entails higher marginal production costs, it is best suited if the number of firms in the industry is not too large. In particular, we demonstrate that the relation between long survival and the level of competitiveness of the industry is inverse U-shaped. We confirm this result by using the concept of coalition stability and further show that if a high number of firms adopt a social strategy, welfare might be lower than with just profit-maximizing firms.

The analysis considers the Brazilian case. Brazil is an interesting case study once it presents serious problems of public accounts deterioration, and in addition it had the president of the republic removed from its position since she was condemned on the charge of having committed crimes of fiscal responsibility. The estimates are made through ordinary least squares, one-step generalized method of moments and two-step generalized method of moments. In order to give robustness to the results, the study also provides estimates through an autoregressive distributed lag modeling approach (ARDL). Besides, in order to dynamically analyze the relationships between discretionary fiscal policy and disagreements in expectations about fiscal variables, we present an impulse response analysis based on vector autoregressive (VAR) estimates. The results indicate that the adoption of discretionary fiscal policies increases the disagreement in expectations about fiscal variables, and thus creates uncertainties about the future behavior of both the public debt and the budget balance.","[Montes, Gabriel Caldas] Fluminense Fed Univ, Dept Econ, Rua Alexandre Moura,Bloco F,8 Sao Domingos, BR-24210200 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Montes, Gabriel Caldas] Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Rua Alexandre Moura,Bloco F,8 Sao Domingos, BR-24210200 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Luna, Paulo Henrique] Univ Candido Mendes, Dept Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Montes, GC (通讯作者)，Fluminense Fed Univ, Dept Econ, Rua Alexandre Moura,Bloco F,8 Sao Domingos, BR-24210200 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",gabrielmontesuff@yahoo.com.br,,"Lourenco Luna, Paulo Henrique/0000-0002-5189-4177",,,,,51,10,10,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The main driver of this interest is the belief that in a longer term innovations and expenditures on research and development will translate into an increase in competitive advantage, financial results, and subsequently also the market value of companies. On the other hand, the attention should also be paid to the fact that innovative activity has also another, darker, side, which is identified with the far-reaching uncertainty about its final effects and the possibility of incurring losses, especially in financial dimension. At the same time, it should be noted that implementation of investment strategy regarding the shares of innovative companies is quite troublesome because of the lack of unified methodology for assessing corporate innovativeness and large information diversity in this area. Purpose of the article: The investment efficiency analysis of investment strategy regarding shares of companies perceived to be innovative with simultaneous focusing on the different cases of situation development in time. Methods: The research was carried out for companies listed on the main market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, taking into consideration various time ranges of investment. The efficiency analysis of this investment strategy was conducted in the risk-return outlay with the use of such measures as: accumulated rate of return, arithmetic average rate of return, standard and semi-standard deviation, as well as coefficients of variation and semi-variation of rate of return and their inverses. Findings & Value added: The obtained results show that in shorter periods of time, investors buy expectations connected with innovative companies and therefore, the efficiency of investment in their shares is relatively high, but in the longer term expectations are revised by companies' financial results, which in turn often negatively affects the investment efficiency.","[Nawrocki, Tomasz L.] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Ul Roosevelta 26, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland",Silesian University of Technology,"Nawrocki, TL (通讯作者)，Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, Ul Roosevelta 26, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland.",tomasz.nawrocki@polsl.pl,"Nawrocki, Tomasz L./T-1490-2018",,[BK212/ROZ1/2017 (13/010/BK_17/0026)],,This work was supported by BK212/ROZ1/2017 (13/010/BK_17/0026).,,33,3,3,2,4,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

To do so, they need to address collective action. Based on transaction costs economics, this paper explores the role of so-called integrative and segregative institutions in the way local administrations adapt - whether their different functional branches respond to climate change collectively rather than independently. Through a comparative analysis of 19 climate-sensitive local administrations in Germany, the paper shows that variation in the way local administrations structure their internal coordination determines the way they approach climate adaptation. Under integrative institutions, local administrations adjust prior coordination structures to accommodate adaptation. Under segregative institutions, administrations move towards integrative institutions in order to adapt, provided they already feel' climate change.","[Roggero, Matteo] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany; [Thiel, Andreas] Univ Kassel, Int Agr Policy & Environm Governance, Kassel, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Universitat Kassel,"Roggero, M (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Berlin, Germany.",matteo.mancini.roggero@gmail.com; thiel@uni-kassel.de,"Thiel, Andreas/J-6106-2013",,German Ministry for Education and Research within the econCCadapt project [FKZ 01LA1137B],German Ministry for Education and Research within the econCCadapt project,This research was funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research within the econCCadapt project (grant number FKZ 01LA1137B).

We fit a quantity-quality model to state-level data on fertility, mortality, and schooling but, notably, not earnings. Racial discrimination raised the cost of black schooling, thus depressing DHC not only of the current generation but of future generations via its role in producing human capital. Birth-state DHC helps explain the wage gap among stayers, while current-state DHC helps explain the gap among movers. These findings highlight the role of intergenerational transmission in the persistence of the wage gap and the role of migration in reducing it.","[Turner, Chad] Texas Treasury Safekeeping Trust Co, Austin, TX 78701 USA; [Tamura, Robert; Simon, Curtis J.] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC USA; [Mulholland, Sean] Western Carolina Univ, Cullowhee, NC 28723 USA",Clemson University; University of North Carolina; Western Carolina University,"Turner, C (通讯作者)，Texas Treasury Safekeeping Trust Co, Austin, TX 78701 USA.",,"Tamura, Robert/AAI-7510-2020",,,,,,53,0,1,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

Empirical results show clear differences in monetary-fiscal policy interactions between the two countries. First, our findings suggest that fiscal policy acts as the leading indicator in the monetary-fiscal policy combination in the U. S., while monetary policy acts as the leading indicator in the monetary-fiscal policy combination in Japan. Second, the impact of the BOJ's government bond purchases on monetary stock is much smaller than that of the Fed's Treasury securities purchases, suggesting differences in the transmission mechanism of unconventional monetary policy in the two countries. Lastly, compared to the U. S., the monetary-fiscal policy combination in Japan has been found to have less impact on macroeconomic variables during the period of unconventional monetary policy. This evidence suggests that monetary policy and fiscal policy reinforce each other more in their effects on the macroeconomy in the U.

To perform this research, the authors propose a score of bank efficiency using the directional distance function, which was estimated using data envelopment analysis. Additionally, they use an ordered probit panel regression to explore the effects of some market-related and bank-specific factors on efficiency. The results show that the non-inclusion of non-performing loans (NPLs) leads to higher bank inefficiency indicators, which are significantly different from those obtained when NPLs are included. Further, they find that economic growth, capital risk, foreign and national banks, and account liquidity risk explain, in part, the efficiency of Colombian banks.","[Almanza, Camilo] Univ Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Mora Rodriguez, Jhon James] Univ Icesi, Cali, Colombia",Universidad del Norte Colombia; Universidad ICESI,"Rodríguez, JJM (通讯作者)，Univ Icesi, Cali, Colombia.",jjmora@icesi.edu.co,,,,,,,47,1,1,0,12,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAY 14,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,201830,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-30,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GI4IU,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434335600001,0

The results reveal a positive and significant link between firm profitability and executive pay: executive pay is sensitive to performance. The question of whether internal corporate control mechanisms play a significant role in the association between executive pay and firm profitability is revisited. Executive pay is weakly tied to profitability when the ownership concentration is high. We expected that, following the managerial power propositions, leadership duality and board size will weaken performance sensitivity of executive pay, with the impact of board independence on this sensitivity being the opposite. However, it was found that only board leadership duality and board size negatively affect the association between return on equity and executive compensation. This study concludes that the performance sensitivity of pay is weaker when executives have more control over decisions, especially those related to their compensation, and when the board of directors' monitoring effectiveness is relatively low.","[Ataay, Aylin] Galatasaray Univ, Management Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Galatasaray University,"Ataay, A (通讯作者)，Galatasaray Univ, Management Dept, Istanbul, Turkey.",aataay@gsu.edu.tr,"Saybaşılı, Aylin Ataay/AAA-8533-2020","Saybaşılı, Aylin Ataay/0000-0001-5150-1946","Galatasaray University, Scientific Research Projects Fund [14.102.001]","Galatasaray University, Scientific Research Projects Fund","This study was supported by Galatasaray University, Scientific Research Projects Fund [Grant No: 14.102.001]",,78,23,27,5,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Using an open economy DSGE model with heterogeneous households, we show that the effects of remittances are inherently contractionary if they accrue to the first group, and expansionary when they accrue to the second group. Calibrating the model to the Philippines using both aggregate data as well as micro-evidence from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), we show that accounting for both binding credit constraints and the internal distribution of remittances improves the model's fit to the data.

In doing so, we also test the Beckerian prediction that at the same level of expected payoff, a low probability of detection with high fine is a stronger deterrent to corruption than a high probability of detection with low fine. In Experiment 1, two treatments are designed to study the effect of a low probability of detection with high fine and a high probability of detection with low fine, on bribe taking behavior. In Experiment 2, subjects participate in the same baseline harassment bribery game either without or after having gone through a four-week ethics education program. Results show that: (a) a low probability of detection with high fine reduces both the amount and the likelihood of bribe demand, (b) a high probability of detection with low fine has no effect on bribe demand, (c) normative appeals of ethics education has a small effect on the likelihood but not on the amount of bribe demand, when measured immediately after the intervention, (d) the effect of ethics education vanishes when measured four weeks after the intervention.

We conducted a 10-day randomized experiment with 432 individuals living below the poverty line in the Kawangware settlement of Nairobi, Kenya, testing two elements of social welfare design: workfare versus welfare and restricted versus unrestricted vouchers. Participants were randomly assigned to a Work condition, involving daily work for unrestricted vouchers, or one of two Wait conditions, involving daily waiting for vouchers that were either unrestricted or partially restricted to staple foods. We find that working improved psychological wellbeing relative to waiting, suggesting that the means of implementing welfare programs may have important effects on individuals beyond the impact of monetary benefit alone. Furthermore, although the restrictions were inframarginal, partially restricted vouchers crowded-in spending on staple foods, suggesting the existence of a flypaper effect in spending from restricted vouchers.

A Random Social Choice Function (or RSCF) satisfies the tops-only property if the social lottery under each preference profile depends only on the peaks of voters' preferences. We identify a general condition on domains of preferences (the Interior Property and the Exterior Property) which ensures that every strategy-proof RSCF satisfying unanimity has the tops-only property. We show that our condition applies to important classes of voting domains which include restricted connected domains (Sato, 2013) and the multi-dimensional single-peaked domain (Barbera et al., 1993).

In this paper, we seek to explain how the presence of such frictions shapes the flow of goods between countries. To this end, we introduce rationally inattentive importers in a multi-country Ricardian trade model. The amount of information importers process is endogenous and reacts to changes in observable trade costs. Unlike traditional trade costs, changes in information processing costs have non-monotonic and asymmetric effects on bilateral trade flows. The model generates a novel prediction regarding the relationship between information processing costs and concentration of imports that finds support in the data. We calibrate the model, perform counterfactuals and show quantitatively how the response of trade flows to exogenous trade shocks gets magnified under inattention. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find that workers trade off quality for quantity, but the effect is statistically significant only for workers under a flat-rate base salary.

Hence, a theoretically consistent measure of monetary aggregates for the European Monetary Union (EMU) is needed. This paper analyzes aggregation over monetary assets for the EMU. We aggregate over the monetary services for the eleven EMU (EMU-11) countries, which include Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia, and Slovenia. We adopt the Divisia monetary aggregation approach, which is consistent with index number theory and microeconomic aggregation theory. The result is a multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate, in accordance with Barnett (J Econ 136(2):457-482, 2007). The multilateral Divisia monetary aggregate for the EMU-11 is found to be more informative and a better signal of economic trends than the corresponding simple sum aggregate. We then analyze substitutability among monetary assets for the EMU-11 within the framework of a representative consumer's utility function, using Barnett's (J Bus Econ Stat 1:7-23, 1983) locally flexible functional form, the minflex Laurent indirect utility function. The analysis of elasticities with respect to the asset's user-cost prices shows that: (i) transaction balances and deposits with agreed maturity are income elastic and (ii) the monetary assets are not good substitutes for each other within the EMU-11. Simple sum monetary aggregation assumes that component assets are perfect substitutes. Hence simple sum aggregation distorts measurement of the monetary aggregate. The ECB provides Divisia monetary aggregates to the Governing Council at its meetings, but not to the public. Our European Divisia monetary aggregates will be expanded and refined, in collaboration with Wenjuan Chen at the Humboldt University of Berlin, to a complete EMU Divisia monetary aggregates database to be supplied to the public by the Center for Financial Stability in New York City.","[Barnett, William A.; Gaekwad, Neepa B.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Barnett, William A.] Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA",University of Kansas,"Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.;Barnett, WA (通讯作者)，Ctr Financial Stabil, New York, NY 10036 USA.",Barnett@ku.edu,"Barnett, William/GWU-7996-2022",,,,,,37,7,8,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Firms' shareholders choose not only production and investment, but also capital structure and payout policy subject to financial frictions. An increase in uncertainty about profits lowers stock prices and leads firms to substitute away from debt as well as reduce shareholder payout. This mechanism parsimoniously accounts for the postwar comovement in investment, stock prices, leverage, and payout, at both business cycle and medium term cycle frequencies.

While lotteries and provision points both reduce free-riding, they do not completely eliminate the free-riding incentive of individuals, often leaving the good unprovided. In the search for a mechanism that works better, we propose the use of a lottery along with a threshold requirement and test it in a laboratory experimental setup against the popular provision point mechanism. We find that a lottery involving a small prize and a threshold outperforms the provision point mechanism by increasing the average amount of contributions and the frequency of provision. We further test an extension of our mechanism that is well-suited for situations with multiple public goods. The mechanism is designed to avoid monetary prizes associated with lotteries, preventing legal complications and diversion of funds from the public good production. It also has the advantage of easing coordination among the potential donors trying to meet the threshold. The findings confirm that the new mechanism may improve the efficiency of private provision of public goods and have implications for crowdfunding websites with varying rates of project failure, arising partially from their reliance on provision point mechanisms.","[Bose, Bijetri] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rabotyagov, Sergey] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Bose, Bijetri] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, 621 Charles E Young Dr S,2203-LSB, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Bose, B (通讯作者)，Fielding Sch Publ Hlth, 621 Charles E Young Dr S, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",bijetri@uw.edu,,"Bose, Bijetri/0000-0001-6239-7566",USDA NIFA [2012-85101-20472],USDA NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),The authors are grateful for the financial support from the USDA NIFA (2012-85101-20472).,,46,2,2,1,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

We find that religious people are less accepting of unethical economic behavior (e.g., tax evasion, bribery) and report more volunteering. They are equally likely as non-religious people to betray trust in an experimental game, where social behavior is unobservable and not directed to a self-selected group of recipients. Religious people also report lower preference for redistribution. Considering differences between denominations, Catholics betray less than non-religious people, while Protestants betray more than Catholics and are indistinguishable from the non-religious. We also explore the intergenerational transmission and the potential causality of these associations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

There is uncertainty about the price distribution due to uncertainty about an underlying exogenous state of relative demand: in the high state, buyers are on the long side; otherwise, they are on the short side. In equilibrium, prices are on average higher in the high state. Individual agents learn about the distribution while searching. Agents typically start out by experimenting with a tough bargaining position-buyers may initially insist on a low price and sellers on a high price. After successive failures to trade, agents become increasingly pessimistic about the market conditions and soften their bargaining stance. When frictions are small, equilibrium transaction prices are approximately market clearing, despite aggregate demand being unknown. Thus, the search-and-bargaining procedure enables price discovery in a decentralized market.","[Lauermann, Stephan] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Merzyn, Wolfram] Deutsch Bahn Netz AG, Frankfurt, Germany; [Virag, Gabor] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Bonn; University of Toronto,"Lauermann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",,,"Lauermann, Stephan/0000-0002-0327-693X",National Science Foundation [SES-1061831],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We have benefited from comments by Georg Noldeke, Tilman Borgers, Jan Eeckhout, Leonardo Felli, Chris House, Daniel Krahmer, Philipp Kircher, Benny Moldovanu, Tymofiy Mylovanov, Marco Ottaviani, Art Shneyerov, and the anonymous referees, as well as seminar audiences at Boston College, Cambridge, Columbia, Concordia University, Essex, Madison-Wisconsin, Michigan, Michigan State, NYU Stern, OSU, Queen Mary University, Penn State University, the University of Toronto, the Canadian Economic Theory Conference, the MaCII 2016 Workshop, the Decentralization Conference at Washington University, the 2nd MEDS Theory workshop in Graz, the Southampton Winter Workshop, and the Midwest Theory Conference.

The method works by exploiting model heteroscedasticity to construct instruments using the available regressors. Some authors have considered the method in empirical applications where an endogenous regressor is binary (e.g., endogenous Diff-in-Diff or endogenous binary treatment models). The present paper shows that the assumptions required for Lewbel's estimator can indeed be satisfied when an endogenous regressor is binary.

With new developments in methods and data availability, tax experiments have gradually moved away from lab settings and towards the field. This movement from the lab to the field has happened against the background of the credibility revolution' in applied economics, which has seen more rigorous methods applied to policy relevant questions, and of the availability to researchers of administrative data from tax returns. These developments have allowed significant advances in the experimental literature on tax compliance. This paper reviews this literature, giving particular attention to field experiments using administrative data, but putting them in the broader context of the compliance literature.

Further, family ruptures during pregnancy depress birth outcomes and raise the risk of perinatal complications necessitating hospitalization.

Compared to the case with only good workers, the mission-oriented sector has to resort to higher monitoring to deal with the threat of sabotage. When standard monitoring is not possible, peer monitoring might deter bad workers from entering the nonprofit sector but reduces output due to free riding and because workers require higher compensation to work in teams. Nonprofits implement peer monitoring only if the expected damage that bad workers can inflict is larger than the loss of productivity due to teamwork. For senior staff with high reservation utility, they turn a blind eye on serious sabotage if the likelihood of hiring a bad worker is perceived as small.

This paper contributes to this growing literature by filling some of the gaps, especially in relation to Keynes's investment philosophy and economic theory, and by undertaking a more comprehensive review of the available evidence, drawing on some unpublished sources which have not as yet been fully exploited.","[Cristiano, Carlo] Univ Pisa, Dept Law, Pisa, Italy; [Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, Rome, Italy",University of Pisa; Sapienza University Rome,"Cristiano, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Law, Pisa, Italy.",carlo.cristiano@unipi.it; cristina.marcuzzo@uniroma1.it,"Cristiano, Carlo/JDM-4376-2023; Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina/AAK-8514-2020","Cristiano, Carlo/0000-0002-8657-6187;",,,,,43,10,10,0,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

It is generally acknowledged that this theory, which relates the extent of trade between countries to their respective sizes, distances, and relative trade barriers, was first developed by Jan Tinbergen in 1962. Acceptance of the gravity model as part of the discipline's core was limited by its scant theoretical foundation for the first 40 years of its existence. This paper finds that a theory of trade gravity was first developed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations. Moreover, it is shown that Smith's statement of a proportional relation between economic size and distance came about as an application of his general theory of differential capital productivity in different economic sectors, and his elaboration of a theory of the gains from trade originated by David Hume. It is further shown that Smith had an explanation of the size of border affects in trade volumes, and a gravity theory of trade restrictions.","[Elmslie, Bruce] Univ New Hampshire, Paul Coll Business & Econ, Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Elmslie, B (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Paul Coll Business & Econ, Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",bte@unh.edu,,,,,,,35,6,8,0,3,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Amid discussions about the most efficient ways to conduct such reforms, whether individually or simultaneously, we still lack evidence on the cross-country interactions and international interdependencies that may strengthen or weaken economic responses within an economic union. This paper deals with three policy tools - unemployment benefits, activation policies and the tax wedge, and demonstrates that they dissipate across open economies. We document evidence of both positive and negative policy spillovers among European economies and carry out a counterfactual of coordinated policies which prove to be needed for some but not other policy variables.

An optimization problem is used to simulate the situation that each source faces (of choosing the technology and fuel) in order to reduce the cost of the new tax. For this process, investments in boilers or dual burners have been considered, that allow for a change in fuel. The results indicate that taxes up to US$10/ton CO2 do not greatly modify the use of fuels in industrial sources. If taxes between US $10/ton CO2 and US$30/ton CO2 are implemented, then emissions are reduced rapidly. With taxes higher than US$30/ton CO2, emission reductions stagnate. It can be concluded that taxes that are too low or too high are effective in raising revenue but not in reducing emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A large number of research firms decide whether to innovate or not, by taking into account what competitors (i.e., other firms) do. This is due to the fact that their profits partly depend on an externality related to the share of firms which actively engage in research activities. Such a share of innovative firms also determines the evolution of technology in the macroeconomy, which ultimately drives economic growth. We show that when the externality effect is strong enough multiple BGP equilibria may exist. In such a framework, the economy may face a low growth trap suggesting that it may end up in a situation of slow long-run growth; however, such an outcome may be fully solved by government intervention. We also show that whenever multiple BGP exist, they are metastable meaning that the economy may cyclically fluctuate between the low and high BGP as a result of shocks affecting the individual behavior of research firms.","[Marsiglio, Simone] Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Tolotti, Marco] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",University of Wollongong; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Tolotti, M (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",simonem@uow.edu.au; tolotti@unive.it,"Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012; Tolotti, Marco/D-6189-2014","Tolotti, Marco/0000-0002-7409-0825",MIUR [PRIN20103S5RN3]; Ca' Foscari University Venice,"MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); Ca' Foscari University Venice","We are indebted to two anonymous referees for their constructive comments helping us to substantially improve our paper.

Benchmarking experiments against Stata (a commonly used commercial package), Biogeme (a commonly used freeware package), and ALOGIT (a highly specialized commercial package for discrete choice modeling) based on an industry dataset for airline itinerary choice modeling applications shows that the size of the input estimation files are 50-100 times larger in Stata and Biogeme, respectively. Estimation times are also much faster in ALOGIT and Larch; e.g., for a small itinerary choice problem, a multinomial logit model estimated in ALOGIT or Larch converged in less than one second whereas the same model took almost 15 seconds in Stata and more than three minutes in Biogeme.","[Newman, Jeffrey P.] Cambridge Systemat Inc, 115 South LaSalle St,Suite 2200, Chicago, IL 60603 USA; [Lurkin, Virginie] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Route Cantonale, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Garrow, Laurie A.] Georgia Inst Technol, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Garrow, LA (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, 790 Atlantic Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jnewman@camsys.com; virginie.lurkin@epfl.ch; laurie.garrow@ce.gatech.edu,,"Garrow, Laurie/0000-0003-2445-9687",,,,,19,8,8,1,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Tasks at the early and late stages of the supply chains generate higher value added, possibly due to a higher knowledge-intensity, after controlling for firm heterogeneity.

We exploit a unique dataset of 365 Polish cooperative banks, 42% of which are run by female CEOs. We find that banks headed by female CEOs are less risky: they report higher capital adequacy and equity to assets ratios. Credit risk in female-led banks is not different from male-led banks, and therefore higher capital adequacy does not stem from lower asset quality and is likely to be linked to higher risk aversion of female CEOs. Our evidence supports the view that women are more risk averse bank CEOs than men. Our findings suggest that gender quotas in bank boards can contribute to reduce risk-taking behavior.","[Skala, Dorota] Univ Szczecin, WNEiZ, Szczecin, Poland; [Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, Strasbourg, France",University of Szczecin; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Inst Etud Polit, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,,,,,,35,46,51,3,45,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

We show that worker flows between jobs in different industries are rare relative to the demographic flows of youth entry and elderly exit. The same applies to the flows between state-owned enterprises and private firms. In fact, evidence suggest that changes in the demand for labor were accommodated mostly through demographic flows, with a smaller role left for job transitions.

Based on an augmented Phillips curve framework, this article employs both the autoregressive distribution lag (ARDL) and nonlinear and asymmetric autoregressive distribution lag (NARDL) model to investigate pass-through effects of crude oil price on China's producer prices index (PPI) and consumer prices index (CPI) in China. It is found that the impact of global oil price fluctuations to China's PPI and CPI are asymmetrical in the long-run, and the long-term impacts of the rise in global oil prices on PPI and CPI are greater than the global oil price decline on PPI and CPI. However, the symmetric ARDL model fails to diagnose the impact of oil price to China's PPI and CPI. Therefore, it is necessary to consider asymmetric relationship in the study of global oil price's influence on China's domestic prices.","[Long, Shaobo] Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Long, Shaobo] Chongqing Univ, Res Ctr Publ Econ & Publ Policy, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Liang, Jun] Renmin Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; Chongqing University; Renmin University of China,"Long, SB (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Sch Publ Affairs, Chongqing, Peoples R China.;Long, SB (通讯作者)，Chongqing Univ, Res Ctr Publ Econ & Publ Policy, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",Longds@126.com,,"Long, Shaobo/0000-0003-4549-8722",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017CDJSK01XK13]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16CJL007]; Major Program of Humanities and Social Science Key Research Base of Ministry of Education [13JJD790036]; Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs of Renmin University of China,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Major Program of Humanities and Social Science Key Research Base of Ministry of Education; Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs of Renmin University of China,"This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 2017CDJSK01XK13]; the National Social Science Foundation of China [grant number 16CJL007], the Major Program of Humanities and Social Science Key Research Base of Ministry of Education [grant number 13JJD790036], and Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs 2014 of Renmin University of China.",,30,36,36,0,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

A new Bayesian multi-chain Markov-switching GARCH model for dynamic hedging in energy futures markets is developed. It builds on the construction of a system of simultaneous equations for the return dynamics on the hedged portfolio and the futures. The implication of our model for portfolios allocation and energy trading are manyfold. First, our formulation allows for an easy identification of the different states of the discrete processes as volatility regimes. Secondly, the use of regime-switching models with multiple chains allows for an effective way to reduce risk. Furthermore, correlated chains are more flexible than single chain models since they account for co-movement in the volatility regimes of different markets thus they should be preferred in turbulent periods (e.g. financial crisis). Finally, the combination of the expected utility framework with the regime switching structure allows us to define a robust minimum variance hedging strategy. Changes in the optimal hedging strategies before and after the financial crisis are evidenced when the proposed robust hedging strategy is applied to crude oil spot and futures markets. It is therefore recommended that many and different models should be used in place of a single one in energy risk hedging since they could perform differently in various phases of the market.

J,"Brown, DP",,,,"Brown, David P.",,,The effect of subsidized entry on capacity auctions and the long-run resource adequacy of electricity markets,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity market design; Subsidized entry; Resource adequacy; Regulatory policy; Multi-unit auctions,IDENTITY-DEPENDENT EXTERNALITIES,"Motivated by recent government interventions in the form of mandated subsidies for new and existing generation capacity, I examine the impact of subsidized entry of electricity generation capacity on the performance of centralized capacity auctions. Subsidized entry suppresses capacity prices and induces an inefficient allocation of capacity. It also alters the equilibrium generation portfolio determined by the capacity auction. In the short-run, altering the generation portfolio through subsidized entry may lead to lower expected electricity prices in subsequent market interactions. These effects reduce total industry profit, but may increase consumer surplus. Consequently, the effect of subsidized entry on short-run expected welfare is ambiguous. However, subsidized entry has adverse long-run impacts. The suppressed capacity and electricity prices reduce the incentives of unsubsidized firms to invest in generation capacity. Further, subsidized entry may induce welfare-reducing boom and bust investment cycles and/or may be self-reinforcing. Under plausible conditions, the long-run resource adequacy issues associated with insufficient capacity investment dominate the potential short-run benefits of subsidized entry. Regulatory policies such as PJM's Minimum Offer Pricing Rule (MOPR) attempt to eliminate subsidized entry. These mitigation measures can be welfare-enhancing in the presence of subsidized entry.

Therefore, gas market reform is expected to be incentive for developing gas storage facilities. In the present study, a real option model was proposed to analyse the optimal investment strategy (investment timing and value) for underground gas storage facilities with/without the consideration of gas market reform. Uncertainties in gas market, government incentives and technological improvements were considered. The obtained results showed that it was not optimal for immediate investment in underground gas storage in China, and that to implement gas market reform would greatly contribute to gas storage construction. With the consideration of gas market reform, the investment of underground gas storage would be executed at 2026 with an investment value of 0.33 RMB/m(3) if there were no government incentive, while to invest in 2030 would be the best decision without the consideration of gas market reform, and the investment value is only 0.05 RMB/m(3). Through a sensitivity analysis, the effects of changes in parameters related to gas market, government incentives and technological improvements on the investment strategy were investigated. The conclusions can provide useful information for gas storage enterprise decision-makers on whether and when to invest underground gas storage facilities in China considering uncertainties.

First, the unbiasedness hypothesis - the proposition that expost exchange rate depreciation matches interest differentials - is rejected much more strongly at short horizons than at long. Second, even at long horizons, the unbiasedness hypothesis tends to be rejected when one of the currencies has experienced a long period of low interest rates, such as in Japan and Switzerland. Using a calibrated New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, we show how a monetary policy rule can induce the negative (positive) correlation between depreciation and interest differentials at short (long) horizons. The tendency to reject unbiasedness for Japan and Switzerland even at long horizons we attribute to the interaction of the monetary reaction function and the zero lower bound.","[Chinn, Menzie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Robert M La Follette Sch Publ Affairs, 1225 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chinn, Menzie D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Chinn, Menzie D.] Natl Bur Econ Res, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Zhang, Yi] Univ Calif Davis, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Zhang, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mchinn@lafollette.wisc.edu; ychzhang@ucdavis.edu,,,University of Wisconsin,University of Wisconsin,"We thank Charles Engel, Kenneth D.

This study has developed a stochastic energy economy -environment integrated model, to assess China's energy and climate targets in 2030, with a particular focus on the carbon intensity reduction, carbon emission peaking, and non-fossil energy development. The probabilities of realizing the targets are obtained, and the nexus among different targets is explored. It's argued that carbon emission management and policy-making should be implemented from the perspective of risk management, and policy makers can take corresponding policy measures based on the degree of confidence required under multiple future uncertainties. It is found that the probabilities of realizing carbon emission-peaking target and non-fossil energy target are low, with the business-as-usual efforts, and additional policies may still be needed. More specific, carbon pricing plays a major role in curbing and peaking carbon emissions, while the policy mix of carbon pricing and non-fossil energy subsidies can peak the carbon emission with relatively low cost compared to the single carbon pricing policy. It is also found that the carbon intensity reduction target is most likely to be attained, followed by the carbon-peaking target, and then the non-fossil energy target, given the same policy efforts. This indicates that, China may not deliberately increase carbon emissions rapidly over the next decade to make the carbon emission peak as high as possible; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the non-fossil energy target.

In contrast, firms led by incumbent CEOs with GPs are more likely to be liquidated, as are firms led by new CEOs without GPs. Since GPs are nullified during bankruptcy, the observed relationship cannot be attributed to an explicit incentive effect. Rather, we contend that during financial distress GPs help recruit reputable CEOs who, even without explicit incentives, continue to maximize shareholder value due to implicit reputational and career concerns.

Various methods have been considered to treat this type of data. One approach assumes that the data correspond to the interval midpoint and then utilizes ordinary least squares to estimate the model. Another approach is to use maximum likelihood estimation, assuming that the underlying variable of interest is normally distributed. In the case of distributional misspecification, these estimation approaches can yield inconsistent estimators. In this paper, we explore a method that can help reduce the misspecification problem by assuming a distribution that can model a wide variety of distributional characteristics, including possible heteroskedasticity. The method is applied to the problem of estimating the impact of various explanatory factors associated with individual discount rates in a field experiment. Our analysis suggests that the underlying distribution of discount rates exhibits skewness, but not heteroskedasticity, In this example, the findings based on a normal distribution are generally robust across distributions.","[McDonald, James; Stoddard, Olga; Walton, Daniel] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 130 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Stoddard, O (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, 130 FOB, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",olga.stoddard@byu.edu,,,,,,,23,4,4,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",2214-8043,2214-8051,,J BEHAV EXP ECON,J.

Youngsters observe the behavioral trait of a role model and form beliefs about the desirability of that trait. Adults have better information about each trait and have a paternalistic attitude toward their children. This makes them reluctant to adopt myopic behavior to avoid setting a negative example to their children. This signaling distortion increases in the influence parents have over their offspring. We extend the model to allow parental influence to depend on the population frequency of each trait and show that cultural complementarity does not imply convergence to a homogeneous population. We find empirical support for a positive relationship between parental influence and propensity to exert self-restraint by looking at alcohol and tobacco consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Syria's experience is a useful one to explore given its historically important role in the region and its distinctive characteristics. The Syrian economic transition, from the early 1990s to 2011, was in two phases: an incremental liberalisation phase and a transition to a social market economy phase. During both phases, Syrian policymakers showed a preference for a gradualist approach to economic transition, rather than a big-bang approach. This was facilitated by oil revenues and subsidies from the Gulf States. The Syrian experience therefore has its own distinct characteristics, as well as elements in common with the transitions in other post-socialist economies.","[Alajaty, Mahmoud; Anchor, John R.] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Management, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England",University of Huddersfield,"Alajaty, M (通讯作者)，Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield Business Sch, Dept Management, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England.",m.alajaty@hud.ac.uk,"Anchor, John/AFM-0328-2022","Anchor, John/0000-0003-2885-9450; Alajaty, Mahmoud/0000-0002-0576-9615",,,,,53,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2018,30.0,3,,,,,382,394,,10.1080/14631377.2018.1442052,0.0,,,13,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF8JM,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432216800005,0

Hamilton (2001) to investigate the relationship between cyclical components of unemployment and output in the Turkish economy where the unemployment rate remains at double digits despite the relatively stable economic environment over the last decade. The paper shows that economic expansion and contraction terms have an asymmetric effect on cyclical unemployment in Turkey. Moreover, the study identifies a specific range for the output gap level at which jobless growth pattern occurs in the Turkish economy. According to our findings, contrary to standard literature, cyclical component of unemployment does not decrease even though cyclical component of output is positive and increases in the middle stages of the upswing phase of the economy. This result may also indicate that the employers are reluctant to extend employment and alter into informalization for reasons such as over-valued domestic currency, surplus labour force and/or any rigid regulatory frameworks in the middle stages of the expansion phase of the economy. However, they become eager to expand employment and renounce informalization only after a certain rate of economic growth is achieved.","[Arabaci, Ozer] Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econometr, Bursa, Turkey; [Arabaci, Rabihan Yuksel] Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Labour Econ & Ind Relat, Bursa, Turkey",Uludag University; Uludag University,"Arabaci, Ö (通讯作者)，Uludag Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Econometr, Bursa, Turkey.",ozerarabaci@uludag.edu.tr; rabihan@uludag.edu.tr,"Arabacı, Özer/AAG-8285-2021",,,,,,46,4,4,2,6,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2018,65.0,5,,,,,569,586,,10.2298/PAN130913026A,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,HF8BA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454464700003,0

However, few analyses explain how environmental policies drive eco-innovation. This article studies eco-innovation-friendly mechanisms in the design of European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemicals) regulation. The aim of REACH, which became effective in 2007, is 'to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment while improving competitiveness and innovation' which makes it appropriate and original for analysing the relationship between environmental regulation and eco-innovation. The primary contribution of this article is to provide a new theoretical and empirical perspective on eco-innovation by showing how design regulation is able to push and pull the environment innovation, based on an original survey related to REACH regulation. The econometric model shows that (1) regulatory-push mechanisms seem to be more important drivers than regulatory-pull mechanisms; (2) the process of authorization and the obligation to transmit information throughout the supply chain play an important role in 'pushing' eco-innovation, suggesting that policymakers should promote new 'green knowledge' to encourage eco-innovation; (3) extending obligations has a significantly positive effect on 'pulling' eco-innovation and (4) only well-designed instruments, appropriate for the techno-industrial and institutional contexts in which they are to be applied, lead to innovation.","[Arfaoui, N.] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, GREDEG, Valbonne, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Arfaoui, N (通讯作者)，Univ Catholique Lyon, ESDES, 16 Rue Abbaye Ainay, F-69002 Lyon, France.",narfaoui@univcatholyon.fr,,,,,,,61,20,21,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

SRBs are targeted to specific military occupations for which reenlistment rates are lower (or expected to be lower) than what is needed. This article first identifies four primary sources of biases affecting these models: reverse causality from supply shifts (a negative bias), the endogeneity of the decision point causing coded SRBs to be higher for reenlisters than leavers (a positive bias), measurement error (a likely negative bias), and excess supply preventing the full effect of an SRB change to materialize (a positive or negative bias). The report proceeds to develop a model that attempts to address the first two biases. With U.S. Navy data from FY2001-FY2008, I examine the extent to which these two biases are affecting the estimated SRB effects. Despite these corrections, the difficulty of addressing the other biases calls into doubt studies that examine the effects of retention bonuses or even the effects of the structure of military pay in general.","[Arkes, Jeremy] Naval Postgrad Sch, 555 Dyer Rd, Monterey, CA 93943 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; Naval Postgraduate School,"Arkes, J (通讯作者)，Naval Postgrad Sch, 555 Dyer Rd, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",arkes@nps.edu,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

We employ an advanced dynamic panel threshold regression model to test for the threshold level of energy intensity that has an asymmetrical energy consumption effect on economic growth; we consider 12 Commonwealth of Independent States countries over the period 1991-2013. The estimated panel threshold regression model suggests 0.44% as the threshold level of energy intensity. Energy consumption above this level significantly retards economic growth, whereas energy consumption below the level is found to have a statistically significant positive effect on economic growth. Thus, when the threshold level of energy intensity (one of the important indicators of energy efficiency) is exceeded, energy consumption significantly hinders growth. If policy makers pay more attention to energy intensity while formulating new energy policies, substantial gains can be achieved in low energy intensity environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, research on value creation has focused on the value created by the company, though the client increasingly serves as an active partner, able to create value within the company in a collaborative manner. This is especially true for professional services that require more collaborative development of business solutions and a greater client adoption. The authors focus on a specific type of professional services - business consulting - and aim to characterize the value co-creation processes that occur between a business consulting company and its clients. The case study results reveal eight value co-creation processes with different impacts on a service provider and a client: (1) building trust and trusting relationships; (2) clients' needs identification; (3) clarifying the client's role; (4) self-motivation to be involved in value co-creation; (5) pursuit of service effectivenes; (6) involvement and commitment for mutual long-term activities; (7) identification of opportunities for reciprocal cooperation, and (8) searching the conditions for mutual growth.

We further analyse the dynamic nature of the scale-dependent wavelet correlations and find that the correlations are highly volatile and significantly increase across different time scales during the episodes of equity market turbulence.

The sensitivity of returns and volatility to business cycle shocks is only evident for extreme quantiles. These findings indicate the importance of modeling the nonlinearity and tail behaviour when analyzing the relationships between equity markets and business cycles.

As financial markets are by nature highly interlinked, one might expect that the uncertainty engendered by Brexit also has an impact on financial markets in several other countries. We first estimate the time-varying interactions between UK policy uncertainty, which to a large extent is attributed to uncertainty about Brexit and UK financial market volatilities. Second, we use two other measures of the perceived probability of Brexit before the referendum, namely daily data released by Betfair and results of polls published by Bloomberg. Based on these data sets, and using both panel and single-country SUR estimation methods, we analyse the Brexit effect on levels of stock returns, sovereign CDS, 10-year interest rates in 19 predominantly European countries, and those of the British pound and the euro. We show that Brexit-induced policy uncertainty will continue to cause instability in key financial markets and has the potential to damage the real economy in both the UK and other European countries.

The article conducts a comparative study between Romania, France and the average recorded in the European Union regarding competitiveness in companies from the accounting business field for the timeframe 2008-2013. Competitiveness is measured as the average for the domestic-owned companies and separately for the foreign-owned companies. Competitiveness assessment is based on asset related elements, processes and performance. The key success factors used for assessing competitiveness are investment rate, gross operating rate, turnover per person employed, share of personal cost in production and added value. The data are collected through the European Statistical System and processed by means of competitiveness analysis methods used in the literature. The findings show that the competitiveness of Romanian and French companies from the accounting business field is above the European Union average. The hypothesis according to which the foreign-owned companies are more competitive than domestic-owned companies is partially confirmed. The foreign owned companies are increasing their competitiveness by reducing labour cost and increasing productivity and added value. They invest far less than companies with local ownership.","[Berinde, Sorin R.] Babes Bolyai Univ, Mihail Kogalniceanu St 1, Cluj Napoca 400174, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Berinde, SR (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ, Mihail Kogalniceanu St 1, Cluj Napoca 400174, Romania.",sorin.berinde@tbs.ubbcluj.ro,"Sorin, Berinde/AAO-9903-2021; Sorin, Berinde I/C-8019-2015",,Babes-Bolyai University Romania [31781/23.03.2016],Babes-Bolyai University Romania,"This work was supported by Babes-Bolyai University Romania, through the Funding contract for the implementation of grants for young researchers; project number 31781/23.03.2016 Corporate governance particularities and their impact on financial statements.",,56,1,1,1,10,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We find that this relationship does not exist in the most developed countries. Instead, our results are stronger in underdeveloped and moderately developed countries. In addition, we find that stock market liquidity is negatively associated with poverty rates. In our final set of tests, we attempt to identify the mechanism through which liquidity reduces inequality. After decomposing wage growth into the portion that is driven by stock market liquidity and the portion that is orthogonal to liquidity, we find strong evidence that liquidity-induced wage growth drives the reduction in both inequality and poverty.","[Blau, Benjamin M.] Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Blau, BM (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Jon M Huntsman Sch Business, Dept Econ & Finance, 3565 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",ben.blau@usu.edu,,,,,,,50,21,24,2,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

From our findings, high diversification configuration significantly leads to high systematic risk. However, systematic risk goes worse at high levels of country and region diversification. The findings led to the conclusion that the effect through China involvement which had co-opted and caught the strategic resources from the regions to focus its FDI policy objectives especially expands the country scope. It's important to consider how to maintain the competitiveness of their ventures in China to expand the markets overseas.

Both the consumer price index (CPI) and purchasing power parity (PPP) belong to the scope of price statistics, and the former is a temporal price index, while the latter is a spatial price index. Consumer price survey accounts for more than 70% in the coverage of the international comparison program (ICP), constituting the main part of the catalog of ICP specifications. The similar calculation method, data investigation, and compilation process also suggest that there should be an intrinsic linkage between CPI and PPP. On this basis, an approximate quantity equation is derived for them in terms of price measurement. The empirical analysis with a sample of 178 economies ranging from 2000 to 2013 found that the CPI and PPP are positive correlated significantly, and there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between them. In short run, the CPI may lead to a deviation from the equilibrium state of PPP, but the error correction mechanism makes this deviation come back gradually. Meanwhile, PPP has a price pass-through effect on CPI. The inherent relationship between CPI and PPP provides support for the integration of the CPI statistical system and the global ICP project.","[Chen, Menggen] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Xuemei] Natl Bur Stat China, Int Stat Informat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Chen, MG (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",cmg@bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,43,6,7,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Nevertheless, the level of uncertainty in the selection process is relatively high and need to be carefully considered. Hence, in order to select a proper 3PLs provider, integration of the Fuzzy AHP and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) has offered a novel integrated model, in which Fuzzy AHP is used for calculating priority weights of each criteria and EDAS is employed to achieve the final ranking of 3PLs providers. Besides, in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, it is validated by a case study. Cost together with quality, and professionalism are found to be the most important factors for 3PLs provider selection. Consequently, the advantage of this model is that it is simple to apprehend and easy to apply. The use of the proposed model leads to the selection of suitable alternative successfully in other selection problems.","[Ecer, Fatih] Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, ANS Campus, TR-03030 Afyon, Turkey",Afyon Kocatepe University,"Ecer, F (通讯作者)，Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Business Adm, ANS Campus, TR-03030 Afyon, Turkey.",fecer@aku.edu.tr,"Ecer, Fatih/AAE-8455-2020","Ecer, Fatih/0000-0002-6174-3241",,,,,48,89,91,0,36,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

And we further analyse the role of OAD's characteristics, including administrative rank and age. The results indicate that although tight monetary policy can reduce bank loans, the OAD can weaken this relationship, and the higher is the administrative rank of OAD, the larger is the effect. And the older is OAD, the larger is the effect. More importantly, the relationship between monetary policy and bank loan is insignificant in banks with OAD, implying that the lending channel of monetary policy is absent when considering the role of OAD.","[Fang, Xi; Qian, Xianhang] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Haiming] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Qian, XH (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, 27 Shanda Nanlu, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.",qxhsdu02@163.com,,"Qian, Xianhang/0000-0002-2185-0886",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302088]; Major Project of National Social Science Foundation of China [12ZD069]; Young Scholars' Program of Shandong University [2015WLJH13],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Project of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Young Scholars' Program of Shandong University,"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302088], the Major Project of National Social Science Foundation of China [12ZD069] and the Young Scholars' Program of Shandong University [2015WLJH13].",,8,1,1,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We address this research question resorting to a novel set of data that links together the universe of Italian firms and detailed data on export transactions. We find that the positive relationship between export status and growth declines with firm age. Further, we also find that, even when accounting for the role of age, the negative size-growth relationship does not disappear, contrary to some recent evidence. These results suggest a positive signaling role of the export status that is stronger for young exporters or born globals. Exploiting the product-country level dimension of the customs data, we also provide, for the first time, evidence on differences in exchange rates pass-through between young and experienced exporters. In particular, we find that early exporters appear to be better equipped than established firms to face exchange rates variations as their exports decrease less following a currency appreciation.","[Grazzi, Marco] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Moschella, Daniele] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",University of Bologna; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Moschella, D (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",marco.grazzi@unibo.it; d.moschella@sssup.it,"Grazzi, Marco/A-6195-2012","Grazzi, Marco/0000-0002-4196-6122","Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi di Forli; Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research (SIR Programme) [RBSI14JAFW]; European Commission [649186]","Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi di Forli; Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research (SIR Programme); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","Marco Grazzi gratefully acknowledges Fondazione Cassa dei Risparmi di Forli for financial support.

Specifically, I focus on the pass-through from the main monetary policy rate to consumer, mortgage, SME and corporate lending rates in period from January 2004 to September 2016. The empirical literature suggests that the pass-through varies across countries and across type of loans. After the global financial crisis, however, researchers mostly confirm a lesser pass-through. The goal of this paper is to find out whether spill-over effects of the global financial crisis have somehow influenced the interest rate pass-through in the Czech Republic. In addition, I test the role of credit risk and government bond yields in the setting of lending rates. To do so, I employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) modelling approach. The baseline results suggest that the interest rate pass-through is complete for all lending rates. Those results, however, neglect the effect of the global financial crisis. In order to address this concern, I create a shift crisis dummy variable. The results of the model with the crisis dummy variable show that after the crisis, the efficiency of the pass-through significantly dropped for mortgage and SME lending rates but not for corporate lending rates, for which the pass-through remained complete.","[Gregor, Jiri] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Gregor, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",jiri.gregor@vsb.cz,"Gregor, Jiří/JMR-1735-2023",,VSB-Technical University SGS [SP2018/138],VSB-Technical University SGS,The author gratefully acknowledges financial support from the VSB-Technical University SGS grant project No. SP2018/138 (Implications for Fiscal and Monetary Policy of Advanced Countries: an Econometric Approach),,15,1,1,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-289-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,96,106,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BN6JE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000485363200011,0

We extend this literature by investigating political cycle effects in a non-monetary, non-fiscal policy regime (the allocation of mining licences) in a transition country context. We propose a model of mining licensing that allows for corruption and for both supply and demand effects to determine the outcome. We then estimate this model using time-series data from post-communist Albania. Relying on a dynamic Poisson model, we find evidence of both opportunistic and partisan effects. Based on our theory, we suggest a corruption interpretation of political cycles in non-fiscal/non-monetary variables.

The Chinese Government is promoting the three rights separation system to consolidate agricultural land through the land rental market with the explicit intention of fostering new agricultural management subjects and improving agricultural productivity. The present paper estimates the effect of rural labor migration on households' participation in land renting in and renting out activities based on a unique dataset from three rounds of nationally representative surveys. Our results indicate that rural labor migration has a significant negative effect on households renting in land and has a positive effect on households renting out land in rural China. Therefore, the government should adopt targeted policies to effectively encourage farmers with higher agricultural capacity to rent in land to alleviate the negative effect of rural migration on households renting in land. Supporting policies should guarantee that rural migrants enjoy the same welfare services as urban residents.","[Ji, Xianqing] Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Natl Governance & Natl Audit, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qian, Zhonghao] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Business, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tonglong] South China Agr Univ, Natl Sch Agr Inst & Dev, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Nanjing Audit University; Yangzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; South China Agricultural University","Ji, XQ (通讯作者)，Nanjing Audit Univ, Inst Natl Governance & Natl Audit, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jixianqing191@sina.com; zhqian@yzu.edu.cn; lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673234, 71333012]; National Social Science Foundation of China [17BJL009]; Ministry of Education Foundation of China [16JZD024]; Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Ministry of Education Foundation of China(Ministry of Education, China); Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, China","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71673234 and 71333012), the National Social Science Foundation of China (No. 17BJL009), the Ministry of Education Foundation of China (No. 16JZD024) and the Qinglan Project of Jiangsu Province, China.",,43,32,32,6,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2018,26.0,1,,,SI,,66,85,,10.1111/cwe.12229,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FS7HA,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419967300006,0

In contrast to the previous industrial waves, the current and ongoing industrial revolution is characterized by the replacement of creative destruction with jobless growth. Instead of replacing the lost jobs with new ones, new disruptive technologies eliminate more jobs in traditional labor and capital-intensive sectors than create jobs in new idea-intensive sectors. By examining the relationship between the income share of the bottom 50 percent, the middle 40 percent, and the top 10 percent and technological progress, we obtain robust econometric results. According to our results, the income polarization among U.S. workers can be associated with the shift of R&D activities from the public to the corporate sector. The concentration of innovations by corporate capital limits the power of society to reduce inequality and to provide greater social stability through the incredible productivity of technological progress.","[Josifidis, Kosta; Supic, Novica] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Josifidis, K (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Novi Sad, Serbia.",,"Supic, Novica/ABF-9244-2022; Supic, Novica/Q-8905-2019","Supic, Novica/0000-0002-9526-7255; Josifidis, Kosta/0000-0002-2522-9202",,,,,25,9,9,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

On average, the central bank's interest rate accounts for approximately 20% of the variance in each variable. We find that the total range of changes is more important than the frequency of changes. The panel regression shows that the range and frequency of policy rate changes is positively associated with the volatility of long-term interest rates but no association with the volatility of stock prices and exchange rates. These results suggest that small and frequent adjustments of policy rates are desirable for reducing the volatility of interest rates.

Four types of incentive programs and four types of penalty programs were established based on three comparison criteria. As a building-level, the first comparison criterion is the averaging approach based on similar cases that can be retrieved using a simplified case-based reasoning model. As a community-level, the second comparison criterion is one-step higher operational and letter rating than the grade of a given building. As a national-level, the third comparison criterion is the operational and letter rating as the minimum criteria for achieving the national CERT. In this study, an elementary school facility located in Seoul, South Korea was selected to validate the applicability of the developed program. As a result, besides the category benchmark, the various comparison criteria should be provided to the public to encourage the voluntary participation of the public in the energy-saving campaign.","[Koo, Choongwan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Hong, Taehoon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Yonsei University,"Hong, T (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Seoul 120749, South Korea.",hong7@yonsei.ac.kr,"Hong, Taehoon/E-9169-2012; Koo, Choongwan/P-9862-2015","Hong, Taehoon/0000-0001-5136-8276; Koo, Choongwan/0000-0001-9229-7355","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning) [NRF-2015R1A2A1A05001657]","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning)(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP; Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning) (No. NRF-2015R1A2A1A05001657).",,54,7,7,0,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Inconsistent voting behaviour occurs if a member shows disagreement on the interest rate proposed by the chairman in the policy go-around, but this member agrees in the formal vote. Results show that after the 1993's increase in central bank transparency, the probability of casting inconsistent votes decreases significantly, on average by 3.3 percentage points. FOMC members with longer tenure on the committee have a lower probability of casting inconsistent votes. Further results suggest that board members and bank presidents differ significantly, with bank presidents casting inconsistent votes more often than board members do. This relation holds true for gender as well, with female members casting more inconsistent votes than males. In addition, political aspects and career backgrounds also contribute to explaining inconsistent voting behaviour in the FOMC. Conditional effects reveal that after the change in transparency, differences between board members and bank presidents remain, whereas differences between male and female members have diminished. What is more, FOMC members with a career in the government sector have been strongly affected by the regime shift in transparency.","[Laehner, Tom] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Econ & Business, Inst Money & Int Finance, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Lähner, T (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Econ & Business, Inst Money & Int Finance, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",laehner@gif.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,58,6,6,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In addition, we explore how EPU index can be effectively used to gain larger economic values in the oil futures market. To this end, this research provides a new perspective on setting thresholds for EPU and examines whether these thresholds can help improve both the forecast accuracy and economic values. Empirical results suggest that the HAR-RV-type models including EPU can generate more accurate forecasts and economic values. The HAR-RV-type models including above-threshold EPU can further improve the forecast accuracy and yield higher economic values by setting specific thresholds for a range of horizons. The findings highlight the importance of EPU and effective way of using EPU in risk management and portfolio strategies that is crucial for investors and policymakers.","[Ma, Feng; Liu, Jing] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wahab, M.

We first discuss the foundations of this theory on the basis of the most popular growth models, and then perform a long-run regression analysis of wealth inequality using Piketty and Zucman's data and a new historical data set for the OECD countries covering the period since 1870 onwards. We find that the wealth-to-income ratio, beta, is significantly related to the ratio between the saving rate, alpha, and the rate of income growth, g. The estimated coefficient for the s/g ratio ranges from 0.05 to 0.18, depending on the specification, while the theory predicts a unitary value. It is also shown that the wealth-to-income ratio responds to the variations in income growth much more than to variations in the saving rate.","[Madsen, Jakob B.] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, 900 Dandenong Rd, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Minniti, Antonio] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Venturini, Francesco] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy; [Venturini, Francesco] NIESR, London, England",Monash University; University of Bologna; University of Perugia,"Venturini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Via Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.;Venturini, F (通讯作者)，NIESR, London, England.",francesco.venturini@unipg.it,"Venturini, Francesco/AFC-0519-2022; Minniti, Antonio/HKM-3586-2023","Venturini, Francesco/0000-0002-7295-268X; Madsen, Jakob/0000-0002-4952-3043","Australian Research Council [DP170100339, DP150100061]",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),This work was supported by the Australian Research Council [grant numbers DP170100339 and DP150100061 to J.B.M.].,,40,7,7,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The policies are surveyed, and the effects are estimated using microdata from the Labor Force Survey combined with data at the prefectural level on day care provision. A difference-in-difference (DD) method is applied to uncover the impacts of the Abe Cabinet's policies. The rapid increase in the provision of infant care, especially in the urban area, has contributed to a strong increase in the labor participation of mothers with young children. In addition, DD method estimates show a strong increase in mothers with infants staying in permanent-contract regular employment. A significant shortening of work hours of workers, especially of parents with infants, is observed, which enabled working mothers to maintain their employment status. A change in the gender wage gap in the Japanese labor market is observed, but much progress is still required to close the large wage gap.","[Nagase, Nobuko] Ochanomizu Univ, Tokyo, Japan",Ochanomizu University,"Nagase, N (通讯作者)，Ochanomizu Univ, Dept Social Sci & Family Studies, Bunkyo Ku, 2-1-1 Otsuka, Tokyo 1128610, Japan.",nagase.nobuko@ocha.ac.jp,,,Abe Fellowship; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15K03503]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03503] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Abe Fellowship; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author thanks Ayako Kondo, Masako Kurosawa, and other participants of the Asian Economic Policy Conference and the editors of the journal, especially Takatoshi Ito and Colin McKenzie, for their insightful and helpful comments.

In order to test these hypotheses, we have studied the effect of different economic and non-economic factors on subjective well-being using the database of the German Socio-Economic Panel. The methodology used is a Probit adapted to Ordinary Least Square (POLS). The main results show that the effect of absolute income on subjective well-being is different depending on the variable of social comparison considered. In addition, the absolute income does not exert the greatest impact on subjective well-being, but social contacts and having a good health.

Using OLS and instrumental variable methods, we find that each additional year of schooling in Tanzania increases earnings, on average, by 9 to 11%. We find that on average individuals underestimate returns to schooling by 74 to 79% and three factors are associated with these misperceptions: income, asset, poverty and educational attainment.

Large amounts of data regarding these debts are collected and stored by debt collection agencies. Early debt collection processes aim at collecting payments from creditors or debtors before the legal procedure starts. In order to be successful and be able to collect maximum debts, collection agencies need to use their human resources efficiently and communicate with the customers via the most convenient channel that leads to minimum costs. However, achieving these goals need processing, analyzing and evaluating customer data and inferring the right actions instantaneously. In this study, fuzzy inference based intelligent systems are used to empower early debt collection processes using the principles of data science. In the paper, an early debt collection system composed of three different Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), one for credit debts, one for credit card debts, and one for invoices, is developed. These systems use different inputs such as amount of loan, wealth of debtor, part history of debtor, amount of other debts, active customer since, credit limit, and criticality to determine the output possibility of repaying the debt. This output is later used to determine the most convenient communication channel and communication activity profile.","[Onar, Sezi Cevik; Oztaysi, Basar; Kahraman, Cengiz] Istanbul Tech Univ, Management Fac, Ind Engn Dept, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Kahraman, C (通讯作者)，Istanbul Tech Univ, Management Fac, Ind Engn Dept, TR-34367 Istanbul, Turkey.",kahramanc@itu.edu.tr,"Oztaysi, Basar/K-7498-2013; kahraman, cengiz/N-9259-2013; Onar, Sezi Cevik/B-4146-2015","Oztaysi, Basar/0000-0002-1090-7963; kahraman, cengiz/0000-0001-6168-8185; Onar, Sezi Cevik/0000-0001-6451-6709",TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) [3130638],TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),This work is supported in part by TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) project (3130638).,,33,4,4,2,6,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Moving averages are used in finance to smooth stock price series and forecast trend direction. We propose optimised custom moving average that is the most suitable for stock time series smoothing. Suitability criteria are defined by smoothness and accuracy. Previous research focused only on one of the two criteria in isolation. We define this as multi-criteria Pareto optimisation problem and compare the proposed method to the five most popular moving average met hods on synthetic and real world stock data. The comparison was performed using unseen data. The new method outperforms other methods in 99.5% of cases on synthetic and in 91% on real world data. The method allows better time series smoothing with the same level of accuracy as traditional methods, or better accuracy with the same smoothness.

Regions suffer from social and economic exclusion, which, in turn, induces high unemployment and crime rates, and leads to the flourishing of smuggling. The aim of this article is to estimate the level of the shadow economy in the regions of Lithuania over the period 2012 to 2016. The topic is very relevant to such transition economies as Lithuania with huge separation between regions and large cities. Deep social problems in regions, lack of job places and absence of investment along with high emigration rate and intensive population's movement to the largest cities lead to the growth of crime rate and high scope of the shadow economy. Calculations performed under the MIMIC model have shown that the share of indirect taxes, average income, the cases of cigarette smuggling, population of women per 1000 men, the number of criminal offences, children in social risk families and the number of tourists are the main causes for the emergence and growth/decline of the shadow economy level. The novelty of the article lies in the calculations that reveal a significantly higher level of the shadow economy in the regions than at the country level. Therefore, it is recommended to make calculations at the regional level in order to select measures to more effectively fight with the shadow. Identified reasons allow formulating the following recommendations for responsible authorities: increase efficiency in tax system, since current excise tax policy has a positive impact on the level of poverty, especially at regional level, deepening of social problems, which as a result contribute to the growth of shadow economy; encourage women occupancy and emancipation and attract funding from national and international projects, to promote equal rights in researched regions; increase the level of attractiveness and security level in cities, promote FDI to cities, and effectively use money from the EU Structural Funds.","[Remeikiene, Rita; Gaspareniene, Ligita] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rozsa, Zoltan] Sch Econ & Management Publ Adm Bratislava, Furdekova 16, Bratislava 85104, Slovakia; [Chadysas, Viktoras; Ginevicius, Romualdas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Remeikiene, R (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, V Kudirkos 18-2, LT-03105 Vilnius, Lithuania.",rita.remeikiene@laei.lt; zoltan@rozsa.sk; ligita.gaspareniene@laei.lt; viktoras.chadysas@vgtu.lt; romualdas.ginevicius@vgtu.lt,"Rozsa, Zoltan/E-1043-2013; Rózsa, Zoltán/GZK-6056-2022","Rozsa, Zoltan/0000-0002-5748-5702;",,,,,49,0,0,0,12,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In addition, the production of wine grapes is heavily regulated within the EU and there are complicated state-level policies in the United States designed to limit the retail availability of wine. There continues to be economic and political pressure for reform to the tariffs between the United States and the EU, and to the domestic regulations in each region. We carefully develop parameters to characterize the effects of tariffs and domestic regulations that affect production and consumption of wine in the two regions. Simulation results show that reductions in tariffs would have relatively small effects in EU and U.S. wine markets, whereas reductions in EU domestic policies that affect wine grape production would have much larger trade and welfare implications.","[Rickard, Bradley J.; Ho, Shuay-Tsyr] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Rickard, Bradley J.; Gergaud, Olivier; Livat, Florine] KEDGE Business Sch, Bordeaux, France",Cornell University; Kedge Business School,"Rickard, BJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.;Rickard, BJ (通讯作者)，KEDGE Business Sch, Bordeaux, France.",bjr83@cornell.edu,,,"National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [1008694]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [Hatch Project # 1008694];",,37,4,5,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

With this object, we use a classical demand model where national consumption depends on real GDP and real prices. In contrast to previous panel estimations in the literature, we highlight non-stationarity time series which can lead to spurious regressions. We explicitly take into account the issue by using recent panel cointegration techniques. Cointegration is present for printing paper and fibreboard, though less clear cut for other products. Then we estimate demand elasticities and find that GDP elasticities are significantly lower than estimates from the literature. Finally, we simulate the implications of modified demand elasticities by using a partial equilibrium model of the forest sector. For most products, changes in elasticities would lead to lower projected demand and lower prices over a 20-year time horizon. Lower demand for solid wood and wood fibre would lead to less tensions with fuel wood- and wood-based chemical markets. In a context of rising interest for renewable bio-based products, updated long-term demand models contribute to the analysis of the forest sector's sustainability.","[Rougieux, Paul] INRA AgroParisTech, Lab Econ Forestiere, UMR 356, Nancy, France; [Damette, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, Dept Econ, BETA CNRS, Nancy, France",INRAE; AgroParisTech; Universite de Lorraine,"Rougieux, P (通讯作者)，INRA AgroParisTech, Lab Econ Forestiere, UMR 356, Nancy, France.",paul.rougieux@univ-lorraine.fr,"Rougieux, Paul/ABF-5664-2021","Rougieux, Paul/0000-0001-9073-9826; Damette, Olivier/0000-0002-7520-3780","French Ministry of Agriculture [E 21/2014]; Greater Nancy area; French National Research Agency, Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Lab of Excellence ARBRE] [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01]","French Ministry of Agriculture; Greater Nancy area; French National Research Agency, Agence Nationale de la Recherche [Lab of Excellence ARBRE](Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This research was supported in part by the French Ministry of Agriculture under Grant [E 21/2014]; the Greater Nancy area; and a grant overseen by the French National Research Agency, Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-11-LABX-0002-01 Lab of Excellence ARBRE].",,54,8,8,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I determine ethnicity by students' last names, and I measure risk by students' propensity to give up a passing grade on a final exam in order to be able to retake the exam in pursuit of a higher grade, but with the risk of earning a lower grade and possibly not passing the course. Differences in preferences for risk may be part of the explanation for differential labour market outcomes between gender and ethnic groups. I find evidence that Ashkenazi men take more exam risk than both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi women, and Mizrahi men. This finding is consistent with the White-Male Effect', the notion that white males, or males from the dominant socio-economic group, perceive lower risks than females and non-whites.","[Sansani, Shahar] Coll Management, Acad Studies, Sch Econ, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel",,"Sansani, S (通讯作者)，Coll Management, Acad Studies, Sch Econ, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",sansanis@colman.ac.il,,,,,,,8,5,5,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Results suggest that the Czechia is the most fragmented and Finland is the most defragmented country in the sample. The analysis shows that though the expenditure decentralization in EU countries is quite high, the degree of revenue decentralization is low, the difference is about 13 percentage points.

In this paper we propose fuzzy approach for dynamic re-optimization of collection vehicles routes in the case when waste bins are equipped with fill level sensors. The idea is to analyse waste collection network served by fleet of vehicles which simultaneously possesses bin status information, and the other vehicles status. We consider collection process realized in dynamic environment where vehicles visit waste collection bins accordingly to predefined routes with opportunity of dynamically changing routes accordingly to the current bin status. We analyse effects of possible route changes which are determined by the proposed approach. Performances of the proposed algorithm, as well as the effects of the routes change strategies are illustrated on numerical example.","[Vidovic, Milorad; Radivojevic, Gordana; Ratkovic, Branislava; Bjelic, Nenad; Popovic, Drazen] Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Dept Logist, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Vidovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Dept Logist, Vojvode Stepe 305, Belgrade, Serbia.",m.vidovic@sf.bg.ac.rs; g.radivojevic@sf.bg.ac.rs; b.ratkovic@sf.bg.ac.rs; n.bjelic@sf.bg.ac.rs; d.popovic@sf.bg.ac.rs,"Popović, Dražen/Q-7273-2019; Bjelić, Nenad/ABA-4240-2020; Bjelic, Nenad/R-7550-2019",,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technical development of the Government of the Republic of Serbia [TR36005, TR36006]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technical development of the Government of the Republic of Serbia","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technical development of the Government of the Republic of Serbia through the project s TR36005 and TR36006, for the period 2011-2018.",,7,0,0,0,2,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-89962-08-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,380,389,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7OT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455265500051,0

Using static and dynamic panel data regression approaches, we show that the frequency, sentiment and timing of tweets posted about a film are correlated to different extent with the movie's box office revenues, with negative tweets being particularly damaging to the box office revenues.

As a result, the key issues of EIA problem are to represent and deal with the uncertain or fuzzy information. D numbers theory, as the extension of Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, is a desirable tool that can express uncertainty and fuzziness, both complete and incomplete, quantitative or qualitative. However, some shortcomings do exist in D numbers combination process, the commutative property is not well considered when multiple D numbers are combined. Though some attempts have made to solve this problem, the previous method is not appropriate and convenience as more information about the given evaluations represented by D numbers are needed. In this paper, a data-driven D numbers combination rule is proposed, commutative property is well considered in the proposed method. In the combination process, there does not require any new information except the original D numbers.

After controlling for partial state ownership, we find that personal political identity of entrepreneurs, a previously investigated dimension of political connections, becomes less important in explaining private enterprises' participation in barrier industries.

And we discuss the effects of relative overconfidence on asset price efficiency and trading volume. We find that when investors hold assets to maturity, relative overconfidence has no effect on price efficiency and trading volume; however, when investors speculate, relative overconfidence reduces price informativeness and trading volume, because investors will reckon asset prices as more noisy and find it meaningless to speculate on capital gains based on their private information.

Denmark is the only country with a fixed exchange-rate regime; all the other 18 countries have flexible exchange rates, mostly as part of an inflation-targeting (IT) framework. At the same time, Denmark is the worst growth performer of all. Our analysis indicates that the lack of monetary policy independence is central to understanding the meager Danish performance. Monetary easing during 2008-2009 is an important predictor of economic growth during 2008-2013, and Denmark, having outsourced monetary policy to the ECB, did not pursue monetary easing as aggressively as most other countries. In fact, the Danish Central Bank was forced to raise its policy interest rate in 2008Q4 in order to defend the euro-peg. Overall, the Danish experience serves as a reminder that fixed exchange rates can be quite taxing on economic growth in the aftermath of a huge negative shock.","[Andersen, Thomas Barnebeck; Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Andersen, TB (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",barnebeck@sam.sdu.dk; nmm@sam.sdu.dk,"Andersen, Thomas Barnebeck/JNE-6693-2023","Andersen, Thomas Barnebeck/0000-0002-7002-7087; Malchow-Moller, Nikolaj/0000-0001-5350-3152",,,,,31,1,1,0,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We find two main results: (i) providing information or eliciting beliefs about previous donations increases the likelihood of a donation, while thresholds have no effect; (ii) information about previous funding increases donations to organizations that received fewer donations in the past, while belief elicitation also increases donations to organizations that received most donations in the past, since individuals are more likely to donate to the organizations they rank first.","[Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Econ Law & Inst, Via Columbia 2, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Pelligra, Vittorio] Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Vle S Ignazio 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy; [Reggiani, Tommaso] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 507-41A, Brno 60200, Czech Republic; [Becchetti, Leonardo] CEIS, Rome, Italy; [Pelligra, Vittorio] CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy; [Reggiani, Tommaso] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Cagliari; Masaryk University Brno; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Pelligra, V (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, Dept Econ & Business, Vle S Ignazio 17, I-09123 Cagliari, Italy.;Pelligra, V (通讯作者)，CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy.",becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it; pelligra@unica.it; tommaso.reggiani@econ.muni.cz,"Reggiani, Tommaso/A-2216-2013","Reggiani, Tommaso/0000-0002-3134-1049; BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716; Pelligra, Vittorio/0000-0002-8012-4243",CSV-Sardegna Solidale,CSV-Sardegna Solidale,"We thank Maria Bigoni, Federico Revelli, Rainer Michael Rilke, Matteo Rizzolli, Robert Sudgen, Daniel Zizzo and an anonymous referee for helpful comments on a previous version of the paper, as well as the participants to the Behavioral Science and Policy-Network for the Integrated Behavioral Science Annual Conference, Nottingham, 21-23/04/2015.

The findings show that 4Ps, on average, increased school enrolment of children by 1.12 percent. It was also apparent that using student-level data as opposed to school-level data revealed a more robust effect of 4Ps on school outcomes.

Posing such questions is particularly important in the case of political and economic structures such as the European Union. The competitiveness of the economies is now one of the most frequently discussed topics. In this work, due to the context of the conducted research (international comparisons of the EU countries' economies) the competitiveness of international economies will be considered in terms of international competitive capacity. In addition to the problems associated with defining this concept, there are also important dilemmas concerned with the measurement of the competitiveness. In the performed comparative analyses of European economies the research results presented within reports of Global Competitiveness Index will be used. Purpose of the article: The main purpose of the paper is to conduct a multidimensional comparative analysis of the competitive capacity of the European Union countries and geographical regions of Europe. Methods: In the paper, to study the spatial differentiation of the EU countries and geographical regions of Europe in the context of their competitive capacity, the taxonomic measure of development based on median vector Weber was used. Findings & Value added: As a result, the classification and the typological groups of EU countries and geographical regions of Europe calculated on the basis of the features describing their competitive capacity arises. The value added of these research is the analysis of competitive capacity conducted not only for EU countries, but also for geographical regions of Europe. In the paper, the verification of criteria using by World Economic Forum to assess the competitive capacity of EU economies was also conducted. In this area of the research, because of high level of correlation, many features from initial database were deleted.","[Cheba, Katarzyna] West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Ul Janickiego 31, PL-71270 Szczecin, Poland; [Szopik-Depczynska, Katarzyna] Univ Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland",West Pomeranian University of Technology; University of Szczecin,"Cheba, K (通讯作者)，West Pomeranian Univ Technol Szczecin, Ul Janickiego 31, PL-71270 Szczecin, Poland.",katarzyna.cheba@zut.edu.pl,"Cheba, Katarzyna/H-4282-2016; Szopik-Depczynska, Katarzyna/AAZ-5033-2020","Cheba, Katarzyna/0000-0001-8753-7764; Szopik-Depczynska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-3054-0660",,,,,37,56,56,1,17,INST BADAN GOSPODARCZYCH,OLSZTYN,"UL KS ROBERTA BILITEWSKIEGO NR 5, LOK 19, OLSZTYN, 10-693, POLAND",2083-1277,2353-1827,,OECON COPERNIC,Oecon.

This entails the involvement of various categories of stakeholders. In this paper, a case study is used to explore how a work integration social enterprise based in the Netherlands, AutiTalent BV, has organized its governance. The Netherlands has not developed legislation specifically dealing with social enterprises, in contrast to many other EU Member States (16 out of 28), and it does not require, although it allows for, the establishment of inclusive governance. By examining how (national Dutch) law affects the governance of a work-integration-oriented social enterprise, the authors aim to contribute to emerging theory on participatory and inclusive governance of social enterprises - as a legal concept but also as an organizational concept - shaped by (tailor-made and/or ordinary) law. The case study reveals that the investigated work integration social enterprise has not set up formal inclusive governance, suggesting that a social enterprise may not be stimulated by legislation which allows but not requires the participation of stakeholders in decision making. At the same time, informal direct communication channels exist between the people who influence the decision-making processes and people from various stakeholder categories.","[Colenbrander, Aalt; Argyrou, Aikaterini; Lambooy, Tineke; Blomme, Robert J.] Nyenrode Business Univ, Breukelen, Netherlands",Nyenrode Business University,"Blomme, RJ (通讯作者)，Nyenrode Business Univ, Breukelen, Netherlands.",r.blomme@nyenrode.nl,,"lambooy, tineke/0000-0001-5059-4888",,,,,59,12,13,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Students with a disadvantaged background face an incentive to assimilate into the more advantaged group. The advantaged group chooses the cost of assimilation strategically to screen those who seek to assimilate. In equilibrium, only the most skilled disadvantaged students assimilate. This theory provides a novel explanation of the acting white problem. Acting white refers to a social phenomenon in which students from disadvantaged ethnicities suffer social sanctions if they obtain good grades. These sanctions raise the cost of acquiring the skills that make it easier to assimilate. Disadvantaged students with low ability impose these sanctions in order to induce their more able co-ethnics to stay in the disadvantaged group. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Auctions at the time of departure efficiently allocate space and a profit maximizing airline can capitalize on these gains by overbooking flights and repurchasing excess tickets from those passengers whose realized value is low. Nevertheless profit maximization entails distortions away from the efficient allocation. Under regularity conditions, we show that the optimal mechanism can be implemented by a modified double auction. In order to encourage early booking, passengers who purchase late are disadvantaged. In order to capture the information rents of passengers with high expected values, ticket repurchases at the time of departure are at a subsidized price, sometimes leading to unused capacity.

We build and estimate a two-country DSGE model with corporate and interbank cross-border loans, Core-Periphery diverging financial cycles and a national implementation of coordinated macroprudential measures based on Countercyclical Capital Buffers. We get three main results. First, targeting a national credit-to-GDP ratio should be favored to federal averages as this rule induces better stabilizing performances in front of important divergences in credit cycles between core and peripheral countries. Second, policies reacting to the evolution of national credit sup ply should be favored as the transmission channel of macroprudential policy directly impacts the marginal cost of loan production and, by so, financial intermediaries. Third, the interest of lifting up macroprudential policymaking to the supra-national level remains questionable for admissible value of international lending between Eurozone countries. In deed, national capital buffers reacting to the union-wide loan-to-GDP ratio only lead to the same stabilization results than the one obtained under the national reaction if cross-border lending reaches 45%. However, even if cross-border linkages are high enough to justify the implementation of a federal adjusted solution, the reaction to national lending conditions remains remarkably optimal.

However, estimating the effect of this policy on family outcomes turns out to be complicated. China had already enacted an aggressive family planning policy in the early 1970s, and its fertility rates had already dropped sharply before the enactment of the one-child policy. The one-child policy was also enacted at almost the same time as China's market-oriented economic reforms, which triggered several decades of rapid growth, which would also tend to reduce fertility rates. During the same period, a number of other developing countries in East Asia and around the world have also experienced sharp declines in fertility. Overall, finding defensible ways to identify the effect of China's one-child policy on family outcomes is a tremendous challenge. I expound the main empirical approaches to the identification of the effects of the one-child policy, with an emphasis on their underlying assumptions and limitations. I then turn to empirical results in the literature. I discuss the evidence concerning the effects of the one-child policy on fertility and how it might affect human capital investment in children. Finally I offer some new exploratory and preliminary estimates of the effects of the one-child policy on divorce, labor supply, and rural-to-urban migration.","[Zhang, Junsen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, JS (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Econ, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jszhang@cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,47,149,197,12,262,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

However, this view of fiscal consolidation processes is limited as it leaves out other aspects related to public sector performance which are relevant not only from the macroeconomic but also from the microeconomic perspective. This paper models Public Sector Performance (PSP) by proposing a theoretical framework that integrates the conventional methodology for measuring its productive efficiency and the monetary assessment of social welfare changes linked to public policy reforms. Two equivalent measures of social welfare change generated by improving (or worsening) productive efficiency are deduced using duality theory. The first is obtained from the cost function, while the second arises directly from the production function. The results reveal that taking advantage of budgetary savings obtained from this approach constitutes a valuable tool for designing welfareenhancing fiscal consolidation packages, meanwhile promoting sound fiscal balances and growth prospects over the long term.","[Onrubia-Fernandez, Jorge] Univ Complutense Madrid, FEDEA, Madrid, Spain; [Onrubia-Fernandez, Jorge; Sanchez Fuentes, A.

The results show that house prices and stock prices variables are stationary at their first difference, and Pedroni's heterogeneous cointegration test does not confirmed the long-run relationship between the two variables; hence, it is imperative to employed dynamic OLS estimator for robust statistical inference. The results of dynamic OLS (DOLS) reveal that, among 22 countries, there are five countries which show the negative association between house prices and stock prices, while except France and Italy, the remaining 15 countries show the positive relationship between the variables. There is no significant relationship observed in the case of France and Italy. The panel results confirmed the negative impact of house prices on stock prices in the region.

This paper improves the existing literature by performing a static and dynamic panel analysis of the effect of a set of political variables on the level of fiscal transparency in 36 democratic countries. By using a recent measure of fiscal transparency based on IMF Governance Finance Statistics and available from 2003 to 2013, we find strong links between political environments and the dynamics of fiscal disclosure. Our results show that government control over the legislature exerts some negative effect on fiscal transparency, while the effect of government ideology is shown to be at least fragile. Furthermore we find that legislature fragmentation exerts a negative effect on fiscal transparency, which suggests that competition within the parliaments does not increase fiscal transparency, but instead it induces governments to react by reducing accessibility to information.","[Cicatiello, Lorenzo; Gaeta, Giuseppe Lucio] Univ Naples Orientale, Dept Human & Social Sci, Naples, Italy; [De Simone, Elina] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Naples, Italy; [Gaeta, Giuseppe Lucio] C MET05 Inter Univ, Ctr Appl Econ Studies Ind Policy Local Dev & Inte, Ferrara, Italy",University of Naples L'Orientale; Parthenope University Naples,"Cicatiello, L (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Orientale, Dept Human & Social Sci, Naples, Italy.",lcicatiello@unior.it; elina.desimone@uniparthenope.it; glgaeta@unior.it,"Gaeta, Giuseppe Lucio/GPT-1071-2022; Cicatiello, Lorenzo/H-7611-2019","Cicatiello, Lorenzo/0000-0003-0217-5579; De Simone, Elina/0000-0002-0274-2062",University of Naples Parthenope,University of Naples Parthenope,"The authors would like to thank all the participants to the 2016 New Public Sector Seminar on Transparency and Trust in Public Services, Francesca di Iorio and the anonimous reviewers for the many insightful comments on this work.

We develop a model with product upgrades and costly bargaining and find that tax rate pass-through only partially characterizes the welfare impact of taxation; consumers may respond to a tax or subsidy by changing product quality or by changing their bargaining effort. We apply the insights of our theory to the study of subsidies for green goods, specifically hybrid electric vehicles in Canada. We utilize highly detailed transaction data and leverage panel variation in subsidies across provinces for identification. Our baseline estimate finds that prices rises by $570 for every $1000 increase in the subsidy. But, this pass through estimate substantially underestimates consumer gains because a majority of this price increase ($459-approximate to 80%) is due to increased product quality in the form of additional options and features.

The optimal tax on externalities is non-linear, thus, not implementable through tradable pollution rights alone, and lower than the Pigouvian tax for two reasons: first, higher outside financing creates additional deadweight loss; second, tax-induced reallocation of resources reduces average productive efficiency.

This paper follows up on Assenza et al. (2013) by using a Genetic Algorithms (GA) model to replicate the results from their LtF experiment. In this GA model, individuals optimize an adaptive, a trend following and an anchor coefficient in a population of general prediction heuristics. We replicate experimental treatments in a New-Keynesian environment with increasing complexity and use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well the model explains the experimental data. We find that the evolutionary learning model is able to replicate the three different types of behavior, i.e. convergence to steady state, stable oscillations and dampened oscillations in the treatments using one GA model. Heterogeneous behavior can thus be explained by an adaptive, anchor and trend extrapolating component and the GA model can be used to explain heterogeneous behavior in LtF experiments with different types of complexity.","[Hommes, Cars; Makarewicz, Tomasz] Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hommes, Cars] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Massaro, Domenico] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Complex Lab Econ, Milan, Italy; [Smits, Tom] SEO Amsterdam Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Hommes, C (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, CeNDEF, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Hommes, C (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",C.H.Hommes@uva.nl,,"Massaro, Domenico/0000-0001-9652-1174; Hommes, Cars/0000-0002-2260-2665","EU FP7 project Integrated Macro-Financial Modeling for Robust Policy Design (MACFINROBODS) [612796]; Ministry of Education, Universities and Research of Italy (MIUR), program SIR [RBSI144KWH]","EU FP7 project Integrated Macro-Financial Modeling for Robust Policy Design (MACFINROBODS); Ministry of Education, Universities and Research of Italy (MIUR), program SIR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the EU FP7 project Integrated Macro-Financial Modeling for Robust Policy Design (MACFINROBODS, grant 612796) and the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research of Italy (MIUR), program SIR (grant RBSI144KWH).",,25,7,7,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

However, search and matching theory indicates that certain shocks may affect unemployment and vacancies in the same way. I trace the effects of both types of shocks affecting the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate using U.S. data. I impose common factor restrictions in an unobserved component model and sign restrictions in a vector autoregressive model. I derive negatively and positively-correlated components of vacancies and unemployment. The negatively-sloped Beveridge curve is the result of an aggregate labour demand shock. This shock also causes some more long-lasting effects for vacancies and unemployment, the 'loops' around the Beveridge curve. The shock that creates a positive co-movement between vacancies and unemployment is due to matching efficiency and job destruction. This positive co-movement occurs after recessions and in the long run.","[Pater, Robert] Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Econ, Ul Sucharskiego 2, PL-35225 Rzeszow, Poland",University of Information Technology & Management Rzeszow,"Pater, R (通讯作者)，Univ Informat Technol & Management, Dept Econ, Ul Sucharskiego 2, PL-35225 Rzeszow, Poland.",rpater@wsiz.rzeszow.pl,"Pater, Robert/AAC-7854-2021","Pater, Robert/0000-0001-7619-9843",Statutory Funds of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Information Technology and Management,Statutory Funds of the Faculty of Economics at the University of Information Technology and Management,"Department of Economics, University of Information Technology and Management, Ul.

Our new data for Britain have the advantages of covering the whole population of non-trivial estates, in contrast to much of the US literature based on the small fraction of the population covered by estate tax returns, and of containing fuller information on charitable intent.

This result is robust to controlling for a large set of geographical, climatic, historical, and institutional variables. Two main mechanisms could explain this reduced-form relationship. First, genetic distance to the world technological frontier can affect the onset of the fertility transition through its impact on the timing and intensity of technology adoption. Second, genetic distance to the technological frontier can capture other cultural differences and the process of diffusion of cultural norms that are related to fertility but not through technology adoption.

We find a negative relationship between business cycle and bank risk-taking, indicating that financial stability is procyclical. In addition, the study shows that lending activity increases risk-taking while rising capital requirements boost financial stability. Moreover, our findings suggest positive co-movements between the business cycle and lending, compared to bank's capital, whereby the procyclicality of lending and bank capital have negative effects on the financial stability of commercial banks in the Eurozone. We notice then that the cyclical behavior of commercial banks, in terms of capital requirements and lending activities, depends on their size. Therefore, lending and capital of smaller banks are procyclical while lending and capital of larger banks are countercyclical. Finally, we find the Troika institutions' bailouts programs significantly impacted banking stability in the Eurozone.","[Ben Bouheni, Faten] ISC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France; [Hasnaoui, Amir] Grp Sup Co La Rochelle, La Rochelle, France",,"Ben Bouheni, F (通讯作者)，Blvd Ft Vaux, F-75017 Paris, France.",fben-bouheni@iscparis.com; hasnaouia@esc-larochelle.fr,"HASNAOUI, Amir/AGH-3592-2022; Bouheni, Faten Ben/AAT-3336-2021; Ben Bouheni, Faten/JXW-7467-2024","HASNAOUI, Amir/0000-0002-7998-6866; Ben Bouheni, Faten/0000-0002-2781-7147",,,,,71,21,22,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We analyze the relationship between the timing of college enrollment, educational outcomes, and the timing of family formation decisions in early adulthood. We use variation in college admission requirements to shed light on this issue. We employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effects of being above the admission requirement for one's preferred college program on college enrollment decisions and the timing of family formation. Based on the analysis on enrollment and auxiliary analyses on labor market participation and earnings, we find that being above the admission requirement mainly affects the timing of college enrollment and not the college-going decision. Being above the admission requirement speeds up college enrollment, college completion and labor market entry. We find that being above the admission requirement has substantial effects on the timing of family formation, for example being above the admission requirement increases the number of children 8 years after year of application by about 0.1 corresponding to an increase of about 40 percent. Our results suggest that career postponements such as delays in the educational system can have large effects on family decision-making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper analyzes the value of climate services which are aimed at improving agricultural productivity through a reduction in weather-associated risks. The first part provides a theoretical foundation for estimating the value of climate services based on a stochastic life-cycle model of a rural household which faces uncertainty with respect to the timing and the size of an adverse weather shock. We subsequently calibrate the model to match the environment of coffee producers in the Cusco region of Peru and provide a range of estimates for the value of climate services for a single average household, the region, and the country as a whole. In the second part of the paper we use empirical data to corroborate the numerical estimates. We assess the value of climate services in the agricultural sector in Cusco based on a choice experiment approach. Data are analyzed using a standard as well as a random parameter logit model allowing for preference heterogeneity. Farmers show a significant willingness-to-pay for enhanced climate services which is particularly related to the service accuracy and geographic resolution. On average, the yearly value of a climate service in the coffee sector is found to be $21 per ha and $8.2 million for Peru as a whole. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Estimates from the literature suggest that high-paying professions have negative externalities, whereas low-paying professions have positive externalities. A calibrated model therefore prescribes negative marginal tax rates on middle-class incomes and positive rates on the rich. The welfare gains from implementing such a policy are small and are dwarfed by the gains from profession-specific taxes and subsidies. These results depend crucially on externality estimates and labor substitution patterns across professions, both of which are very uncertain given existing empirical evidence.","[Lockwood, Benjamin B.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nathanson, Charles G.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Weyl, E.

We are the first to document this macroeconomic repercussion of the sectoral shift away from the secondary sector toward the tertiary sector, that is, of deindustrialization and the rise of services. We distinguish between nontradable services and all other sectors, using U.S. state-level employment data for post-1960 recessions. Concerns over the endogeneity of services are addressed in two ways: by using 3-year prerecession averages of sector shares, and separately by invoking instrumental variables. Our results are robust to alternative specifications. The increase in service production and deindustrialization in the United States over the last half-century lengthens the trough-to-peak employment recovery from recessions by about 40%.","[Olney, Martha L.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Pacitti, Aaron] Siena Coll, Dept Econ, Business, Loudonville, NY 12210 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Olney, ML (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",olney@berkeley.edu; apacitti@siena.edu,,,Berkeley Economic History Lab,Berkeley Economic History Lab,"Funding for research assistance provided by Berkeley Economic History Lab.

Principals write contracts based on both absolute and relative performance evaluations (APE and RPE, respectively) to make individually optimal risk-return trade-offs but do not take into account their impact on endogenously determined aggregate variables. This results in contractual externalities when these aggregate variables are used as benchmarks in contracts. Contractual externalities have welfare changing effects when principals put too much weight on APE or RPE due to information frictions. Relative to the second best, if the expected productivity is high, risk-averse principals over-incentivize their own agents, triggering a rat race in effort exertion, resulting in over-investment in effort and excessive exposure to industry risks. The opposite occurs when the expected productivity is low, inducing pro-cyclical investment and risk-taking behaviours.","[Ozdenoren, Emre; Yuan, Kathy] London Business Sch, London, England; [Ozdenoren, Emre; Yuan, Kathy] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA; [Yuan, Kathy] FMG, London, England",University of London; London Business School; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Ozdenoren, E (通讯作者)，London Business Sch, London, England.;Ozdenoren, E (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",,"Ozdenoren, Emre/HTS-7576-2023",,ERC [617106]; ESRC [ES/K002309/1]; ESRC [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002309/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank the Editor, Philipp Kircher, three anonymous referees, Ulf Axelson, Patrick Bolton, Peter Kondor, Thomas Mariotti, Ailsa Roell, Oguzhan Ozbas, Vania Stavrakeva, Gunter Strobl, and seminar participants at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Economics, HKUST, Hong Kong University, Imperial College, London School of Economics, London Business School, Shanghai Advance Institute of Finance (SAIF), European Finance Association Meeting 2013, and European Winter Finance Meeting 2014 for helpful comments, Oleg Rubanov for excellent research assistance, and ERC (617106) and ESRC (ES/K002309/1) for funding support.",,60,9,9,2,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

All this is with optimized feedback policy rules. On the other hand, fiscal consolidation hurts both countries and all the time, if it is implemented in an ad hoc way, like an increase in taxes. The least distorting fiscal mix from the point of view of both countries is the one which, during the early phase of pain, Italy cuts public consumption spending to address its debt problem and, at the same time, reduces income tax rates, while, once its debt has been reduced in the later phase, it uses the fiscal space to further cut income taxes.

Factor model methods provide a more flexible way of addressing concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity that are robust to critiques from either side of the debate. The factor model estimators produce minimum wage-employment elasticity estimates that are much smaller than the traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) results and are not statistically different from zero. These results hold for many specifications and datasets from the minimum wage-employment literature.

It is argued that when the choice of unit versus ad valorem taxes affects longer-term decisions beyond the customary price or quantity decisions, the mix of the two taxes co-determines market conduct. This gives ad valorem taxes an anti-competitive effect that harms ad valorem taxes' efficiency in comparison with unit taxes. We show that a mix of the taxes-or a unit tax alone if we compare one or the other of the taxes-is sometimes welfare superior on account of consumer-price and tax revenue effects. A practical implication of our findings is that pass-through rates are only sometimes useful guides for policy. In fact, we show when the proper response to demand for higher revenue is a higher unit tax rate and a lower ad valorem tax rate.","[Vetter, Henrik] Statsbiblioteket, Victor Albecks Vej 1, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,"Vetter, H (通讯作者)，Statsbiblioteket, Victor Albecks Vej 1, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",hv@statsbiblioteket.dk,,,,,,,22,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

This insightful approach allows us to offer a global and disaggregate analysis of mobility as proportionate change in inequality and hence provide the reader with a full set of information to make his/her own judgment about the extent of mobility and country ranking. Specifically, we investigate the degree to which mobility is driven by low or high earners and how this picture changes across three different earnings measures: full-time full-year working, adding part-time working and then part-year working. Our results draw out some general key facts. First of all the vast bulk of the measured mobility occurs in the tails especially the lower tail with at least half of the index driven by mobility in the bottom earning quintile. Second, in the top 20 percent of the distribution there are few movements of earnings that effect the level of permanent inequality except in Denmark. Third, no country has a clear dominance for mobility across the full earnings distribution but Denmark differs from the other countries with clearly greater mobility in the middle and at the top. Finally, we find that with the exception of Denmark and Italy, mobility does not lead to clear convergence to the mean but rather to points around 0.7-0.8 and 1.5 to 2 times the mean.","[Vittori, Claudia; Gregg, Paul] Univ Bristol, Ctr Market & Publ Org, Bristol, Avon, England; [Gregg, Paul] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bath,"Vittori, C (通讯作者)，Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",claudia.vittori@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Anecdotal evidence suggests the presence of mean reversion in stock prices and return predictability over horizons longer than 10 years, but thus far, there is no empirical evidence confirming such anecdotal evidence. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature. Specifically, using 141 years of data, this paper begins by performing formal tests of the random walk hypothesis in the prices of the real S&P Composite Index over increasing time horizons of up to 40 years. Although our results cannot support the conventional wisdom that the stock market is safer for long-term investors, our findings speak in favor of the mean reversion hypothesis. In particular, we find statistically significant in-sample evidence that past 15-17 year returns are able to predict the future 15-17 year returns. This finding is robust to the choice of data source, deflator, and test statistic. The paper continues by investigating the out-of-sample performance of long-horizon return forecasting based on the mean-reverting model. These latter tests demonstrate that the forecast accuracy provided by the mean-reverting model is statistically significantly better than the forecast accuracy provided by the naive historical-mean model. Moreover, we show that the predictive ability of the mean-reverting model is economically significant and translates into substantial performance gains.","[Zakamulin, Valeriy] Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Serv Box 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway",University of Agder,"Zakamulin, V (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, Sch Business & Law, Serv Box 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",Valeri.Zakamouline@uia.no,,"Zakamulin, Valeriy/0000-0002-8619-7283",,,,,74,5,8,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

However additional choice is not an unmixed blessing as it creates challenges related to both consumer confusion and adverse selection. There is mounting evidence that many people have difficulty understanding the value of insurance coverage, like evaluating the relative benefits of lower premiums versus lower deductibles. Also, in most US health insurance markets, people cannot be charged different prices for insurance based on their individual level of health risk. This creates the potential for well-known problems of adverse selection because people will often base the level of health insurance coverage they choose partly on their health status. In this essay, we examine how the forces of consumer confusion and adverse selection interact with each other and with market institutions to affect how valuable it is to have multiple levels of health insurance coverage available in the market.","[Ericson, Keith Marzilli] Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Markets Publ Policy & Law, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Sydnor, Justin] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Business, Risk Management & Insurance, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ericson, Keith Marzilli; Sydnor, Justin] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ericson, KM (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Questrom Sch Business, Markets Publ Policy & Law, Boston, MA 02215 USA.;Ericson, KM (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kericson@bu.edu; justin.sydnor@wisc.edu,,"Ericson, Keith/0000-0002-5053-2385",,,,,46,29,35,2,19,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

While we confirm the positive impact of financial development on the level of trade openness, our findings reveal that the marginal effect decreases considerably with the size of the financial sector. The study contributes to two different strands of the economic literature: First, while widely examined in the finance-growth nexus literature, the discovered non-linearities have been neglected so far in studies on the link between finance and trade. Second, the diminishing marginal effect of finance appears to be an important factor in explaining the recent slowdown in global trade growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most efficient and effective ways to ease energy shortage is to sufficiently reduce energy intensity. In the extant literature on the influential factors of China's energy intensity, the regional imbalance and spatial spillover effects were basically ignored, which may yield to biased and unreasonable results. As a result, in this paper, the driving forces of China's provincial energy intensity were for the first time investigated by combining the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)-Malmquist and spatial panel approaches for the period between 2000 and 2014. The results indicate that technological progress plays a dominant role in decreasing China's overall energy intensity. In both the Eastern and Central regions, the technological progress and its components can decrease energy intensity, while this effect doesnot significantly exist in the Western region. Rapid industrialization should be responsible for China's currently high energy intensity, while energy price hiking is conducive to the decrease in energy intensity. Moreover, there is also clear evidence that these factors influence on energy intensity partly through the spatial spillover effects.","[Huang, Junbing; Du, Dan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hao, Yu] Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Huang, JB (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Hao, Y (通讯作者)，Sustainable Dev Res Inst Econ & Soc Beijing, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",20701432@bit.edu.cn; 781007193@qq.com; haoyuking@163.com,"Hao, Yu/ABF-4628-2021","Hao, Yu/0000-0001-8394-4215","Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities [JBK1507164]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403015, 71521002]",Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This paper is supported by Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities (No. JBK1507164) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403015, 71521002).

There is a negative and significant correlation between the interaction variable migration rate-natural resources and the probability of outbreak of civil wars, showing that the effect of natural resources is conditional on the migration rate. Simulations to quantify the marginal effects of the interaction term show that a migration rate equal to 6% or higher dampens the effect of natural resources on civil wars. To address the potential endogeneity problem in estimating the relationship between civil conflicts and migration, although I distinguish economic migrants from refugees, I also use an IV approach. In this respect, the negative effect of the two interacting variables on the probability of outbreak of civil wars remains robust after having instrumented the migration rate by using the gravity-based predicted emigration rate. Given the endogenous nature of the ratio of primary exports to GDP, in addition, the study directly utilizes the emigration rates as an alternate robust method to estimate the primary issue on civil conflicts. The results show that only the civil conflicts caused by natural resources are negatively impacted by emigration rates.","[Issifou, Ismael] Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France",Universite de Orleans; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Issifou, I (通讯作者)，Univ Orleans, CNRS, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France.",ismael.issifou@univ-orleans.fr,,"Issifou, Ismael/0000-0002-7267-2266",,,,,63,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0939-3625,1878-5433,,ECON SYST,Econ.

It identifies a reason for strategic overinvestment by the domestic industry, leading to permissive regulation in the absence of ISDS. An ideal investor-state dispute settlement arrangement (efficiency- oriented, transaction cost free, with untouchable, fully reliable, and unbiased judges) has positive and negative effects in this framework. It generates an equal level playing field for domestic and foreign investors, but it magnifies an existing overinvestment problem and may reduce world welfare. The results explain anecdotal evidence according to which ISDS that protects foreign investors is liked by the domestic industry and disliked by other interest groups in the host country.

A significant assumption was that the proposed method does not require any prolonged or expensive research and that it also allows to add other research tools (like e.g. an eyetracker) if need be. The chosen research topic also constitutes an alternative to the usage of advertising value equivalency, as it is not considered a reliable indicator of effectiveness of sponsorship campaigns. Purpose of the article: The central aim of this research study was to evaluate the feasibility of assessing costs incurred by sponsors of sports events as the price of gaining recognisability of their brands by television audiences watching broadcasts of sponsored events. Methods: The research was conducted on the basis of a questionnaire which gave data concerning spontaneous and assisted recognisability of sponsors' brands. Participants consisted of viewers who had watched volleyball match indicated by the investigator. The research also included data obtained from source materials, concerning the costs of sponsorship agreements and viewership of chosen volleyball matches. Findings & Value added: The investigation revealed that it is possible to calculate the costs of reaching television audiences of sports events effectively, i.e. where audiences are given the opportunity to recognize a brand as a sponsor of a given sports event. Results of the research offer sponsorship campaign managers a possibility to compare the costs incurred to reach their target group as part of a specific campaign, with other similar campaigns undertaken by a particular company, as well as with the results achieved by other sponsors of the same events.","[Kucharski, Michal] Jerzy Kukuczka Acad Phys Educ Katowice, Katowice, Poland; [Kot, Sebastian] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Czestochowa, Poland; [Kot, Sebastian] North West Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Potchefstroom, South Africa",Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The analysis here is using data from the two-day Puget Sound Transportation Panel (PSTP) travel diary and 230 households participating in all ten waves of the panel. The main objective of this analysis is to identify what triggers behavioral change in activity and travel and to quantify and compare the size of these triggering effects using different methods. Our search for triggers includes the birth of a child, child leaving the household, and the entry or exit from the labor force of a household member. In the land use changes we identify moves from high accessibility and diverse environments to lower accessibility and less diverse places and find that diversity is key in changing behavior. The method used to analyze the data is a longitudinal Mixed Markov Latent Class analysis that allows to not only account for behavioral heterogeneity at each time of observation but to also test for the existence of multiple latent trajectories of change and the role played by triggers in shaping these trajectories.","[Lee, Jae Hyun] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, GeoTrans Lab, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",lee@geog.ucsb.edu; awdavis@geog.ucsb.edu; goulias@geog.ucsb.edu,"Lee, Jae Hyun/ABH-9059-2020","Lee, Jae Hyun/0000-0003-4007-7048; Goulias, Konstadinos/0000-0002-7436-9447",,,,,44,4,5,1,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

Our results suggest that Ricardian Equivalence does not hold on average: tax changes have a significant and strong impact on consumption choice. Using individual consumption time series, the behaviour of.56% of our subjects can be classified as inconsistent with the Ricardian Equivalence proposition. Classifying subjects according to rules of thumb that best describe their behaviour, we find that subjects switch less to rules that theoretically violate Ricardian Equivalence in later rounds compared to earlier rounds. This implies that some subjects learn to comply with Ricardian Equivalence by changing their consumption strategy.

In 1998 a long-term management plan was adopted to restore and preserve the swamp without evaluating the potential welfare benefits of the plan. This paper employs the contingent valuation method to estimate the total economic value of the restoration and preservation of Pekapeka Swamp. Data required for the analysis was generated using a survey questionnaire administered by mail to 958 households in the Hawke's Bay region in 2008. An effective response rate of 42% was achieved after a second reminder. Using a dichotomous choice format with a follow-up open-ended valuation question, this study shows that, based on the population of the Hawke's Bay region, the estimated total economic value ranges from NZ$1.64 million to NZ$3.78 million per year and the net present value ranges between NZ$5.05 million and NZ$16.39 million. These results imply that the restoration and preservation of Pekapeka Swamp is an important investment which the authorities should continue to support. These estimates may be used to justify future increases in the level of expenditure on the project. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Why do some nations report such high levels of mental well-being? Denmark, for instance, regularly tops the league table of rich countries' happiness; Britain and the US enter further down; some nations do unexpectedly poorly. The explanation for the long-observed ranking - one that holds after adjustment for GDP and other socioeconomic variables - is currently unknown. Using data on 131 countries, the article cautiously explores a new approach. It documents three forms of evidence consistent with the hypothesis that some nations may have a genetic advantage in well-being.","[Proto, Eugenio; Oswald, Andrew J.] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; ESRC Ctr Competit Adv Global Econ, Coventry, W Midlands, England; IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Warwick; University of Warwick; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Oswald, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",andrew.oswald@warwick.ac.uk,"Oswald, Andrew/AAT-9888-2021","Proto, Eugenio/0000-0001-7766-6503",UK Economic and Social Research Council of the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council of the CAGE Centre at the University of Warwick; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This manuscript has been in construction for some years (the first working-paper version was in 2012).

The complexity approach can account for a set of attributes that evolutionary economics has been considering, as decentralized interaction, heterogeneous agents, bounded rationality, networks of linkages, non-linear dynamics, divergent paths, disequilibrium and emergent properties. In this regard, the complexity approach could be a theoretical and conceptual starting point that allows the integration of different contributions (Davis, 2008; Fontana, 2013). In this article, we attempt to show that complexity can also be useful to point out the profound differences between evolutionary strands. This paper analyzes how the ontological evolutionary assumptions of complexity are emphasized with different intensity by different groups of representative contributions of evolutionary economics. We propose that these differences reflect deeper issues related to two major concerns of economic theory: coordination and order vs. transformation and change of economic systems (Dosi and Orsenigo 1988). In this context, the hypothesis of the article is that complexity acts as an umbrella and at the same time as a differentiating criterion of different strands within evolutionary economics, since their ontological assumptions relate differentially to these two concerns. Using a bibliometric methodology, we identify a set of representative contributions for five strands of evolutionary economics. Additionally, we analyze how the various dimensions and attributes of complexity ontology are emphasized unevenly by each group of contributions. To show the differences, we quote fragments from contributions corresponding to the dimensions and attributes of the complexity and use a set of nonparametric tests to corroborate the significance of the differences in the frequency in which these references appear. The results show that, while groups concerned with coordination are focused on heterogeneity and networks assumptions, groups concerned with transformation stress path dependence and divergent dynamics. Emergent properties are common to all of them.","[Robert, Veronica] Idaes UNSAM Conicet, Sarmiento 2549 5 C, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Yoguel, Gabriel; Lerena, Octavio] IdeI UNGS, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",,"Robert, V (通讯作者)，Idaes UNSAM Conicet, Sarmiento 2549 5 C, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",vrobert@gmail.com,"; Lerena, Octavio/AAA-2569-2021","Yoguel, Gabriel/0000-0003-1916-418X; Robert, Veronica/0000-0003-3069-6486; Lerena, Octavio/0000-0002-3378-9891","Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de la Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnica, Argentina [0833]","Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de la Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnica, Argentina","This study was funded by Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de la Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnica, Argentina (Grant number: PICT 2012 No0833).",,100,19,21,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We consider both symmetric and asymmetric starting points with regards to the amount of initial knowledge firms have before conducting R&D and look at how differences in starting positions affect the willingness of firms to share knowledge. We investigate when and if firms find R&D cooperation beneficial and how investment in R&D is affected by the outcome of the sharing decisions. The experimental evidence shows that overall subjects tend to behave consistently with theoretical predictions for the sharing of knowledge, although leaders who are not compensated by a side payment from laggards are more willing to share than predicted by the theory, and leaders who are compensated are less willing. The data on investment suggests less investment with sharing than without, consistent with theory. Compared to exact numerical predictions, there is overinvestment or underinvestment except for symmetric firms under no sharing. All cases of overinvestment and underinvestment, regardless of sharing or not and regardless of starting positions, are well explained by smoothed-out best (quantal) responses.","[Roelofs, Matthew R.] Western Washington Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Ostbye, Stein E.; Heen, Eirik E.] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Sch Business & Econ, Tromso, Norway",Western Washington University; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Roelofs, MR (通讯作者)，Western Washington Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",matthew.roelofs@wwu.edu,,,School of Business and Economics at UiT-The Arctic University of Norway,School of Business and Economics at UiT-The Arctic University of Norway,"We would like to thank the editor of this journal and two anonymous referees for their constructive suggestions that greatly improved the paper.

Using panel data techniques we find that a permanent reduction in the tariff rate will significantly increase short-run income inequality. To obtain further insight into how the distribution of income is affected, we also estimate the impact of tariffs on income shares by quintiles. We find that the relative income of the lowest quintile is the most adversely affected, while the greatest beneficiaries are the agents in the second richest quintile. By adopting a panel data approach, and including a wide range of control variables, we are confident that these findings reflect causal effects rather than merely reflecting spurious correlations. We also find that reducing tariffs will likely increase long-run income inequality, although these results are less conclusive. The empirical evidence provides some support for the proposition that the speed with which, and the initial level from which, the tariff is adjusted affects income inequality. Finally, our empirical analysis confirms the conventional result that tariff reductions have an expansionary effect on aggregate output. This suggests that tariff reduction involves at least a short-run tradeoff between increasing the level of economic activity coupled with more income inequality.","[Rojas-Vallejos, Jorge] Pontificia Univ Catolica Valparaiso, Valparaiso, Chile; [Turnovsky, Stephen J.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Turnovsky, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",jorge.rojas@pucv.cl; sturn@uw.edu,"Rojas-Vallejos, Jorge/X-8693-2019","Rojas-Vallejos, Jorge/0000-0002-5939-3035",Chilean Government; Van Voorhis endowment at the University of Washington; University of Washington,Chilean Government; Van Voorhis endowment at the University of Washington; University of Washington(University of Washington),"Rojas-Vallejos's research was supported in part by the BecasChile Scholarship Program of the Chilean Government and the Grover and Creta Ensley Fellowship of the University of Washington.

During the first years of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) were only slightly affected by its negative impacts. However, after 2013, a considerable growth slowdown period has evolved in these countries with the exception of the Indian economy. In the current study, we examine whether the growth dynamics of the BRICS economies shows significant correlation with the fluctuation of commodity prices, especially in the case of raw materials. Besides applying a cross correlation model on the quarterly commodity price indices and real GDP growth data, the research also focuses on the export structure of the selected fast-growing countries. As a closing element of our paper, a brief analysis is carried out regarding the correlations of growth patterns within the BRICS economies.","[Soreg, Krisztina] Natl Univ Publ Serv, Doctoral Sch Publ Adm Sci, Budapest, Hungary",Ludovika University of Public Service,"Soreg, K (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Publ Serv, Doctoral Sch Publ Adm Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",soreg.krisztina@uni-nke.hu,,"Soreg, Krisztina/0000-0003-1229-431X",,,,,22,1,1,0,9,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

COOPER; MANAGERIAL DISPOSABILITY; RADIAL MEASUREMENT; UNIFIED EFFICIENCY; CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY; UNDESIRABLE CONGESTION,"This study discusses a use of DEA environmental assessment in a time horizon. We use a radial approach to examine a dynamic change of index measures related to China's regional development and industrial pollution prevention. In applying the proposed assessment to a time-series data, we need to examine components that produce a shift of an efficiency frontier in a time horizon. A unique feature of the proposed assessment is that it incorporates a framework of Malmquist index to examine the frontier shift among multiple periods. Here, the frontier shift indicates a progress potential on technology development and/or managerial improvement among observed periods. Thus, it is not an efficiency measure: Rather, the measurement eliminates inefficiency by shifting an organization to an efficiency frontier. In this study, the index is conceptually separated into 6 sub-components, which are further disaggregated into 12 different elements (6 subcomponents x 2 disposability concepts) under natural and managerial disposability concepts. The proposed index measurement needs to consider a possible occurrence of a frontier crossover among different periods because technology diffusion on production activities usually has a time lag until it becomes really effective. Methodologically, this study conveys the message that DEA is an approximation method, so being not perfect. Therefore, it is necessary for us to use several different approaches (e.g., potential improvement by measuring a frontier shift and efficiency analysis) to obtain reliable empirical evidence. As an application, this study examines the level of sustainability related to 30 municipalities and provinces in China from 2003 to 2014. The following six policy implications are obtained in this study. First, all municipalities and provinces have made a considerable progress on their economies and pollution prevention efforts. Second, the effect of the frontier crossover is limited in China because they attain a high level of their potentials on economic development and pollution prevention. Of course, this effort is within the Chinese boundary, not international, because this study does not compare them with other industrial nations. Third, China needs to allocate its resources to western provinces at a level that it has used for coastal developments. Fourth, the government should reinforce efforts on environmental protection in central and southern regions. Fifth, the government has focused on the sustainability development in urban municipalities and provinces and then has gradually shifted the policy influence toward rural areas. Finally, different empirical results are confirmed by the potential analysis which consists of the Malmquist index measurement and the efficiency analysis. Both approaches need to be examined for future planning on Chinese regional development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These papers estimate causal effects of policies by exploiting policy changes, which is a more credible identification strategy than those applied in earlier observational studies. The literature on parental leave finds that a more generous leave package tends to delay mothers' return to work, but it does not have detrimental effects on maternal labour supply in the medium to long run. Some papers also find that provision of job protection for around 1year can increase maternal employment, but longer job protection has little additional effects. The literature on childcare policies finds that maternal employment does not necessarily increase, because the expansion of childcare may crowd out informal childcare arrangements, such as care provided by grandparents. Findings by recent papers on Japan are largely consistent with the international evidence.","[Yamaguchi, Shintaro] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Yamaguchi, S (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",,,"Yamaguchi, Shintaro/0000-0001-7951-9670",,,,,41,7,8,1,32,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

In the prisoners' dilemma, the first best outcome is attainable, but cannot be sustained as a Nash equilibrium. In the tipping game, only a second best outcome may be attainable, but there exists a Nash equilibrium that is strictly preferred to the one in the prisoners' dilemma. We show that many groups persistently choose the prisoners' dilemma despite its strategic disadvantage, and that the groups that eventually choose the tipping game do better than the ones that stick with the prisoners' dilemma.","[Barrett, Scott] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dannenberg, Astrid] Univ Kassel, Kassel, Germany; [Dannenberg, Astrid] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",Columbia University; Universitat Kassel; University of Gothenburg,"Barrett, S (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sb3116@columbia.edu; dannenberg@uni-kassel.de,,,Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies; ERC Starting Grant Human Cooperation to Protect the Global Commons (HUCO) [636746]; European Research Council (ERC) [636746] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies; ERC Starting Grant Human Cooperation to Protect the Global Commons (HUCO); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Geir Asheim, Raphael Calel, Alessandra Casella, Bard Harstad, Robert Keohane, Brad LeVeck, Thomas Schelling, Alessandro Tavoni, David Victor, and two referees for comments on an earlier version of this paper.

In an original way, we model trust in the manager and the relative anxiety about investing in a risky asset. Moreover, we investigate how trust and anxiety affect the manager's fee and the portfolios of cumulative prospect theory investors. The novelty of our contribution relative to previous work is that we rely on cumulative prospect theory( CPT) rather than the classical mean-variance framework. Moreover, our research differs from traditional CPT work through an improved value function that accurately characterizes the reduction in anxiety suffered by the CPT investors from bearing risk when assisted by the portfolio managers' help relative to when they lack such assistance. Our results differ in several respects from those obtained when using on classical preferences. First, the optimal fees are not symmetric. Specially, the dominant managers obtain higher fees than subordinate managers regardless of changes in risk of risky assets (a risky asset) and changes in the dispersion of trust in the population. Another difference is that these fees are not proportional to expected returns. In particular, the optimal fees increase nonlinearly as risk of risky assets (a risky asset) increases and the dispersion of trust in the population increases.","[Deng, Liurui] Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zilan] Hunan Normal Univ, Grad Sch, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan Normal University; Hunan Normal University,"Deng, LR (通讯作者)，Hunan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Changsha 410081, Hunan, Peoples R China.",purplerosed@yahoo.com; Liuzilan@hunnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71201051]; State Scholarship Fund [2014BQ11]; Young Talents Training Plan of Hunan Normal University [2014YX04]; Philosophical and Social Science Fund of Hunan [14YBA264],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Scholarship Fund; Young Talents Training Plan of Hunan Normal University; Philosophical and Social Science Fund of Hunan,"The article is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71201051), the State Scholarship Fund (Grant No. 2014BQ11) and Young Talents Training Plan of Hunan Normal University (2014YX04), Philosophical and Social Science Fund of Hunan (No. 14YBA264).",,21,2,2,1,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

However, there is substantial disagreement on how to theorise these roles. Several members of the Cambridge Social Ontology Group have made important contributions in the form of their work on the ontology of technological objects. This paper builds on their work to develop an ontology of socio-technical structures: social entities composed of both humans and technological objects, with causal powers that depend on how these parts relate to, and interact with, each other. The implication is that material things are not just significant in their own right, or as parts of technical complexes, but that they can play a central role in social structures themselves. Indeed, many of the most important and consequential social structures in contemporary societies, and in particular in contemporary economies, are socio-technical structures.","[Elder-Vass, Dave] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Elder-Vass, D (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Social Sci, Ashby Rd, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",d.elder-vass@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,6,6,2,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In addition to several commonly used distributions, alternative distributions are explored in this study, some of which account for the asymmetry and heavy tails simultaneously found in distributions, and contain more tail parameters to separately depict the right and left tails when forecasting the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of crude oil markets during highly volatile periods. Seven backtests are also conducted to compare the VaR forecasting accuracy among different distributions. The empirical results indicate that a highly volatile environment challenges the commonly used distributions, and the four risk models based on commonly used distributions are rejected about 27% to 38% of the time. The alternative distributions, i.e., skewed general error distributions (SGED), generalized hyperbolic skewed Student-t distributions (GHST), and generalized asymmetric Student-t (GAST) distributions, generally produce more accurate VaR measurement, and GAST gives the best measurement accuracy. The empirical results imply that risk managers or policymakers should further consider more flexible distributions, such as SGED, GHST, or GAST in particular, when quantifying or managing the risk in turbulent market times.

Firms compete in a differential game setting over supply schedules, which encompasses a continuum of imperfect competition equilibria from Bertrand to Cournot. Although production generates environmentally damaging emissions, firms can undertake R&D that has the sole purpose of reducing emissions. In addition to characterizing the optimal policy, we examine how the optimal tax and subsidy, and the optimal level of abatement, change as competition intensifies, as the dynamic parameters change, and as the investment in abatement technology changes. In this setting, competition increases welfare through its impact on the final goods price. However, lower prices result in larger quantities and more pollution. Our key contribution is to show how the impact of increased competition on welfare depends on the extent of the market and the nature of preferences and technology.","[Menezes, Flavio M.; Pereira, Jorge] Univ Queensland Brisbane, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Menezes, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland Brisbane, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",f.menezes@uq.edu.au; j.pereira@uq.edu.au,"Menezes, Flavio/L-4434-2019","Menezes, Flavio/0000-0003-0889-9551",,,,,30,16,18,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Recurrent and over-generous promises to credulous investors of an ex ante, policy-optimal return amounts to an extra policy instrument in boosting the demand for public debt. In a numerical simulation of a version of the Diamond (Am Econ Rev 55: 1126-1150, 1965) model, we find that the incentive for the policy-maker to pursue this strategy is trivial if taxes can be set at a policy-optimal level, but possibly over-riding if they cannot. Thus, the main result lines up with the empirical conclusion of Reinhart et al. (Debt intolerance. Debt intolerance, 2003) that debt intolerant countries have weak fiscal structures''. The subsidiary result of the model is that defaulting countries will also have higher shares of public expenditure. Thus the model also predicts Wagner's Law to the extent that fiscal structure is correlated with economic development.","[Roberts, Mark A.] Univ Nottingham, Ctr Finance Credit & Macroecon, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham,"Roberts, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Ctr Finance Credit & Macroecon, Nottingham, England.",markroberts175@msn.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1573-9414,1574-0277,,ECON CHANG RESTRUCT,Econ.

This paper attempts to determine if the theory of extended crises presented by Delli Gatti et al. (2012) is consistent with empirical evidence. The analysis is carried out using two approaches. The first part of the paper is purely descriptive and is dedicated to a comparison between structural differences and different patterns of development in six countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and US. Using data on the major world economies (KLEMS and STAN) since 1970, we show that the fundamentals behind the extended crisis theory apply to these economies. We focus particularly on Italy, Germany and the US. Among large economies, Italy is one of the most affected and still not recovering, even though the Italian financial sector appeared to have been less exposed to the 2008 shock than other countries. The crisis in Italy could be directly connected to the failure of the Italian economy to move to an economic system based on more skill-intensive production, in particular in the service sector (as in the US). The US financial sector was extremely exposed to the 2008 sub-prime crisis but US economy recovered much faster than in many European countries. Germany is the leading European economy, generally considered in European public debate as the example to be followed. In the last part of the paper the analysis is broadened, involving more countries in a panel analysis approach: different specifications of panel probit/logit models are presented, in a first attempt to investigate the roles of both structural features and financial shock in explaining the extent of the crisis in different countries.

Month-to-month data from the KSE 100 index and monetary variables were extracted for the period January 1992 to November 2015. We transformed the data series into a stationary form by employing the augmented Dickey-Fuller method. The Johansen cointegration approach reinforces the long-haul association between equity prices and monetary indicators, for instance the rate of exchange, inflation, and interest rates. Results of the Granger and Toda and Yamamoto causalities demonstrate the unidirectional causal relationship between interest rate and KSE 100 index; the one-way causation existed from interest rate to equity returns for the KSE100 index. The analysis of the impulse response function concludes that the changes in the KSE 100 index happened due to its own shocks. However, changes in exchange and inflation rates were experienced because of the interest rate. The outcome of variance decomposition demonstrated that most of the changes in the KSE 100 index are because of its own shocks. Thus, it is concluded that the predictability of the equity prices for the KSE 100 heavily relied on exchange rate, inflation, and interest rate variations.","[Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem; Fayyaz, Majid] Ind Univ, Fac Management Sci, Karachi, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Kaunas, Lithuania.",Dalia.Streimikiene@lei.lt,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502",,,,,93,8,9,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Exit costs that block policy reversals also cause lock-in. Conventional thinking treats policy as a dial which is adjusted according to the economy's state. Policy lock-in questions the dial formulation and raises new issues for optimal policy design. It also offers insights into economic and political crisis theory.

By using the model, we evaluate how changes in tax rates can account for the evolution of top incomes in the United States. The model matches the decline in the Pareto exponent of the income distribution and the trend of the top 1 percent income share in recent decades.","[Aoki, Shuhei] Shinshu Univ, Dept Econ, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Nirei, Makoto] Univ Tokyo, Dept Econ, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo, Japan",Shinshu University; University of Tokyo,"Aoki, S (通讯作者)，Shinshu Univ, Dept Econ, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",shuhei.aoki@gmail.com; nirei@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [JP23243050, JP24730238, JP16K17114]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03350, 16K17114] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP23243050, JP24730238, JP16K17114.",,50,34,42,0,19,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

In the model, a trade of one asset can provide information about the value of other assets. Importantly, the information content of trading behavior is endogenously determined. We show that this endogeneity leads to multiple equilibria when assets are sufficiently correlated. The equilibria are ranked in terms of both trade volume and efficiency. The model has implications for policies targeting post-trade transparency. We show that introducing post-trade transparency can increase or decrease welfare and trading volume depending on the asset correlation, equilibrium being played, and the composition of market participants.","[Asriyan, Vladimir] CREI, 25-27 Merce Rodoreda Bldg, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [Fuchs, William] Univ Texas Austin, Austin McCombs Sch Business, 2110 Speedway, Austin, TX 78705 USA; [Fuchs, William] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Calle Madrid, Getafe 28903, Spain; [Green, Brett] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 2220 Piedmont Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Asriyan, V (通讯作者)，CREI, 25-27 Merce Rodoreda Bldg, Barcelona 08005, Spain.",vasriyan@crei.cat; wfuchs@gmail.com; greenb@berkeley.edu,"Green, Brett/AAH-9482-2019; Asriyan, Vladimir/AAA-5485-2019; Fuchs, William/AAG-2458-2019; Green, Brett/GLT-7256-2022","Asriyan, Vladimir/0000-0001-8110-4933; FUCHS SCHUARZBERG, WILLIAM MARTIN/0000-0001-9936-6712",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Grant [ECO2014-54430-P]; Barcelona GSE Seed Grant; ERC [681575]; European Research Council (ERC) [681575] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Grant(Spanish Government); Barcelona GSE Seed Grant; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Asriyan acknowledges support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Grant (ECO2014-54430-P) and the Barcelona GSE Seed Grant.

The panel nature and the timing of the Mexican Family Life Survey allows for unique gains in this literature, as we can compare pre- and post-violence outcomes of the same individual, and control for migratory response. The results suggest that young adults exposed to increased local violence attained significantly less years of education, were less likely to complete compulsory schooling, and were more likely to be employed. This change in behavior is driven by household financial hardship rather than fear, as it is unrelated to the parents' perceptions of potential victimization and is strongest for those with parents that are self-employed, the employment group most adversely economically impacted by the Mexican War on Drugs.","[Brown, Ryan; Velasquez, Andrea] Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80204 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus,"Brown, R (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80204 USA.",ryan.p.brown@ucdenver.edu; andrea.velasquez@ucdenver.edu,,"Brown, Ryan/0000-0001-6202-2668",,,,,38,36,51,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We discuss how the scale and scope of an information management system has an influence on the level of innovation in the process of the data exchange. We define information management as a club good and apply the insights from the theory of fiscal federalism.

Over a 40-year period, there was a dramatic decline in infectious disease deaths in cities. As such objective progress in urban quality of life took place, how did the media report this trend? At that time, newspapers were the major source of information educating urban households about the risks that they faced. By constructing a unique panel database, we find that news reports were positively associated with government-announced typhoid mortality counts, and the size of this effect actually grew after local governments made large investments in public water works to reduce typhoid rates.

Two agents from the same community always face a low linking cost, while the cost of forming a relationship between two agents from different communities diminishes with the rate of exposure of each of them to the other community. We find that socialization among the same type of agent can be weak even if the cost of maintaining links within one's own type is very low.

Using data on bilateral trade and measures of culture, we evaluate how the impact of cultural differences on trade evolves over time during and after the Cold War. Evidence suggests that the negative influence of cultural differences on trade is more prominent in the post-Cold War era than during the Cold War. For instance, ethnic differences reduce trade by 24% during the Cold War, whereas this reduction is 52% in the post-Cold War period. We also suggest a channel for the differential impact of cultural differences over time. By studying the evolution of the effects of cultural difference and cold-war blocs on trade, we provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that cold war blocs have trumped cultural differences during the Cold War. Thus, cultural determinants of trade replace cold-war blocs as a major impediment to international trade only after the end of the Cold War.","[Gokmen, Gunes] New Econ Sch, Skolkovo, Moskovskaya Obl, Russia",New Economic School,"Gokmen, G (通讯作者)，New Econ Sch, Skolkovo, Moskovskaya Obl, Russia.",ggokmen@nes.ru,,,Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [14.U04.31.0002],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","I am indebted to the editor Nathan Nunn, three anonymous referees, Alberto Alesina, Maristella Botticini, Klaus Desmet, Marc Dincecco, Simeon Djankov, Paolo Epifani, Alessandra Fogli, Selim Gulesci, Andreas Madestam, Kiminori Matsuyama, Matthias Messner, Annaig Morin, Tommaso Nannicini, Michele Pelizzari, Barbara Petrongolo, Giovanni Pica, Jean-Philippe Platteau, Massimiliano Onorato, Guido Tabellini, Silvana Tenreyro, Pierre-Louis Vezina, Romain Wacziarg, Shlomo Weber, and numerous seminar and conference participants for their help and support.

In an experiment subjects first choose their action and then choose whether to disclose this action to other group members, and disclosure costs are varied between treatments. We find that no group overcomes coordination failure when action disclosure costs are high, but half of the groups do so when the costs are low. Simulations with a belief learning model can predict which groups will overcome coordination failure, but only if it is assumed that players are either farsighted, risk-seeking or pro-social. To distinguish between these explanations we collected additional data on individual preferences and the degree of farsightedness. We find that in the low cost treatment players classified as more farsighted more often deviate from an inefficient convention and disclose this action, while the effect of risk and social preferences is not significant.

Since the discount is paid on all units rather than marginal units, the tariff is discontinuous and exhibits a negative marginal price (cliff) at the threshold that triggers the discount. This paper shows that all-units discounts arise in optimal agency contracts between upstream and downstream firms that face double moral hazard. I present conditions under which all-units discounts dominate two-part tariffs and other continuous tariffs. I also examine these tariffs when the upstream market faces a threat of entry. In the case considered, all-units discounts deter entry by less efficient rivals without distorting price and investment, whereas continuous tariffs either accommodate such entry or deter it by distorting price and investment.

While sentiment is not directly observable, identifying appropriate proxies and, quantifying the impact of sentiment on asset prices is an important topic. Asset prices that do not appropriately reflect fundamental values may result in inefficient allocation of capital - impacting portfolio allocation decisions and the cost of capital. Utilizing a number of sentiment proxies, over the period 1990-2015, we demonstrate a strong relationship between investor sentiment and stock returns that is consistent with theoretical explanations of sentiment. We determine that implied volatility index (VIX) is the preferred measure of sentiment in terms of improving model fit and adding explanatory power. Causality tests suggest that investor fear (VIX) drives returns across firm-size and value, and also across industry. We also illustrate that firms that are more subjective to value, or face limits to arbitrage, such as small-cap stocks, or those in the business equipment (technology) or telecoms industry, are most responsive to changes investor sentiment. Finally, we demonstrate that sentiment has a greater influence on market returns during recession, when sentiment is at its lowest ebb, and this is particularly true for those stocks most susceptible to speculative demand.","[Smales, L.

This study proposes and applies a methodology to analyse development blocks empirically. To assess the extent and character of innovational interdependencies between industries the study combines analysis of innovation biographies and statistical network analysis. This is made possible by using data from a newly constructed innovation output database for Sweden. The study finds ten communities of closely related industries in which innovation activity has been prompted by the emergence of technological imbalances or by the exploitation of new technological opportunities. The communities found in the Swedish network of innovation are shown to be stable over time and often characterized by strong user-supplier interdependencies. These findings serve to stress how historical imbalances and opportunities are key to understanding the dynamics of the long-run development of industries and new technologies.","[Taalbi, Josef] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, POB 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Taalbi, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, POB 7083, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",josef.taalbi@ekh.lu.se,"Taalbi, Josef/ABA-9415-2021; Taalbi, Josef/AFK-0109-2022","Taalbi, Josef/0000-0002-2560-9504;",VINNOVA [2008-02031],VINNOVA(Vinnova),"This study is an elaboration of my PhD dissertation (Taalbi 2014) completed at Lund university.

The exercise was made in previous article with 2003 and 2008 data. Method: We take 81 activities that represent more than 96% of total GNP in 2013 and we calculated competitiveness based on two dimensions: labor productivity and wages. With a cluster analysis it is possible to group two types of Mexican states: the competitive states and non competitive states. Results: There are two types of Mexican states. The 13 competitive states are more diversified and show higher levels of both productivity and wages. They are also better integrated to the international economy, and comprise mostly industrial mature states such as Nuevo Leon, Central Mexico (Ciudad de Mexico, Queretaro, Estado de Mexico), Jalisco and other Border states. More recently also Guanajuato and San Luis Potosi in central Mexico. For the other 19 states, the lack of productivity is compensated through lower salaries. These include Southern and Southeastern states, and most in the lower Pacific coast. Conclusions: These conditions have remained the same over the recent years. In short, we can not expect convergence merely by the effect of time, in despite that two states of the Bajio region reached now the competitive group.","[Unger, Kurt] CIDE, Div Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

An alternative plan to the current Stability Programme (2015-2018),CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Fiscal policy; Austerity; Functional finance; Balanced budget expansion; Spanish economy,EURO AREA; POLICIES,"The Spanish authorities have implemented strongly restrictive fiscal policies with a negative impact on GDP and employment, especially during the recession of 2011-2013. This paper shows that the end of fiscal austerity is feasible for Spain. Adopting a 'functional finance' approach to fiscal policy and making a (partial) use of the idea of Balanced Budget Expansion, we present an alternative fiscal policy for the years 2016-2018 which is not focused on deficit reduction, but on employment creation and on the development of social and structural policies aimed at a real transformation of the Spanish economy. The two main components of this plan are a progressive fiscal reform to increase public revenue over GDP, and a simultaneous increase in the ratio of public expenditure over GDP. With the aid of a three-equation model, this paper proves that an alternative plan to austerity can be not only expansionary but also fully compatible with fiscal sustainability. The choice, then, lies between prioritising either the rate at which unemployment is reduced or at which public deficit is reduced.","[Uxo, Jorge] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Alvarez, Ignacio] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Uxó, J (通讯作者)，Antracita 14,Esc A,1 D, Madrid 28045, Spain.",Jorge.Uxo@uclm.es,"ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/F-7039-2016; Uxó, Jorge/AAB-3357-2019; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/AAR-3498-2020","ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2801-3447; Uxó, Jorge/0000-0002-2218-1004; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2801-3447; Alvarez, Ignacio/0000-0003-0534-1253",,,,,31,6,6,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

I construct a tractable endogenous growth model with recursive preferences, stochastic volatility, and capital adjustment costs. The model shows that a rise in volatility can decelerate growth in the absence of any level shocks. In contrast to level risk, which is always welfare reducing for a risk-averse household, volatility risk can increase or decrease welfare, depending on model parameters. When calibrated to U.S. data, the model finds that the welfare cost of volatility risk is largely negligible under plausible model parameterizations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Hayek (1899-1992) is known for his vision of the market economy as an information processing system characterized by spontaneous order: the emergence of coherence through the independent actions of large numbers of individuals, each with limited and local knowledge, coordinated by prices that arise from decentralized processes of competition. Hayek is also known for his advocacy of a broad range of free market policies and, indeed, considered the substantially unregulated market system to be superior to competing alternatives precisely because it made the best use of dispersed knowledge. Our purpose in writing this paper is twofold: First, we believe that Hayek's economic vision and critique of equilibrium theory not only remain relevant, but apply with greater force as information has become ever more central to economic activity and the complexity of the information aggregation process has become increasingly apparent. Second, we wish to call into question Hayek's belief that his advocacy of free market policies follows as a matter of logic from his economic vision. The very usefulness of prices (and other economic variables) as informative messages-which is the centerpiece of Hayek's economics-creates incentives to extract information from signals in ways that can be destabilizing. Markets can promote prosperity but can also generate crises. We will argue, accordingly, that a Hayekian understanding of the economy as an information-processing system does not support the type of policy positions that he favored. Thus, we find considerable lasting value in Hayek's economic analysis while nonetheless questioning the connection of this analysis to his political philosophy.","[Bowles, Samuel] Santa Fe Inst, Behav Sci Program, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA; [Kirman, Alan] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Econ, Paris, France; [Sethi, Rajiv] Columbia Univ, Barnard Coll, Econ, New York, NY USA; [Sethi, Rajiv] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",The Santa Fe Institute; Columbia University; The Santa Fe Institute,"Bowles, S (通讯作者)，Santa Fe Inst, Behav Sci Program, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",samuel.bowles@gmail.com; alan.kirman@ehess.fr; rs328@columbia.edu,"Sethi, Rajiv/AAH-3961-2020",,,,,,72,32,36,0,16,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The objective of the present study is to examine the factors affecting the decisions of people to use preventive medical care (e.g. blood glucose tests, blood cholesterol tests and blood pressure test). An ordered logit model is estimated based on a nationally representative sample. The present study finds that income, age, education, ethnicity, employment status, health insurance and smoking are significantly associated with the use of preventive medical care. As a measure towards increasing the prevalence of the preventive medical care usage, the government should pay special attention to low income earners, the young and the elderly, the less-educated, the ethnic minorities, employed individuals, individuals whose medical expenses are not paid by insurance carriers, as well as smokers.","[Cheah, Yong Kang] Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok 06010, Kedah Darul Ama, Malaysia; [Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, Usm 11800, Penang, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Tang, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, Usm 11800, Penang, Malaysia.",tcfoon@usm.my,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011; Cheah, Yong Kang/M-2677-2014","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222; Cheah, Yong Kang/0000-0002-6793-7055","Population Studies Unit (PSU), University of Malaya [IF002-2014]","Population Studies Unit (PSU), University of Malaya","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions on the earlier draft of this paper.

This paper aims to investigate the locational determinants of FDI in 62 Vietnamese provinces and whether spatial dependence is a significant factor that both researchers and policy-makers should take into account. We report that province-specific percapita income, secondary education enrolment, labor costs, openness to trade, and domestic investment affect FDI directly within the province itself and have indirect effects on FDI in neighboring provinces. The direct and indirect effects coexist with spill-over effects and spatial dependence between provinces. Our findings indicate that FDI in Vietnam reflects a combination of complex vertical and export platform motivations on the part of foreign investors; and an agglomeration dynamics that may perpetuate the existing regional disparities in the distribution of FDI capital between provinces.","[Esiyok, Bulent] Baskent Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Ankara, Turkey; [Ugur, Mehmet] Univ Greenwich, Old Royal Naval Coll, Sch Business, 30 Pk Row, London SE10 9LS, England",Baskent University; University of Greenwich,"Esiyok, B (通讯作者)，Baskent Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Ankara, Turkey.",besiyok@baskent.edu.tr; M.Ugur@gre.ac.uk,"Ugur, Mehmet/AAG-5018-2019; EŞİYOK, BÜLENT/HTR-6588-2023","Ugur, Mehmet/0000-0003-3891-3641; Esiyok, Bulent/0000-0001-7469-5309",,,,,35,15,15,1,40,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Furthermore, we examine whether employers are willing to dismiss older workers to trigger an effective increase in mobility that will open new opportunities for the youth community. We build our analysis upon six main empirical models to study employment decisions reflected by major indicators such as the number of hiring, number of separations, total employment effects, male-female ratio, age cohorts, labour mobility and net employment. The results show that the Arab Spring has created structural unemployment trends. In addition, we note that the 2008 global turmoil has fostered the firing level of employment. Our conclusions also indicate that the response of Tunisia's government to high unemployment rates caused by the financial meltdown in 2008 and the events in 2011 was not sufficient to remove the attached lingering effects that still distress the country's labour market.

Starting from a model where investment depends on actual profit rates and rates of capacity utilization, we characterize three regimes with different investment functions and specific adjustment mechanisms to bring about a uniform rate of profit and convergence between the actual and the normal rates of capacity utilization. We find that the paradox of thrift holds in the long run for all regimes. With regards to income distribution, results concerning wage-led growth and the paradox of costs are more ambiguous. The reproportioning of the capital stock between the two sectors is also discussed. We conclude that our analysis provides some justification for using simple one sector Kaleckian models, since the results achieved with the two-sector model are roughly in conformity with those of the one-sector model, depending on the closure being used.","[Kim, Jung Hoon] Gyeonggi Res Inst, 1150 Gyeongsu Daero, Suwon 16207, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lavoie, Marc] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ St,Social Sci Bldg, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Lavoie, Marc] Univ Paris 13, Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Ctr Econ, Univ Paris Nord CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France",University of Ottawa; Universite Paris 13,"Lavoie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ St,Social Sci Bldg, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.;Lavoie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 13, Univ Sorbonne Paris Cite, Ctr Econ, Univ Paris Nord CEPN, 99 Ave Jean Baptiste Clement, F-93430 Villetaneuse, France.",jh6911@gri.re.kr; mlavoie@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,60,7,7,0,4,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

We separate two channels that could affect investor behavior, disentangling a religiosity effect from a well-being effect. Our original identification strategy compares the stock market reaction to sukuk and bond issuance during the holy month of Ramadan, allowing for a differentiated stock market reaction to the religions component of a trade. Using the event study methodology, we measure abnormal returns for a sample of 2140 issuances by 133 issuers in Malaysia over the period 2000-2013. While we find evidence for both channels, sukuk issuance during Ramadan is valued more positively than bond issuance by stock market investors. Further, the positive reaction to sukuk issuance during Ramadan only rewards firms which issue sukuk exclusively. Our findings support the view that religiosity influences the behavior of investors, suggesting that this factor should be taken into account in the analysis of financial markets.

Bribery occurs preemptively, that is before the supervisor exerts costly effort to discover the firm's level of noncompliance and collect evidence for successful prosecution. In contrast to previous papers, preemptive bribery is modeled as a Bayesian signaling game because the supervisor is uninformed about the firm's level of noncompliance. We show that under normal informational assumptions, some (possibly all) firms always engage in preemptive bribery. However, if knowledge of the firm's level of noncompliance has implications for the supervisor's ability to collect evidence and prosecute (prior knowledge), preemptive bribery can be completely eliminated.

Nevertheless, we know little about how peer-approval, and particularly competition for peer-approval, influences people's decisions to cooperate. This paper provides experimental evidence suggesting that people in peer-approval competitions value social approval more when it leads to unique and durable rewards. Our evidence suggests that such rewards act as a signaling mechanism, thereby contributing to the value of approval. We show that this signaling mechanism generates cooperation at least as effectively as cash rewards. Our findings point to the potential value of developing new mechanisms that rely on small non-monetary rewards to promote generosity in groups.","[Pan, Xiaofei] Univ South, Sewanee, TN 37375 USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Interdisciplinary Ctr Econ Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Sewanee: University of the South; George Mason University,"Pan, XF (通讯作者)，Univ South, Sewanee, TN 37375 USA.",xpan@sewanee.edu,"Houser, Daniel/JXX-4326-2024",,,,,,37,5,6,6,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

I show that growth discontinuities are not driven by any special set of borders, or by differences in geographic and climatic conditions on the different sides of borders. I investigate multiple explanations for growth discontinuities, including differences in the determinants of growth across borders and differences in the extent to which borders form barriers to flows of goods, capital or people. I present evidence that differences in the quality of the rule of law are consistently helpful in explaining differences in growth between two countries at their border, and conclude that national-level variables such as institutions and policies may have rapid and important effects on growth.","[Pinkovskiy, Maxim L.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, Res Dept, Microecon Funct, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Pinkovskiy, ML (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank New York, Res Dept, Microecon Funct, 33 Liberty St, New York, NY 10045 USA.",maxim.pinkovskiy@ny.frb.org,,,Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans for intellectual stimulation; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program; Institute of Humane Studies,Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans for intellectual stimulation; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute of Humane Studies,"I would like to thank Daron Acemoglu, Jerry Hausman, James Snyder and Amy Finkelstein for guidance and advice.

Spatial Economic Analysis. This article assumes that the estimated model is static, whereas the true model is an autoregressive distributed lag error components model including spatial dependence on the disturbances. We derive the probability limits of the ordinary least squares (OLS), Between and Within estimators of a static model on panel data. The results show that asymptotic biases of these estimators vary mainly according to the degree of spatial autocorrelation, the unobservable individual heterogeneity and the data generating process (DGP) of the explanatory variable. The probability limit of the Between estimator converges to the long-run effects, particularly when the individual unobserved heterogeneity is large, when compared with the idiosyncratic error term, and/or there is a strong time dynamic in the regressors. The interpretation is more contrasted for the OLS and Within estimators. The former can be associated under very restrictive conditions with the long-run effects; the latter with the short-run effects.","[Pirotte, Alain] Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, CRED, TEPP, CNRS, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Mur, Jesus] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Econ Anal, Gran Via 2-4, E-50005 Zaragoza, Spain",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; University of Zaragoza,"Pirotte, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris II Pantheon Assas, CRED, TEPP, CNRS, 12 Pl Pantheon, F-75005 Paris, France.",alain.pirotte@u-paris2.fr; jmur@unizar.es,"Mur, Jesus/P-4040-2014",,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad and from the 'Programa Operativo FEDER Aragon through the GAEC group [ECO-2015-65758-P],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad and from the 'Programa Operativo FEDER Aragon through the GAEC group,The authors thank the referees and editor for their helpful comments and suggestions.

We consider two types of partial-delegated-public firms. In partial-delegated-public with location delegation, the firm chooses location to maximize its profit while the social planner chooses price to maximize social surplus. Partial-delegated-public firm with price delegation is the opposite where the firm chooses price to maximize its profit. We find significant differences in equilibrium outcomes both between the two types of partial-delegated-public firms, and between the partial-delegated-public firms and the purely private/public firms. While equilibrium prices in the partial-delegated-public firm cases lie in between those in the pure cases (purely private or purely public), the private firm's profit may be higher when its rival is a partial-delegated-public firm rather than a purely private/public firm. We also find a trade-off' within the two partial-delegated-public firm cases: social surplus is higher under location delegation, but consumer surplus and profit of the partial-delegated-public firm are higher under price delegation.","[Shuai, Jie] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Shuai, J (通讯作者)，Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",,,"Shuai, Jie/0000-0003-1922-1033",,,,,27,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

The existence of such interdependences opens the field for determining the preconditions that might support expectations formation.

The research covers the Czech National Bank, the National Bank of Hungary, the National Bank of Poland and Sveriges Riksbank. The research combines qualitative and quantitative methods.

A consequence, I show, is that it is optimal for a firm to increase the cost of browsing (even though this drives away potential customers) because doing so allows it to target sales efforts at those consumers most likely to buy. Despite representing pure waste, this can increase welfare by facilitating efficient allocation of sales or marketing resources. For a similar reason, consumers often benefit from search costs in aggregate, and prefer them to other means of screening, such as price increases.","[Taylor, Greg] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Taylor, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",greg.taylor@oii.ox.ac.uk,,"Taylor, Greg/0000-0002-4563-4862",,,,,28,8,10,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

This paper asks whether one can design objectives for the firm that meet both normative and positive criteria. The answer is negative: Constrained efficient production plans would generically be turned down by a majority of shareholders.

Previous research has failed to find a strong support for this phenomenon, which could be due to assuming exchange rate changes to have symmetric effects on the trade balance or due to assuming linear adjustment. The asymmetry cointegration approach, which introduces nonlinearity into the model specification, may resolve a part of the problem if not all. Following a recent nonlinear approach to cointegration (i.e. NARDL), this research examines the phenomenon displayed in Malaysia-EU bilateral trade for each of the 63 industries that trade between the two regions. We find that exchange rate changes have significant short-run asymmetric effects on the trade balance of most industries. As expected, the nonlinear model and asymmetry cointegration provides more support for the J-curve.","[Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Bahmani-Oskooee, Mohsen] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Aftab, Muhammad] Univ Malaya, Dept Finance & Banking, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Universiti Malaya,"Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Res Int Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.;Bahmani-Oskooee, M (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",bahmani@uwm.edu; maftab@siswa.um.edu.my,"Aftab, Muhammad/ACZ-3714-2022; KHAN, MUHAMMAD ZIA AFTAB/AAD-2172-2019","KHAN, MUHAMMAD ZIA AFTAB/0000-0003-2926-3229; Aftab, Muhammad/0000-0003-1013-4849; Aftab, Muhammad/0000-0003-4164-4147",,,,,25,6,6,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2017,44.0,2,,,,,339,365,,10.1007/s10663-016-9324-8,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ES6WW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399692300006,0

Intended to mitigate the potential welfare losses from enforcing foreign-owned patents, many developing countries use this policy to improve access to drugs that are covered by foreign -owned patents. The effects of compulsory licensing on access to new drugs, however, are theoretically ambiguous: Compulsory licensing may encourage innovation by increasing competition or discourage innovation by reducing expected returns to R& D. Empirical evidence is rare, primarily because contemporary settings offer little exogenous variation in compulsory licensing. We address this empirical challenge by exploiting an event of compulsory licensing as a result of World War I when the US Trading with the Enemy Act made all German -owned patents available for licensing to US firms. Firm-level data on German patents indicate that compulsory licensing was associated with a 30 percent increase in invention by German firms whose inventions were licensed.","[Baten, Joerg] Univ Tubingen, Melanchthonstr 30, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany; [Baten, Joerg] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Baten, Joerg] CEPR, London, England; [Bianchi, Nicola] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, 2001 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Moser, Petra] NYU, Kaufman Management Ctr, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, 44 West 4th St 7-69, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Moser, Petra] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Ifo Institut; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Northwestern University; New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Moser, P (通讯作者)，NYU, Kaufman Management Ctr, Leonard N Stern Sch Business, 44 West 4th St 7-69, New York, NY 10012 USA.",joerg.baten@uni-tuebingen.de; nicola.bianchi@kellogg.northwestern.edu; pmoser@stern.nyu.edu,"Bianchi, Nicola/KCX-9480-2024","Bianchi, Nicola/0000-0002-6919-294X; , Joerg/0000-0001-5029-501X","National Science Foundation [SES0921859, 1151180]; CASBS; Stanford Institute for Policy Research; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities [1151180] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); CASBS; Stanford Institute for Policy Research; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We wish to thank Tim Bresnahan, Dora Costa, Peter di Cola, Mark Duggan, Richard Epstein, Bob Hall, Walker Hanlon, Helen Kim, Wolfgang Keller, Steve Maurer, and seminar participants at the All-UC Group in Economic History, LSE, Northwestern Law, Queens, HBS, Hoover, Michigan, and UCLA for helpful comments and conversations.

A large strand of literature studies the role of cultural heritage to attract tourists, while a rich bulk of studies on cultural participation investigates the impact of tourism flows on the demand for culture. Another aspect worth investigating relates to the link between cultural participation and the performance of tourism destinations (TDs), as a higher cultural participation in an area could boost the performance in the management of tourism resources. However, so far, this issue has been disregarded in the literature, and this paper aims at filling this gap. Specifically, it studies the effect of cultural participation on TDs' performance using a conditional efficiency approach that ensures robust inference on the role of environmental factors. We employ data on the Italian regions for the period 2004-2010, and we explore the role of cultural participation for tourism by using several indicators. Our findings offer empirical support to the positive role of cultural participation and, thus, suggest that public cultural policies might also boost the efficiency of the tourism sector.","[Guccio, Calogero; Lisi, Domenico; Martorana, Marco; Mignosa, Anna] Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy; [Mignosa, Anna] Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Catania; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Lisi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",domenico.lisi@unict.it,"Guccio, Calogero/M-4127-2015","Guccio, Calogero/0000-0002-1053-4968; Martorana, Marco Ferdinando/0000-0003-2616-4460",,,,,61,26,28,3,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

MCS for the industry composition occurs in a country that experiences a decline in its costs of serving the foreign market and meanwhile experiences an increase in its level of competition.

A simple theoretical model predicts that when a child is born of their mother's preferred sex, parents will allocate more resources towards that child, resulting in healthier children. I test this prediction empirically using a longitudinal data set from Indonesia. Each mother's preferred sex, defined by whether she prefers for future children to be male or female, is matched to the observed sex of her subsequent child. Because this measure of maternal sex preference is established before conception, identification requires only that the sex at birth of the subsequent child is random. I find that children born of their mother's preferred sex are heavier, have a higher body mass index, and experience fewer illnesses in early childhood. I show that reductions in subsequent fertility can explain roughly half of the total effect.","[Palloni, Giordano] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, 2033K St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Palloni, G (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, 2033K St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",g.palloni@cgiar.org,,,,,,,33,15,17,2,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

We find that conditional on a level of debt, default incentives are U-shaped in the capital stock: the economy with too small or too large amounts of capital is likely to default. Even without using an ad-hoc output cost of default, the calibrated model generally well matches business cycle facts of emerging economies and generates defaults in good and bad times, with a frequency of 25.5% and 74.5%, respectively, consistent with Tomz and Wright (2007)'s empirical findings. Simulation results show that the economy defaults in good times when it has overinvested in capital during booms before default. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We ask whether the unexpected shutdown of the popular file hosting platform Megaupload had a differential effect on box office revenues of wide-release vs. niche movies. Identification comes from a comparison of movies that were available on Megaupload to those that were not. We show that only movies that premiere in a relatively large number of theaters benefitted from the shutdown of Megaupload. The average effect, however, is negative. We provide suggestive evidence that this result is driven by information externalities. The idea is that online piracy acts as a mechanism to spread information about product characteristics across consumers with different valuations for the product. Our results question the effectiveness of blanket public anti piracy policy, not only from a consumer perspective, but also from a producer perspective. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Building upon the framework of an augmented Okun's law, the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) modelling reveals that the nature of Okun's law is asymmetric. For the Eurozone economies, the empirical evidence demonstrates that labour markets quickly respond to cyclical outputs in a short period, while the adjustments towards new equilibrium become weak in the long run. In addition, the cross-sectional analysis of long run asymmetries indicates that government spending and trade balance are key factors affecting the asymmetric unemployment-output relationship. Therefore, member states might conduct effective labour market reforms taking into account the identified asymmetries and asymmetry determinants. These results also seem to suggest that, in spite of the fact that member states lack monetary sovereignty, flexible application of fiscal reforms could help to reduce asymmetric effects.

The field of strategic management has developed a more nuanced approach to the understanding of how firms are created, organized and grow, how they innovate and compete and how managers manage. One of the leading paradigms in the field is the dynamic capabilities framework. In this paper, contrasts and comple-mentarities are drawn between dynamic capabilities and economic theories of the firm, including transaction cost economics and agency theory. Connections to the Cambridge school are highlighted, including the duality between Keynes's 'animal spirits' and the dynamic capabilities entrepreneurial owner/manager. Leibenstein's x-inefficiency is juxtaposed here with d-ineffectiveness. Knowledge-based theories of the firm consistent with Cambridge conventions emerge. Intellectual exchange between strategic management and economics is encouraged to help improve the intuition behind models of firms and the economy.","[Teece, David J.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Teece, DJ (通讯作者)，Berkeley Res Grp, 2200 Powell St,Suite 1200, Emeryville, CA 94608 USA.",teece@haas.berkeley.edu,"Teece, David/A-2868-2013",,,,,,114,128,149,6,88,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This paper investigates whether, and to what extent, these intertwined shocks spillover into the Tanzanian economy. The author finds that a 1 percentage point (ppts) drop in China's investment growth is associated with a decline in Tanzania's export growth of roughly 0.60 ppts. A 1 percent fall in commodity prices leads to 0.65 percent lower exports value. The results suggest that a hard landing of the Chinese economy to its 'new normal' would doubtless send shock waves through the Tanzanian economy by further driving down commodity demand and prices as well as lowering development finance. In contrast, financial market volatility has a fairly negligible impact on economic growth. The main results stand up well to a wide-array of robustness checks.","[Haile, Fiseha] World Bank, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",The World Bank,"Haile, F (通讯作者)，World Bank, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",fisehahaile77@yahoo.com,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 13,2017,11.0,,,,,,,,2017- 9,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-9,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ES1IC,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000399280300001,0

In order to counteract the geographical mismatch of workers, the German active labor market policy offers a subsidy covering moving costs to incentivize unemployed job seekers to search/accept jobs in distant regions. Based on administrative data, this study provides the first empirical evidence on the impact of this subsidy on participants' prospective labor market outcomes. We use an instrumental variable approach to take endogenous selection based on observed and unobserved characteristics into account when estimating causal treatment effects. We find that unemployed job seekers who participate in the subsidy program and move to a distant region receive higher wages and find more stable jobs compared to non-participants. We show that the positive effects are (to a large extent) the consequence of a better job match due to the increased search radius of participants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Agents form their demands according to the degree to which they are trend-following or contrarian. Empirically, the model requires that agents' demands be coerced by leverage constraints. Using five samples of US stock returns, we show that the fit to realized returns is essentially driven by the total dispersion of the model's returns. We also find that the latter are more realistic when forecasts are based on short-term estimates and when trend-followers and contrarians have the same ex-ante importance. We then provide evidence that the model is able to mimic most stylized facts observed on financial markets (tail decay, volatility clustering and autocorrelation patterns) quite closely. Finally, we find that portfolio policies designed according to the model's predictions outperform the naive 1/N portfolio out-of-sample by 2% per annum. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In an experiment, small groups were first able to establish a coordination history in a repeated minimum-effort game; in the second phase, two groups with different histories were combined into a larger group. Unlike most of the previous literature, subjects could endogenously choose to communicate in the newly formed group for a small fee. While communication proved to be necessary for preventing coordination failure in the newly formed group, only every second subject was willing to implement communication. Particularly, subjects from groups with a less efficient coordination experience in the first phase were more likely to realize the potential of coordination failure in the new group and were thus more likely to decide for communication. The results may be useful for understanding how groups coordinate in changing environments as they are common in economic contexts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Under this view, the deep recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis is often interpreted as the propagation of the initial credit shock. Following Gertler and Gilchrist (1994)'s methodology, we study the behavior of small and large firms during episodes of credit disruption and extend the analysis to the 2008 financial crisis and NBER-dated recessions. We find that large firms' short-term debt and sales contracted relatively more than those of small firms during the 2008 financial crisis and during most recessions since 1969. The results are robust to changes in the business cycle dating procedure.

When preferences are such that non-local incentive constraints may bind in the optimum, even slight misspecification of the preferences can lead to large and non-vanishing losses. Instead, we propose a two-step scheme whereby the principal: (1) identifies the model-optimal menu; and (2) modifies prices by offering to share with the agent a fixed proportion of the profit she would receive if an item were sold at the model-optimal price. We show that her loss is bounded and vanishes smoothly as the model converges to the truth. Finally, two-step mechanisms without a sharing rule like (2) will not yield a valid approximation.","[Madarasz, Kristof] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Prat, Andrea] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Columbia University,"Madarász, K (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,,,,,30,18,19,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Employers benefit from discrimination against minority workers because it can reduce the overall risk from workers' noisy signals by increasing the expected quality of majority workers and their chance to win the competition for the limited number of positions. We show that employers can influence the selection of a discriminatory equilibrium by choosing the set of finalists in competition primarily from a majority group, and favoring them when the two groups are equally qualified.

Setting out from this premise, the present paper sets forth five reasons why Ecuador would be well advised to end dollarization. Studies such as those of Naranjo and Naranjo (2011), Acosta (2004), Correa (2004a and 2004b), Naranjo (2004) and Jameson (2003) made valuable and distinctive contributions to this discussion, but the oil boom and the change in the mode of development over the past decade have tended to leave the debate increasingly void. This article makes reference to regulation theory and the Argentine crisis of 2001. It concludes that dollarization has been maintained because of a transformation in the mode of regulation that opened the way to a different accumulation regime, but that the country needs to restore its own currency if it is to consolidate the new mode of development.","[Paredes, Gonzalo J.] Natl Univ Cordoba, Fac Econ Sci, Cordoba, Argentina; [Paredes, Gonzalo J.] Univ Guayaquil, Inst Econ & Polit Res, Guayaquil, Ecuador; [Paredes, Gonzalo J.] Catholic Univ Santiago Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador",National University of Cordoba,"Paredes, GJ (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Cordoba, Fac Econ Sci, Cordoba, Argentina.;Paredes, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Guayaquil, Inst Econ & Polit Res, Guayaquil, Ecuador.;Paredes, GJ (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Santiago Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador.",gonzalo.paredes01@cu.ucsg.edu.ec,,,,,,,62,0,0,2,12,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,APR,2017,,121,,,,,139,156,,,,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FE9AI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408496200008,0

A cultural norm that determines the contemptibility of tax dodging practices links the past incidence of tax evasion with the tax payers' current incentives to conceal sources of income. This dynamic complementarity may lead to multiple equilibria in the evolution of tax evasion. Due to the latter's effect on capital accumulation, this multiplicity may lead economies in divergent development paths, as long as they differ in the initial magnitude of tax evasion. This happens even though economies may be, on the outset, identical in terms of capital stock and structural characteristics, including those that govern tax enforcement.","[Varvarigos, Dimitrios] Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester,"Varvarigos, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Econ, Astley Clarke Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",dv33@le.ac.uk,,"Varvarigos, Dimitrios/0000-0003-0337-9493",,,,,52,14,14,3,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

A growth model is presented with endogenous incomplete markets, where financial frictions generated by the imperfect enforcement of contracts depend on the difference between future and current output. The former determines the costs of being excluded from financial markets after defaulting. The latter determines the benefits of not servicing current obligations. As the economy approaches its balanced growth path, frictions and their effect on income become more important because the net benefits of honoring contracts decrease as this difference narrows. Therefore, as the economy approaches its steady-state, the effect of contracting institutions on GDP per capita increases. This result is proven analytically and its robustness is explored in a more general quantitative model of heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. The model delivers a testable prediction which is confirmed using simulated data, and validated empirically using a modification of previous specifications of cross-country regressions on institutions and per capita GDP.

The role of slack and non-linearities in the Phillips curve,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Phillips curve; Labour market slack; In ation dynamics; Forecasting,MONETARY-POLICY; DYNAMICS,"The response of US in ation to the high levels of spare capacity during the Great Recession of 2007-09 was rather muted. At the same time, some have argued that the short-term unemployment gap has a more prominent role than the standard unemployment gap in determining in ation, and either the closing of this gap or non-linearities in the Phillips curve could lead to a sudden pick-up in in ation. In this context, our main aim is to provide guidance to policymakers as regards the reliability of the Phillips curve to forecast in ation. Our main findings from Phillips curves estimated since the early-1990s suggest that the consideration of a time-variation in the Phillips curve slope is more relevant than just focusing on-finding the correct slack measure. Although the Phillips curve may be relatively at over the full sample (1992Q1-2015Q1), time varying estimates with rolling windows and with the Kalman filter suggest that the slope does vary over time and that it has increased slightly since 2013. These non-linear specifications outperform the benchmark linear model in an out-of-sample exercise. The main policy implication is that decision-makers should not exclude the possibility that in ation might rise suddenly given its non-linear behaviour, and more strongly than a linear model would dictate.

When bidder identities are observable, our approach yields tighter bounds than previous approaches that ignore asymmetry, demonstrating that bidder asymmetries can function as an aid rather than a hindrance to identification. We present a nonparametric estimation and inference approach relying on our identification argument and apply it to data from U.S. timber auctions, finding that bounds on optimal reserve prices and other objects of interest are noticeably tighter when exploiting bidder asymmetries.","[Coey, Dominic] Facebook, Core Data Sci, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Larsen, Bradley; Waisman, Caio] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Larsen, Bradley] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sweeney, Kane] Uber, Market Optimizat, San Francisco, CA USA","Facebook Inc; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Uber Technologies, Inc.","Coey, D (通讯作者)，Facebook, Core Data Sci, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.",coey@fb.com; bjlarsen@stanford.edu; kane@uber.com; cwaisman@stanford.edu,"Larsen, Bradley/JJF-9680-2023","Larsen, Bradley/0000-0002-8357-0046",,,,,13,9,11,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

In the economics literature, the convention is to monitor the ratio of debt to the country's Central Bank's international reserves. However, the debt itself could act as a main precursor. In this context, we examine Turkey's ST-PrED data as representative of an emerging economy. Our methodology is to use a linear growth model to fit the ST-PrED data and a Bayesian method for model estimation and forecasting strategy. The empirical findings illustrate the performance of our predictions in capturing unstable terms of the economy. As a policy implication, we recommend that policy makers place special emphasis on ST-PrED as a potent indicator of the country's financial vulnerability. Taking into account the ST-PrED level, to prevent the contagion effect of a crisis, it is essential to implement policies that are more effective in coordinating international financial ows and improving liquidity positions. Furthermore, fostering structural reform and an innovative approach to strengthen the real sector and improve education could create economic stability and sustainability in terms of debt structure among emerging economies.

By applying Mathematica-based graph modeling we create a causal network of the synergistic impact mechanism among certain climate related factors. Our computational approach identifies a climate factor that affects most immediately or most strongly the others. Important factors are indicated through the use of graph theoretical tools. Our graph-based approach and its computational aspects allow for factor ranking(s) according to their importance to the network both numerically and visually, for certain settlement types. Our contribution provides quantitative estimates of impacts and adaptation potentials of five potential effects of climate change ( migration, flooding-landslides-fire, air and water pollution, human health and energy-water-other resources) which play a substantial role at the synergistic impact mechanism. By using graph visualization techniques, the structure of the synergistic impact mechanism is selfevident. Specifically, graph layouts are created to detect i) the causal relationships of the synergistic mechanism under study ii) the most influential factor(s) in the synergistic mechanism and iii) classify the factor's roles (based on the degree of their impact) within the coping mechanism.

Commons, I study the way in which labor legislation in China can be understood as the search for a status of employment security for rural migrant workers.

I analyze this contradiction not as a failure of the legislation itself, but as the product of a particular institutional context which provides a way to skirt the law, and thereby diminish its effectiveness. Finally, in a non-democratic state, labor law which has been instrumentalized and mobilized within a form of state corporatism reveals that very significant challenges exist for building a truly secure status for employees.","[Perisse, Muriel] Univ Dartois, Econ Management & Soc Sci Dept, Arras, France",,"Périsse, M (通讯作者)，Univ Dartois, Econ Management & Soc Sci Dept, Arras, France.",,,,,,,,84,11,12,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The significance of this study is given by the fact that the class of agents following a CAPM-like investment strategy with a certain deviation measure which is tantamount to always selecting a certain personal master portfolio can be described by having generalised mean-risk preferences with certain constraints on the utility function (Rockafellar et al., 2007).

We derive theoretical properties and provide a clear systemic risk interpretation for the proposed measures. Devised upon the notion of communicability in networks, we introduce the impact susceptibility index, which indicates whether market participants are locally or remotely vulnerable. We show how this index can be used as a financial stability monitoring tool and apply it to analyze the Brazilian financial market. We find that non-banking institutions are potentially remotely vulnerable in certain periods, while banking institutions are not susceptible to indirect impacts, To address the perspective of market participants as sources of contagion, we propose the impact diffusion influence index, which captures the potential influence of financial institutions on propagating impacts in the network. We unveil the presence of a portion of small medium banking institutions that is consistently more influential than large banks in potentially diffusing impacts throughout the network. Regarding financial system stability, regulators should identify the entities that play these two roles, as they can render the system more risky. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In each stage, players are sorted into groups in which they play pairwise matches against each other. The match results induce a ranking over players in each group, and higher ranked players qualify to the next stage. Players prefer qualifying to higher stages. In this setting, a player may potentially profit by exerting zero effort in some matches even when effort exertion is costless. Since such behavior manipulates the tournament, it is desired that full effort exertion is an equilibrium and any equilibrium ranking of qualifying players is immune to manipulation. To this end, I show that it is both necessary and sufficient to allow only the top-ranked player to qualify from each group. Otherwise, rankings can become a noisy indicator of players' strengths, while effort cost and heterogeneous prize spread can be of little relevance to players' effort choices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the drivers-mechanisms-effects (DME) model is built, which shows how element agglomeration, scale growth, knowledge accumulation and industry evolution drive the environmental system to change during the urbanization process. An econometric regression model using provincial panel data is further constructed to empirically analyze the impacts of urbanization on environmental quality. It is shown that during the process of urbanization in China, element agglomeration and knowledge accumulation help to improve environmental quality but with weak positive effect, while growing urban scale and industrial structure have obvious negative effects on environmental quality. The inverted-U shape (up first and then down) change in the environmental quality during China's urbanization process is obvious. It is critical that China concentrates on the transformations of both city development paths and urbanization models to reduce resource and environmental costs as much as possible.","[Wei, Houkai] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan] Chinese Acad Macroecon Res, Inst Spatial Planning Reg Econ, Natl Dev & Reform Commiss, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Wei, HK (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wei_houkai@263.net; guodisuozhangyan@163.com,,,"National Social Science Fund [08, ZD044, 14ZDA026]",National Social Science Fund,"Houkai Wei, Senior Researcher, Rural Development Institute, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China.

J,"Wu, FL",,,,"Wu, Fulan",,,SIGNALING UNOBSERVABLE QUALITY CHOICE THROUGH PRICE AND ADVERTISING: THE CASE WITH COMPETING FIRMS,MANCHESTER SCHOOL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRODUCT QUALITY,"This paper develops a model in which a firm can use price and advertising jointly as a signal of their private choice of quality, whereby quality is endogenously chosen by firms. The monopoly model reveals that there exists a unique equilibrium in which the monopolist chooses high quality but a higher level of advertising compared to the full-information benchmark. The model is then extended to the case with competition of two imperfectly competitive firms. We find that if competition is not strong enough, then there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium in which both firms choose high quality. The equilibrium outcome shows that both firms will set lower prices and a higher level of advertising as compared to the monopoly case. Interestingly, we find that more competition might lead to a loss of social welfare due to the increasing level of advertising for quality signaling. The numerical results further demonstrate that as competition gets more intense from the monopoly, prices decrease initially, the level of advertising increases, and social welfare decreases, which may make a ban on advertising more recommendable after a certain threshold.","[Wu, Fulan] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Wu, FL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

We show that income inequality rises from 1990 to 2000 and then falls from 2000 to 2011. We perform simple but informative decompositions to figure out the contributing factors behind that dissimilarity in the behavior of inequality across those two subperiods. Our results are consistent with a story in which economic growth increases the demand for more educated workers, initially increasing inequality. However, those higher returns to education encourage agents to invest in higher education, producing a subsequent human capital deepening that reduces inequality at later stages of the development process.","[Parro, Francisco] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Santiago, Chile; [Reyes, Loreto] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Columbia University,"Parro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Santiago, Chile.",francisco.parro@uai.cl; ldr2132@columbia.edu,,,,,,,40,9,10,4,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Specially, we test for the effectiveness of a major non-conventional monetary policy tool, the use of special asset purchase programs by the Federal Reserve, in impacting the financial markets. Estimates from vector auto-regression (VAR) analyses show that the impact of both unexpected and expected monetary shocks on aggregate stock returns is magnified several times during periods of QE. In addition, traditional monetary policy tools, like the Federal Funds rate, have no impact on aggregate stock returns, neither leading up to, nor during QE, while ournon-conventional policy measure does appear to have some impact. In an extension of our results, we find that unexpected monetary shocks have an increased marginal impact on the stock returns of financial firms during QE. In addition, the stock returns of financial institutions have significant reactions to both changes in non-conventional monetary policy tools and announcements surrounding non-conventional policy actions.","[Ashraf, Ali] Frostburg State Univ, Dept Mkt & Finance, Frostburg, MD 21532 USA; [Hassan, M.

This paper presents a model in which these contracts serve to overcome a hold-up problem that occurs because governments cannot commit to non-excessive future tax rates. We find that implemented APAs lead to a Pareto improvement even when all agents are risk neutral. Multilateral APAs are, in general, more efficient than unilateral ones. However, not all efficient APAs are concluded in equilibrium, due to asymmetric information problems. For the same reason, equilibrium APAs are highly complex, just as in practice. Surprisingly, APAs may lead to an increase in profit shifting to the low tax location and, in most cases, do not allow for a reduction in audit capacity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Lobbying is in the style of Grossman and Helpman's Protection for Sale' model with a new feature: all actors face uncertainty arising from the complexity of the legislative process. I demonstrate that the higher the executives set tariffs in a trade agreement, the less effort lobbies put forth to prevent its ratification. Thus trade agreements act as a domestic political commitment device: executives set relatively high tariffs to discourage lobbying and increase the chance that the agreement will be ratified. The model sheds light on the empirical puzzle surrounding governments' welfare weights in the Grossman and Helpman model and provides a new explanation for failures to ratify trade agreements.","[Buzard, Kristy] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, 110 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,,kbuzard@syr.edu,,,,,,,44,3,3,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

In the (private market) Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) equilibrium low-wage/low-risk individuals are not fully insured. While social insurance provided to the poor has a negative incentive effect, it also increases their otherwise insufficient insurance coverage. Social insurance to the rich produces exactly the opposite effects. Whichever of these effects dominates, some social insurance is always desirable irrespective of the pattern of correlation. Finally, we introduce risk misperception which exacerbates the failure of private markets. Rather surprisingly, this does not necessarily strengthen the case for public insurance.

We compare the educational and socioeconomic outcomes in different scenarios (melting pot versus multiculturalism). If schooling shifts children's identity away from their parents' values, parents may choose lower levels of education for their children, at the cost of reducing their future earnings. We show how this effect can be attenuated and reversed when the school or, indeed, the host society are willing to accommodate the values of the community and/or to adjust to these values; otherwise the community gradually becomes alienated.

We considered the case when it is negative, investigating the determinants of the discount for control, having as study case the Romanian listed companies. Comparative to the general case of control premium, discounts for control are also determined by some other specific factors, like the number of non-trading days and the cash ratio. Some determinant factors of control premium have an opposite influence when this is negative: the percentage of shares purchased in the transaction, the ownership concentration, the fact the buyer or the seller is domestic, and the existence of a major shareholder owning more than 50% of shares. Consequently, some factors usually used in explaining the control premium cannot be suitably used for the case of the discount for control.

In particular, we show that the legal mandate should always be lengthened when these two types of biases increase by the same percentage magnitude.","[Farvaque, Etienne] Univ Lille 1, Sci & Technol Cite Sci, CNRS, UMR 9221,LEM, Batiment SH2, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Farvaque, Etienne] Skema Business Sch, Campus Lille Ave Willy Brandt, F-59777 Euralille, France; [Farvaque, Etienne] CIRANO, 1130 Rhe Sherbrooke O 1400, Montreal, PQ H3A2M8, Canada; [Matsueda, Norimichi] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, 1-1-155 Uegahara, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6628501, Japan",Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); SKEMA Business School; Universite de Montreal; Kwansei Gakuin University,"Farvaque, E (通讯作者)，Univ Lille 1, Sci & Technol Cite Sci, CNRS, UMR 9221,LEM, Batiment SH2, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France.;Farvaque, E (通讯作者)，Skema Business Sch, Campus Lille Ave Willy Brandt, F-59777 Euralille, France.;Farvaque, E (通讯作者)，CIRANO, 1130 Rhe Sherbrooke O 1400, Montreal, PQ H3A2M8, Canada.",etienne.farvaque@univ-lille1.tr; nmatsued@kwansei.ac.jp,"farvaque, etienne/AAX-8898-2021",,ANR-JSPS Chorus Program; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25285087] Funding Source: KAKEN,"ANR-JSPS Chorus Program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors thank useful comments by the referee and the editor of the Review, as well as by Chen Li, Bartholomew Moore, Vladimir Petkov, Yigit Saglam, the participants of a workshop at the Victoria University of Wellington, the 50th Public Choice Society Conference in New Orleans, the 47th Annual Conference of the Canadian Economics Association at the HEC in Montreal and the 5th Singapore Economic Review Conference in Singapore.

We evaluate how far trade-induced productivity gains (technology spillovers) reduce or remove this obstacle, because more intensive trade enhances these potential gains. Based on theory and the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) we estimate stronger import-induced than export-induced productivity gains. We feed the theory and the estimates into a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated to WIOD. We find that the USA's, China's and the EU's optimal tariffs are reduced by less than 20%, Russia's and India's by around 25% and Brazil's by 40% when taking endogenous trade-induced productivity gains into account. Nonetheless, incentives for single economies to impose strategic tariffs persist. Particularly large, trade-intensive downstream sectors producing distinct goods incentivize high sectoral optimal tariffs. A global free trade agreement could overcome such incentives and maximize the trade-induced productivity gains.","[Huebler, Michael; Pothen, Frank] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Huebler, Michael; Pothen, Frank] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Hübler, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",huebler@iuw.uni-hannover.de,,"Pothen, Frank/0000-0003-4078-7074","state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the programme SEEK (Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies) at ZEW (Centre for European Economic Research) in Mannheim, Germany; European Commission","state of Baden-Wurttemberg within the programme SEEK (Strengthening Efficiency and Competitiveness in the European Knowledge Economies) at ZEW (Centre for European Economic Research) in Mannheim, Germany; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","We thank two anonymous reviewers and Editor Sushanta Mallick for very helpful comments as well as participants of the International Conference on Economic Modelling in Bali in 2014 and a research seminar at University Heidelberg in 2013.

Using different econometric models, i) a time-varying parameter structural vector autoregression (TVP SVAR) model with short-run identifying restrictions, ii) a structural VAR (SVAR) model with the short-run identifying restrictions, and iii) a VAR model with ordering free generalized impulse response VAR (GIR VAR), we find that the response of the Chinese interest rate to the oil price shocks is not only time-varying but also showing quite different signs of responses. Specifically, in the earlier sample period (1992:4-2001:10), the interest rate shows a negative response to the oil price shock, while in the latter period (2001:11-2014:5) it shows a positive response to the shock. Given the negative response of the world oil production to an oil price shock in the earlier period, the shock is identified as a negative supply shock or a precautionary demand shock as suggested by Kilian (2009), thereby the negative response of the interest rate to the oil price shock is deemed as economy-boosting. The positive response of the interest rate to the oil price shock in the later period, given that this shock is identified as a positive world oil demand shock, gives evidence that stabilization of inflation is one of the main objectives of China's monetary authority, even though the current main objective of the monetary policy is characterized as maintaining the stability of the value of the currency and thereby promoting economic growth. Finally, the variance decomposition results reveal that the oil price shock becomes an increasingly important source in the volatility of China's interest rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, a second method is necessary to calibrate the model. The currency demand approach can lead to highly implausible results; the size of the shadow economy might be largely overestimated. An alternative is the survey method. For real tests of whether a variable has an impact, procedures are necessary that do not use the same variables as those used to construct the indicator. Thus, to make progress in analysing the shadow economy, the model approach has a role to play, but it has to be complemented by other methods employing different data. The currency demand approach cannot be used as long as it employs the same variables for its constructions.","[Kirchgassner, Gebhard] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ & Appl Econ Res SIAW HSG, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Kirchgassner, Gebhard] Leopoldina, Halle, Germany; [Kirchgassner, Gebhard] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of St Gallen; Ifo Institut,"Kirchgässner, G (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, SIAW HSG, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",gebhard.kirchgaessner@unisg.ch,,,,,,,43,24,25,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

However, they suffer from the reluctance of respondents to reveal their own illicit behavior. This paper evaluates whether this weakness of self-assessments can at least partially be overcome through a novel questioning method, the crosswise model, which allows estimating the prevalence of tax evasion, but not identifying whether the individual respondent engages in tax evasion or not. Using evidence from Serbia, we show that crosswise model-based estimates of the share of firms which significantly underreport sales exceed those obtained from conventional methods by around 10 % points or more. With respect to wage underreporting to evade payroll tax and social security contributions, we do not find differences. These results appear to be robust to a number of modifications, and we explore various potential causes that lead to these results.","[Kundt, Thorben C.] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, Bonn, Germany; [Misch, Florian] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Nerre, Birger] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, Belgrade, Serbia",International Monetary Fund,"Misch, F (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",thorben.kundt@giz.de; fmisch@imf.org; birger.nerre@giz.de,,,,,,,51,17,17,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

In both of these episodes, economic just-so stories advanced our understanding of history. What animated intellectual innovation in both cases was a bold conjecture about the raison detre of a puzzling institutional structure. But what ultimately enriched our understanding was the process of conjecture and revision those conjectures set off. In both episodes, the revised conjectures that best withstood criticism and revision were those that saw the phenomena not as static snapshots of economic agents confronting an economic problem but rather those that embedded the phenomena within a larger economic problem and within a process of economic change. In the end it is an account of institutional change what I call the good old New Institutional Economics that connects the use of institutional economics to explain puzzling historical phenomenon with the role of institutional economics in addressing the big questions of economic growth.

We also compare the efficacy of various selection criteria to each other and synthesize the literature on the explanations for the value anomalies. The overall evidence shows that the best criterion varies over time and across the markets. The relative efficacy of different valuation criteria also seems to depend on numerous methodological choices. Recent studies have given mild evidence that combining traditional valuation ratios either with each other or with some financial statement variables could at least in some cases enhance the value premium, although very few studies have provided transparent comparisons between the results based on individual valuation ratios and those based on composite value criteria.","[Patari, Eero; Leivo, Timo] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Pätäri, E (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, Lappeenranta, Finland.",eero.patari@lut.fi,,,,,,,198,17,22,6,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We measure the welfare effects and impact on cellulosic ethanol production after implementing the tax-subsidy policy using a general equilibrium model. A revenue-neutral integrated tax-subsidy scheme leads to a small positive tax rate for crude oil and a large positive subsidy for cellulosic ethanol because the former has a larger emissions coefficient than the latter. The overall welfare effects of an integrated tax subsidy scheme are less than a 1% increase for the economy but the growth in the cellulosic ethanol industry could range from 28% to 238% because the revenues from taxing crude oil are directly used to subsidize cellulosic ethanol production.

The method of measuring connectedness proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012, 2014) is adopted to study the relationship between oil shocks and returns at six major stock markets around the world. It is shown that the contribution of oil shocks to the world financial system is limited. Oil price changes, however, can be explained by information on the financial system. Furthermore, a rolling windows analysis finds that oil shocks can occasionally contribute significantly to stock markets, and it is also proved that only large shocks matter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that the better way to understand public economics is through a three-part division between positive, normative, and instrumental models. An instrumental model is about means and ends. Once this additional dimension is acknowledged, one can see that 'optimal' taxation models are closely connected to what are generally seen as purely positive models. I argue that economists have been using similar standards to assess 'optimal' taxation models as they use to assess positive models. Recent advances in optimal taxation theory have embraced the positive aspects of models, even about social welfare functions, something that is generally classified as a normative.","[Albrecht, Brian C.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Albrecht, BC (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",albre155@umn.edu,,,Mercatus Center; Institute for Humane Studies,Mercatus Center; Institute for Humane Studies,Thanks to the Mercatus Center and the Institute for Humane Studies for financial support.,,46,0,0,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

We test this theory empirically by studying the relationship between pirate attacks and financial-market returns in the Arabian Peninsula. The result of our empirical test supports Leeson's theory: unsuccessful pirate attacks are associated with lower financial-market returns, suggesting that market participants expect unsuccessful pirate attacks to be followed by future pirate attacks.","[Belasen, Ariel R.; Kutan, Ali M.] Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA; [Belasen, Alan T.] SUNY Empire State Coll, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA",Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University Edwardsville; State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY Empire State College,"Kutan, AM (通讯作者)，Southern Illinois Univ Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL 62026 USA.",abelase@siue.edu; akutan@siue.edu; alan.belasen@esc.edu,,,,,,,49,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The data is based on new and unique data for 10 European countries for the period 2002-2010. A key feature of the empirical analysis is the use of several types of advanced ICT activities, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, mobile internet access, and e-commerce practices. The main result of the study is that the increase in ICT/e-commerce activities over time has not led to a decline in jobs. This holds true for both manufacturing and service industries, as well as for SMEs and large firms. For ERP systems and websites, there is some evidence of positive effects. These findings do not support the hypothesis that ICT utilization is leading to labour substitution overall. In fact, ICT activities appear to be rather neutral to employment.

We compare the performance of QAR plus Beta-tEGARCH with constant degrees of freedom (benchmark model) and QAR plus Beta-t-EGARCH with time-varying degrees of freedom (extended model).

For the S& P 500, all likelihood-based model selection criteria support the extended model, which identifies extreme events with significant impact on the US stock market. We find that for 59% of the 150 firms, the extended model has a superior statistical performance. The results suggest that the extended model is superior for those industries, which produce products that people usually are unwilling to cut out of their budgets, regardless of their financial situation.

For this purpose, the broad characterisation of financialisation offered by Fine (2012) is adopted. This characterisation identifies eight features of the financialisation process. We focus in particular on the size of the financial sector within a selection of European economies. Data show that the financialisation process is not reflected in the share of employment in the financial sector. This is likely to be the result of the labour-saving nature of technological and organisational innovations introduced in the financial sector in the last two decades. By contrast, the increasing weight of finance in the economy is reflected in the ratio of the value added of the financial sector to total value added and by the ratio of the value of financial assets to GDP. Overall, we find that most European countries have undergone a process of financialisation in the last three decades. However, this process has been variegated, leading us to coin the term 'variegated financialisation'. The variegation of the financialisation process is likely to be explained by differences in economic and social structures between nations, regions and systems.","[Brown, Andrew; Spencer, David A.; Passarella, Marco Veronese] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Brown, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",A.Brown@lubs.leeds.ac.uk; D.A.Spencer@lubs.leeds.ac.uk; M.Passarella@leeds.ac.uk,,"Veronese Passarella, Marco/0000-0001-7652-5952",,,,,28,16,17,0,2,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

We use the synthetic control method to examine how the L'Aquila earthquake affected subsequent enrolment at the local university. This issue has wide economic implications as the University of L'Aquila made a large contribution to the local economy before the earthquake. Our results indicate that the earthquake had no statistically significant effect on first-year enrolment at the University of L'Aquila in the three academic years after the disaster. This natural disaster, however, caused a compositional change in the first-year student population, with a substantial increase in the number of students aged 21 or above. This is likely to have been driven by post-disaster measures adopted in order to mitigate the expected negative effects on enrolment triggered by the earthquake.","[Cerqua, Augusto; Di Pietro, Giorgio] Westminster Business Sch, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, London, England; [Di Pietro, Giorgio] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Westminster; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Di Pietro, G (通讯作者)，Westminster Business Sch, 35 Marylebone Rd, London NW1 5LS, England.",G.D.I.Pietro@westminster.ac.uk,,"Cerqua, Augusto/0000-0001-7029-0523",,,,,32,6,6,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It is inherently available only in a limited form to decision-makers. Limited or imperfect information is caused by uncertainty - both ontologic and epistemic, limitations in cognitive capabilities or bounded rationality, hidden information, and information asymmetries. This has fundamental implications for the manner in which the self-interested behavior of agents will manifest itself. The article argues that in the context of imperfect information, self-interest can function in a manner quite different from what standard approaches assume. This has been demonstrated by the recent financial crisis. However, there has been limited consideration in mainstream models, both of the neoclassical and institutional type, as to what the exact nature of self-interestedness is, and how this affects the market behavior of agents. The nature of self-interest, therefore, needs to be modeled explicitly to improve the explanatory power of economic theories.","[Chakravarti, Ashok] Govt Zimbabwe, Off President & Cabinet, Ease Doing Business Program, Harare, Zimbabwe",,"Chakravarti, A (通讯作者)，Govt Zimbabwe, Off President & Cabinet, Ease Doing Business Program, Harare, Zimbabwe.",,,,,,,,72,4,6,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Religious piety alleviates the agency conflict by lessening the motivation for managers to exploit shareholders. Because of its role in mitigating the agency conflict, we argue that religious piety influences corporate governance arrangements. We exploit the variation in religious piety across U.S. counties and show that religious piety significantly influences the probability that a firm has an entrenched (staggered) board of directors. In particular, firms located in an area with stronger religious piety are significantly less likely to have a staggered board. This negative effect, however, is significant only when the degree of religiosity is higher than a certain threshold. Further analysis reveals that our results are unlikely confounded by endogeneity. Our results are especially interesting as they demonstrate that non-financial attributes, such as religious piety, has a significant influence on one of the most crucial governance mechanisms, i.e. the board of directors.","[Chintrakarn, Pandej] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Dept Business Adm, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Tong, Shenghui] China Huarong Asset Management Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiraporn, Pornsit] Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA",Mahidol University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA.",pxj11@psu.edu,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Basel Accord II and Ill for banks and Solvency II for insurers require insurance companies and banks to allocate capital for operation risk. Because the risk measure used for Basel regulatory capital purposes reflects a confidence level of 99.9% during one year and the loss distribution of operational risk has high skewness and kurtosis, it is almost infeasible to get an accurate estimate of such a risk measure if a crude Monte Carlo approach is used. Therefore, we develop a novel importance sampling method for estimating such a risk measure. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method is very efficient and robust. The main contribution of this method is to provide a feasible and flexible numerical approach that delivers highly accurate estimates of operational risk with a high confidence level and meets the high international regulatory standard for quantification of operational risk.","[Chung, Ming-Tao] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hsieh, Ming-Hua] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chi, Yan-Ping] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University,"Hsieh, MH (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei, Taiwan.",102356509@nccu.edu.tw; mhsieh@nccu.edu.tw; ypchi@mis.nccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,5,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

The stimulating effect of income inequality is revealed via saving. Specifically, wealthy social classes dispose the capability to save more and devote a larger portion of their saving to investments and technological developments. However, environmental and social perspectives shall be taken into consideration when aiming for a sustainable development. This paper considers the effects of income inequality on sustainable economic growth in the context of saving for the EU-25 countries during the period of 2005-2013. The empirical research of this study is done using open code software package Gretl and working with panel data. Based on the relationship between income inequality ratio, economic growth and GDP per capita, countries have been divided into 4 clusters. Empirical results support impact of reciprocal action among income inequality, savings, economic growth, spending on social security to domestic material consumption, renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, municipal waste generation, municipal waste recycling, ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions to be insignificant in all four country cluster groups. Reciprocal action among income inequality, savings, economic growth, and spending on social security was estimated to increase emission of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides, but reduced the amount of gross domestic energy consumption. The reciprocal action is estimated to increase emission of nitrogen oxides in the country cluster groups with relatively low income level and different relationship between income and economic growth levels.","[Ciegis, Remigijus; Andriuskevicius, Karolis] Vilnius Univ, Muitines St 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Dilius, Aidas] Sauliai Univ, P Visinskio St 19, LT-77156 Shiauliai, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Ciegis, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Muitines St 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",remigijus.ciegis@khf.vu.lt; aidasdilius@gmail.com; karolis.andriuskevicius@gmail.com,,"Andriuskevicius, Karolis/0000-0002-0398-3140; Ciegis, Remigijus/0000-0001-9303-7205",,,,,30,2,2,1,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Multiple equilibrium unemployment rates emerge as a result of this modification. It is shown that output demand not only plays short-term role but might be essential in the long-run as well. This is because the initial fall in aggregate demand may cause unemployment rate to converge to a higher (long-run) equilibrium. All these aspects are illustrated for the Spanish labour market and it is shown that the model with multiple equilibrium unemployment rates outperforms the baseline standard search and matching model in its forecasting performance as well as in its ability to describe huge persistent swings in unemployment.,"[Cizek, Ondrej] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Cízek, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",cizeko@vse.cz,,,"University of Economics, Prague [VSE IGA F4/93/2017]","University of Economics, Prague","This work was supported by VSE IGA F4/93/2017, University of Economics, Prague.

Our hypothesis was that organizational innovation should have a significant and positive impact on technical (product or process) innovation. We control for endogeneity by using a Poisson estimator that accommodates a binary endogenous regressor. We test 10 potential instruments using a battery of test criteria and settle on five. All results are presented using the five instruments to avoid expectation bias. In general we find that organizational innovation does impact technical innovation positively. With the 2009 data we find that the mean of the average treatment effect for product innovation is roughly 1.7 times that of process innovation. For the 2009-2012 data we find that the impact on product innovation is roughly 1.5 times that of process innovation. For the 2012 data, we had anomalous results for process innovation, such that organizational innovation reduced the number of process innovations by 2.3 per year. In terms of Canadian government policy, the results lend support to the view that technical innovation is not the only innovation that matters. The right policy mix may encourage firms to experiment with and adopt more organizational innovations to enhance technical innovation.","[Cozzarin, Brian Paul] Univ Waterloo, Dept Management Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Cozzarin, BP (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Management Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",brian.cozzarin@uwaterloo.ca,"Cozzarin, Brian Paul/AAY-9110-2021; Cozzarin, Brian/AAY-9114-2021","Cozzarin, Brian Paul/0000-0002-4280-7633;","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [435-2014-2061]; Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada [5025591]","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada","This work was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant 435-2014-2061 and Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada 5025591.",,43,35,37,9,71,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Firstly, data from CzechInvest covering the period 2002-2014 is used for analysis of foreign investors' source countries. Their cultural distance from the Czech Republic is measured based on Hofstede's framework by using Kogut-Singh index and Euclidean index. The highest cultural distance was calculated in case of Netherlands, followed by Austria and United Kingdom. Secondly, based on the comparative analysis of data from the companies' annual reports and the Czech statistical office and CzechInvest, the foreign presence is calculated. The values illustrate low degree of foreign presence - till 5 % and so low potential for the creation of spillovers. This conclusion also confirms the trend of the technology gap. The technology gap is probed by the Shift-share analysis as a decomposition of the technology level of Kralovehradecky region on the technology, employment and combination of both these effects. The result is corresponding with the localization of manufactures or fragmentation's manufactures with low numbers of new created jobs and with no usage of possibility of grow using technology absorption of foreign firms located in the Kralovehradecky region.","[Cuhlova, Renata; Kotikova, Sylvie] Tech Univ Liberec, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Cuhlová, R (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117, Czech Republic.",renata.cuhlova@tul.cz; sylvie.kotikova@tul.cz,"Cuhlova, Renata/ABH-3653-2020","Cuhlova, Renata/0000-0002-5109-6693",SGS grant - Crossborder migration of labour mobility as a consequence of international companies' localisation,SGS grant - Crossborder migration of labour mobility as a consequence of international companies' localisation,The paper was processed under the SGS grant - Crossborder migration of labour mobility as a consequence of international companies' localisation.,,14,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,283,292,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300028,0

The analyses focused on the following three groups of revenue from a real estate market: recurrent property taxes; revenue from municipal assets and taxes in respect of ownership right transfer. The main research hypothesis was made that the major metropolitan areas suffer more from the fall in this type of revenue due to economic slowdown than other big cities. In order to determine the relationship between the economic situation and the cities' revenue from the real estate market the Pearson correlation coefficient was used. The analyses were conducted on the general and detailed levels: seeking the relationship between the GDP per capita on the voivodship level and the city revenue from the real estate market and three identified above groups of revenue sources.

Findings provide strong evidence for the validity of the MDH for the Saudi market. Volatility persistence decreases when the trading volume and the number of trades are included in the conditional variance equation. The most striking finding is that contemporaneous number of trades is a better proxy for information arrival than trading volume, interacting with volatility in a manner anticipated under the MDH. This can be attributed to the unique characteristic of the Saudi equity market where only domestic investors are allowed to execute trade transactions.

We therefore augment the standard overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic labor productivity and longevity risk in that we account for gender and marital status. We simulate the abolition of pay-as-you-go pension payments, calculate the resulting intergenerational welfare changes and isolate aggregate efficiency effects for singles and families by means of compensating transfers. We find that abolishing social security creates significant efficiency losses which are substantially higher for singles compared to married couples. A decomposition of the efficiency loss reveals that this difference can be almost exclusively attributed to the insurance role of the family with respect to longevity risk. Neglecting differences in family structure when studying the privatization of social security, one overestimates the long run change in the capital stock by about 40 percent, the decline in labor supply by about 30 percent and the aggregate efficiency loss by even 36 percent. Given rising divorce rates and less stable marriages in almost all Western societies, our results also indicate that social security should not be reduced but strengthened in the future.","[Fehr, Hans] Univ Wurzburg, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany; [Fehr, Hans; Kindermann, Fabian] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Fehr, Hans] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Kallweit, Manuel] VDA, Berlin, Germany; [Kallweit, Manuel] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",University of Wurzburg; Tilburg University; Ifo Institut; University of Bonn,"Fehr, H (通讯作者)，Univ Wurzburg, Sanderring 2, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",hans.fehr@uni-wuerzburg.de,,"Kindermann, Fabian/0000-0002-7845-4948","Project Familienstruktur, Einkommensunsicherheit and oeffentliche Finanzpolitik - Eine numerische Gleichgewichtsanalyse (Fritz Thyssen Stiftung)","Project Familienstruktur, Einkommensunsicherheit and oeffentliche Finanzpolitik - Eine numerische Gleichgewichtsanalyse (Fritz Thyssen Stiftung)","We thank the editor Ayse Imrohoroglu as well as two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

This has been done despite that there is no accepted definition of the term in the literature. In this paper, we study historical transitions across income groups to see whether there is any evidence that supports the claim that some middle-income economies do not advance. Overall, the data refute this proposition and, as a consequence, we reject the existence of a middle-income trap as a generalized phenomenon. Instead, we argue that what distinguishes economies in their transition from middle to high income is the speed of these transitions, fast versus slow, a standard growth question. We find that, historically, those economies that graduated from lower-middle income ($2000 in 1990 purchasing power parity [PPP] $) to upper-middle income ($7250 in 1990 PPP $) did it in about 55years. Likewise, we find that, historically, it took 15years for an economy to graduate from upper-middle income to high income (above $11,750 in 1990 PPP $). Our analysis implies that, as of 2013, there were 10 (out of 39) lower-middle-income economies and 4 (out of 15) upper-middle-income economies that were experiencing slow transitions' (i.e., above 55 and 15years, respectively). The historical evidence presented in this paper indicates that economies move up across income groups. The analysis of a large sample of economies over many decades also indicates that many economies that today are high income spent many decades traversing the middle-income segment.","[Felipe, Jesus; Kumar, Utsav] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept ERCD, Manila Adb, Philippines; [Galope, Reynold] Metropolitan State Univ, Coll Community Studies & Publ Affairs, St Paul, MN USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Metropolitan State University,"Felipe, J (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept ERCD, Manila Adb, Philippines.",jfelipe@adb.org,"Galope, Reynold/JUF-6513-2023","Galope, Reynold/0000-0002-1713-895X",,,,,16,29,31,7,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

On the other hand, indicators of human and social development, healthcare, and education have been particularly poor. I argue that the polarization of economic power plays an important role for this development. Furthermore, I analyze the structure of the Dominican economy in order to show that the country has relied on tourism, services, and special economic zones to obtain relatively high growth rates. These activities do not require high-skilled labor and will not allow the economy to generate high incomes for the population, but benefit a few families who control most conglomerates. In turn, this explains low investment in education and social spending, as well as low taxation rates.","[Flechtner, Svenja] European Univ Flensburg, Dept Int & Inst Econ, Flensburg, Germany",,"Flechtner, S (通讯作者)，European Univ Flensburg, Dept Int & Inst Econ, Flensburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,33,2,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We extend these estimations by running the data at four different time intervals, each representing different economic or political regimes in Turkey. In the second part, we repeat the same exercise at sectoral level for 176 countries over the period 1994-2010, using the BACI database. Aggregate estimates show that the gravity model is very effective in explaining the export and import flows of Turkey and that all close-by regions, including EU27, have a significant impact on trade flows of Turkey. We also find that the EU Customs Union has a negative effect on Turkish exports and a positive effect on imports. Estimates at selected time intervals reinforce aggregate estimates and sectoral level analyses indicate that while some regions contribute positively in all or the majority of sectors, others contribute negatively or produce mixed results.","[Frede, Julian] Univ Trier, Dept Econ, Trier, Germany; [Yetkiner, Hakan] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Econ, Izmir, Turkey",Universitat Trier; Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Frede, J (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Dept Econ, Trier, Germany.",Julian.Frede@deginvest.de,"Yetkiner, Hakan/D-5955-2014","Yetkiner, Hakan/0000-0002-4455-8757",,,,,27,10,11,3,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In doing so, we use the long-term data of 10 OECD countries for a maximum time span of 1800-2009. We find that the validity of Wagner's law is likely to vary strongly over time for each country. A roughly similar feature in most of the countries is that the law is less valid in the earliest stage of economic development as well as in the advanced stages, with the validity tending to follow an inverted U-shaped pattern with economic development. Further, our results indicate that the long-run growth of government size cannot be adequately explained by Wagner's law.

Accounting for nonstationarity and cointegration, we use the dynamic OLS estimator to estimate the impact of domestic and non-domestic R&D capital stock on labour productivity of Spanish communities, taking into account trade-, migration- and foreign direct investment (FDI)-related technology diffusion channels. We find significant trade-related spillover effects within Spanish communities and from EU countries. On average, an increase in the non-domestic R&D stock of 1% increases their labour productivity between 0.02% and 0.12% if related to bilateral trade pattern. Moreover, migration within Spanish communities has a negative impact ranging between -0.07% and -0.16% on labour productivity as the impact of inward migration is dominated by outward migration. There is no robust impact from FDI inflows of OECD countries in general or EU countries in particular. Finally, the domestic R&D stock, physical capital and human capital are shown to be significant drivers for labour productivity in Spain no matter if non-domestic (local or foreign) spillover effects are trade-, migration- or FDI-related.","[Hafner, Kurt A.] Heilbronn Univ, Fac Int Business, Heilbronn, Germany; [Cabrer Borras, Bernardi] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Dept Anal Econ, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Hafner, KA (通讯作者)，Heilbronn Univ, Fac Int Business, Heilbronn, Germany.",kurt.hafner@hs-heilbronn.de,,,,,,,50,1,1,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Recently mostly IQ tests are used to measure individuals' cognitive abilities. However, high scores in IQ tests do not mean the ability of rational decision making. Even highly intelligent individuals (successful in IQ tests) can make very irrational decisions. Intelligence measured in IQ tests and rationality are two different concepts, since important components of rationality like adaptive responding, good judgment, and decision making are not assessed on actual tests of intelligence. From this reason it was constructed a Comprehensive Assessment of Rational Thinking (CART) by Keith Stanovich, whose research group has found systematic differences among individuals in the tendency to make errors of judgment and decision making and therefore their efficiency of achieving their goals. This article briefly summarizes the development of CART test, terminology like epistemic rationality and instrumental rationality and introduces the first results of the CART testing in the Czech Republic with the goal to compare rationality of the Czech population by gender, education and net earnings.","[Havlickova, Blanka] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dept Tourism, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Havlícková, B (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Namesti Winstona Churchilla, Prague 13000 3, Czech Republic.",blanka.havlickova@vse.cz,,,[IG206017],,"IG206017 Economic, security and system changes in international tourism.",,8,0,0,0,0,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-5233-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,429,434,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0QL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000492966900062,0

The key dimension of heterogeneity is whether cities are likely to have manufacturing for export outside their regions, as opposed to being exclusively market towns providing local services to agricultural hinterlands. In regions where cities are likely to be manufacturing centers (25% of our sample), drier conditions increase urbanization and total urban incomes. There, urban migration provides an escape from negative agricultural moisture shocks. However, in the remaining market towns (75% of our sample), cities just service agriculture. Reduced farm incomes from negative shocks reduce demand for urban services and derived demand for urban labor. There, drying has little impact on urbanization or total urban incomes.

Entrepreneurs choose firm size, capital structure, consumption, default and whether to incorporate. We find that less risk-averse entrepreneurs tend to incorporate while more risk-averse entrepreneurs do not; this occurs because leaving some personal assets exposed by not incorporating allows more risk-averse borrowers to credibly commit to lower default rates. We show that incorporation is determined by two effects: the standard effect that bankruptcy insures low firm returns and a new scale effect-more risk-averse entrepreneurs run smaller firms and default more often. The more risk-averse choose to leave some personal assets unshielded in bankruptcy due to a commitment problem that dominates the value of insurance. The less risk-averse run larger firms, default less and incorporate.","[Herranz, Neus; Krasa, Stefan] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Villamil, Anne P.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Iowa,,stefankrasa@gmail.com; annevillamil@gmail.com,"Villamil, Anne/IUP-6469-2023","Villamil, Anne/0000-0002-3867-5164",National Science Foundation [SES-031839]; NCSA [SES050001]; Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership at the University of Illinois; Kauffman Foundation [20061258],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NCSA; Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership at the University of Illinois; Kauffman Foundation,"We thank Cristina De Nardi, Jamsheed Shorish and Yiannis Vailakis for useful discussions.

I do not find an environmental Kuznets curve-type relation between income and deforestation. Albeit I find a negative relation between income and the deforestation probability, this relation turns insignificant once I take into account specific socio-economic household characteristics: better education, higher relative affluence, younger age, self-employment, a higher value of nonproductive assets owned by the household as well as affiliation to an ethnic majority significantly reduce the deforestation probability. Received credits, remittances or (public) transfers do not significantly affect the deforestation probability. This implies for development policy that pure income-increasing financial support does not suffice for curbing poverty-related deforestation. Fostering education, social status, doing business and private ownership of assets are more promising options.","[Huebler, Michael] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Hübler, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",huebler@iuw.uni-hannover.de,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 756],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work benefited from support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [FOR 756].,,13,9,12,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Financing the region's huge demand for infrastructure investments is an essential issue for policy-makers across the region. Against the backdrop of expanding fiscal burdens of Asian governments and more stringent capital requirements on bank lending, local currency bonds can serve as an alternative for infrastructure financing in Asia. In this paper, we use empirical analysis to identify the major determinants of infrastructure bond market development. Evidence indicates that an economy's size is positively related to infrastructure bond market development. Furthermore, we find that Project Bond Initiative, a European Union initiative, contributed significantly to infrastructure development in Europe. The implication for Asian policy-makers is that deepening regional integration of Asian bond markets would help Asian economies to reach an efficient economic scale to foster infrastructure bond market and policy measures in the forms of credit enhancement would facilitate issuance of infrastructure bonds.","[Hyun, Suk] Korea Capital Market Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Donghyun; Tian, Shu] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines",Korea Capital Market Institute; Asian Development Bank,"Hyun, S (通讯作者)，Korea Capital Market Inst, Financial Serv Ind Dept, 143 Uisadang Daero, Seoul, South Korea.",bigsuk@gmail.com,,,,,,,27,5,5,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Different caregiving activities are examined, including caring for household adults, caring for non-household adults, and caring for children. Different aspects of well-being are examined, including how meaningful respondents find their activities and how happy, sad, tired, in pain, and stressed their activities make them. The results show that, controlling for selection into caregiving, most caregiving negatively affects the well-being of retirees.

Competencies have to lead to effective performance, which means that the performance of a person with competency must be significantly better than that of a person without it. Competencies are components of a job, which are reflected in behavior that is observable in a workplace. The question is how we can find the key competencies of a high performer.

The decision of each firm consists of two stages. In the first stage, the owner offers his manager a contract based on profits and sales. In the second stage, the manager chooses its output or price. Several possible sequential games will be analysed, depending on the sequence of the strategic variables. In the first scenario in which firm 1 makes a contract decision and a producing decision sequentially, and firm 2 follows in the same fashion, we show that any delegation equilibrium in which both owners commit their managers to profit-maximising behaviour disappears. In the second scenario in which the firms first enter into the contract stage and then Stackelberg competition follows in the second stage, sales-based delegation occurs. If firms compete in quantities, second mover advantage appears if firms make simultaneous delegation contracts, while first mover advantage is recovered if they make sequential contracts. If firms compete in prices, the results are reversed.","[Kim, Jeong-Yoo] Kyung Hee Univ, Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Joon Yeop] POSTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pohang Si, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH),"Kwon, JY (通讯作者)，POSTECH, Div Humanities & Social Sci, Pohang Si, South Korea.",jykwon@postech.ac.kr,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In most universities, salaries of teachers were determined by their position, workload, and the execution of wide list of additional responsibilities and activities. Many universities developed remuneration systems with a large number of indicators, which does not allow highlighting priorities, what leads to dispersion of resources and the inability to use the material incentive tools for solving the most important tasks of the university.

The passenger carrier continued to receive government subsidies but closed several rail lines, which led to protests by passengers. The freight carrier earned large profits from the transit of Russian oil to Europe, but invested its money in buying used American locomotives, rather than rebuilding the track. Both companies laid off about half of their workforce, provoking the first private-sector strike in Estonia since the collapse of Communism. In 2006, a new government bought back the freight services and track at more than twice the sale price, an expensive lesson in the perils of privatisation.","[Lust, Aleksander] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Govt & Justice Studies, Boone, NC 28608 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Lust, A (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Govt & Justice Studies, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",lusta@appstate.edu,,,,,,,140,1,1,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,,2017,29.0,1,,,,,71,89,,10.1080/14631377.2016.1237041,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EL2KO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394448800004,0

Human Resource management is critical to competitive success, especially in SMEs it has to face various constrains and limitations. The analysis of HRM in Czech companies was done on data collected within selected Czech companies (People management forum members as a main HRM managers association) in April 2015. As it was expected based on the literature overview in small companies HR processes are often less developed than in small and large companies. On the other hand some results may indicate that small companies have started to develop knowledge regarding the importance of HR in the company. Results brought in this paper contribute to the debate about importance of HRM from different perspectives and show which activities are crucial part of HRM in Czech companies.","[Marsikova, Katerina] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic; [Mendes, Andressa] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Escola Politecn, Ave Athos da Silveira Ramos,149 Cidade Univ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Technical University Liberec; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Marsiková, K (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",katerina.marsikova@tul.cz; andressafigueiredo@poli.ufrj.br,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-349-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,213,221,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6CS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426486500024,0

The resulting fishing derbies led to an increased number of accidents and fatalities. We show that the subsequently implemented individual fishing quota programs led to a sharp reduction in the number of fatalities, in large part because of lower pressure to make risky trip decisions, in particular under adverse weather conditions.","[Marvasti, Akbar] NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Marvasti, Akbar] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA; [Dakhlia, Sami] ESCE Int Business Sch, 10 Rue Sextius Michel, F-75015 Paris, France",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Miami,"Marvasti, A (通讯作者)，NOAA, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 75 Virginia Beach Dr, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Marvasti, A (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",akbar.marvasti@noaa.gov; sami.dakhlia@esce.fr,"Dakhlia, Sami/AAA-3652-2021","Dakhlia, Sami/0000-0002-0329-6391",NOAA,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The opinions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA.

The European Union, principally, should be the most suitable institution to limit financialisation in favour of a more social Europe, given that it is often considered to be a shield against the harsh winds of globalisation.

Quantile regressions show that profit and market share premia from being connected increase along the firm-size distribution, especially in highly regulated sectors. These patterns are partly explained by Ben Ali's relatives sorting into the most profitable sectors. The market shares of connected firms are positively correlated with exit and concentration rates in highly regulated sectors.

Since the very beginning the Berthaus concept what was originally complex social phenomenon with developed internal structure, by economists has been simplified to, their words, economic content, it means to simple consumption of material goods. Jevons along with his contenporaries and early followers consciously underwent the simplification to comply with the requirements for the economics as a mathematical theory, as physics of society. He needed for his theory an easy abstract concept comparable with universality of Theory of Gravity. Despite the original neoclassic economists considered their theories complete, the principle of utility maximization which was later named rational consumer choice has become subject for later unflagging neoclassical development. The paper aims to remind simplicity of original neoclassical utility maximalization principle in conceptions of founders of neoclassical theory (Jevons, Menger, Mill, Wallras, Marshall) in contrast with new utility theory and to point out that the principle is meaningful as long it is seen in original abstract form.

One manifestation of this imbalance is the lack of supply of graduates who received diplomas of engineers. The answer to this situation was activities of the state aimed at increasing the number of places for training in engineering area and the reduction of places for training in other areas. The idea of the study: if there is a shortage of engineering graduates then we should expect a higher rate of employment of graduates with engineering education, both in general and in accordance with the education profile. If the rate of employment is higher for young engineers than other graduates, then the reasons for the declared deficit should be sought in the unattractiveness of the jobs offered to engineers. Regression analysis showed that engineering education does not increase the likelihood of young people employment. The declared reasons of the engineering personnel shortage are not low volume of training in the universities, but unattractiveness of jobs (especially on wages) offered at industrial enterprises employing engineers.","[Stuken, Tatiana; Korzhova, Olga] Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, 55a Prospekt Mira, Omsk 644077, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Stuken, T (通讯作者)，Dostoevsky Omsk State Univ, 55a Prospekt Mira, Omsk 644077, Russia.",stuken@mail.ru; KorzhovaOS@omsu.ru,"Korzhova, Olga/G-2441-2017; Stuken, Tatiana/H-6777-2016",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-12-4,,,,2017,,,,,,,1577,1585,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL7PR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455325300157,0

This article attempts to formulate a proposal for stabilization and recovery that includes upfront key policy actions to deal with the drastic foreign exchange constraint. We consider the recovery of foreign currency liquidity to be of paramount importance. This will allow not only the lifting of exchange control and the implementation of a stable and competitive real exchange rate, but also the removal of shortages across the board and output recovery. The recovery of domestic activity will also require supply-side relief in the form of broad deregulation, institutional changes, and a sensible policy to lift price controls. To maintain a stable and competitive exchange rate, we propose a whole set of policy measures for rapid suppression of inflation and the causal mechanisms that have formed over the years. A monetary reform and the support of monetary and fiscal policy for successful stabilization and recovery efforts are also discussed.","[Vera, Leonardo] Univ Cent Venezuela, Escuela Econ, Faces, Ciudad Univ, Caracas, Venezuela",University of Central Venezuela,"Vera, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Venezuela, Escuela Econ, Faces, Ciudad Univ, Caracas, Venezuela.",,,,,,,,21,4,7,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In this line, mutual fund demand can be measured as the total net cash flows experienced by the fund during a period. Due to a lack of the data for inflows and outflows in some countries and databases, many authors estimate the net cash flows using fund size and return information. This rough measure, although being a good approximation, implicitly assumes an error in its calculation. For a sample of 2985 US open-end funds, we find evidence that estimating this implied fund flows, the error generated is higher for smaller funds, funds with higher returns, and for those experiencing higher levels of inflows or outflows. This lack of precision leads to a distortion in the estimation of the effect of some determinants on the mutual fund demand, especially when longer periods are considered when constructing the net cash flows.","[Victor de Mingo-Lopez, Diego; Carlos Matallin-Saez, Juan] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finance & Accounting, E-12071 Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"de Mingo-López, DV (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finance & Accounting, E-12071 Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",demingo@uji.es,"de Mingo-López, Diego Víctor/B-1214-2017","de Mingo-López, Diego Víctor/0000-0001-5702-1556; Matallin Saez, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7213-4695",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55221-P]; Universitat Jaume I [PREDOC-2014-04],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Universitat Jaume I,This work was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55221-P] and Universitat Jaume I [PREDOC-2014-04].,,19,0,0,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using 2000-2013 panel data from 27 manufacturing industries in China, this study conducts both probit and Tobit tests and shows that international outsourcing led to SBTC in China's manufacturing industries. A positive correlation is found between international outsourcing and the increase in the skill premium in both static and dynamic models. For each 1-percent increase in the international outsourcing index, the skill premium will rise approximately 10 percent. This finding indicates the existence of a mechanism through which the effect of international outsourcing on the skill premium is reinforced where SBTC is occurring. However, this may enlarge wage gaps within the same industry. Therefore, China should not only use the skill premium to promote the transformation and upgrading of industries benefiting from outsourcing and optimize the structure of employment but also prevent the negative effects of an increased skill premium.","[Wang, Jun] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wangjun200213@163.com,,,"Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [15YJA790056, 15JJD790042]",Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China,This research is supported by the Humanity and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (Grant Nos. 15YJA790056 and 15JJD790042).,,39,3,4,3,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2017,25.0,1,,,,,109,126,,10.1111/cwe.12189,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EK3QC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393839900007,0

The results show that: (1) there is no enough evidence to support that the preliminary and first revised data are unbiased and efficient; (2) there exist systematic errors related to the state of the economy, and hence information about the state of the economy was not incorporated into the GDP data.

In this study we examine the conditions of rapid foreign direct investment (FDI) expansion that can be beneficial to firm performance. In order to do so we examine a firm's internal factors, such as firm specific advantages (FSAs) and strategy, as well as external factors including domestic and foreign influences that moderate the relationship between firm performance and the speed of FDI expansion. By conducting empirical tests on data on Polish firms' expansion, we find that some FSAs (profit per employee and foreign sales), as well as some aspects relevant to strategy (geographic and cultural distances), negatively influence the relationship between speed of FDI expansion and firm performance. From our results we conclude that Polish companies are unique in the way that neither gradual internationalization nor rapid foreign expansion amounts to a suitable strategy for them. The Polish market, exhibiting a combination of transition and emerging economy characteristics, must apply its own distinctive FDI strategy to compete in foreign markets.","[Yang, Oh Suk] Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea; [Niedzielska, Marcela Julia] Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kangwon National University; Hanyang University,"Yang, OS (通讯作者)，Kangwon Natl Univ, Chunchon, South Korea.",,,,,,,,77,1,1,4,25,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Negotiating requires give and take. A good negotiation leaves each party satisfied and ready to communicate with each other or do business with each other again. During a negotiation, you may choose to use a passive, aggressive or assertive communication style. Using an assertive style will help increase your chances of negotiating successful outcomes. Your chosen strategy and style will depend on who you are negotiating with and the type of relationship you have with them.","[Zouharova, Jarmila] Unicorn Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Zouharová, J (通讯作者)，Unicorn Coll Sro, V Kapslovne 2767-2, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",zouharovajar@volny.cz,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,6,UNIV PALACKEHO V OLOMOUCI,OLOMOUC,"OLOMOUC 771 47, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-244-5233-3,,,,2017,,,,,,,464,469,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO0QL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000492966900068,0

Using new data from a representative sample of 2668 Swedish expatriates, we examine the robustness of high social trust in countries with different levels of institutional quality. The results suggest that individual trust decreases with length of stay in countries with high corruption and low rule of law. The effect is relatively small and driven by expatriates who were aged 30 years or below upon arrival to the new country. While other studies have found that trust among migrants adapts to destination country trust levels, we find that after the (approximate) age of 30, high trust is a sticky personality trait. The results are robust to controlling for a large array of individual characteristics (including age) and support the view that social trust is sensitive to events that occur early in life.","[Bergh, Andreas] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Ohrvall, Richard] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58138 Linkoping, Sweden; [Bergh, Andreas; Ohrvall, Richard] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Linkoping University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Bergh, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",andreas.bergh@ifn.se; richard.ohrvall@ifn.se,"Bergh, Andreas/E-9962-2018; Bergh, Andreas/AAM-2478-2020","Bergh, Andreas/0000-0003-2621-6769; Ohrvall, Richard/0000-0002-0806-5664",Swedish Research Council; Torsten Soderberg's Foundation,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Torsten Soderberg's Foundation,Financial support from the Swedish Research Council and Torsten Soderberg's Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.,,48,18,18,0,6,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Recently, however, society and many players in the political arena have begun to care not only about job quantity and quantitative employment levels, but also about the quality of the jobs created. This study provides the first systematic literature review of research on the quantity and quality of jobs created by entrepreneurial firms. Our review shows that entrepreneurial firms have a long-lasting and positive effect on job creation. This effect seems to be due to a very small fraction of young, high-growth firms. With regard to job quality, however, the findings are less clear cut: while some studies indicate that entrepreneurial firms do create higher-quality jobs, a multitude of studies indicate that these jobs are of lower quality. We also show that entrepreneurial firms attract a different type of employee than established firms. For example, employees in entrepreneurial firms attach a lower weight to salary and job security than those in established firms, and instead assign greater value to responsibility, innovation, and challenges. Another finding is that many jobs in entrepreneurial firms are filled by formerly unemployed individuals. The review concludes with policy implications and avenues for future research.","[Block, Joern H.; Fisch, Christian O.] Trier Univ, Trier, Germany; [Block, Joern H.; Fisch, Christian O.] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Praag, Mirjam] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [van Praag, Mirjam] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [van Praag, Mirjam] CEPR, London, England; [van Praag, Mirjam] TI, London, England",Universitat Trier; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Copenhagen Business School; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Block, JH (通讯作者)，Trier Univ, Trier, Germany.;Block, JH (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",block@uni-trier.de; cfisch@uni-trier.de; mvp.ino@cbs.dk,"Block, Joern/K-2208-2016","Block, Joern/0000-0003-4564-0346; Fisch, Christian/0000-0003-3609-7193",,,,,54,19,23,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Members of the social networking service Facebook express positive support to content on the website by clicking a Like button. We set up a natural field experiment to test whether users are more prone to support content if someone else has done so before. To find out to what extent conformity depends on group size and social ties we use three different treatment conditions: (1) one stranger has Liked the content, (2) three strangers have Liked the content, and (3) a friend has Liked the content. The results show that one Like from a single stranger had no impact. However, increasing the size of the influencing group doubled the probability that subjects expressed positive support. Friendship ties were also decisive. People were, on average, four times more likely to press the Like button if a friend, rather than a stranger, had done so before them. The existence of threshold effects in our experiment clearly shows that both group size and social proximity matters when opinions are shaped.","[Egebark, Johan; Ekstrom, Mathias] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Grevgatan 32, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ekstrom, Mathias] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Ekström, M (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Grevgatan 32, S-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.;Ekström, M (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",mathias.ekstrom@nhh.no,,,,,,,44,16,17,0,49,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

We add to this debate by studying the effects of offering full-day child care on child development. Specifically, we analyze the consequences of a substantial increase of full-day slots at the expense of half-day slots and hence, when holding the extensive margin constant. The conversion was triggered by several reforms to the German child care system. Using unique administrative data covering the full population of eight birth cohorts in one West German state, we find that more hours have a negative effect on children's socio-emotional well-being. Subgroup analysis suggests that this result is driven by children from disadvantaged family backgrounds, especially those from low-education backgrounds, single-parent households and migrant families. On a brighter note, we find that full-day care has a positive effect on the school readiness of immigrant children.","[Felfe, Christina] Univ Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany; [Felfe, Christina] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Zierow, Larissa] Ifo Inst Munich, Munich, Germany; [Zierow, Larissa] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",University of Wurzburg; Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut; University of Munich,"Zierow, L (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst Munich, Munich, Germany.;Zierow, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",zierow@ifo.de,"Zierow, Larissa/IVH-2324-2023","Zierow, Larissa/0000-0002-1793-9175",Profile Area Economic Policy at the University of St. Gallen; Chair for Population Economics at the University of Munich (LMU); University of Munich (LMU),Profile Area Economic Policy at the University of St. Gallen; Chair for Population Economics at the University of Munich (LMU); University of Munich (LMU),"We thank two anonymous referees and the editor for their inspiring input and helpful suggestions.

We exploit variation in sex ratios - the number of men divided by the number of women in a region - across Germany induced by WWII. In the 1990 elections, women were more likely to run for office in constituencies that had relatively fewer men in 1946. We do not find a significant effect of the sex ratio on the likelihood of a woman winning the election. These results suggest that while women were more likely to run for a seat in parliament in constituencies with lower historical sex ratios, voters were not more inclined to vote for them.

Brand building is a neglected engine of capital formation, innovation and institutional change in market economies. The nature of brands and the service streams they generate have been construed too narrowly. Brands are capital: entrepreneurs use brands as market-making devices that create value and capture profit, while consumers use brands to derive psychic income and lifestyle benefits. Brands are building blocks that can be combined in production to fill perceived gaps in brand architectures and capital structures. These structures are themselves complex adaptive systems. In an era of digital technological platforms, complex generative networks are the institutional locus of brand creation and brand extensions. Innovation in brand building is a socially distributed, service-intensive and interpretive process; it entails combinatorial experiments in resource integration by heterogeneous and socially connected actors, such as entrepreneur-producers, end-users and distributors. Legal brand owners never have total control over their brands - customer networks often exercise substantial de facto control rights (economic property rights) over the use and transformation of brands. Both the entire branding system (as a form of organization) and individual iconic brands can crystallize into relatively stable institutions that orient and coordinate market behaviour.","[Harper, David A.] NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Endres, Anthony M.] Univ Auckland, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",New York University; University of Auckland,"Harper, DA (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10003 USA.",david.harper@nyu.edu; a.endres@auckland.ac.nz,"Harper, David A/U-3706-2018","Harper, David A/0000-0002-4716-3638",,,,,46,5,6,2,34,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

The inclusion of EPU measures, either for the US, the UK or for overall European economies, improves the forecasting ability of models based on standard financial market information, especially for the period before the 2008 global crisis. However, during and after the crisis period, the slope of the yield curve and excess stock market returns improves the out-of-sample forecast performance the most compared to an AR-benchmark model.

We exploit variation in the practice of Islam across Turkish NUTS3 regions and we find that firms located in regions characterised by stronger religiousness are more likely to enter export destinations with a higher share of Muslims among their population. This result is robust to the control for past trade, common language, cultural and migration ties as well as for selective trade policy in favour of politically connected religious business groups. In particular, religious proximity eases export entry for producers of trust intensive goods, it favours subsequent foreign market entries and reduces the export exit probability. All in all, our evidence supports an export enhancing effect of religious proximity working through export sunk costs reduction rather than through similarity in preferences.","[Lo Turco, Alessia] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Maggioni, Daniela] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Maggioni, D (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",a.loturco@univpm.it; daniela.maggioni@unive.it,,/0000-0002-4942-5486,,,,,57,11,12,1,11,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0147-5967,1095-7227,,J COMP ECON,J.

Hence, a universal childcare system with easy access has the potential to make a substantial difference in children's lives and reduce socio-economic disparities in educational outcomes. However, if childcare quality varies across centers, universal childcare systems can also potentially increase disparities in school readiness if the children of more highly-educated parents select into centers of higher quality. Using a unique dataset with one-to-one assessments of school readiness skills among 627 five-year-olds attending 67 different childcare centers, we investigate differences in childcare quality by testing whether covariate adjusted assessments scores are clustered by center. Through fixed effect and random effect analyses, we demonstrate significant variation in school readiness across centers.

We consider a three-player sequential game in which the first and third players do not interact sequentially, but only through an intermediary, the second player. We posit that the third player's decision to cooperate depends on his indirect higher order belief, namely, his belief about what the first player believes the second player would choose. We employ pre-play communication between the first and third players as a way to influence the third player's indirect higher order belief. The evidence demonstrates that communication can effectively induce cooperation from the third player by shaping his indirect higher order belief.","[Wu, Jiabin] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 515 PLC 1285, Eugene, OR 97403 USA",University of Oregon,"Wu, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 515 PLC 1285, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",jwu5@uoregon.edu,,"WU, JIABIN/0000-0001-6515-9678",,,,,39,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Using historical data for a large set of countries dating back to the nineteenth century and applying a difference-in-difference design we find that the introduction of a constitutional BBR leads to a reduced probability of experiencing a sovereign debt crisis. We estimate that debt-to-GDP ratio decreases by around eleven percentage points on average, most of these consolidation being explained by decreasing expenditures rather than increasing tax revenues. Using the same methodology and sample, we do not find evidence that non-constitutional BBRs included in national legislation affect these variables. Additional estimates gained from applying the synthetic control method on nine selected case study countries in Africa, Europe, and Latin America are consistent with the main findings, but also highlight the importance of country specific circumstances when evaluating the success of BBRs.

Positive returns, however, are only possible for sophisticated strategies that consider information on the risk of the signal providers' portfolios. Moreover, no strategy reveals a positive abnormal return after transaction costs in the sense of a Carhart four-factor model. Further, we analyze predictors of the weekly returns of the signal providers in a panel set-up.

Facing a competitiveness loss in southern countries due to misalignments, three sets of alternative economic policy are investigated: a policy-mix based on tax rebates to improve competitiveness; an increase in intra-European financing by banks of northern countries; and an issuance of Eurobonds to pool European sovereign debt.","[Duwicquet, Vincent] Univ Lille 1, CLERSE CNRS, Lille, France; [Mazier, Jacques; Saadaoui, Jamel] Univ Paris XIII, CEPN CNRS, Paris, France; [Saadaoui, Jamel] Univ Strasbourg, BETA CNRS, Strasbourg, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Saadaoui, J (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France.",saadaoui@unistra.fr,"Saadaoui, Jamel/AAG-2386-2021","Saadaoui, Jamel/0000-0003-1143-4480; Duwicquet, Vincent/0000-0003-0376-0518",,,,,45,5,5,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2018,69.0,4,,,,,737,767,,10.1111/meca.12211,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GW3VZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446838300002,0

Our study finds that firms with higher conflicts of interest among managers and shareholders pay lower dividends. In the context of the conflicts of interest among major and minor shareholders, we find that such conflicts would exert little impact on dividend payments. Further, we find that the family-controlled firms prefer to pay less dividends whereas the corporations with higher state ownership are associated with larger dividend payments. Our findings are in line with the argument that the Indonesian state consider corporate dividends as one of the main sources of revenues other than corporate taxes in their government budget.

Households with higher education adopt accounts and experience rises in savings and income, while low education households do not. However, the benefits to adopters are used to help insure the rest of the village - in contrast to suggestions elsewhere in the literature that savings may negatively impact sharing through networks. Non-savers experience large rises in transfer receipts, improved food consumption, and better health. The worst-off households experience particularly strong increases in informal aid. Findings show financial markets expansion has immediate effects beyond service-users, with large and surprising impacts on informal support systems.

This decreases the organizational complexity of allowing more flexible payment terms for customers. We test whether subsidies, deposit requirements, and access to a mobile money savings vehicle increase the propensity of households to purchase an improved but more expensive sanitation service. While high subsidies increase purchases of the improved service, interventions inspired by mental accounting such as deposit requirements and earmarked savings accounts do not. The option to save in earmarked accounts using mobile money caused households to substitute away from purchasing the improved service in the general market and towards purchasing it through our providers, rather than substituting away from the unimproved service.

We find that R&D, productivity and total surplus are highest in a hub economy and lowest in a spoke, while intermediate levels are exhibited by countries in a symmetric network. Thus, regional/preferential trade agreements, resulting in asymmetric trade networks, benefit hubs but harm spokes.

The test results indicate the presence of nonlienarity in the relationship between public spending and GDP in Croatia and Slovenia as well.

We find a negative effect of school removals on primary school and junior high school completion rates. However, we also find positive effects on educational attainment beyond junior high school for those students who began their education in the new merged primary schools. This effect can be attributed to resource pooling and higher teacher quality in the new schools. The adverse effects are more severe for girls, especially if new schools did not provide boarding and are located far away from student residences, and also for children whose parents have low educational attainment, thus exacerbating gender inequality and intergenerational transmission of education inequality.","[Haepp, Tobias] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Lidan] Renmin Univ China, Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Renmin University of China,"Lyu, LD (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Ctr Populat & Dev Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lvld@ruc.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [16CRK023],National Social Science Fund of China,This work was supported by The National Social Science Fund of China [grant number 16CRK023].,,53,7,7,2,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Our paper uses recent high-frequency data (HFD) and investigates price comovements in the context of normal times and crisis periods. To this end, we applied a non-Gaussian Asymmetrical Dynamic Conditional Correlation (ADCC)-GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model and the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) approach. This choice has three advantages: (i) With the development of high-frequency trading (HFT), it is more appropriate to use HFD to test price linkages for overlapping and nonoverlapping data. (ii) The ADCC-GARCH model captures further asymmetry in price comovements. (iii) The use of the MES enables to measure systemic risk contributions around the distribution tails. Accordingly, we offer two interesting findings. First, while the hypothesis of asymmetrical and time-varying stock return linkages is not rejected, the MES approach indicates that both European and US indices make a considerable contribution to each other's systemic risk, with significant input from Frankfurt to the French and US markets, especially following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Second, we show that the propagation of systemic risk is higher during the crisis period and overlapping trading hours than during nonoverlapping hours. Thus, the MES test is recommended as an indicator to help monitor market exposure to systemic risk and to gauge expected losses for other markets.","[Ben Ameur, Hachmi] INSEEC Business Sch, 27 Ave Claude Vellefaux, F-75010 Paris, France; [Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, Evry, France; [Louhichi, Wael] ESSCA Sch Management, Angers, France; [Cheffou, Abdoulkarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",Groupe Inseec; Universite Paris Saclay; ESSCA School of Management,"Ben Ameur, H (通讯作者)，INSEEC Business Sch, 27 Ave Claude Vellefaux, F-75010 Paris, France.",hbenameur@inseec.com,,"Ben Ameur, Hachmi/0000-0003-4424-3488; JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,53,5,5,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Three different measures of uncertainty (economic policy, financial markets and energy markets) are considered, and the magnitude and asymmetric effects of their influence are investigated. Our results suggest that there generally exists negative dependence between energy returns and changes in uncertainty. The risks of clean energy and crude oil returns are more sensitive to uncertainties in the financial and energy markets, while the impact of economic policy uncertainty is relatively weak. The upside and downside CoVaRs and Delta CoVaRs demonstrate significant asymmetric effects in response to extreme uncertainty movement. Our findings therefore have important implications for energy portfolio investment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

(2) Due to the variable nature of renewable energy infeed, the short-term demand for flexibility increases and changes the volatility of electricity prices. The more variable prices offer opportunities for controllable electricity producers (CEPs) who provide up- and down-ramping flexibility to increase their revenues. In contrast, the VREs with high degrees of simultaneity tend to pay for this flexibility in the electricity spot market to reduce their imbalance exposure. The intraday market (IDM) for electricity has gained importance for the market value of different technologies lately and continues to expand due to the increasing efforts to balance within-day deviation from day-ahead schedules. This article presents a combination and extension of two existing models to capture the peculiarities of the intraday price formation and to analyze the impact of the IDM on the market value of VREs and CEPs. Doing so, the paper suggests an adjustment of the classical market value factor metric and to go beyond classical day-ahead market (DAM) information. The article shows that market value factors (MVFs) can be stabilized if the IDM delivers 'market-based' price signals for the costs of flexibility, that are sufficient to activate flexibilities prior to the usually more expensive imbalance mechanism (IBM). Yet, the MVFs from single VRE technologies will worsen if their market share is high enough to outweigh forecast errors from other technologies and if they become a permanent price maker in the IDM and the IBM.

There would appear to be a strong case for the employment of indices which are intermediate between relative and absolute measures, and which avoid the extreme values underlying both.

The cooperative is characterized by its wealth distribution, and produces a consumption good from labor, which allocates among workers according to a convex combination of the Proportional and the Egalitarian rule. In the first stage, workers decide this combination by simple majority. In a second stage, they choose how much labor to provide to the cooperative. We find that when in the cooperative's wealth distribution, the median wealth is lower (higher) than the average, the degree of meritocracy chosen by workers is lower (higher) than that of the optimum, and coincides with it when both statistics coincide. This choice has similar consequences on the cooperative's labor-output, since it increases with respect to the degree of meritocracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Just like for transportation, shortest paths are computed, which minimize tax payments for multinational enterprises when they repatriate profits. We include corporate income tax rates, withholding taxes on dividends, double tax treaties, and double taxation relief methods. We find that treaty shopping leads to an average potential reduction of the tax burden on repatriated dividends of about 6% points. An indicator for centrality in the tax network identifies the UK, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands as the most important conduit countries. Low-tax havens do not have a crucial role in reducing dividend repatriation taxes. By contrast, tax haven financial centres do. In the regressions we find that the centrality measures are robustly significant explanatory variables for bilateral FDI stocks. This also holds for our treaty shopping indicator.","[van't Riet, Maarten; Lejour, Arjan] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Lejour, Arjan] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Tilburg University,"van't Riet, M (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",mvtr@cpb.nl; a.m.lejour@cpb.nl,"Lejour, Arjan/I-6772-2019","Lejour, Arjan/0000-0002-2866-1789; van 't Riet, Maarten/0000-0001-7248-3695",,,,,37,20,23,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

J,"Westmore, B",,,,"Westmore, Ben",,,Do government transfers reduce poverty in China? Micro evidence from five regions,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper estimates urban and rural poverty rates across five Chinese province-level administrative regions (Shanghai, Liaoning, Guangdong, Henan and Gansu) using representative household survey data from the China Family Panel Studies survey. The types of government transfer payments that households in poverty received and the ability for such payments to lift them from poverty are also assessed. Consistent with published estimates from China's National Bureau of Statistics, the results highlight substantial disparities in poverty rates between provinces in 2014. Nevertheless, for each province, the poverty rates estimated from the survey data were notably higher than the official figures. Although the problem of rural poverty continues to be a significant focus of Chinese policy makers, the results suggest that the poverty rate was higher in urban than in rural areas in most provinces. This partly owed to the higher cost of living in urban China, which is captured in the poverty lines defined for this analysis. In 2014, the most common types of government transfer received by households in poverty were agricultural subsidies or social assistance - principally the dibao. Regarding the latter, the results suggest some improvement in payment targeting in rural areas between 2012 and 2014, but the majority of dibao recipients in most provinces still had income above the defined poverty line in 2014. Furthermore, across all provinces, the vast majority of households living below the defined poverty line did not receive social assistance at that time.","[Westmore, Ben] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Econ Dept, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Westmore, B (通讯作者)，Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Econ Dept, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",ben.westmore@oecd.org,,,,,,,30,22,24,2,46,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

To achieve this objective, data were collected from a sample of 98 Iranian manufacturing and service organizations from various industry sectors at the Tehran Stock Exchange and generalized method of moments (GMM) approach was conducted for a dynamic panel data to evaluate the effect of the sustainability reporting level on the listed firms' market valuation. As can be seen from the results, the overall extent of sustainability disclosure arranged in accordance with the low rate of sustainability reporting for listed firms in TSE. It was also found that the sensitive firms have a greater level of corporate sustainability disclosure than the other firms. Moreover, sustainability reporting has been shown to be related to market valuations in which firms activating in sensitive industries environmentally with sustainability reporting had higher market valuations than firms activating in non-sensitive industries with sustainability reporting. Our '7+ 1' sustainability disclosure practice aspects all together with their basic measurement items can be applied as a checklist for assessing how well sustainability disclosure practices are performed at TSE.","[Mohammadi, Massoud Alam Dad; Mardani, Abbas; Khan, Mohd Noor Azli Ali] UTM, Azman Hashim Int Business Sch, Dept Business Adm, Skudai, Malaysia; [Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Inst Agr Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",dalia@mail.lei.lt,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Mardani, Abbas/D-5700-2015","Mardani, Abbas/0000-0003-1010-3655",,,,,110,18,20,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

First, with the Indian central bank moving towards a flexible inflation targeting framework based on the consumer price index (CPI) inflation, this paper is the first attempt in the Indian context to model dynamics of the CPI inflation. Second, in view of the recent international evidence that the observed flattening of the Phillips curve might more be an artefact of the national inflation rates being the target of monetary policy, and limited data span for the new CPI inflation series, this paper explores the Phillips curve relationship in India using sub-national data in a panel framework. The estimates in this paper confirm the presence of a conventional Phillips curve specification. Excess demand conditions have the expected hardening effect on inflation. Exchange rate movements are also found to impact inflation. (c) 2018 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, in order to model income, we apply distributional regression relating potentially each parameter of the conditional income distribution to the covariates. Secondly, we determine the vulnerability cutoff endogenously instead of defining a household as vulnerable if its probability of being poor in the next period is larger than 0.5. For this purpose, we employ the receiver operating characteristic curve that is able to consider prerequisites according to a particular targeting mechanism. Using long-term panel data from Germany, we build both mean and distributional regression models with the established 0.5 probability cutoff and our vulnerability cutoff. We find that our new cutoff considerably increases predictive performance. Placing the income regression model into the distributional regression framework does not improve predictions further but has the advantage of a coherent model where parameters are estimated simultaneously replacing the original three step estimation approach.","[Hohberg, Maike; Landau, Katja; Kneib, Thomas; Zucchini, Walter] Univ Goettingen, Chair Stat, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan] Univ Goettingen, Chair Dev Econ, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen,"Hohberg, M (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Chair Stat, Humboldtallee 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",mhohber@uni-goettingen.de,,"Kneib, Thomas/0000-0003-3390-0972",Ministry of Science and Culture (Lower Saxony),Ministry of Science and Culture (Lower Saxony),We thank two anonymous referees and Stephen Jenkins for helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

This study aims to estimate the carbon implications of these changes in the economic structure at the city level. We compiled a multiregional input-output (MRIO) model for China and used an environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) to estimate CO2 emissions in Shanghai from both production and consumption perspectives. We found that consumption-based CO2 emissions were more than 30% higher than production-based emissions in Shanghai. In recent years, both production- and consumption-based CO2 emissions in Shanghai declined because of changes in China's economic development mode. The production-based emissions declined mainly due to changes in the production structure and energy mix, while the consumption-based emissions declined mainly due to changes in consumption patterns and domestic interregional emission flows.

The value of a seller's good is known to the seller and observable by the certifier, but not by buyers. Sellers can choose to get a rating. The certification intermediary can reveal a signal of arbitrary precision about the quality of the good. In contrast to the existing literature, we allow aggregate uncertainty. As in the existing literature, one rating class is optimal. However, the certification intermediary does not generally choose a socially optimal cutoff: the certifier is more likelyto be too lenient if the distribution of aggregate uncertainty has a lower mean, a higher variance, and is more left skewed. It is more likely to be too strict if the opposite holds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

First, I show suggestive evidence that women with a first-born girl have lower survival. Second, consistent with prior literature, I find that having a first-born girl leads to fertility behaviors medically known to hurt women's survival. Third, I show new evidence of effects of a first-born girl on a mother's likelihood and severity of anemia. These outcomes are severely aggravated with each successive female birth. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that these channels can explain over a quarter of the missing mothers with first-born girls. The paper does not find evidence of discrimination in the allocation of food or receipt of iron supplements, however, severe physical domestic violence increases significantly soon after the birth of a first daughter.","[Milazzo, Annamaria] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Milazzo, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",amilazzo14@gmail.com,"Milazzo, Annamaria/C-5620-2019","Milazzo, Annamaria/0000-0003-0176-9439",,,,,81,23,25,1,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3878,1872-6089,,J DEV ECON,J.

Sweden ranks as one of the world's most gender-equal countries and at the same time a recipient of many immigrants from countries with more traditional views on gender roles and gender equality. I find that the labor force participation of immigrant women in Sweden is related to their source country culture, in the sense that women from countries where women's labor market participation is low (high) also have low (high) participation in the Swedish labor market. However, all immigrant women assimilate towards, but do not reach parity with, the participation rate of native women, and the difference between women from high- and low-participation countries diminishes with length of residence in Sweden. This indicates that source country culture on gender roles does not have a persistent effect on immigrant women's labor market participation in Sweden. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of taking into account unobservable time-constant individual and source country factors when estimating the relationship between source country culture and immigrants' labor market outcomes. Neglecting to control for these factors could lead researchers to misrepresent the rate of assimilation and overstate the effect of source country culture.","[Neuman, Emma] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden; [Neuman, Emma] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Discriminat & Integrat Studies, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Linnaeus University,"Neuman, E (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.;Neuman, E (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Discriminat & Integrat Studies, SE-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",emma.neuman@lnu.se,,,,,,,52,12,13,4,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Recent research suggests, however, that organizing production to include remote work remains challenging because employers and workers in these markets continue to lack information that is less easily communicated. Employers appear unable to accurately anticipate the full costs and benefits to them of using the market prior to entry, and continue to have difficulty evaluating worker applications even when experienced in these markets.

In accordance with existing evidence, this paper finds that periods of intervention characterized by large, infrequent and sporadic interventions are effective in moving the changes in the exchange rate in the desired direction for the full-sample period and across two of the three sub-samples.

There is no doubt that headmasters, deputy headmasters and other school managers who want to achieve excellent performance of their schools, must pay special attention to management of all employees (including teaching and non-teaching staff) because their abilities, motivation and performance determine the desired results of schools. Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article is to define particular categories of managers in Czech primary and secondary schools and specify their responsibilities and competencies in personnel management in order to propose an optimal organization of personnel management at Czech schools. Methods: Achieving the purpose of the article is based on the analysis of available scientific literature and the results of the authors' questionnaire survey on the organization of personnel management at Czech primary and secondary schools. The survey was conducted from January to March 2017. The respondents were headmasters, deputy headmasters and other managers of Czech primary and secondary schools. The relevant data were obtained from 90 respondents. The data analysis was based on the calculation of relative frequencies and the evaluation of the dependence of responses using contingency tables and chi-square tests of independence. Findings & Value added: The findings show that responsibilities tOr managing teaching and non-teaching staff at Czech schools belong not only to headmasters but also to other managers at schools, including deputy headmasters, head teachers, heads of school clubs, heads of school canteens, educational consultants, school psychologists, treasurers, or school caretakers.

MRL, which is one of non-tariff barriers with respect to food safety, is applied to home and foreign countries at the same time. Thus, firms in countries with higher food safety standards are expected to have a competitive advantage from the 'signaling effect'. The results show that high MRL standards in the U.S. have a positive impact on U.S. vegetable exports, indicating the 'signaling effect' from the strict U.S. domestic MRL standards.

Theoretical reasoning behind the role of call externalities in limiting the market share of smaller networks assumes that receiving a call contributes to consumer utility. This paper tests this critical assumption with stated-preference data elicited from subscribers of mobile telephony in Poland. Our findings show that receiver benefits are a significant driver of mobile operator choice. Thus by reducing the volume of outgoing calls, larger networks can limit customer base growth of smaller rivals. Regulatory options for mitigating this effect are discussed. The size of market share gained by introducing a common off-net markup is low: 1.7-2.8% depending on the market segment. However under symmetric termination rates, an entrant would increase its market share by 6.1-8.5% at the expense of incumbents. In case of Poland, this would shorten the catch-up period from eight to five years. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

(J Econ Growth 11(2):97-127, 2006) and Aghion et al. (in: Romer, Wolfers (eds) Brookings papers on economic activity: conference draft, Brookings, Washington, 2009) show that when economies operate close to the technological frontier, their ability to generate efficiency gains rests on the contribution of workers with advanced forms of education (i.e. tertiary). The contribution of this empirical paper is to revisit and improve the analysis of that assumption, in the context of firms located in advanced economics, assuming that what holds for OECD countries or US states should also be observed also at a more disaggregated level. To that end, we analyse a rich panel of Belgian firm-level data, covering the 2008-14 period. In the first step, we estimate each firm's proximity to frontier using stochastic frontier methods. Step 2 consists in regressing each firm's efficiency growth rate on (1) the share of workers by education attainment (2) its (initial) distance/proximity to the frontier and (3) (the main variable of interest) the interaction between (1) and (2), whose sign provides a direct test of the Vandenbussche/Aghion assumption. The main result of the paper supports the idea that the closer the firms are to what amounts to a local frontier; the more educated workers-in particular those with a master's degree-matter for efficiency gains. The paper also shows that many of them are currently employed in firms that are distant from the efficiency frontier. Reallocating them would have a positive impact on overall efficiency.","[Vandenberghe, V.] UCL, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Vandenberghe, V (通讯作者)，UCL, IRES, 3 Pl Montesquieu, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",vincent.vandenberghe@uclouvain.be,"Vandenberghe, V./L-9544-2013","Vandenberghe, V./0000-0002-1645-1127",,,,,29,0,1,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2018,166.0,3,,,,,259,283,,10.1007/s10645-018-9322-2,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GO4AM,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439942300001,0

Thus, an ex post competition policy approach would be preferable to a strict ex ante prohibition of NN violations. In contrast, the current paper argues that NN regulation is largely ineffective, in particular, when it comes to the prohibition of fast lanes and other quality of service (QoS) differentiations, and to a lesser extent, when it comes to the zero price rule. NN regulation is only effective in preventing the blocking of specific content and in preventing the favoring of ISP owned content and in preventing some price discriminations. These are also areas where NN regulations are more likely to be welfare-enhancing. Where they are ineffective, NN regulations are likely to create inefficiencies through the cost and allocative inefficiencies caused by NN bypass.

While we find short-run asymmetric effects of volatility in almost all industries, we find evidence of adjustment asymmetry in 17 exporting and nine importing industries. We also find significant impact or short-run cumulative asymmetry in 12 exporting and six importing industries. The most important finding is significant long-run asymmetric effects in 36 Malaysian exporting industries and 25 Malaysian importing industries.

It then shows that for an economy without capital over-accumulation-the empirically relevant case, cf. Abel et al. (Rev Econ Stud 56(1):1-19, 1989)-a market supplying efficiency units of labor beyond the planner's level does so by leading households to go for quality over quantity in their reproductive choices-over-investing in education and depressing fertility with respect to the planner's levels-a feature reminiscent of reproductive patterns in developed economies. It is finally shown that a pension scheme contingent to the household's fertility and education investment decentralizes the planner's allocation as an equilibrium outcome. Such pension scheme is financed through a tax on the increase in labor income that results from households education investment. Interestingly enough, the usual tax-financed compulsory education does not decentralize the planner's allocation, even when the mandatory level of education is the planner's, since it does not address the misalignment of incentives at the heart of the problem.","[Davila, Julio] Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, 34 Voie Roman Pays L1-03-01, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Dávila, J (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, 34 Voie Roman Pays L1-03-01, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",julio.davila@uclouvain.be,"DAVILA, Julio/ABE-2802-2020","DAVILA, Julio/0000-0002-5827-9118",FNRS M.I.S. - Ulysse grant; PDR [T.0044.13],FNRS M.I.S. - Ulysse grant(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); PDR,The author gratefully thanks funding from a FNRS M.I.S. - Ulysse grant and PDR T.0044.13 Research Project.,,21,5,5,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

We propose a multivariate model of volatility that decomposes volatility multiplicatively into a non-stationary (e.g. periodic) part and a stationary part with log-GARCH dynamics. Since the model belongs to the log-GARCH class, the model is robust to spikes or jumps, allows for a rich variety of volatility dynamics without restrictive positivity constraints, can be estimated equation-by-equation by means of standard methods even in the presence of feedback, and allows for Dynamic Conditional Correlations (DCCs) that can - optionally - be estimated subsequent to the volatilities. We use the model to study the hourly day-ahead system prices at Nord Pool, and find extensive evidence of periodic volatility and volatility feedback. We also find that volatility is characterised by (positive) leverage in one third of the hours, and that a DCC model provides a better fit of the conditional correlations than a Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) model.

Many explanations for this energy efficiency gap have been put forward, but there has been surprisingly little field testing of whether the conventional wisdom is correct. This article reports on the results of an experimental evaluation of the nation's largest residential energy efficiency program-the Weatherization Assistance Program-conducted on a sample of approximately 30,000 households in Michigan. The findings suggest that the upfront investment costs are about twice the actual energy savings. Furthermore, the model-projected savings are more than three times the actual savings. Although this might be attributed to the rebound effect-when demand for energy end uses increases as a result of greater efficiency-the article fails to find evidence of significantly higher indoor temperatures at weatherized homes. Even when accounting for the broader societal benefits derived from emissions reductions, the costs still substantially outweigh the benefits; the average rate of return is approximately -7.8% annually.","[Fowlie, Meredith] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fowlie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,Alfred P.

Based on province-level panel data for years 1991-2014 in rural China, it is shown that energy transition from traditional biomass energy (TBE) to traditional commercial energy (TCE) significantly decreases RECPC, while energy transition from TBE or TCE to advanced commercial energy (ACE) significantly increases RECPC. As is revealed by the energy stacking model, per capita income has a significantly negative impact on RECPC, and the impact of lagged RECPC is opposite. Due to the regulation of energy price, there exists price distortion in China's rural energy market and the price mechanism functions poorly. Besides, factors, including juvenile dependency ratio and education level, significantly reduce RECPC. Therefore, it is vital to integrate rural energy into national energy strategic system, facilitate energy transition process and introduce the market system reform of rural energy and continue to improve the education level of rural residents in rural China.

The results from cointegration and error correction modeling show that exports and imports have statistically significant impacts of opposite signs on Consumption-based CO2 emissions in both the long- and short-run and that the effects of changes in the trade-CO2 emissions relationship will fully be absorbed around three years.

The results based on hidden cointegration technique and a modified version of the Granger non-causality test, show that there exists a long-run and asymmetric relationship between government spending and government revenues. Our estimation results can be summarized into three main empirical findings. First, the government follows a hard budget constraint and soft budget constraint strategies in the case of negative and positive shocks, respectively. Second, negative shocks to the fiscal budget are removed fairly quickly compared to positive shocks. Third, bi-directional causality between revenues and expenditures offers support in favor of the fiscal synchronization hypothesis. The policy implication is that budget deficit's reduction could be achieved through government spending cut, accompanied by contemporaneous tax controls.","[Irandoust, Manuchehr] Kristianstad Univ, Sch Business Studies, Dept Econ & Finance, S-29139 Kristianstad, Sweden",Kristianstad University,"Irandoust, M (通讯作者)，Kristianstad Univ, Sch Business Studies, Dept Econ & Finance, S-29139 Kristianstad, Sweden.",manuchehr.irandoust@hkr.se,,"Irandoust, Manuchehr/0000-0003-0447-9349",,,,,43,10,10,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2018,45.0,3,,,,,543,557,,10.1007/s10663-017-9375-5,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GM8BV,,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438433600005,0

Our model assumes that the government increases debt to finance its spending in the short run, and then increases taxes or cuts spending to keep the debt-GDP ratio constant. The spending-driven government debt increases public capital and output in the short run, but decreases private investment, total capital stock, output, and net exports in the long run, and makes the future generations worse off. Among various means of debt control, a decrease in government spending seems to be the least harmful to private investment, capital stock, and output while an increase in capital taxation is most detrimental.","[Li, Shiyu] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Shuanglin] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lin, Shuanglin] Univ Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wang, Yan] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Wang, Yan] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Zhai, Fan] China Investment Corp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhai, Fan] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines",Renmin University of China; Peking University; University of Nebraska System; George Washington University; The World Bank; Asian Development Bank,"Lin, SL (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, China Ctr Publ Finance, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Lin, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Dept Econ, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",shuanglin@pku.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403280]; Beijing Social Science Fund, China [14JGC118]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Fund, China","The authors thank Bert Hofman, Laurence J.

The elasticities of income with respect to this capital are econometrically estimed through equations which also integrate human capital and R&D. The tests are performed within frameworks of modern neoclassical macrodynamic models. On this basis, we calculate an implicit rate of return of capital to test the validity of what Piketty states as a fundamental inequality, comparing rate of return on capital and income growth rate in the long run. This inequality is verified, but appears to be tendentiously challenged over the last decade. Then, Piketty's second law, arguing that the coefficient of capital tends to be equal to the ratio between savings rate and income growth rate, is examined. This second law is to be viewed as a process of asymptotic convergence in the long term (Part 2). These results are compared with new estimates for the post-1978 sub-period of capitalism with Chinese characteristics, but the fundamental inequality is no longer verified, and it is not reasonable to affirm the validity of the second law (Part 3). Finally, we address the issue of the inequalities in China.","[Long, Zhiming] Tsinghua Univ, 307C,Shanzhai Bldg,Zhishan Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Herrera, Remy] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, CNRS UMR 8174, Maison Sci Econ, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",Tsinghua University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Long, ZM (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, 307C,Shanzhai Bldg,Zhishan Rd, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhiminglong@tsinghua.edu.cn; herrera1@univ-paris1.fr,,"Long, Zhiming/0000-0003-3047-535X",,,,,58,2,2,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1043-951X,1873-7781,,CHINA ECON REV,China Econ.

Governments often react by intervening against currency depreciation as, for example, in the case of Papua New Guinea in response to the commodity price shocks of 2014. We develop an original theoretical model to analyze the balance of payments impact of a commodity price shock under alternative exchange rate regimes: a flexible rate regime and a fixed rate regime with foreign exchange rationing. The balance of payments consequences are shown to depend on the elasticity of exports and imports with respect to the exchange rate. For the Papua New Guinea case, we estimate export elasticities for a variety of commodities (gold, silver, copper, oil, coffee, cocoa, copra, copra oil, palm oil, rubber, tea, logs, and marine products) as well as for imports. The results indicate that the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied for this resource-rich economy, implying that exchange rate flexibility may be practicable. We implement our calibrated model to conduct a counter-factual simulation and find that with a flexible exchange rate, foreign reserves would have been 20 percent higher three years after the shock than they were under the actual policy of exchange rate stabilization. In light of this, we argue the merits of greater exchange rate flexibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Depending on how preferences over alternatives are extended to preferences over lotteries, there are varying degrees of efficiency and strategyproofness. In this paper, we consider four such preference extensions: stochastic dominance (SD), a strengthening of SD based on pairwise comparisons (PC), a weakening of SD called bilinear dominance (BD), and an even weaker extension based on Savage's sure-thing principle (ST). While random serial dictatorships are PC-strategyproof, they only satisfy ex post efficiency. On the other hand, we show that strict maximal lotteries are PC-efficient and ST-strategyproof. We also prove the incompatibility of (i) PC-efficiency and PC-strategyproofness for anonymous and neutral SDSs, (ii) ex post efficiency and BD-strategyproofness for pairwise SDSs, and (iii) ex post efficiency and BD-group-strategyproofness for anonymous and neutral SDSs.

DSGE models with rare disasters require solution methods that can handle the large nonlinearities triggered by low-probability, high-impact events with accuracy and speed. We solve a standard New Keynesian model with Epstein-Zin preferences and time-varying disaster risk with perturbation, Taylor projection, and Smolyak collocation. Our main finding is that Taylor projection delivers the best accuracy/speed tradeoff among the tested solutions. We also document that even third-order perturbations may generate solutions that suffer from accuracy problems and that Smolyak collocation can be costly in terms of run time and memory requirements.","[Fernandez-Villaverde, Jesus] Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Levintal, Oren] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC Herzliya, Tiomkin Sch Econ, Herzliyya, Israel",University of Pennsylvania; Reichman University,"Fernández-Villaverde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",jesusfv@econ.upenn.edu; oren.levintal@idc.ac.il,,,National Science Foundation [SES 1223271],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Marlene Isore, Pablo Winant, Xavier Gabaix, Tony Smith, the editor Karl Smedders, four referees, and participants at several seminars for comments.

Donors, who are ideologically aligned with candidates, decide how much to contribute to their own candidate. They may benefit from rent-seeking by their own candidate but dislike rent-seeking by the opposition. Increased rent-seeking by politicians thus generates campaign contributions for themselves but also mobilizes donations to the opposing candidate, potentially to a greater extent. This latter effect acts as a deterrent to rent-seeking when contributions finance electoral campaigns and positively affect election chances. When political competition is low, incumbent donors outnumber opposition donors, and limits reduce rent-seeking. When political competition is high, donors are equalized and laissez-faire reduces rent-seeking. Consistent with these hypotheses, data from the USA suggest that limits are associated with better policies and stronger growth performance at low levels of political competition, while laissez-faire is preferred when political competition is high.","[Maloney, John] Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England; [Pickering, Andrew] Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England",University of Exeter; University of York - UK,"Maloney, J (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter, Devon, England.",,,,,,,,49,1,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2018,85.0,339,,,,,479,517,,10.1111/ecca.12260,0.0,,,39,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GI5LQ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434412400004,0

Debate assumes one of two genres, depending on bias: Ajuror, say Lones, is intransigent if he wishes to prevail and reach a conviction for any type of Moritz next to concede. In contrast, Lones is ambivalent if he wants the strongest conceding types of Moritz to push for acquittal. Both jurors are ambivalent with small bias or high delay costs. As Lones grows more hawkish, he argues more forcefully for convictions, mitigating wrongful acquittals. If dovish Moritz is intransigent, then he softens (strategic substitutes), leading to more wrongful convictions. Ambivalent debate is new, and yields a novel dynamic benefit of increased polarization. For if Moritz is ambivalent, then he toughens (strategic complements), and so, surprisingly, a more hawkish Lones leads to fewer wrongful acquittals and convictions. So more polarized but balanced debate can improve communication, unlike in static cheap talk. We also show that patient and not too biased jurors vote against their posteriors near the end of the debate, optimally playing devil's advocate. We shed light on the adversarial legal system, peremptory challenges, and cloture rules.","[Meyer-Ter-Vehn, Moritz] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Meyer-Ter-Vehn, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",,"SMITH, LONES/AAF-5793-2020","Bognar, Katalin/0000-0001-8357-8569",,,,,33,2,2,1,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

The game-theoretical analysis shows which type of perfect Bayesian Nash equilibria is obtained depending on the parameter setup: perfect compliance, imperfect compliance or zero compliance. For each equilibrium, we also derive the probabilities of type I ( false-positive) and type II (false-negative) errors committed by the cartel authority. To account for the uncertainty and the vague knowledge concerning the model parameters, we perform Monte Carlo simulations based on parameter ranges extracted from the related literature. The simulations indicate that zero compliance dominates the picture and that the error probabilities are high for type II and negligible for type I errors. The results are fairly robust against correlation in the input parameters.

This paper proposes a theory of the contagion of civil wars. Weak territorial control facilitates the emergence of a regional market for war inputs in the porous frontier. The contagion effect is nonlinear and creates multiple equilibrium situations of regional complexes of civil conflicts. This helps explain the observed patterns of regional clustering of conflict and institutional quality, and raises identification issues in the measurement of the contagion effect. We also derive a positive spillover of civil wars: governments are sometimes in a position to avoid contagion by improving their institutions.

I first review some of the conceptual and empirical challenges faced when trying to accommodate this notion in micro-founded, general-equilibrium models. I next review my own research, which sheds new light on the observed business cycles by accommodating frictional coordination in the form of higher-order uncertainty. This makes room for forces akin to animal spirits even when the equilibrium is unique. It allows demand shocks to generate realistic business cycles even when nominal rigidity is absent or undone by appropriate monetary policy. It modifies the general-equilibrium predictions of workhorse macroeconomic models in manners that seem both conceptually appealing and empirically relevant.

We start from the assumption that forecasters may have a flexible rather than a symmetric (quadratic) loss function assumed in standard tests. This assumption leads to the prediction that variables available to a forecaster when a forecast was formed should have no predictive value for a binary 0/1-indicator that captures the sign of the forecast error. A test of forecast optimality, thus, can be interpreted as a classification problem. We use random forests to model this classification problem. Random forests are a powerful nonparametric modeling instrument originally developed in the machine-learning literature. Unlike conventional linear-probability or logit/probit-models, random forests account in a natural way for potential nonlinear links between the signed forecast error and the variables in a forecaster's information set. Random forests also can handle a situation in which the number of forecasts is small relative to the number of predictor variables that a researcher uses to proxy a forecaster's information set. Random forests, therefore, are a powerful modeling device that is of interest for every researcher who studies the properties of macroeconomic forecasts. Upon estimating random forests on forecasts of four German research institutes, we document that optimality of longer-term inflation forecasts cannot be rejected and that inflation forecasts are weakly efficient. For shorter-term inflation forecasts, our results are heterogeneous across research institutes. When we pool the data across the research institutes, we reject optimality of both shorter-term and longer-term forecasts.","[Behrens, Christoph; Pierdzioch, Christian; Risse, Marian] Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University,"Pierdzioch, C (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Econ, Holstenhofweg 85,POB 700822, D-22008 Hamburg, Germany.",c.pierdzioch@hsu-hh.de,,"Behrens, Christoph/0000-0002-5728-4150",German Science Foundation [FR 2677/4-1],German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We thank the German Science Foundation for financial support (Project Macroeconomic Forecasting in Great Crises; Grant number: FR 2677/4-1).

Among paired students, poor performers benefit more from CAL when paired with good performers and vice versa. Average performers benefit equally irrespective of who they are paired with.

We model bank discrimination by assuming that real estate serves as collateral and that POEs have lower loan-to-value ratios than SOEs. We find that bank discrimination causes resource misallocation by crowding out the more productive POEs, which helps to quantitatively explain the volatility of SOE output share. We further find that housing demand booms and monetary easing drive up the real estate value, enhance the borrowing capacity of SOEs by more with bank discrimination, and thus lead to a rise in SOE output share to exacerbate resource misallocation.","[Guo, Shen; Jiang, Zheng] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Acad Publ Finance & Publ Policy, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Shi, Huimin] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Renmin University of China,"Shi, HM (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, 59 Zhongguancun St, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",shenguo@cufe.edu.cn; jiangzheng@cufe.edu.cn; huiminshi@ruc.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [18XNA004],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"We are very grateful to the editor, Sushanta Mallick, and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments and valuable suggestions, which significantly improved this paper.

One reason for adaptation is the impacts of climate change. Ample case study evidence shows that such adaptation is rarely a smooth process. However, generalisable patterns of how and why barriers arise remain scarce. The study adopts a collective action perspective and the archetypes approach in a meta-analysis of 26 selected publications to explain how barriers arise in specific conditions. Focusing on adaptation of water governance in river basins, the study finds 21 reappearing patterns. Less well-established patterns relate to water property rights, hydrological standards, adaptation externalities, non-climatological uncertainty and vertical coordination. Results further show how barriers impede collective action in specific ways. The paper precisely introduces the archetypes approach, and shows that reported problems in adapting collective action under climate change arise from attributes of actors and pre-existing institutions rather than biophysical characteristics.","[Oberlack, Christoph] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Oberlack, Christoph] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Eisenack, Klaus] Humboldt Univ, Resource Econ Grp, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",University of Bern; University of Bern; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Oberlack, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, Hallerstr 10, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.;Oberlack, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Hallerstr 12, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",christoph.oberlack@cde.unibe.ch; klaus.eisenack@hu-berlin.de,,"Oberlack, Christoph/0000-0003-2813-7327",,,,,105,25,27,5,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Moreover, policy options of cutting red tape and reducing federal bureaucracy are often asserted to be a way to stimulate investment and, through this channel, a way to promote economic growth. This paper examines the relationship between growth in regulatory restrictions in the Code of Federal Regulations and manufacturing investment in the United States over the 1970-2009 period. An industry-level dataset is constructed by mapping the novel industry-specific RegData dataset from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University to the comprehensive industry-specific manufacturing data in the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database. In total, the constructed dataset includes 337 manufacturing industries. This approach yields substantial evidence that increased business regulation is associated with decreased business investment.","[Pizzola, Brandon] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Pizzola, B (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",bpizzola@gmu.edu,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This is because child care has a positive income gradient, whereas leisure and housework do not. Using U.S. data from PSID-CDS, this paper computes parental child care during and outside of typical work hours (TWH) by income quintile for two-parent families. The TWH distinction is important because the opportunity cost of spending time with children is first and foremost in terms of forgone earnings during TWH; outside of TWH, leisure or housework mainly constitute this opportunity cost. Indeed, I find that child care decreases with income during TWH and, hence, behaves similarly to leisure and other household chores. While maternal child care also slightly decreases with income outside of TWH, paternal care increases with income outside of TWH. Also, the discrepancy between paternal and maternal child care is smaller outside of TWH than it is during TWH. This is particularly pronounced in high income families. Theoretical implications are derived in a static framework of time allocation and child quality production encompassing the recent literature on the topic. Variation in child care during TWH can be rationalized by assuming a high elasticity of substitution between leisure, consumption and child quality. This is the standard explanation for the patterns observed in leisure and housework. Within this widely used framework, however, the facts outside of TWH point to systematic differences by income in preferences or productivity. Further exploration of child care patterns during and outside of TWH is needed to inform us about the dimensions in which this widely used framework should be extended.","[Schoonbroodt, Alice] Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Pappajohn Business Bldg,W334, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Schoonbroodt, A (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Dept Econ, Pappajohn Business Bldg,W334, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",alice-schoonbroodt@uiowa.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,26,18,20,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Profitability rises with age for young firms, remains elevated, and then declines slowly for mature firms. A dynamic lifecycle model captures the observed age profile of profitability. Investment in product development generates profitability increases for young firms while wage pressures from more productive entrants lead to profitability declines for mature firms. The model generates the lifecycle behavior of financing and growth documented in the literature, even though it contains no financial frictions. It also implies greater sensitivity of financing and growth to age for young firms, a prediction supported by empirical tests. Taken together, these findings indicate that profitability dynamics influence the financing and growth of firms over the lifecycle.","[Warusawitharana, Missaka] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Supervis & Regulat, Mail Stop 1814,20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Warusawitharana, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Div Supervis & Regulat, Mail Stop 1814,20th & C St NW, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",missaka.n.warusawitharana@frb.gov,,,,,,,55,3,3,6,34,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

It shows that the diffusion of significant fundamental information generates a Z-type aggregate demand function that leads to the occurrence of such a phenomenon as an imbalance (or disequilibrium). Pricing analysis under imbalance reveals that, with the exception of the independence of consecutive returns, there is a nonlinearity in mean that can be empirically detected using a threshold model or a regime switching model. The proposed model facilitates the convergence of the equilibrium approach with the methodology of evolutionary economics and can also be useful in studies of financial fragility.

We add a frequency-domain perspective to conclude about the effects at different time periods, while the panel data analysis allows us to study different heterogeneities that may occur due to geography, GDP per capita, and human development classification. For all of the sample, there is bi-causality between electrical energy consumption and GDP in the long run, while for the short and medium run, causality is verified from GDP to electricity consumption. When segmented by continents, the results are mixed; however, when the division is done by HDI, there is bi-causality between electricity consumption and GDP for high HDI countries. In contrast, for countries with a low HDI, there is causality from electricity consumption to GDP. This poses a set of particularly important policy implications for countries with low human development. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We explore a part of this puzzle by examining the role of managerial manipulation in accounting for the properties of stock market participation. We show that when investors have heterogeneous beliefs about managerial manipulation, investors who are relatively pessimistic about reporting quality consider stock prices unjustified by the underlying firm value and rationally withdraw from the stock market, giving rise to limited market participation in equilibrium. Our model also suggests that tightened accounting standards have the effect of reducing the dispersion of investor beliefs regarding financial reporting and thus help encourage stock market participation. Consistent with this idea, we find that stronger accounting and governance policies are associated with higher market participation across countries.

International trade, by eliminating the duplication of coordination costs, leads to a greater variety of tasks, each produced at a larger scale than in autarky. The greater variety of tasks implies greater division of labor and hence gains from trade. Extending the model to two factors of production yields the additional result that if the two countries are sufficiently similar in their relative endowments, then both factors of production can experience gains from trade.","[Soo, Kwok Tong] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Soo, KT (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",k.soo@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Soo, Kwok Tong/0000-0002-2960-3097",,,,,36,0,0,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Further, the contagion effect and interdependency between oil price and sectoral equity are assessed through frequency domain causality. The causality from oil price in the long run determined that there is interdependence between three sectors and oil price changes. The direction of causality from oil price is mixed in both the short run (high frequency) and long run (low frequency) for nine sectors.

It can retreat to a reaffirmation of nationalisms or commit to a new form of multilateralism, guided by the primacy of social prosperity and the principle of subsidiarity. The G20 has traditionally focused on economic policy issues - economic growth and financial stability. This is appropriate as along as social progress is closely tied to economic progress, for then the achievement of material prosperity will promote human flourishing. But when economic and social progress becomes decoupled - as we commonly observe through growing income disparities, growing disempowerment and disintegrating social affiliations - then an exclusive preoccupation with economic policy issues is unlikely to quell the widespread public discontent. On this account, it is appropriate for the G20 objectives to be broadened to include resilient, inclusive and sustainable prosperity. This wider conception of human needs calls for a new worldview to underlie G20 policymaking, one that generates social acceptance for multilateral cooperation in tackling multilateral problems, while allowing different countries to nourish different national, cultural and religious identities.","[Snower, Dennis J.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Snower, DJ (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",dennis.snower@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,3,0,0,1,10,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 24,2018,12.0,,,,,,,,2018-21,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-22,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GF2TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431792200002,0

This paper analyzes the drivers causing productivity changes of especially vulnerable public schools during the crisis. We use the Hicks-Moorsteen index, which is a seldom applied methodology that leads to feasible results under variable returns to scale. To illustrate the benefits of this index, we use a sample of 298 Catalan public primary schools between 2009 (when budgetary constraints started) and 2014. The results reveal that during the crisis schools improved their total factor productivity by raising academic achievement despite cutbacks in resources. We also found that there was a strong convergence pattern during the financial crisis, driven by the catch-up process of some schools. The findings have important policy implications, suggesting that a monitoring system should be set up for use by policy makers.","[Aparicio, Juan] Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Ctr Operat Res, Av Univ S-N, Elche 03202, Spain; [Lopez-Torres, Laura] Univ Alcala, Dept Econ & Business, Plaza Victoria 2, Alcala De Henares 28802, Spain; [Santin, Daniel] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Polit & Publ Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Universidad de Alcala; Complutense University of Madrid,"Santín, D (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Appl Polit & Publ Econ, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",dsantin@ccee.ucm.es,"López-Torres, Laura/AAT-8389-2021; Aparicio, Juan/P-6348-2015; Santín, Daniel/I-7784-2016","López-Torres, Laura/0000-0002-7998-5759; Aparicio, Juan/0000-0002-0867-0004; Santín, Daniel/0000-0002-1654-1659",Fundacion Ramon Areces,Fundacion Ramon Areces,"The authors are greatly indebted to Fundacion Ramon Areces for supporting and encouraging mutual collaboration on productivity analysis in education under projects 'La medicion de la eficiencia de la educacion primaria y de sus determinantes en Espana y en la Union Europea: un analisis con TIMSS-PIRLS 2011' (D.

Members of the creative class possess creative capital and they fall into one of two possible groups they are either artists or engineers. We describe the optimal income redistribution rule that maximizes the creative class's average steady state income. Because this average income is increasing in the physical capital per creative class member ratio, the rule requires a regional authority to redistribute income away from (towards) the group that saves a lower (higher) fraction of its income. This is a negative finding in the sense that the rule's implementation will tend to favor the group that already saves more. Even so, the finding is consistent with the observation made by some researchers that there is a connection between income inequality and regions in which the creative class performs a large part of all economic activities.","[Batabyal, Amitrajeet A.] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Batabyal, AA (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, 92 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",aabgsh@rit.edu; Hamid.Beladi@utsa.edu,,"Batabyal, Amitrajeet/0000-0001-7813-1519",Gosnell endowment at RUT,Gosnell endowment at RUT,"We thank the Editor Sushanta Mallick and two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments on a previous version of this paper.

We study a set of endogenous relations linking growth and its fundamental causes, domestic conflict and conflict in the neighbourhood. Methodologically, we go beyond a reduced-form single equation model to estimate a system of four equations where neighbourhood conflict affects domestic civil conflict, institutions and economic integration. Civil conflict in the neighbourhood significantly increases the probability of domestic conflict, lowers the quality of domestic institutions, and reduces the degree of economic integration with the rest of the world. The dollar value of this damage cumulates over time depending on the frequency/duration of spatial conflict.

We show that it is a dominant strategy for firms to delegate no matter whether firms are Cournot or Bertrand competitors, although the equilibrium is not necessarily efficient. Futhermore, in equilibrium Cournot competition is more profitable for firms than Bertrand competition. Finally, requiring consistency in conjectures yields the same outcome no matter what type of strategic interaction and managerial choice there is on the part of firms.","[Ciarreta, Aitor; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,"García-Enríquez, J (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Econ Aplicada Econometria & Estadistica 3, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",javier.garcia@ehu.eus,"Ciarreta, Aitor/H-7633-2015; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/A-5945-2015","Ciarreta, Aitor/0000-0003-2627-4715; Garcia-Enriquez, Javier/0000-0002-2160-0369","Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness; ERDF [ECO2013-40935-P, ECO2015-64467-R, ECO2016-76884-P]; Basque Government [IT383-13]",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); ERDF(European Union (EU)); Basque Government(Basque Government),"Aitor Ciarreta and Javier Garcia-Enriquez gratefully acknowledge funding from the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness and from ERDF via research grants ECO2013-40935-P, ECO2015-64467-R and ECO2016-76884-P and from the Basque Government through Grupo Consolidado IT383-13.",,35,2,2,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Evolutionary economists offer novel approaches to the analysis of consumption behavior that emphasize the major role of learning in the evolution of consumer preferences and wants. As a possible inspiration for further progress in evolutionary thought, this paper examines the idea of consumer learning by studying the nature of what consumers should learn in the context of 'novelty'. Our empirical results regarding novelty during the learning process show that consumers learn the 'new characteristics' of consumer goods, contrary to the Lancasterian approach, which suggests that the characteristics space of goods is fixed. We show that during the process of consumption, 'consumer learning' extends the characteristics space of consumer goods; this phenomenon is far from negligible and differs across product types. Moreover, our results show that the emergence of new characteristics cannot be modeled as a Poisson process because these new characteristics exhibit clear interdependence over time.","[El Qaoumi, Kenza; Le Masson, Pascal; Weil, Benoit; Un, Aytunc] MINES ParisTech, CGS, Ctr Management Sci, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"El Qaoumi, K (通讯作者)，MINES ParisTech, CGS, Ctr Management Sci, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France.",elqaoumikenza@gmail.com,,"EL QAOUMI, KENZA/0000-0003-4961-7055",School of Mines ParisTech,School of Mines ParisTech,This work is a development of part of my doctoral thesis discussed at Ecole des Mines ParisTech in the Management of Science Center (CGS).

We use firm census data for 1986-2007 and uncover polarization in employment and wages in the second half of this period. This mostly appears to be due to technological change. Our results show a sharp increase of both employment and wage premium for abstract tasks relative to routine tasks. In contrast to the existing literature, we separate between routine manual tasks and routine cognitive tasks. We uncover a sharp decline in routine manual employment but the decline in routine cognitive employment is modest and coupled with an increased wage premium that does not appear to be due to worker selection. This latter result is mainly explained by the large expansion of the service sector which employs many workers in routine cognitive-intensive jobs and the likely slower computer capital adoption resulting from the relatively low levels of human capital, by international standards.

As in a Phelps-Lucas island model, final producers look at the prices of their local inputs to infer aggregate conditions. However, market linkages between islands make the informativeness of local prices endogenous to general equilibrium relations. In this context, I show that a vanishingly small heterogeneity in local conditions is enough to generate an equilibrium in which prices are rigid to aggregate shocks and transmit only partial information. I use this insight as a microfoundation for price rigidity in an otherwise frictionless monetary model and show that even a tiny amount of dispersion in fundamentals can lead to large non-neutrality of money.","[Gaballo, Gaetano] Banque France, Paris, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Gaballo, G (通讯作者)，Banque France, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,49,10,10,1,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Young agents' education is produced according to a variable elasticity of substitution production function where the inputs are public education and private expenditures undertaken by parents. Results reveal that higher substitutability between these inputs enables agents to reduce private education expenditures and spend more on consumption and investment, leading to better economic outcomes. Higher aggregate substitutability therefore also implies that a higher tax rate is optimal, since this reduces the need for private educational expenditures to supplement public education expenditures. Analytical results reveal that, depending on initial conditions, the economy could either achieve smooth convergence towards the long run outcome or experience fluctuations during transition. However, numerical analysis suggests that a smooth transition is more likely. Fluctuations during transition may occur when the share of parental human capital in determining an agent's human capital is high. Hence, institutional reforms that reduce the importance of inherited human capital by providing everyone better access to high quality education could facilitate smooth convergence to the long run outcome.","[Gamlath, Sharmila] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Lahiri, Radhika] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Lahiri, R (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",s.gamlath@qut.edu.au; r.lahiri@qut.edu.au,,"Gamlath, Sharmila/0000-0003-0692-5939; Lahiri, Radhika/0000-0002-5076-0556",,,,,44,15,17,2,49,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The exchange rate market and the real markets are linked through the balance of payments. We have analytically found that there exists at least a steady state in which the exchange rate is equal to its fundamental value and incomes of both countries are equal to the autonomous components times the multiplier (as in the Income-Expenditure model). This steady state can be unique and unstable when all agents act as contrarians, while when agents act as fundamentalists it is unique but its stability depends on the reactivity of actors of the market. Finally, we show that the (in)stability of the economic system depends on both the reactivity of the markets and that of different types of agents involved. Employing well-know functional forms, we show that the model can replicate some of the statistical features of the true time series of the exchange rate.","[Gori, Michele; Ricchiuti, Giorgio] Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Ricchiuti, Giorgio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore Milano, Complex Lab Econ, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy",University of Florence; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Ricchiuti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Firenze, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Impresa, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.;Ricchiuti, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore Milano, Complex Lab Econ, Via Necchi 5, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",michele.gori@unifi.it; giorgio.ricchiuti@unifi.it,"Ricchiuti, Giorgio/AHE-1031-2022","Ricchiuti, Giorgio/0000-0003-1309-3165",,,,,20,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This paper analyzes how Vietnam's economy is likely to be affected by these regional frameworks. We apply a static CGE model, incorporating the effects of capital accumulation, labor supply changes, and productivity growth stemming from trade liberalization. We also analyze middle income trap scenarios, in which Vietnam's growth factors fall below the full-potential level and draw policy implications. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This paper reduces that gap in that it quantifies the effect of ITO on total factor productivity using a sample of 10,100 firms in India. The results show that ITO purchasing brings strong returns and outperforms in-house IT. A comparison with studies from elsewhere reveals that Indian ITO also outperforms IT in a range of circumstances in developed countries. Taken together, these findings support the idea that ITO firms, just like other knowledge intensive business services, can act as a conduit for best practices and tacit knowledge, and that this role is very useful in a developing country context. The implication is that more ITO projects would be good for catching up in developing countries. In India, policy support for the ITO sector should be re-designed to incentivise domestic work.","[Kite, Grace] Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Kite, G (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Oriental & African Studies, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",grace@graciouseconomics.co.uk,,,,,,,71,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We incorporate the idea by explicitly modelling the choice between two technologies in a heterogeneous agent model with overlapping generations. Both technologies can be improved through learning-by-doing' and adaptation of the technology to local conditions. One of the technologies is an 'advanced technology' in that it has potentially greater returns to capital deepening, and also to learning-by-doing and adaptation. However, a critical level of development has to be reached before the technology becomes appropriate; for lower levels of development the less advanced technology is more productive. Depending on initial conditions, a variety of long run outcomes and transitional dynamics are possible, suggesting that appropriate technology provides a potential explanation for the diversity of growth and technology diffusion experiences observed in world economies.","[Lahiri, Radhika] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ding, Juhong] China Execut Leadership Acad Pudong, Pudong, Peoples R China; [Chinzara, Zivanemoyo] World Bank Grp, Lusaka, Africa Region, Zambia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Lahiri, R (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",r.lahiri@qut.edu.au,,"Lahiri, Radhika/0000-0002-5076-0556",,,,,29,3,3,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

We argue that this surprising positive relation between competition and fund fees is consistent with strategic fee setting by funds. Fund performance is better and more persistent in less competitive segments, which attracts relatively more performance-sensitive investors. This leaves relatively less performance-sensitive investors in more competitive markets. Hence, funds operating in more competitive markets face a relatively inelastic demand curve and take advantage of it by increasing their fees (which reduces investors' net returns). Our findings have important policy implications that market competition on its own may not be sufficient to decrease fund fees and regulatory interventions are required to increase investor awareness of mutual fund fees and their adverse impacts on net fund performance.","[Panida, Sitikantha; Tang, Zhenyang] Clark Univ, Grad Sch Management, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clark University,"Panida, S (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Grad Sch Management, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",sparida@clark.edu; ZTang@clarku.edu,"Tang, Zhenyang/AAD-2456-2019",,,,,,35,9,9,1,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0264-9993,1873-6122,,ECON MODEL,Econ.

The authors carried out a comprehensive review of the literature on the actual determinants of land value and made an attempt to classify different approaches to this matter. Then they performed an empirical case study of the drivers of agricultural land values in a leading agricultural region of Poland. The aim of the study is to establish how the use values of land, amenities and policy payments contribute to land values in the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS), which operates in Poland. The study is based on a sample of 653 transactions during the years 2010-2013. A hierarchical regression (ML-IGLS method) was used, where the unobserved heterogeneity is attributed to the location-specific factors at different levels of analysis. Results indicate that the policy payments for public goods decapitalise the value of land, whereas the environmental amenities have a relatively strong influence on farmland prices.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Educ & Personnel Dev, Poznan, Poland; [Czyzewski, Bazyli; Matuszczak, Anna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon & Agr Econ, Poznan, Poland; [Trojanek, Radoslaw] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Microecon, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Economics & Business; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Educ & Personnel Dev, Poznan, Poland.;Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon & Agr Econ, Poznan, Poland.",b.czyzewski@ue.poznan.pl; r.trojanek@ue.poznan.pl; anna.matuszczak@ue.poznan.pl,"Trojanek, Radoslaw/A-8421-2019; Czyżewski, Bazyli/Y-4679-2019","Trojanek, Radoslaw/0000-0002-8614-9484; Czyzewski, Bazyli/0000-0002-6324-2723; Matuszczak, Anna/0000-0002-5045-5447",National Science Centre [OPUS 6 UMO-2013/11/B/HS4/00572],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)","The article was the outcome of the project funded by the National Science Centre, no.

In this study, we robustly observe this behavior (called chaotic itinerancy) in a model of multi-regional business cycles, in which all regions of a national economy are homogeneous and connected through producers' behavior based on the average level announced by the government. Although a producer very slowly adjusts his/her output towards the average level, regional business cycles begin to synchronize because of the entrainment effect. Moreover, when a producer emphasizes the profit maximization more and when puts more weight on the average level in his/her decision-making, the economy is more likely to exhibit such intermittent transition. Further, it is clarified that behind intermittent transition exist cycles among periodic orbits with different number of unstable directions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We found that consumers have similar valuation of DSL connection speeds in the range between 1 and 8 Mbps. Moreover, in January 2014, the valuation of FttH connections with a speed of 100 Mbps was not much higher than of DSL connections with a speed of 1 to 8 Mbps, but it has increased quickly over time and became significantly higher at the end of the period in December 2014. The small initial difference in the valuation of DSL and FttH connections may be because consumers' basic Internet requirements such as browsing, emailing, reading news, shopping, and even watching videos online could be satisfied with a connection speed below 8 Mbps. We also found that consumers face significant switching costs when changing broadband tariff plans, which are substantially higher when switching from DSL to FttH technology. According to counterfactual simulations based on our model, switching costs between technologies are the main factor which slows down consumer transition from DSL to FttH. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We address this issue through a time-varying parameter VAR (TVP-VAR) with stochastic volatility. We identify four structural shocks by combining zero long-run restrictions and short-run sign restrictions based on a NK-DSGE model with frictional labor markets. Our main findings are as follows. First, at business cycle frequencies for most part of the sample the lion share of the volatility of job creation is explained by non technology shocks; this challenges the conventional practice of addressing the labor market volatility puzzle (Shimer, 2005) under the assumption that technology shocks are the main driver of fluctuations in hiring. Second, permanent supply shocks had a negative impact on job creation during the Great Inflation period-a result reminiscent of the hours puzzle (Gall, 1999). We show that the main candidate in explaining such structural change is the more passive conduct of monetary policy at that time. It follows that the results derived from partial equilibrium models of the labor market, which imply a rise in hiring as technology improves, neglect important transmission channels and may be misleading.

An incentivized interval forecast elicitation method is employed to answer this question. Each market consists of six traders, and the value of dividends is known. Two treatments are considered: six human traders (6H), and one human interacting with five computer traders whose behavior is known (1H5C). We find that while the deviation of the initial price forecasts from fundamental value is smaller in the 1H5C treatment than in the 6H treatment, albeit not statistically significantly, the average confidence regarding the forecasts is not. We further analyze the relationships between subjects' confidence in their forecasts and their trading behavior, as well as their trading performance, in the 6H treatment. While subjects' high confidence in their short-term forecasts shows a negative correlation with their trading performance, high confidence in their long-term forecasts shows a positive correlation with trading performance.

We use data from the Chinese Household Income Project Survey 2002, which exclusively contains information about the lineage structure in these villages allowing us to classify three levels of lineage-based heterogeneity. Our identification strategy relies on the exogeneity of lineage-based heterogeneity. We find evidence that people in a village with higher lineage-based heterogeneity are less likely to exhibit reciprocity behavior within lineages or contribute to the provision of public goods that are jointly shared across lineages. The estimation results remain robust to the inclusion of various control variables and additional background characteristics.

It is often believed that assuming an open or a closed economy does not matter. This view is incorrect, and the result depends critically on the nature of devaluations. When devaluations are contractionary, standard Taylor rules do not work. This result holds in a standard New Consensus model and in an amended version of it. We suggest that a successful inflation-targeting regime for an open economy cannot rely only on the manipulation of a short-term interest rate.","[Libman, Emiliano] Univ Buenos Aires, CIMaD, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Libman, Emiliano] Ctr Estudios Estado & Soc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Buenos Aires,"Libman, E (通讯作者)，Univ Buenos Aires, CIMaD, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Libman, E (通讯作者)，Ctr Estudios Estado & Soc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",emilianolibman@gmail.com,,,,,,,48,4,7,0,3,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In this article, I analyze the effects of violence on risk attitudes. For this purpose, I sampled a group of victims of violence in Colombia and collected data on the severity and temporal proximity of their exposure to violence and on their symptoms of psychological trauma. I find that more severe violence brings about higher levels of risk aversion in the gains and ambiguity domains but that the behavioral effect is not permanent. I also find that the effect is driven by severe anxiety disorders, which is consistent with studies in psychology. The results suggest that violence can affect poverty dynamics through a behavioral channel.","[Moya, Andres] Univ Los Andes, Econ Dept, Calle 19A 1-37E, Bogota 111711, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Moya, A (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Econ Dept, Calle 19A 1-37E, Bogota 111711, Colombia.",a.moya@uniandes.edu.co,,,"Pacific Rim Research Dissertation Grant; Centro Latinoamericano para el Desarrollo Rural (RIMISP); Henry A.

First, it examines the factors that determine access to formal savings products. Second, it looks at what the barriers to saving are. Using data from a nationally representative survey of 5100 individuals, the paper applies econometric estimation and qualitative data analysis methods to provide answers to these questions. Findings show a low level of saving in Myanmar, and that formal savings increase with income, education, and keeping a budget, among other factors. Policy recommendations include the design of financial literacy programs that are suitable to the Myanmar context, and providing access to financial services.","[Tambunlertchai, Kanittha] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,"Tambunlertchai, K (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",kanittha.t@chula.ac.th,,,,,,,41,9,10,1,26,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We assume that public investment is fully financed by fiscal deficit in our model analyzing the effects of public debt on the economy. Our results under the fiscal rule can be summarized as follows. First, the model shows two steady states exist: one is unstable with zero growth and the other is saddle-path stable with positive growth. The economy may not converge to the stable steady state if the public capital relative to public debt is not sufficient at the initial point. Second, the model shows that the growth maximizing tax rate exceeds the welfare-maximizing tax rate in considering transitional dynamics, but the short-term effect can differ from that of a model with a balanced budget rule.

In particular, debt stabilization in two diametrically opposed regimes is compared. In the first regime, the national fiscal discipline regime, financial markets impose sovereign risk premia based on each country's government debt level. In the second regime, the Eurobonds regime, financial markets impose a risk premium based on the average debt level in the monetary union. Outcomes in both regimes are compared using simulations of a number of relevant scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.
