Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that board reforms increase firm value. Reforms involving board and audit committee independence, but not reforms involving separation of chairman and chief executive officer positions, drive the valuation increases. In addition, while comply-or-explain reforms result in a greater increase in firm value than rule-based reforms, the effects of reforms are similar across civil law and common law countries. Further investigation shows that the subsequent change in board independence plays an important role in explaining the effectiveness of the reforms. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Explained as a failure of implementation and adequate resourcing, the deeper problem lies in using a segmented rather than holistic analytical framework that treats both assets and women as discrete, individual objects, rather than socially embedded and networked. Land gives meaning to people's lives, it is more than a source of material wealth; hence access to land is coveted, contested and negotiated in multiple ways by differently positioned people. Drawing on long-term primary research in India, as well as secondary research in China and Indonesia, in relation to women's access to land, I unpack some of the complexities and contradictions in terms of both legal and social interpretations of legitimacy as well as women's agency. Apart from having a large proportion of their population dependent on agriculture, the choice of countries is also useful in constructing typologies of governance systems and social relations at different institutional levels that shape women's access to land, a prime one being inheritance. I demonstrate the need for an alternate, relational framework that is both dynamic and transcends binaries, unpacking the multidimensionality of women's agency vis-a-vis assets, in diverse livelihood, environmental and governance contexts, if gender equality goals are to be met.","[Rao, Nitya] Univ East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Rao, N (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",,,,,,,,122,40,44,3,32,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0305-750X,,,WORLD DEV,World Dev.,JUL,2017,95.0,,,,,,43,54,,10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.02.018,0.0,,,12,Development Studies; Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies; Business & Economics,EU7MJ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401218600004,0

In 2010, the city reintroduced tram service with the opening of a new light rail line, after a gap of 45 years. This study documents the increase in public transit use in Bergen, both in terms of volume and market share, since the line was opened. Furthermore, it explores the effects of light rail transit on travel behaviour using Bergen as a case city. These goals are accomplished by combining and analysing data from different sources, including five travel surveys, and other data concerning building stock, population, business activity, commuting and traffic counts. The study identifies four potential driving forces for changes in travel behaviour: (1) the introduction of the light rail; (2) a new high-frequency bus network; (3) increased rates in the toll cordon system; and (4) changes in the urban structure. The study concluded that the introduction of light rail was the main driving force behind the growth in public transit use. The study also highlighted that transit use was highest in areas served by the light rail. The effects of the light rail investments are reinforced by an optimal location of the line with respect to potential users.","[Engebretsen, Oystein; Christiansen, Petter; Strand, Arvid] Inst Transport Econ, Oslo, Norway",Institute of Transport Economics,"Engebretsen, O (通讯作者)，Inst Transport Econ, Oslo, Norway.",oen@toi.no; pch@toi.no; ast@toi.no,,"Christiansen, Petter/0000-0002-5225-6572",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The study has been financed by the Research Council of Norway.

We found the exact opposite for a developing country after analyzing 8732 respondents in the Indonesian Family Life Survey. The job dissatisfaction of the self-employed was not fully explained by earnings, personal traits, job characteristics, anticipation, or adaptation, but mostly by segregation into a small number of industries with few job benefits. This finding is consistent with the dual labor market theory. We also found that among the self-employed, those with the highest probability of being paid employees were the least satisfied. Paid employment was highly sought after in developing countries, and these were presumably self-employed workers with high abilities. This finding cannot be explained by the dual labor market theory alone. To explain this inconsistency, we enriched this theory with relative deprivation. Our results suggest that the existence of the dual labor market and relative deprivation are important determinants of the job satisfaction of the self-employed in developing countries.","[Kwon, Illoong] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Publ Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Sohn, Kitae] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Sohn, Kitae] Konkuk Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Curtin University; Konkuk University,"Sohn, K (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",ilkwon@snu.ac.kr; kitae.sohn@curtin.edu.au,,,,,,,42,15,16,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In addition to the conventional marginal abatement cost curve, we present a pair of complementary marginal abatement cost curves which highlight the impact taxation has on economic performance and public debt and are therefore directly relevant to the terms of the policy debate. These marginal abatement cost curves provide an effective tool for understanding the rate at which the environmental effectiveness, economic costs, and budgetary effects change with the tax level. Our results indicate that taxes can be an important policy instrument for reducing emissions and promoting fiscal consolidation, although this will come at a cost in terms of economic performance. Simulation results suggest that a tax of 17.00 Euros per can satisfy existing climate policy targets. The tax revenue effects, together with reductions in public spending, yield a 4.8 % reduction in public debt. These desirable outcomes come at the cost of a 1.3 % reduction in GDP over the long term. Our analysis highlights that limiting public consumption expenditures can contribute to larger reductions in public debt, albeit at a marginally greater cost to economic activity. In turn, reducing public investment, although effective in reducing public debt, produces a much larger negative economic impact. This evokes an important trade-off, particularly pronounced in the present debates regarding austerity measures in the EU, between fiscal consolidation efforts and efforts to promote convergence to EU standards of living. These results further highlight that modeling assumptions with respect to public spending decision are not innocuous. An exogenous trajectory for public spending suggests substantially smaller GDP effects and substantially larger public debt effects for any given emissions target.","[Pereira, Rui M.; Pereira, Alfredo M.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Pereira, RM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",rmpereira@wm.edu; ampere@wm.edu,,,"Fundacao de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Ministerio de Ciencia e Tecnologia, Portugal [PTDC/ECO/72065/2006]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/ECO/72065/2006] Funding Source: FCT","Fundacao de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Ministerio de Ciencia e Tecnologia, Portugal; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This paper is part of a project financed by the Fundacao de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Ministerio de Ciencia e Tecnologia, Portugal, reference no: PTDC/ECO/72065/2006.

Particular emphasis is placed on testing for real option effects through analysis of the sensitivity of oil (gas) firm share price to oil (gas) price volatility. Using the level of active exploration drilling as a proxy for exercised real options, we find some evidence of a real option effect linked to drilling in gas firms, though there is little evidence of this for oil firms. There is evidence of a strong positive oil (gas) return effect on oil (gas) firm value.

The article focuses especially on gender differences. We find that the three factors most strongly influencing overall satisfaction with the STS for all users are the size of the area in which the service can be used, the comfort experienced during transport, and the number of trips on which STS can be used. Men's satisfaction with the STS is more strongly influenced by the size of the travel area than is the case for women. The degree to which women are satisfied with the STS is more strongly influenced by the comfort and number of trips than is the case for men. The method used in this article to measure users' overall satisfaction can be valuable for other researchers conducting comparable studies, and our findings may be applied by politicians aiming to design an STS which fulfils the needs of the elderly and disabled.","[Solvoll, Gisle; Hanssen, Thor-Erik Sandberg] Nord Univ, Sch Business, NO-8049 Bodo, Norway",Nord University,"Solvoll, G (通讯作者)，Nord Univ, Sch Business, NO-8049 Bodo, Norway.",gisle.solvoll@nord.no; thor-erik.s.hanssen@nord.no,,,,,,,49,9,9,0,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

We find that for the 1985-2010 period, 40 out of 49 U.S. industries can be predicted by at least one commodity. Our findings are consistent with Hong and Stein's (1999) underreaction hypothesis. Unlike prior literature, we pinpoint the length of underreaction by employing daily data. We provide a comprehensive examination of the return linkages among 25 commodities and 49 industries. This provides a more detailed investigation of underreaction and investor inattention hypotheses than most related literature. Finally, we implement data-mining robust methods to assess the statistical significance of industry returns reactions to commodity log price changes, with precious metals (such as gold) featuring most prominently. While our results indicate modest out-of-sample forecast ability, they confirm evidence that commodity data can predict equity returns more than four trading weeks ahead.","[Valcarcel, Victor J.] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Vivian, Andrew J.; Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ Technol, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; Loughborough University; University of Nebraska System,"Wohar, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska, Omaha, NE 68182 USA.",victor.valcarcel@utdallas.edu; mwohar@unomaha.edu,"; Valcarcel, Victor/H-5590-2017","Vivian, Andrew/0000-0002-6036-4477; Valcarcel, Victor/0000-0002-6642-3239",,,,,47,2,2,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

Specifically, political ecology's attendance to environmental subjectivities helps explain why some groups traditionally assumed to be in favor of mass transit resist the projects developed in part to benefit them. Based on qualitative research conducted in Oakland, California between 2011 and 2012, this paper ultimately argues that a political ecology lens helps highlight how environmental and transit subjectivities identities developed from everyday interactions with mobile and built environments shape dispositions towards, and the politics around, mass transit projects. This insight is important as it reveals how interactions with the built environment, and the subjectivities these interactions engender, can be overlooked in the context of transportation interventions, especially when these subjectivities are in tension with transit planners' working assumptions and worldviews.","[Behrsin, Ingrid] Univ Calif Davis, Geog Grad Grp, 133 Hunt Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Benner, Chris] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, 1156 High St, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Behrsin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Geog Grad Grp, 133 Hunt Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",iabehrsin@ucdavis.edu; cbenner@ucsc.edu,,,,,,,83,8,10,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Within the framework of an oligopolistic version of the Monti-Klein model, the pass-through of a bank tax levied on loans is stronger when elasticity of credit demand is low. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the incidence of the Hungarian bank tax that was introduced in 2010 on banks' assets. This case is well suited for our analysis because the tax rate is much higher for large banks than for small banks, which allows relying on difference-in-difference methodology. In line with model predictions, our estimations show that the tax is likely to be shifted to customers with the smallest demand elasticity, such as households. This result depends on the common trends assumption that is discussed at length.","[Capelle-Blancard, Gunther] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Labex ReFi Financial Regulat Lab, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Capelle-Blancard, Gunther] Paris Sch Business, Paris, France; [Havrylchyk, Olena] Univ Lille, CEPII, Lille Econ Management, Econ, Lille, France",Universite de Lille,"Capelle-Blancard, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Labex ReFi Financial Regulat Lab, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France.;Capelle-Blancard, G (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Business, Paris, France.",,"CAPELLE-BLANCARD, Gunther/AAQ-7953-2020","CAPELLE-BLANCARD, Gunther/0000-0001-5688-0113",,,,,37,21,21,3,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

These studies are primarily based on conditional mean-based models. Quantile models can be employed to capture the heavy-tails of stock returns, however, they are limited to causal relationships, and hence are silent about the sign and persistence of any uncertainty shocks - both of which are important information for investors. Our paper is the first to employ quantile impulse-response functions obtained from multivariate quantile models to analyze the impact of US policy and US equity market uncertainties on not only domestic stock returns, but also stock returns of mature and emerging markets. Using daily data over the period January 1998 to March 2016, we find that during episodes of financial distress, an uncertainty shock reduces stock market returns; both in mature and emerging markets, but in higher magnitudes for the latter, while it increases the highest quantiles of returns, only for the mature markets. Policy uncertainty is a less relevant factor, but it still impacts negatively the stock market dynamics during episodes of financial distress, especially for the emerging markets. These results contrast with the market reactions to uncertainty in the median scenarios, which tend to be insignificant in all the cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Access to financial advice, lower fees, and more international fund choices are associated with higher international allocations, suggesting a role for plan design and policy.

We find that the increase in the credit rate has a positive effect on the R&D spending of high tech firms with taxable status, but does not have the same positive effect on non high tech firms. These results indicate that tax incentives alone may not be effective to increase R&D spending if firms do not have profitable innovation opportunities. Further, we find that when the tax incentive is structured as a credit based on incremental R&D spending over a moving average base, firms opportunistically time their R&D spending patterns to obtain additional tax credits, resulting in greater variability in R&D spending and potentially the unintended loss of tax revenues. This study contributes to the ongoing global debate about the efficacy of tax policies toward R&D by providing firm level evidence from a large cross section of firms in an emerging economy.

Consistent with the model, risky assets are concentrated in financially unconstrained firms holding large financial portfolios, are held by poorly governed firms, and are discounted by 13% to 22% compared to safe assets.

It reviews the key literature which has developed around the concept of organized crime as business, and business as organized crime, and discusses the nature of rackets in historical and organizational context. The paper takes as its theoretical inspiration the Frankfurt School's notion of a racket society, which Writers such as Adorno, Horkheimer and Kirchheimer developed as part of their Critical Theory of society. As such, it builds on a small but developing field of literature which applies theories of the racket society to contemporary contexts. In this case, the paper provides contemporary examples of racket like behaviour at the corporate/political nexus, and highlights the social harms associated with this.","[Granter, Edward] Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School,"Granter, E (通讯作者)，Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Booth St, East Manchester M13 9SS, England.",Edward.granter@mbs.ac.uk,"Granter, Edward/ABC-1782-2020; Granter, Edward/ABC-1775-2020",,,,,,110,10,12,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

After more than a decade of progressive administrations, key government programmes have only accounted for marginal gains and in some cases setbacks, symbolized by the failure to expand the expropriation of new land and settle landless families on an adequate scale. The collapse of those alliances and 2016's impeachment process of President Rousseff marks the end of that cycle, highlighting strategic and policy failures. The paper examines government actions, the historical causes and roots of land conflicts, and struggles for land and territory, as well as the difficulties of mobilization. The paper focuses upon political disputes, particularly new processes of criminalization, economic disputes, surrounding the role of agribusiness, and the challenges related to struggles for land and territorial rights in a situation ruled by a progressive party and governments.","[Sauer, Sergio] Univ Brasilia UnB, Postgrad Programme Environm & Rural Dev MADER, Campus Planaltina,Area Univ 01, BR-73345010 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Meszaros, George] Univ Warwick, Sch Law, Lib Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Universidade de Brasilia; University of Warwick,"Sauer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia UnB, Campus Planaltina,Area Univ 01, BR-73345010 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",sauer@unb.br,"Sauer, Sérgio/AAO-5315-2020","Sauer, Sérgio/0000-0002-2014-3215",CNPq-Brazil,CNPq-Brazil(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),We would like to thank Leandro Vergara-Camus and Cristobal Kay as editors and the anonymous reviewers for their timely and invaluable comments and suggestions.

Changes in prices alter economic incentives by affecting revenues, profits, conservation, and nonmarket public benefits. Economic incentives in industries exploiting common resources have been examined from multiple angles. However, industry level variation in market prices arising from changes in public regulation has not been explored. We analyse the impact on economic incentives due to changes in output limits and market prices through estimation of ex-vessel price and scale flexibilities for imported skipjack and yellowfin in Thailand's cannery market. The unitary scale flexibility, estimated from the General Synthetic Inverse Demand Systems, indicates no loss in revenue and even potential profit increases resulting from lower harvest levels that could arise from lower catch limits. However, for a revenue neutral or positive outcome to be achieved, the three inter-governmental tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, which manage the majority of the yellowfin and skipjack tuna in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, would have to coordinate multilaterally to set the catch limits for both species.","[Sun, Chin-Hwa Jenny] Gulf Maine Res Inst, Portland, ME USA; [Chiang, Fu-Sung] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Appl Econ, 2 Pei Ning Rd, Keelung 20224, Taiwan; [Guillotreau, Patrice] Univ Nantes, LEMNA, Nantes, France; [Squires, Dale] NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA; [Webster, D.

Short-term equity claims, or dividend strips, have higher average returns and Sharpe ratios than the aggregate stock market. The returns on short-term dividend claims are risky as measured by volatility, but safe as measured by market beta. These facts are hard to reconcile with traditional macro-finance models and we provide an overview of new models that can reproduce some of these facts. We relate our evidence on dividend strips to facts about other asset classes such as nominal and corporate bonds, volatility, and housing. We discuss the broader economic implications of our findings by linking the term structure of returns to real economic decisions such as hiring and investment. We conclude with an outline of empirical and theoretical extensions that we consider interesting avenues for future research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This article focuses on different forms of ethnic discrimination in the rental housing market. Several hypotheses on statistical discrimination, spatial steering, and discrimination by price were tested by a field experiment in Germany that was unique regarding both the amount of information available on rental units and on ethnic composition of neighborhoods. For 637 rental objects, two e-mail inquiries were sent out with applicants having German or Turkish names and varying occupations. Logistic random intercept regressions revealed a discrimination rate against Turkish applicants of 9 percentage points. Indicating a high occupational status in the application reduced this discrimination rate significantly, but private landlords tended to disregard status and discriminate by migration background only. Surprisingly, the discrimination against Turkish applicants was the strongest when the proportion of Turkish residents living in the neighborhood was highest. German applicants were particularly favored over Turks when making applications for reasonably priced objects. These results point to both core mechanisms driving discrimination (preference and information) being relevant, but in different market segments.

Consistent with economic intuition, outside directors are more likely to fire (retain) CEOs when retention (replacement) costs are high relative to replacement (retention) costs. When the decision is ambiguous because neither cost dominates, outside directors are more likely to retain the CEO when they both benefit from selling stock in the misreporting period. We show that joint abnormal selling captures director-CEO alignment incrementally to biographical overlap. This new proxy operationalizes information sharing and trust, making it useful for studying economic decision making embedded in social relationships. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Little progress has however been made, as shown by Article 10 of the Paris Agreement. One reason is that these technologies could become vital assets to compete on global markets. This paper presents a partial equilibrium model with two regions, the North and the South, and imperfect competition in the international polluting goods market, to analyze the North's incentives to accept technology transfer. Results crucially depend on the existence of environmental cooperation. When both northern and southern governments set emission quotas non-cooperatively, inducing fewer global emissions is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the North to accept the transfer. In contrast, when governments set quotas cooperatively, the North has no incentive to share its technology either before or after the agreement. Technology transfer commitments may be included in the agreement, but with no effect on global emissions and global surplus. The only impacts are distributional, technology transfers and side payments may be substitute instruments.","[Glachant, Matthieu] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CERNA Ctr Ind Econ, UMR CNRS i3, Paris, France; [Ing, Julie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CER ETH, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Nicolai, Jean Philippe] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Chair Integrat Risk Management & Econ, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Ing, J (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, CER ETH, Zurichbergstr 18, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",ingj@ethz.ch; jnicolai@ethz.ch,,,Swiss Re Foundation; ETH Zurich Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss Re Foundation; ETH Zurich Foundation(ETH Zurich); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We would like to thank Jens Horbach and Scott Barett and two anonymous referees for useful advice and comments.

Herding appears significant throughout the 2002-2015 period for all markets, with smaller stocks found to enhance its magnitude. Herding entails no clear asymmetries conditional on market performance; conversely, it appears notably asymmetric when conditioned on market volatility, as it is significant (or stronger) mainly during low volatility days, without this pattern, however, surviving when accounting for the 2007-2009 crisis. The US and South African markets motivate herding on a small number of occasions only, while the return dynamics of a regional economic initiative's member-markets are found to induce herding in each other very rarely, thus demonstrating that investors' behaviour in markets with low integration in the international financial system is not significantly affected by non-domestic factors.

We quantify the importance of accounting for such time variation in out-of-sample comparisons of alternative approaches to forecasting recoveries or losses given default (LGD) on defaulted bonds. Using simulations of losses on defaultable bond portfolios, we show that conditional mixture models improve forecasts of expected credit losses through capturing time variation in the recovery/LGD distribution. However, the best forecasts of instrument or firm-level recovery/LGD do not necessarily provide the best forecasts of portfolio-level losses, as the latter depend on the association between errors in the default and recovery/LGD forecasts.

In this article, we propose a unified framework for pricing, hedging, and assessing the risk embedded in the guarantees offered by Variable Annuities in a Levy market. We address these questions from a risk management perspective. This method proves to be fast, accurate, and efficient. For hedging, we use a local risk minimization to provide a concise formula for the optimal hedging ratio. We also consider hedging strategies that use a portfolio of standard options. For assessing risk, we introduce an accumulated discounted loss function that takes mortality, transaction costs, and fees into account. We apply our resulting unified framework to the Minimum Guarantees for Maturity Benefit, Death Benefit, and Accumulation Benefit contracts. We illustrate the whole method with CGMY and Kou processes, which prove to offer a realistic modeling for financial prices. From this application, we draw important practical implications. In particular, we show that the assumption of geometric Brownian motion leads to undervalue the actual economic capital necessary to hedge and gives an illusion of safety.","[Kelani, Abdou; Quittard-Pinon, Francois] EMLYON Business Sch, CEFRA Ctr Financial Risk Anal, Ecully, France",emlyon business school,"Kélani, A (通讯作者)，EMLYON Business Sch, CEFRA Ctr Financial Risk Anal, Ecully, France.",abdou.kelani@gmail.com; quittardpinon@em-lyon.com,,,,,,,39,14,15,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Social trust measures the level of mutual trust among the members of a society. Using a large sample of Chinese listed firms for the 2001-2015 period, we find that firms headquartered in regions of high social trust tend to have smaller crash risks. This result is robust to a battery of sensitivity tests and is more prominent for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), for firms with weak monitoring, and for firms with higher risk-taking. Moreover, we observe that firms in regions of high social trust are associated with higher accounting conservatism and fewer financial restatements.

This analysis highlights the crucial implications of a foreign price process on the learnability of the domestic minimum-state-variable (MSV) REE price, and shows that, under fixed exchange rates, a Stationary foreign price process can generate an expectationally stable MSV REE price path in the home country. Precisely, this paper demonstrates that a price path is learnable in the expectational stability sense when the price process, which is MSV REE, responds in the same direction as the foreign price to any changes in the lagged foreign price. While, the MSV REE price is unlearnable when the domestic and foreign prices move in opposite directions in response to any changes in the lagged foreign price. The real time simulations illustrate that introducing adaptive learning into a fixed exchange rate model can lead a learnable price process to oscillate with a smaller and bounded amplitude. These findings tell us how learning depends on the interactions between domestic and foreign price processes, which gives policy makers a valuable insight into the choice of anchor currency.","[Lin, Yo-Long] Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Rd, Nantou 54561, Taiwan",National Chi Nan University,"Lin, YL (通讯作者)，Natl Chi Nan Univ, Dept Econ, 1 Univ Rd, Nantou 54561, Taiwan.",yolong@ncnu.edu.tw,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Prosumage will likely gain momentum as support payments expire for an increasing share of PV capacities after 2020. Third, we model possible system effects in a German 2035 scenario. Prosumage batteries allow for a notable substitution of other storage facilities only if fully available for market interactions. System-friendly operation would also help limiting cost increases. We conclude that policymakers should not unnecessarily restrict prosumage, but consider system and distributional aspects.","[Schill, Wolf-Peter; Zerrahn, Alexander; Kunz, Friedrich] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Dept Energy Transportat Environm, Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Schill, WP (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Dept Energy Transportat Environm, Berlin, Germany.",wschill@diw.de,"Schill, Wolf-Peter/P-8179-2019; Schill, Wolf-Peter/V-8221-2017","Schill, Wolf-Peter/0000-0002-6981-7487; Schill, Wolf-Peter/0000-0002-6981-7487",,,,,46,58,59,1,23,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

The attention-induced price pressure hypothesis of Barber and Odean (2008) suggests that increased attention leads to increased buying, which temporarily pushes prices and returns higher. This upward trend in prices and returns is followed by a reversal. We test the attention hypothesis on REITs from 2004 to 2012 using Search Volume Index (SVI) data in Google Trends. We find that REITs that generate high retail investor attention, as measured by SVI, earn higher returns compared to REITs that generate no retail investor attention. The results are driven by small stocks and stocks with high book to market ratio. We report that the SW effect is not due to impediments to trade and conjecture that SW increases retail investor recognition among REITs that are characterized by information incompleteness, leading to higher returns. Over time, this increase in returns is followed by a reversal.","[Yung, Kenneth] Old Dominion Univ, Strome Coll Business, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [Nafar, Nadia] Alfred Univ, One Saxon Dr, Alfred, NY 14802 USA",Old Dominion University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; Alfred University,"Yung, K (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Strome Coll Business, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",kyung@odu.edu; nafar@alfred.edu,,,,,,,53,24,26,2,59,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Our approach contributes to the study of commodities in several aspects. First, we test for the presence of a genuine long-memory process in the volatility of commodities. Second, we determine that the random level shifts are certainly the main source of variation in the commodity price volatility. Finally, we estimate the volatility and its components as latent variables, thereby making it possible to evaluate their level of correlation with macroeconomic variables in small open economies such as Latin-American countries where the dependence on commodity price volatility is high. We use six commodity series: agriculture, livestock, gold, oil, industrial metals and a general commodity index. All series cover the period from January 1983 until December 2013 in daily frequency. The results show that although the occurrence of a level shift is rare, (about once every 1.5 or 1.8 years), this component clearly contributes most to the variation in the volatility. Furthermore, isolating the level shift component from the overall volatility indicates a strong relationship of this component with a set of business cycle indicators of several Latin American countries.","[Alvaro, Dennis; Guillen, Angel; Rodriguez, Gabriel] Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1801, Lima 32, Peru; [Alvaro, Dennis] Cent Reserve Bank Peru, Jr Antonio Miro Quesada 441-445, Lima 1, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Rodríguez, G (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Peru, Dept Econ, Av Univ 1801, Lima 32, Peru.",gabriel.rodriguez@pucp.edu.pe,"Rodríguez, Gabriel/F-3230-2012","Rodríguez, Gabriel/0000-0003-1174-9642",,,,,43,1,1,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Prior researchers have appealed to notions of conditional cooperation coupled with self-interest to explain this phenomenon. We explore a complementary explanation for contributions falling over time. We show that there can be considerable heterogeneity in the distribution of initial beliefs among conditional cooperators, with subjects holding either optimistic or pessimistic beliefs regarding their peers' cooperativeness. Therefore, what is often perceived as purely self-regarding behavior may well be conditional free-riding by pessimistic reciprocators. These differences in prior beliefs, and subjects' contribution choices in response to those differing priors, can also generate a process of decay over and above self-serving biases or the interaction between reciprocators and free-riders.

Governments and universities are seeking to develop framework conditions that are conductive to spin-off creation. The most prevalent of such initiatives are legislative changes at national level and the establishment of technology transfer offices at university level. The effectiveness of such initiatives is debated, but empirical evidence is limited. In this paper, we analyze the full population of universities in Italy, Norway, and the UK; three countries adopting differing approaches to framework conditions, to test whether national- and university-level initiatives have an influence on the number of spin-offs created and the quality of these spin-offs. Building on institutional theory and using multilevel analysis, we find that changes in the institutional framework conditions at both national and university levels are conductive to the creation of more spin-offs, but that the increase in quantity is at the expense of the quality of these firms. Hence, the effect of such top-down changes in framework conditions on the economic impact from universities seems to be more symbolic than substantive.","[Fini, Riccardo] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Bologna, Italy; [Fu, Kun] Univ Loughborough, Glendonbrook Inst Enterprise Dev, London, England; [Mathisen, Marius Tuft] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Trondheim, Norway; [Rasmussen, Einar] Nord Univ Business Sch, Bodo, Norway; [Wright, Mike] Imperial Coll London, London, England; [Wright, Mike] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium",University of Bologna; Loughborough University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Nord University; Imperial College London; Ghent University,"Fini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Bologna, Italy.",riccardo.fini@unibo.it; k.fu@lboro.ac.uk; marius.mathisen@iot.ntnu.no; Einar.Rasmussen@nord.no; mike.wright@imperial.ac.uk,"Fini, Riccardo/F-2717-2011; fu, kun/P-3082-2016","Fini, Riccardo/0000-0002-8640-8976; Mathisen, Marius Tuft/0000-0001-9977-1777; Rasmussen, Einar/0000-0001-7130-3752; Fu, Kun/0000-0002-7608-5042",TASTE project (FP7-PEOPLE-CIG-MARIE CURIE ACTIONS) [303502]; Research Council of Norway; ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish,TASTE project (FP7-PEOPLE-CIG-MARIE CURIE ACTIONS); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors would like to thank the seminar participants at the OECD Conference on Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Enterprise Dynamics, OECD, Paris, December 8-9, 2014; the XXV Annual Scientific Meeting Associazione Italiana di Ingegneria Gestionale (RSA AiIG 2014), Bologna, October 16-17, 2014; and the 2015 Academy of Management Annual Meeting, Vancouver, August 2015, for valuable feedback on earlier versions of the manuscript.

Results are similar for private banks, suggesting accrual manipulation related to capital market incentives is unlikely to explain the results. Although economic fundamentals explain most of the variation in the provision, we find sentiment has an incremental and economically meaningful effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings indicate a 31% local average increase in quarterly capital flows into mutual funds mentioned in a prominent Wall Street Journal Category Kings ranking list, compared to those funds which just missed making the list. This flow increase is about seven times larger than extra flows due to the well-documented performance-flow relation. Other funds in the same fund complex receive substantial extra flows as well, especially in smaller complexes. There is no increase in flows when the Wall Street Journal publishes similar lists absent the prominence of the Category Kings labeling. We show mutual fund managers react to the incentive created by the media effect in a strategic way predicted by theory, and present evidence for the existence of propagation mechanisms including increased fund complex advertising subsequent to having a Category King and increased efficacy of subsequent fund media mentions.

Accordingly, a larger shadow economy should give governments an incentive to shift revenue sources from taxes to inflation, in line with the public finance motive of inflation. In this paper, we recall that point in a simple canonical model, then empirically test it in a sample of up to 153 developed and developing countries over the 1999-2007 period. In line with the model's prediction, we indeed observe a positive relation between inflation and the size of the shadow economy, and a negative relation between the tax burden and the size of the shadow economy. We find that both relations are conditional on central bank independence and on the exchange rate regime, implying that it is the strongest in institutional set-ups that constrain monetary policy the least. Both relations are present in the sub-sample of developed countries as well as the sub-sample of developing countries. Both relations survive several robustness checks, using various sets of control variables including the stock of debt, controlling for endogeneity, using alternative estimates of the shadow economy, and estimating the two relations as a system of equations.

Although female empowerment has been an explicit target of many microfinance programs, the literature remains conflicted regarding the magnitude and direction of impact. Using multiple estimation methods with data from Bangladesh, I find that women from villages with microfinance programs are substantially more likely than women from non-program villages to have taken group action by publicly protesting when they observed a woman being beaten, abandoned or divorced. Taking advantage of eligibility requirements for program participation, I further show that women from program villages who are eligible to participate are substantially more likely than non-eligible women from the same village to have taken group action, which suggests that these effects are in fact related to the microfinance programs themselves.","[Peters, Christina] Metropolitan State Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Campus Box 77,POB 173362, Denver, CO 80217 USA",Metropolitan State University of Denver,"Peters, C (通讯作者)，Metropolitan State Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Campus Box 77,POB 173362, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",cpeter80@msudenver.edu,"Peters, Christina/K-9327-2019","Peters, Christina/0000-0001-9854-8573",,,,,49,4,4,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This can be clearly observed by the rapid increase of employer awards as part of the external image of many companies. Whilst previous research has described the role of employer in general, this paper provides empirical data on the influence of employer awards on the decision-making process of prospective applicants within the food industry. This has been achieved by conducting a survey based on a choice experiment in which participants were confronted with different job advertisements. The results demonstrate that employer awards significantly influence applicants' decisions, but their importance is lower compared to other company-specific criteria. This finding, however, remains significant only when the participants are not familiar with the employer award in question. The authors argue in favour of a critical, yet economically sensible usage of employer awards.","[Abramovskij, Marina; Enneking, Ulrich] Hsch Osnabruck, Oldenburger Landstr 62, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany",,"Abramovskij, M (通讯作者)，Hsch Osnabruck, Oldenburger Landstr 62, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany.",mabramov@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,,,,,58,1,1,0,9,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of the impact of such events on the country's equity market behaviour, both in terms of returns and volatility. Design/methodology/approach - The data set is composed of daily stock index closing prices for the overall market and top eight most actively traded sectors. To assess the impact of the considered events on the market and sector returns, an event study approach is applied. On the other hand, a univariate VAR-EGARCH model is employed to explore whether, and to what extent, volatilities at the market and sector levels respond to such events. Findings - The results suggest that political uncertainty has a profound impact on the risk-return profiles of almost all market sectors, with different degrees of intensity. By and large, the price and volatility effects are most pronounced in banks, financial services excluding banks and chemicals sectors, whilst food and beverages as well as construction and materials sectors are found to be the least responsive to these events. The 2013 military coup turns out to be the most pervasive event impinging on the market and sector-specific indices. Practical implications - The results have a number of practical implications that could be of interest to many parties involved. More specifically, with political dysfunction overshadowing business and investment activities in Egypt, genuine democratic reforms, which entail proper regard for human rights and the rule of law, must have the highest priority of policymakers, in order to secure a positive investment climate and to foster investor confidence. Furthermore, in tandem with considering other relevant factors, multinational companies need to have a thorough assessment of Egypt's future political course and to develop more robust contingency plans to effectively combat potential threats generated by political vicissitudes. Originality/value - To the author's best knowledge, this study is the first attempt to empirically examine the price and volatility effects of the recent presidential events in Egypt, thereby contributing to the relevant literature in this area.","[Ahmed, Walid M.

On the other hand, there is insufficiency of available methodological and methodical tools for the study of new social phenomena, born by contemporary transformations of labor and entrepreneurship. The article is aimed at substantiation of the holistic (integrative) approach to studying labor and entrepreneurship problems and creation of a unified theory of labor and entrepreneurship, as relevant tools of changing labor study in the context of a new social reality. Socioeconomic analysis is the leading method in solving the problem that allows revealing the two-way communication of economic and social processes and introducing studies of labor and entrepreneurship into the wider social context. The article shows a number of steps, making it possible to overcome the peripheral status of the labor economics and introduce it into the methodological core of modern social researches through a significant expansion of the object field of researches, updating methodological tools and increasing interdisciplinary interaction with non-economic sciences. It is shown how the complication of a conceptual labor model based on the principle of duality and bilateral socioeconomic consideration of the research subject can reveal the heuristic potential of labor socioeconomics, while retaining analytical advantages of the cost analysis, developed by the labor economics. Article materials can be useful for researchers who are interested in the issues of methodology of labor economics, labor sociology, and for a wider range of scientists and experts engaged in the development of technologies and system solutions of labor and entrepreneurship problems.","[Anatolyevna, Nazarova Ulyana; Aleksandrovich, Alekseev Oleg; Sharifovna, Galimova Aigul; Eduartovna, Galina Albina] Bashkir State Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Business, Ufa, Russia",Ufa University of Science & Technology,"Anatolyevna, NU (通讯作者)，Bashkir State Univ, Inst Econ Finance & Business, Ufa, Russia.",nazarovaua@mail.ru; aleksoa@yandex.ru; aigul_galimova@mail.ru; galinaae@mail.ru,"Alekseev, Oleg Aleksandrovich/HNS-8068-2023",,,,,,26,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,191,196,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600033,0

And, while learning, knowledge creation, sharing and application depends on organizational infrastructure, those processes are also to large extent affected by socio-cultural factors - shared values, beliefs and attitudes - that shape individual and organizational behaviours, processes and practices. Cultural factors can be innovation enablers encouraging cooperation, teamwork and creativity, on the other hand excessively hierarchical or competitive cultures can work against innovation. Similarly, predominant organizational values and beliefs may promote or hinder capacity for creating, sharing, and applying knowledge. The aim of this research paper is to analyse the role of cultural factors, knowledge management processes and organizational learning towards innovation performance. Respectively, it looks for knowledge management aspects and patterns of cultural traits that make organizations innovative. A quantitative study of 112 small and medium-sized enterprises from various industries was conducted simultaneously in Latvia and Russia to assess organizational learning and knowledge management processes, socio-cultural factors, and innovation performance. Our research reconfirmed that knowledge management statistically significantly increased innovation, and knowledge management and learning processes were closely related. Organizational learning had a positive impact on product, process and organizational innovation, while no statistically significant impact on marketing innovation. The research also confirms that stronger and more developed organizational culture lead to a better innovation performance. Finally, the results suggest that Latvian companies had significantly better performance on organizational learning in comparison to the Russian companies surveyed.","[Apsalone, Madara; Baumane-Vitolina, Ilona; Sumilo, Erika] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia; [Dukeov, Igor] Stockholm Sch Econ, Riga, Latvia; [Berke-Berga, Anzelika] Riga Stradins Univ, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; Riga Stradins University,"Apsalone, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Dukeov, Igor/V-3366-2019; Berke-Berga, Anzelika/JBJ-1257-2023; Apsalone, Madara/AAG-8276-2019","Berke-Berga, Anzelika/0000-0002-8844-8197;",,,,,31,0,0,0,8,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,6,16,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400001,0

At the same time, increased heterogeneity may undermine social cohesion, create coordination, and communication barriers, and adversely affect economic development. In this article we investigate the extent to which cultural diversity affects economic growth and whether this relation depends on the level of development of a country. We use novel data on bilateral migration stocks, that is the number of people living and working outside the countries of their birth over the period 19602010, and compute indices of fractionalization and polarization. In so doing, we explore the effect of immigration on development through its effect on the composition of the destination country. We find that overall both indices have a distinct positive impact on real GDP per capita and that the effect of diversity seems to be more consistent in developing countries. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Universities are knowledge intensive organizations characterized by high densities of knowledge and intelligence, whose role in the knowledge economy becomes dominant in society. As a result of this challenge universities should adapt their governance and mission to the new requirements and to increase their competitiveness in the global market of higher education services. This is a conceptual paper, but it is based on a critical analysis of the literature in this domain, a high level of personal experience and expertise in academic management, and a significant research performed in the fields of knowledge management and intellectual capital in organizations. In the knowledge economy, knowledge becomes a strategic resource and universities should be aware of this new development and focus their visions and missions on increasing efficiency in knowledge creation, knowledge transfers toward students and community, and in developing strategic thinking models in the mind of students. That means that students should become active participants in the knowledge processing and develop their skills for strategic thinking and decision making. The paper presents also the problem of evaluating the intellectual capital of universities and shows the shortcomings of many models proposed so far for intellectual capital measuring and reporting. The main shortcomings come from the metaphorical approaches used for explaining the concept of knowledge and that of intellectual capital. The paper presents the organizational knowledge dynamics and the intellectual capital dynamics frameworks. Based on understanding these frameworks, the paper discusses three main strategies designed by universities to increase their competitiveness: introducing new knowledge management programs and degrees, increasing knowledge creation and transfer toward the business environment, and intergenerational learning. For each strategy the paper presents its purpose and specific way of implementation.","[Bratianu, Constantin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania; [Bratianu, Constantin] Acad Romanian Scientists, 5 Splaiul Independentei,Sect 5, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR),"Bratianu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.;Bratianu, C (通讯作者)，Acad Romanian Scientists, 5 Splaiul Independentei,Sect 5, Bucharest, Romania.",constantin.bratianu@gmail.com,"CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/L-3402-2018","CONSTANTIN, BRATIANU/0000-0002-1029-7384",,,,,38,0,0,2,8,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,427,437,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800033,0

Since they are flexible models with tractable analytic properties, financial modelling with TDs has become increasing popular in recent years. We first provide a formal classification of TD models into drift-driven, diffusion-driven, and distribution-driven according to their empirical emphases and specification strategies. Motivated by the stylized distributional features of VIX such as skewness and excess kurtosis, we then propose a pair of new distribution-driven TDs for modelling VIX dynamics and pricing VIX futures by directly incorporating such information into the specification of the transformation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation into the relative performance of the three classes of models against several empirically relevant criteria. Our focus is on the in-sample goodness-of-fit measure and the out-of-sample forecast accuracy for modelling VIX and pricing VIX futures, as well as the stock return predictability of the implied Variance Risk Premium. Our findings demonstrate that the newly proposed distribution-driven models have clear advantages over well-established alternatives in most of our exercises. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that fund families often create TDFs by bundling existing mutual funds and use TDFs to increase non-performance-related flows to constituent funds that are not competitive. Such incremental non-performance-related flows exceed 1% of total net assets on a monthly basis. We further investigate the potential monitoring effect of plan sponsors by examining the association between the characteristics of constituent funds and their likelihood of staying in the TDFs. We find that constituent funds with lower return performance or younger age exhibit a lower survival probability of continuing as part of a TDF. Therefore, the problem of potential agency cost at the selection point of the constituent funds may be mitigated to some extent after entering TDFs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The target function represents the maximal tax budgetary payments; the system of restrictions consists of linear and nonlinear functions, which corresponds to normative data. The maximal tax efficiency portfolio is generated by the principle of Pareto. The relevance of the proposed model follows from the current development of Russia and the situation on the international financial markets. In this regard, mechanisms and models are needed to assess the effectiveness of the funds invested by the state. The author proposes and analyzes a mathematical model of state support for investments. The target functional is the maximum tax budget allocations, the system of restrictions - linear and nonlinear functions, corresponding to regulatory data. It is proved that the formulated problem is a convex programming problem. According to the Pareto principle, an optimal set of basic criteria characterizing the financial stability of the investment project is determined. The portfolio is formed by the criterion of maximum tax efficiency. To solve the problems of assessing the effectiveness of investment projects today, there is a wide range of instrumental methods. Thus, using the mathematical model of state support for investments, the state obtains a mechanism to increase the efficiency of its activities, to support the modernization and technical re-equipment of enterprises in the most painless ways without losing its independence, and also to predict the consequences of its actions on the monetary policy being implemented.","[Chernyatieva, R.

This contribution argues that persistent national identities colour interest perceptions of national publics, especially among non-elite groups, who are less likely to engage in cross-border interactions. Within this, the news media select events that are likely to violate these perceptions. This paper undertakes content analysis of low-quality, high circulation press in three prominent Member States: Poland, Britain (England & Wales) and Spain. Its findings suggest that EU integration is reflected negatively in both states where concepts of 'the nation' and 'national governance' remain relatively uncontested. Resistance was less pronounced in Spain. The increased contestability of Spanish national identity among conflicting ethno-linguistic groups caused EU integration to be perceived as less threatening. Nationalist popular discourse against integration gained less traction in the more federalized state constructed from distinct sub-state groupings; what constitutes 'the nation' remained normally contested.","[Clement, Andrew Anzur] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Clement, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",andrew.clement@erasmusmundus-gem.eu,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",2392-8867,2393-2384,978-606-714-428-4,EURINT,,,2017,,,,,,,90,112,,,,,,23,Economics; Political Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BK0YX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393300005,0

To understand how this event affects performance, and the antecedents of hiring, we analyse Danish matched employer-employee data. Those who hire enjoy superior sales outcomes in subsequent years, while the dispersion in profits increases. Furthermore, those that hire enjoy faster sales growth in the previous year, suggesting that sales growth precedes the first hire. Finally, we show that founders with a stronger profile in terms of education and previous income are more likely to increase profits, while the characteristics of the employee are less important. The latter finding is important from a job creation perspective, in light of the suggested sorting of more marginalized employees into new and established firms.","[Coad, Alex] Univ Sussex, Falmer, England; [Coad, Alex] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Knowledge Growth Unit, Edificio Expo C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Nielsen, Kristian; Timmermans, Bram] Aalborg Univ, Aalborg, Denmark; [Timmermans, Bram] Agderforskning, Kristiansand, Norway; [Timmermans, Bram] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Strategy & Management, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",University of Sussex; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Aalborg University; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Coad, A (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Knowledge Growth Unit, Edificio Expo C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",A.Coad@sussex.ac.uk,"Coad, Alex/H-8938-2012; Nielsen, Kristian/K-8139-2017","Coad, Alex/0000-0002-5706-0528; Timmermans, Bram/0000-0003-1087-6017; Nielsen, Kristian/0000-0002-2790-4064","ESRC; TSB; BIS; NESTA as part of the IRC distributed projects initiative [ES/H008705/1, ES/J008427/1]; AHRC as part of the FUSE project; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/J008427/1] Funding Source: UKRI",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); TSB; BIS; NESTA as part of the IRC distributed projects initiative; AHRC as part of the FUSE project; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The views expressed are purely those of the authors and may not in any circumstances be regarded as stating an official position of the European Commission.

Since the beginning of the 2000s, a new type of contractual arrangement has been developing rapidly: the Plant & Share' contract. Through such a contract, a landowner provides the land to a farmer who develops a perennial tree crop plantation; when production starts, the plantation, the plantation and the land, or the product is shared. The aim of the paper is to discuss the conflictive features of the arrangement. I argue that this contract, in spite of its potential for tensions and conflicts, constitutes an alternative to the much more conflictive land sales that currently dominate extra-familial land transfers in the country.","[Colin, Jean-Philippe] Ctr IRD Montpellier, UMR GRED, Inst Rech Dev, BP 64501, F-34394 Montpellier 3, France",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Colin, JP (通讯作者)，Ctr IRD Montpellier, UMR GRED, Inst Rech Dev, BP 64501, F-34394 Montpellier 3, France.",jean-philippe.colin@ird.fr,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Latest population forecast, presented by the Czech Statistical Office in 2013, shows that without permanent international immigration the population of the Czech Republic would decrease. The paper presents the results of our own population forecast, which takes into account the recent fertility increase observed in 2013-2015, and the replacement migration concept, i.e. the estimate of the amount of annual net migration needed to stabilize the Czech Republic population size at its current size (10.6 million of inhabitants) until the end of this century. Three different scenarios of future fertility levels are assumed. We also compare our results with the population forecast without migration and with constant net migration. Additionally to the population forecast itself, we present future trends in the productive, post-productive and old-age population, and compute old-age dependency ratios.

In such a context, world trade flows and international competition increase. International trade evolves in favor of large emerging countries, they quickly penetrate the world market and specialize in high-sophisticated products. Furthermore, emerging countries have expanding their exports much faster than the leading developed countries. The reshaping of the world market depends on these emerging countries. These findings lead us to study the sources of countries' export performance. On the one hand, this literature review presents the traditional measures of countries' export performance focusing on export diversification. These measures suggest that diversification goes hand-in-hand with countries' growth and economic development. On the other hand, this literature review details the new measures of countries' export performance related to export sophistication, product space, and economic complexity. These measures converge towards specialized diversification, i.e. a diversification into related products which generates new activities that are rooted in a country's initial patterns of specialization. Therefore, the process of specialized diversification focuses on countries' structural transformation in order to become more complex economies.","[Gaglio, Cyrielle] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Gaglio, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, GREDEG, Nice, France.",cyrielle.gaglio@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,48,2,4,5,33,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The Great Famine coincided with the Chinese Communist Party's industrialization and agriculture modernization plan, the Great Leap Forward (GLF). To remove omitted variable and endogeneity problems, a unique relationship between the Communist army's takeover of mainland China (1946-50) and the degree to which subnational leadership was willing to enforce GLF policies to the detriment of rural citizens' well-being is exploited via instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Specifically, areas liberated later had a higher density of zealous administrators by the start of the GLF in 1958, and in turn experienced stricter enforcement of GLF policies which resulted in greater famine severity. As a result, this research finds a relatively pronounced impact of politically-triggered famine captured by the IV approach, which strengthens the growing outlook that famine is a consequence of inadequate food entitlement, as opposed to being simply food shortages.

It shows how apparently representative organisational forms can exploit the majority of their members, bolstering the power of political-economic elites who straddle the state-society divide, as well as how such organisations can undermine the foundations for democratic consolidation more broadly. Challenging conventional understandings of 'state capture', the paper argues that UTODA's organisational power instead evolved through processes conceptualised as 'double capture': first, the government infiltrated the informal transport sector, but subsequently the transport organisation came to wield disproportionate influence over the state itself, with detrimental effects on both urban services and popular representation. The long-term domination by this authoritarian organisation meant that even after its downfall in 2011 there was little organisational capacity to build on in the sector, facilitating the reassertion of top-down governmental control.","[Goodfellow, Tom] Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Goodfellow, T (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Urban Studies & Planning, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",t.goodfellow@sheffield.ac.uk,,,,,,,51,13,15,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Building on consolidated methodologies for the assessment of potential accessibility, we estimate accessibility indicators at the zone level, evaluate how potential accessibility varies among income groups, and present evidence related to transport mode, in order to analyze social and spatial inequalities produced by the distribution of accessibility to employment and education activities. The research incorporates a method to evaluate how accessibility varies among zones according to average income and mode of transport in order to produce evidence-based arguments that can inform transport policy in the city-region of Bogota, and other similar contexts in the Global South. Our results show strong distributional effects of the socio-spatial and economic structure of the city-region, its transport infrastructure and services, and the effect of current transport and land-use policies for citizens of different income groups. The tools and empirical evidence in this research seek to contribute to informed policy development in Latin America and other developing contexts, and feeding current debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social and spatial inequalities stemming from urban mobility.

For a more exact classification of public expenditures from the functional point of view, the classification of the functions of the government (COFOG) is used. According to this classification we can classify general government expenditures by ten categories that represent the functional areas of the government (state). Attention is paid to selected categories of general government expenditures by COFOG function, which contribute to the development and cultivation of the human potential. The paper aims to provide an evaluation of general government expenditures by selected function in EU countries, including their similarities and differences. More closely, the paper analyses and focuses on general government expenditures by selected function (social protection, health, education, culture and recreation) in EU countries, as an average of the period 2010-2015, using the methods of cluster analysis and box-plot. The results of the analysed general government expenditures by function showed similarities as well as differences between EU countries. The division of EU countries into three clusters showed that with respect to the amount of general government expenditures on health, education and culture and recreation as % of GDP, the most similar are the countries in the first cluster (mainly Denmark, Finland, Belgium, France, Austria, Luxembourg), compared to the countries in the second cluster (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Czech Republic). By contrast, the largest differences regarding the volume of general government expenditures on social protection and health as % of GDP were found in the countries in the first cluster (Scandinavian countries, France), compared to the countries in the third cluster (Cyprus, Latvia, Romania). The structure of total general government expenditures by function as % of GDP proved that expenditures on social protection and health account for the most marked share in most EU countries.","[Halaskova, Martina] Inst VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Halaskova, Renata] Univ Ostrava, Fac Educ, Dept Technol & Vocat Educ, Frani Sramka 3, Ostrava 70900, Czech Republic; [Halaskova, Martina] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava; Technical University of Ostrava,"Halásková, M (通讯作者)，Inst VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic.;Halásková, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Publ Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",martina.halaskova@vsb.cz; renata.halaskova@osu.cz,"Halásková, Martina/ABE-3871-2021","Halásková, Martina/0000-0002-6812-6158",Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296],Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,This paper was supported within Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness (Project No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296).,,28,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,246,255,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700026,0

We employ the stochastic frontier approach, use a large and detailed dataset, and cover time span 2001-2012. While effects of firm characteristics are small, the effects of ownership are economically substantial. We show that majority owners are most contributive with respect to firm's efficiency when compared to other categories we analyze. Minority owners with legally grounded power are able to impose significant efficiency improvement. The effect of the foreign ownership is strongest when foreign owners control firms with less than majority of voting power. Minority owners sharing the control do not seem to contribute to efficiency. The impact of crisis is not balanced but can be regarded as marginally positive in general. The firms' characteristics change only a little. In contrast, worsening impact of the crisis is evidenced for controlling ownership categories.

The purpose of this study is to fill the gap by developing and empirically testing a model of value co-creation stages. According to the service-dominant (SD) logic, this study considers value co-creation containing two stages, and examines the relationships among innovation orientation, value co-creation stages, and relational performance. Data were collected from manufacturing companies in Taiwan. A partial least square (PLS) was used to address sophisticated data analysis issues. The empirical evidence indicated that firms with more innovation orientation can facilitate involving stakeholders to reciprocity; In addition, firms have better relational performance at reciprocity stage than initial engagement stage.

Attracting foreign direct investment plays a significant role in the growth of developing economies. Assessment of influence that the foreign capital exerts on the receiving party was studied in-depth by a wide range of Russian and foreign scholars, however, the issue is still a debating point among the modern economists. Due to this, the purpose of this paper is to reveal and evaluate the factors that influence attraction of foreign direct investment to developing economies. The paper uses comparative analysis and generalization of available information as its main methods; besides that, it undertakes a content analysis of reports and analytical pieces from leading Russian and foreign works published during several recent decades pertaining to the issue of determination of factors influencing the size of direct foreign investment. An econometric model was conceived from the statistical data covering 19 developing economies that allows estimation of influence from different factors onto the net inflows of direct foreign investments. Dwelling on existing economic theories that describe the economic nature of direct foreign investments, two groups of influence factors were discovered, namely: a group of macroeconomic factors and a group of factors linked to general societal development (11 factors in total). In conclusion, the authors reflect upon the degree and the direction of influence that the macroeconomic and societal development factors have on the net amount of direct foreign investment.","[Kozhevnikov, Konstantin Igorevich; Pridvizhkin, Stanislav Victorovich; Kozhevnikova, Margarita Karpovna] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Price Format Construct & Ind, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Bazhenov, Oleg Victorovich] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Accounting Anal & Audit, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Zasukhina, Yelizaveta Aleksandrovna] AO PF SKB KONTUR, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University; Ural Federal University,"Bazhenov, OV (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Dept Accounting Anal & Audit, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",o.v.bazhenov@urfu.ru,"Bazhenov, Oleg V/C-3924-2015",,,,,,17,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,52,57,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600009,0

To deal with the issue of different macroeconomic indicators calculated in socialist economy and after its transition to a market economy, EKC modeling was done with consolidated data on national economic performance. The results suggest, contrary to a widespread opinion, that changes in trends (turning points) for some pollutants on EKC can be found already in the 1980s. It also can be concluded, based on results received for the period after the year 2000 that validity of EKC might be in question for some pollutants. Following research on EKC for other pollutants and countries, as well as an application of other methodological approaches, could contribute both to better understanding of EKC model, including economic and social (pre) conditions of its validity, and its theoretical context.","[Kreuz, Jaroslav; Lisa, Ales; Sauer, Petr] Vysok Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Mezinarodnich, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Kreuz, J (通讯作者)，Vysok Skola Ekon Praze, Fak Mezinarodnich, Prague, Czech Republic.",jaroslav.kreuz@gmail.com; ales.lisa@vse.cz; petr.sauer@vse.cz,"Sauer, Petr/J-5952-2015",,,,,,47,1,1,0,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Also, interaction in the chain contributes to the strength of the chain. This raises questions such as do chain parties cooperate and is there a certain consensus concerning the future strategic route? This article provides a unique analysis of how stakeholders envisage the future of dairy farming in a period of radical policy change and what barriers they foresee to their objectives. The questionnaire used examined perceptions on development strategies, availability of resources, opportunities & threats (O& T), farmer skills and future expectations. In 2015 and early 2016, a total of 161 completed questionnaires were collected from stakeholders (leading persons in the dairy chain) in the Netherlands, Slovenia, Lithuania and Poland. Data were analysed by PCA, ANOVA, cluster and stepwise regression methods. Eight strategic clusters of stakeholders were found. Farm expansion and specialisation was the most expected development strategy (57% of stakeholders). Almost one fourth of the stakeholders took a wait and see approach, of which 15% looked for opportunities to activate at a particular moment in time, while 8% were generally pessimistic about the future. Diversification in combination with organic farming was chosen by 5% of the stakeholders, 10% of stakeholders focused on cooperation, service and high tech, and another 5% placed their trust in skills, subsidies and labour. The opinions of stakeholders were highly affected by the country of origin, while only minor variations in opinions were observed between different categories of stakeholders. Polish stakeholders showed the most specialised view on the dairy chain, but they scored relatively low on cooperation. Development towards diversification and organic agriculture received higher scores in Slovenia and Lithuania compared to the Netherlands and especially to Poland. Netherlands' stakeholders were the most positive about the future e.g. they foresee expansion and market opportunities. It was shown that strategies, resources and O& T each directly affect future expectations, which was in agreement with the hypothetical model used.","[Kuipers, Abele y] Wageningen UR, Expertise Ctr Farm Management & Knowledge Transfe, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Malak-Rawlikowska, Agata] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Stalgiene, Aldona] Lithuanian Inst Agrarian Econ, Vilnius, Lithuania; [Klopcic, Marija] Univ Ljubljana, Domzale, Slovenia",Wageningen University & Research; Warsaw University of Life Sciences; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics; University of Ljubljana,"Kuipers, A (通讯作者)，Expertise Ctr Farm Management & Knowledge Transfe, POB 35, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",abele.kuipers@wur.nl,"MALAK-RAWLIKOWSKA, AGATA/G-7117-2019","MALAK-RAWLIKOWSKA, AGATA/0000-0002-1484-0989; Stalgiene, Aldona/0000-0002-9791-7864",EU-ERASMUS+ program as part of the Interactive Strategic Management (ISM+) project [2015-1-PL01-KA2-016871],EU-ERASMUS+ program as part of the Interactive Strategic Management (ISM+) project,"The stakeholders participating in this study are acknowledged, as well as the EU-ERASMUS+ program for financing this study as part of the Interactive Strategic Management (ISM+) project no. 2015-1-PL01-KA2-016871.",,26,7,7,0,10,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Around one thousand (1.000) Citizen Service Centers (CSCs) - the KEP - have been developed to provide electronic services in an attempt to support transactions with the public administration. Within this context, electronic certificates (e-certificates), as advanced administrative products of public services, have followed the expansion of the Information and Communication Technologies' (ICTs) applications to the greatest part of the public sector spectrum. The aim of this study is twofold: to reveal the e-certificates' most substantial resources that suit the Intellectual Capital (IC) taxonomy criteria in the sense that they constitute part of the human, structural and relational capital categories and to discuss the significance of intellectual capital resources in the widespread use of the electronically delivered certificates. The methodology adopted is grounded on structured interviews which were administered to eleven (11) KEP directors from five out of the thirteen regions of Greece. The directors participating in this research provided their expertise by rating through a five point scale the importance of each IC resource noted on a preset specially designed interview form. The results based on the abovementioned empirical research are summarized as follows: (a) coordinating, communicative as well as technical skills deemed to be most important with regard to the human capital intangibles; (b) in relation to the structural IC assets category the usability of the software environment prevailed; whereas (c) in the relational capital category social networking was indicated by the directors as the most important. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research that may lead to a better incorporation of intellectual capital perspectives within the context of public sector's administrative products' development.","[Laskari, Tatiana] Ionian Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Informat, Corfu, Greece; [Kostagiolas, Petros] Ionian Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Informat, Dept Arch Lib Sci & Museum Studies, Corfu, Greece; [Kefis, Vasileios] Pante Univ Social & Polit Sci, Fac Econ & Publ Adm, Dept Publ Adm, Athens, Greece",Ionian University; Ionian University; Panteion University,"Laskari, T (通讯作者)，Ionian Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Informat, Corfu, Greece.",lasktat@yahoo.gr; pkostagiolas@ionio.gr; bkefis@panteion.gr,"Kostagiolas, Petros/U-1556-2018","Kostagiolas, Petros/0000-0001-8974-1128",,,,,46,1,1,0,8,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,163,170,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000021,0

Some of the gaps are associated with education differences, but education alone cannot account for the substantially higher net worth of White families than of Black and Hispanic families. As of 2013, the median wealth of Black college graduate families had fallen to only 13 percent of the median wealth of White families. One possible explanation is the significantly lower shares of married couple and married parent households among minorities. For example, even among college graduates, only 41 percent of Black family heads were married, compared with 68 percent of White family heads. Did these trends in family status contribute significantly to differences between Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the declines in wealth among college graduates? The author finds that family status changes between 2007 and 2013 were too small to play a large role and even married couple families among Blacks and Hispanics suffered sharp declines in home equity and net worth. Still, married couples retained at least a 70 percent advantage over the unmarried groups.","[Lerman, Robert I.] Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Lerman, Robert I.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Lerman, Robert I.] Amer Univ, Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA",Urban Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics; American University,"Lerman, RI (通讯作者)，Urban Inst, Washington, DC 20037 USA.;Lerman, RI (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.;Lerman, RI (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",,"Lerman, Robert/AAK-6855-2021",,Center for Household Financial Stability; Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,Center for Household Financial Stability; Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,"This article was prepared for presentation at the symposium, Does College Level the Playing Field?

On the one hand, High-tech SMEs, characteristic of Start-up light-assets, have greater business risk, compared with the traditional manufacturing companies; On the other hand, the majority of High-tech SMEs' internal control mechanism is imperfect. It's not worth for bank to for their accurate financial information. Balancing the benefits and risks, the bank is less likely to loans to High-tech SMEs. Ningbo has witnessed the pilot of Small loan guarantee insurance in 2009, however, it has not been a comprehensive promotion. At the root of this, the method of pricing loan guarantee insurance is too single, merely based on experience and lack of scientific and rational theory support. We convert the topic about guarantee insurance pricing to the issue of credit default rates. First of all, based on the summary of historical research, deeply talking with the leader of loan guarantee insurance, considering of High-tech SMEs' characteristic, such as high innovation, high risk, high proportion of intangible assets, we build a suitable credit rating system for High-tech SMEs. What's more, based on the grade according to the credit rating system, using credit measurement model, we price the rate which follows different risk of High-tech SMEs. It shows the risk heterogeneity of High-tech SMEs. Finally, from the aspect of historical data, credit system and the pricing model, we make some suggestions to improving High-tech SMEs Loan guarantee insurance pricing.","[Liang Jiahao; Ye Xiaoling] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Finance Sch, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Liang, JH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Finance Sch, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",619254203@qq.com; hzyxl@126.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,6,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,286,300,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700020,0

Higher bride price payments reduce the fertility pressure for women with results being robust to confounding socio-economic and contextual factors. The fertility-reducing impact is greater for women who are economically dependent on their husbands. In polygamous households and for arranged marriages, a lower bride price increases fertility pressure while in monogamous households and for non-arranged marriages, the bride price does not affect fertility. As bride price payments have less power over (economically) independent women, empowerment will give leeway to girls in traditional societies.","[Mbaye, Linguere Mously] African Dev Bank, Immeuble Ctr Commerce Int Abidjan CCIA, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Wagner, Natascha] Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands",African Development Bank Group (AfDB); Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Wagner, N (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Int Inst Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands.",wagner@iss.nl,"Wagner, Natascha/D-1285-2018","Wagner, Natascha/0000-0003-0830-6429; Mbaye, Linguere Mously/0000-0002-1282-8054",,,,,44,14,18,5,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Agricultural trade represents nearly 10% of total merchandise exports and over 10% of total merchandise imports. The character and structure of Uzbek agrarian trade are fast changing. Only in period 1992 - 2015, the value of agrarian trade turnover increased from 140 mill. USD up to 1.7 billion USD. Changes affected not only the structure but also the value, volume, unit prices and competitiveness. The main goal of this paper is to identify the changes in the area of Uzbekistan's agrarian foreign trade structure and competitiveness. Competitiveness is analysed not only in relation to global markets, but it is also analysed in relation to different groups of countries and significant agrarian trade partners. Both agrarian trade competitiveness and territorial and commodity structure changes are analysed from the perspective of the last 15 years (2000-2015). Agrarian trade development (territorial structure) is analysed from two different perspectives: intra-trade (CIS market) and extra-trade (other countries). Competitiveness analyses is done through the application of following methods: Lafay index, Trade balance index and also the product mapping approach is applied. Uzbek agrarian trade territorial structure has become more concentrated, the commodity structure became more diversified. Uzbek trade is quite competitive especially in relation to the Asian countries and CIS countries, the competitiveness in relation to other territories is limited. The significant weakness in Uzbek agrarian trade is its ability to generate added value. The unit values of Uzbek imports are much higher in comparison to exports unit values. The main pillar of Uzbek competitiveness is low price of inputs and cheap volume of unprocessed products.","[Ortikov, Akhmadjon] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Ortikov, A (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",ortikov@pef.czu.cz,,,"IGA, FEM, CULS Prague [20161014]","IGA, FEM, CULS Prague","The paper is processed with financial support of IGA, FEM, CULS Prague.

Russian-Estonians have had discussions if and how these regulations impact maritime stakeholders and the economy in the Baltic Sea Region (BSR). Estonia oil shale industry is located in the Eastern part of the country (Ida-Viru County) and represents up to 5% of the national economy. Ida-Viru County is an economic weakly developed region and shares a common border with Russia with majority Russian speaking Estonians. Approximately half of regional workforce is employed directly or indirectly in this industry giving the oil shale industry an important role in the county's economic wellbeing. A large part of shale oil is used for the production of maritime bunker oil. Unfortunately, the sulphur content of shale oil is higher than it is allowed by the SECA regulations. In addition, the low oil price is putting extra pressure on oil sector which endangers the traditional business model of the Estonian oil shale industry. This paper investigates the impact of the environmental SECA regulations on the Estonian oil shale industry and discusses its consequences on the regional development as well as the economic and social cohesion in Ida-Viru County. Methodically, the research is based on expert interviews, a case study, and a further exploration of potential options to overcome possible economic distortions and to strengthen the social coherence in Eastern Estonia in the frame of the Estonian smart specialisation strategy.","[Prause, Gunnar; Olaniyi, Eunice Omolola] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Prause, G (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",,"Prause, Gunnar/AAG-7141-2019; Olaniyi, Eunice/AAU-3706-2020; Prause, Gunnar K./O-5741-2018","Olaniyi, Eunice/0000-0002-2181-9328; Prause, Gunnar K./0000-0002-3293-1331",,,,,46,2,2,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,461,472,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400046,0

It starts from the premise that state and private elites in China are working together to consolidate a robust domestic agribusiness sector, as both an arena for national-level rural and economic development, and a new frontier for access to resources and markets abroad. Through analyses of policy documents, market share data and ethnographic materials, I explore the organization and operation of dragon heads in the pork sector. My findings reveal that agribusiness development in China's pork sector is largely domestic, has a mixed state-private form and tends to marginalize the foreign-based TNCs that have been the most powerful actors in the global agri-food system to date. I argue that China is not only a destination for external' transnational capital, but also a site of agribusiness development in its own right. This has important implications for analysing capitalist transformations and for engaging global agri-food politics.","[Schneider, Mindi] Int Inst Social Studies, Korteriaerkade 12,Room 435, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Schneider, M (通讯作者)，Int Inst Social Studies, Korteriaerkade 12,Room 435, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",schneider@iss.nl,"Chekalin, Vyacheslav/S-6391-2017",,Fulbright-Hays program; Lehman Fund for Scholarly Exchange with China; Department of Development Sociology at Cornell University,Fulbright-Hays program; Lehman Fund for Scholarly Exchange with China; Department of Development Sociology at Cornell University,"Special thanks to Philip McMichael, Alice Pell, Burak Gurel, and three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions of this article.

The estimation of the tax administration efficiency is based on the definition of an economic and mathematical model that characterizes the dependence of the tax revenue level on the key indicators of tax administration. The statistical data provided by the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation were used in the study. It has been concluded that there are three indicators that have a significant impact on the tax collection in the budget system of the Russian Federation: the amount of arrears paid; taxpayers' coverage with field tax inspections; the amount of the reduced tax payments as a result of tax inspections. The built economic and mathematical model, which confirms a relatively high correlation between the behavior of tax returns in the budget system of the Russian Federation and the selected indicators of tax administration, determines the need for its qualitative improvement in the conditions of the emerging national tax system. The article also covers recommendations for the establishment of efficient tax administration in the Russian Federation, such as: reduction in the administrative costs for enforcement of the tax legislation by state authorities and taxpayers; elimination of the existing opportunities for tax evasion; improvement of the conditions for taxpayers' performance of their tax liabilities.","[Semenova, Nadezhda Nickolaevna; Filippova, Natalya Alekseevna; Efremova, Tatyana Aleksandrovna] Natl Res Mordovia State Univ, Saransk, Russia",Mordovian State University,"Semenova, NN (通讯作者)，Natl Res Mordovia State Univ, Saransk, Russia.",nnsemenova@mail.ru; Efrta@mail.ru,"Ефремова, Татьяна/AAC-4443-2021; Semenova, Nadezhda N/A-7885-2019","Ефремова, Татьяна/0000-0003-2435-9694; Semenova, Nadezhda N/0000-0002-2270-256X",,,,,33,2,2,1,6,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-408-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,38.0,,,,,,612,618,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9HY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416099600100,0

Review of the 'wisdom of the crowds' research reveals two key assumptions: voter competence and voter independence. Although direct testing of the actual fulfillment of these assumptions in a real-world setting is not possible, both empirical literature on voting behavior and rational choice theory provide ample ground for skepticism in this regard. Low level of knowledge together with unmitigated influence of systematic biases is expected to dominate the actual voting behavior. Affect heuristic is used as an example to illustrate this point.

This study aims to (1) identify the types of production based SMEs within this industry which are potential to drive the economy of the District in Malang Regency, and (2) investigate the factors which may affect the production of these SMEs. Data were obtained from the Industry and Commerce Department of Malang Regency. Location Quotient (LQ) analysis tool was employed to identify the type of food production based SMEs that are potential to become the driving force for the regional economy. In addition, multiple linear regression was used to determine the effect of the amount of labor, equipment investment, and raw material costs on the production of processed food types. The results of the identification find that there are three types of food production based SMEs (that are generated by most of 33 districts in Malang Regency), namely (1) bread and pastries, (2) chips, and (3) crackers. The result of LQ analysis shows that bread and pastry SMEs become the economic driver in Dau, Gedangan, Singosari, Sumberpucung, Wagir, and Wajak subdistricts. Chips SMEs become the economic driver in Ampelgading, Pagelaran, Pakis, Tirtoyudo, Turen and Wajak subdistricts. Meanwhile, Crackers SMEs become the economic driver in Bululawang, Donomulyo, Sumbermanjing Wetan, Turen, and Wajak subdistricts. From the perspective of equity aspect in economic development, the findings of this research is deemed to be interesting, because it shows that most sub-districts whose food production based SMEs become the economic driver are located in South Malang (except Singosari, Dau, and Pakis subdistricts) in which economic condition of the people is lower than that of the rest of Malang Regency.","[Taneo, Stefanus Yufra M.; Setiyati, Etsa Astridya; Meany; Hadiati, Sri] Univ Ma Chung, Malang, Indonesia",Universitas Ma Chung,"Taneo, SYM (通讯作者)，Univ Ma Chung, Malang, Indonesia.",stefanus.yufra@machung.ac.id,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-410-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,40.0,,,,,,123,134,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9IB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416100900010,0

The results of the study have shown that it is possible to make valid predictions regarding an employee's future performance based on that person's energy profile, at least in certain areas. It was found that measured levels of employee's energy and stress, assessed with the Electrophotonic Imaging Device, are valid predictors of the turnover and the number of transports generated by the respective employee. In this way, the connection between an employee's energy profile and their professional performance becomes clear. This can then be used to make objective and quantitative assessments about the future professional performance, not just of the assessed employee, but of other employees as well, because the proposed approach is based on universal principles and not on subjective evaluations. This research offers valuable information for both academia and practice, indicating a new way of predicting working performance that can be immediately used by companies to enhance staff performance and human resource management.","[Torp, Andronicus; Purcarea, Anca Alexandra] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania; [Andrei, Andreia Gabriela] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, 11 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700506, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Torp, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania.",andronicus.torp@icloud.com; andrei.andreia@gmail.com; apurcarea@gmail.com,"Andrei, Andreia/I-9722-2017","Andrei, Andreia/0000-0002-1093-6713",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,219,229,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800017,0

Since the implementation of the college entrance examination system, according to China's actual national conditions and personnel training, in constant exploration and study, in order to improve examinees comprehensive quality and improve China's comprehensive national strength, our country has been in constant reform of college entrance examination system. In recent years, much attention has been paid to English college entrance examination system.

As the economic level has been greatly improved these years, the mortality rate is gradually declining as a whole. The change will affect the premiums, reserves and moreover, the profits of the life insurance products for the mortality rate is of great importance in the design of life insurance products. Thus the effect of the mortality has become one of the problems we have to think seriously. In December 21, 2016, China Insurance Regulatory Commission issued the Notice on the Use of 2010-2013 Life Table, published the China's Life Insurance Industry Life Table (2010-2013), and that insurance companies can refer to the data provided in the  China's Life Insurance Industry Life Table (2010-2013) in the determination of insurance premiums as a basis for deciding the predetermined mortality. In practice, the change in mortality, in addition to itself, will also lead to changes in other indicators, such as lapse rate, sales, and so forth; and different insurance products are affected by mortality rate to various extent, such as life insurance and annuities. This paper will use life insurance and annuities to explore the impact of mortality on the overall profit under the basis that other conditions remain unchanged, which, use the idea that profit equals net cash flow minus incremental liabilities for references. In order to explore the impact of mortality on the overall profit of different insurance products, the research will include the contents shown below. To the beginning, this paper will use stochastic simulation to work out the future mortality improvement factor from different aspects based on the newly published experience life table. Subsequently, we take the lapse rate into account to estimate the change of lapse rate according to the fluctuation of mortality. Then we set a group of term insurance and term annuity to determine the annual profit and cumulative earnings based on series of fundamental hypothesis. Finally, this article will provide some suggestions for the operation in practice according to the results obtained above. The mortality changes have long been problems of concern, and it also has some research value in this paper if we examine this problem from new perspective. One is that in the profit measurement process, this paper aims at the overall profit of the product, examines the different kinds of mortality risk and its impact on the lapse rate, so that the situation in profit measurement is more diversified. For another thing, using the insurance product portfolio as the research object, this research will observe the comprehensive impact caused by mortality rate of the different types of insurance, which is closer to the reality of the insurance market situation. And the proposed risk management recommendations may provide references for the actual operation of the insurance company.","[Zheng Fengping; Zhou Yuxi] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"Zheng, FP (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",xytx30@sina.com; yuxiz0216@163.com,"Zhou, Yuxi/GXH-3588-2022",,,,,,17,0,0,1,1,TSINGHUA UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"TSINGHUA UNIV HAIDIANQU, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,,,,2017,,,,,,,645,660,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK8HD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000442810700045,0

In fact, urban policies are policies for managing the cities and the urban as a way of being. They define the planning benchmarks and directions for the sustainable development of the urban area. Cities are made up of several components/sub-systems on which sectoral policies focus (e.g., demographic, social, municipal, cultural, environmental). Therefore, at the city level, we speak about a mix of urban policies and not one policy. A priority of urban policies is the regeneration of municipal heritage, especially of the architectural heritage - of iconic buildings - as symbols of collective memory. The European cities which signed the Leipzig Charter undertake projects to effectively regenerate and use the architectural heritage as a development axis. Also, it is very necessary to create and value public spaces - elements of the urban framework - as places bearing value and symbols required for creatively living together. Culture is another priority of the urban policy. Studying the relation between culture and city regeneration provides several benchmarks for formulating public policies and ensuring economic sustainability of the urban world. The entire dynamics of the urban area - from the municipal policy to the development of a creative economy and high technology acquisition leave their mark on cultural policies, on their targets and functions. The assessment of the outcome of the innovative activity reveals the managerial efficiency in its multidimensionality: material, environmental, cultural, economic, institutional, etc.","[Moldoveanu, Maria] NIER, Romanian Ctr Comparat Econ & Consensus, Bucharest, Romania; [IOAN-FRANC, Valeriu] NIER, Ctr Econ Informat & Documentat, Bucharest, Romania",,"Moldoveanu, M (通讯作者)，NIER, Romanian Ctr Comparat Econ & Consensus, Bucharest, Romania.",mmoldoveanu39@gmail.com; cide90@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,83,91,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700008,0

Moreover, in cities we find most of the cultural institutions and creative industry organizations - spaces for creating the cultural contents and behavioral rules able to reshape the urbanity model. But there are problems concerning urban culture in localities lacking in economic units, resources, and productive businesses towns which we could define by the well-known phrase places where nothing happens.","[Moldoveanu, Maria] NIER, Romanian Ctr Comparat Econ & Consensus, Bucharest, Romania; [Neacsu, Paula] NIER, Ctr Econ Informat & Documentat, Bucharest, Romania",,"Moldoveanu, M (通讯作者)，NIER, Romanian Ctr Comparat Econ & Consensus, Bucharest, Romania.",mmoldoveanu39@gmail.com; cide90@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,2,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,75,82,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700007,0

Normative economy of natural resources leads to economic positivity accepted in conventional production and reproduction. In the space of normative economics, value manifests parametrically. Relativity of variation in size of value of resources and goods is given, for example, by increasing taxes to achieve controlled distribution and to encourage or discourage consumption, or by minimizing taxes, when we intend to create conditions to encourage a certain type of consumption. Normative economics is demanding answers to questions concerning what to produce with certain resources at our disposal;' how to produce those products and for whom to produce (who consumes). In such a situation, it requires knowledge and understanding of the functionality of markets in competition. It is also necessary to identify the balance and efficiency of resources under transformation by understanding the differences in the markets in which we can operate with a set of interventions to ensure procedural efficiency.","[Ciutacu, Otilia Teodora] RNP Romsilva, 9A Petricani St,MC, Bucharest 023841, Romania; [Gaf-Deac, Ioan I.] Romanian Acad, NIER, Res 3, Calea 13 Septembrie,13,MC, Bucharest 050711, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Ciutacu, OT (通讯作者)，RNP Romsilva, 9A Petricani St,MC, Bucharest 023841, Romania.",otilia.ciutacu@yahoo.com; editurafmp@gmail.com,"Gaf-Deac, Ioan/AAA-9146-2022","Gaf-Deac, Ioan/0000-0003-3814-0618",,,,,7,0,0,0,0,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,137,143,,,,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700012,0

Those events were accompanied by the loss of human lives to open the way toward a new political path for Romania, with multiple effects on the lives of individuals. Actions for institutional building have been undertaken for more than a third of the century; a new constitution was adopted (1991) which stipulated the democratic regime, republican governance, fundamental rights and freedoms, as well as the duties of citizens, public authorities, etc. Local, parliamentary and presidential elections were held, extending to the European Parliament (after Romania's accession to the European Union in 2007) as well. At the same time, several national referenda were held. Approaching such a topic is justified by the fact that the progress recorded at any given time is not set in stone; the situation develops, and deviations might occur, so that it is important to acknowledge all changes and their effects within the society. For the entire mentioned time interval, it might be appreciated that, as shown in the SWOT analysis, the democratic political regime was maintained and upheld, despite some failures along the way. The Romanian political scene was dominated by two directions, i.e. the social-democratic one (the Social-Democrat Party), and the liberal one (the Democrat-Liberal Party and the National Liberal Party, currently unified under the name of the latter), without any of these parties having absolute majority, save for the elections of May 1990. Therefore, government coalitions were built with consistent majorities, based on the temporary collaboration of the two major orientations. As an EU and NATO member, the potential for the development of the country increases considerably, along with the opportunities for strengthening democracy, but this needs to be valued adequately, promoting actions designed to counteract all domestic dysfunctions related to public institutions, the efficient and high use of resources, eradication of corruption, etc. At the same time, it is necessary to pay more attention to improving the living conditions of the population, this being also a favorable factor for the functioning of the democracy, if it is accompanied by the support of the citizens and adequate government.","[Marginean, Joan] Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Natl Inst Econ Res, Bucharest, Romania",National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

After the seventies, by its practical orientation, quality of life expanded rapidly from the sphere of theoretical research and analysis to the social action of changing/improving living conditions. Quality of life is not merely a simple academic topic or a nice phrase. It is increasingly present in the area of public debates, stimulating concerns/interest of political decision makers and of social stakeholders. The first part of the present paper focuses on the main factors increasing quality of life, starting from its dimensions/components. The quality of life, due to its evaluating structure, implies the value a human being gives to his/her life: how good or bad is the life one is living, as a whole, and by particular components (family, profession, work, civic, social, cultural, political life, free time, interpersonal relationships, etc.). The quality of life is estimated by a plurality of social and economic indicators, distributed by distinct life components. At the same time, a population's degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with life, based on specific subjective indicators, measures the impact of the outcome of social development on human condition. The second part of my paper points out the significance of quality of life as part of a strategy for maximizing the degree of individual satisfaction with his/her life. Thus, the quality of life is directly associated with a policy of change, of responsible action based on active and efficient interventions. The human significance of the direction of the development, of the targets, of the way of developing individual and collective action are integral parts of a strategy for a future country project. To this end, the orientations/options, the objectives and directions of development of a model/country project directly influence the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of the individual with his/her life. Validating the ethic norms for social action shall be supported in this context by: objective indicators for timely evaluation of the outcomes of changing the social and natural environment, subjective indicators of measuring the impact of these changes on the general satisfaction with life, comparative European statistics regarding welfare and quality of life, academic research analyses, public opinion surveys, official reports regarding social development. All of them represent measurement units/instruments and milestones for evaluating the social and human efficiency of actions based on moral regulations. In the current context of globalization, expanding the moral knowledge by assumed accountability for social actions turns into a necessity, but also into a guarantee for a sustainable development process. In this context, my paper concludes that widening the moral conscience by assumed responsibility for social action turns into an integral part of an actual process of sustainable development.","[Zamfir, Elena] Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Calea 13 Septembrie,13,Sect 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Zamfir, E (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Calea 13 Septembrie,13,Sect 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania.",ezamfir1@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,1,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,9,23,,,,,,15,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700001,0

This article proposes a new system of taxation of hydrocarbons that could adopt a differentiated royalty model, with two pillars-for existing operations or for new ones. Moreover, we believe that the new system of taxation of hydrocarbons should provide different levels of royalties for operating onshore and offshore. Also, there should be differentiation between shallow and deep offshore deposits, because of differences in costs involved. The effects of the application of a new system are: increasing contribution to consolidated state budget; efficient management of the productive potential of existing deposits and sustainable use of internal oil and gas resources; and increasing foreign direct investment inflows in oil and gas extraction, particularly in the Black Sea continental shelf.","[Bulearca, Marius] Romanian Acad, Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Bulearca, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",mariusbulearca@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5; 978-3-631-76221-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,363,372,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7SD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766346000032,0

Despite the rapid growth of agricultural production complexes and long traditions of the rural way of life, domestic food production in the region of Northeast Asia fails to meet demand. Even big and completive agricultural producers such as China and Russia have, to some extent, to rely on agricultural imports, suffering from price fluctuations on the global market, which threaten their food security. This paper includes an overview of the current state of agricultural production and food consumption trade in the region of Northeast Asia, primarily China's Northeast and Russia's Far East, with particular attention to the development of rural territories. Influences of the interregional collaboration between China and Russia on food security in the macro region of Northeast Asia are discussed.

Direct effects of renewable energy should be the elimination of polluting energy sources. This does not take place, at least in Romania, due to the nature of the installations producing renewable energy: they cannot provide energy twenty-four hours day, which requires the existence of backup equipment that comes into operation when it is not windy or at night.

This facilitates an understanding of the impact of economic policies affecting capital and labor force on the subsectors evolution.","[Dospinescu, Andrei Silviu; Hornianschi, Nicoleta] Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania",,"Dospinescu, AS (通讯作者)，Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania.",andrei@mail.ince.ro; hornianschi@yahoo.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,251,259,,,,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700023,0

This paper addresses these flaws by proposing a change in current reporting methodologies for composite indicators, which makes results perfectly comparable with respect to relative performance gaps between countries, ensures complete comparability between annual performances, and makes time comparisons against relative peer performances feasible without further calculations. Results reported using the new methodology point out the relative size of the differences between countries with respect to HDI scores, and can be used to assess the actual gaps between countries, and determine whether score changes are truly significant over chosen periods of time. This approach makes a reality check of media claims, and, if used, will help in making a more objective interpretation of countries' performance as a guide for public policies.","[Otoiu, Adrian; Titan, Emilia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Otoiu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania.",otoiu.adrian@gmail.com; emilia_titan@yahoo.com,"Otoiu, Adrian/J-6348-2013; OTOIU, Adrian/GWM-9957-2022; OTOIU, Adrian/HPE-8279-2023","Otoiu, Adrian/0000-0001-5830-5462;",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5; 978-3-631-76221-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,49,59,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7SD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766346000006,0

Government Decision. no. 506/2016, which establishes the institutional framework and implements some measures for it, emerged in Romania. Romania, with about 2.9 million hectares of mountain and farmland, is interested in capitalizing on mountain products, which are based on multifloral grass, ruminants, organic fertilizers and the difficult labor of small mountain farmers. Mountain products will be able to be sold nationally directly by farmers, if they form their market. On a large scale, the capitalization internally and externally on mountain products requires the association with grade I and II cooperative systems. The main objective is increasing farmers' incomes and fighting poverty. The constraints are found in the low prices for meat, milk etc., the lack of organization in associative-cooperative forms and the predictable competitive reactions of the industrial actors.","[Rey, Radu; Rey, Adrian Radu] Romanian Acad, Costin C Kiritescu Natl Inst Econ Res, Ctr Mt Econ CE MT, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest, Romania",National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

Comparative analysis has been conducted with all EU countries, with a special emphasis on Romania, Poland and Slovenia, countries that have a similar environment to Serbia in the field of agriculture. The results show that when comparing the price of agricultural land in Serbia in 2014 and 2015, it is less affordable for Poles and Romanians. On the other hand, it is more affordable for Slovenians, and significantly affordable for Germans, French, Italians, Belgians, Danes and the Dutch. In other words, for farmers from those countries buying agricultural land in Serbia land is five to eleven times more affordable compared with the purchasing power of the local population.

The expectations and the interventions (as project intentions) related to rural development in a Community Led Local Development approach following the specific actions of animation and information led to a uniform knowledge and understanding, in which the actors had the freedom to express their immediate future project-based actions. The analysis considers the general orientation of preferences, the readiness (including own financial contribution) and the link with the territory's potential. Furthermore, it compares the two territories in both agriculture and rural development potential and expectations.

Responding to the information needs of the decision-making process in this area and given the high variation in the regional density of self-employment in Romania, our paper seeks to explore its underlying factors of influence, both during and following the recent economic crisis. To this end, we applied appropriate methods of spatial analysis that take into account the spatial autocorrelation patterns exhibited by our data. We tested various model specifications and found the spatial models to be a better fit for the data, compared to classic regression. In line with the mainstream literature, our annual estimations, covering the interval 2008 to 2014, pointed to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as the main factor of influence on the distribution of self-employment density across Romanian counties. Another positive determinant is the share of young persons in the total population of the county, while foreign direct investments (FDIs) exert a negative effect.","[Goschin, Zizi] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Druica, Elena; Grigore, Ana-Maria] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of Bucharest,"Goschin, Z (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",zizi.goschin@csie.ase.ro; elena.druica@faa.unibuc.ro; ana.grigore@faa.unibuc.ro,"Druica, Elena/M-8323-2019","Druica, Elena/0000-0003-1063-7913",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,201,211,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700018,0

This will further increase the energy supply risks of the Republic of Moldova. RM signed an Association Agreement with the European Union in 2014, committing itself to fully transpose EU legislation in key areas, including energy. This will allow it to gradually integrate RM's energy sector into the EU-wide internal energy market, but keeping as competitors RM's traditional eastern suppliers of gas and electricity. To achieve this goal, new gas and electricity interconnections should be built and flows on some of the existing gas interconnections with Romania and Ukraine should be reversed. Despite their role in increasing the level of security of energy supply, commercial viability of some new interconnections is low and regulated mechanisms should be implemented in order to secure the investment recovery. The authors researched and proposed such a mechanism for the new gas interconnection with Romania, fully compatible with EU legislation, and based on a unified gas transmission tariff.","[Sandulescu, Alexandru] European Union High Level Adviser Energy Policy R, Kishinev, Moldova; [Carlea, Filip] Romanian Acad, Costin C Kiritescu Natl Inst Econ Res, Ctr Renewable Energy Sources Promot & Energy Effi, Bucharest, Romania; [Rudi, Marta] European Union High Level Advisers Miss Republ Mo, Kishinev, Moldova",Romanian Academy of Sciences; National Institute for Economic Research Costin C.

With a decrease by 45% of (live weight) beef production, in the period of 2007-2014, the Romanian beef sector cannot capitalize on the opportunities provided by the European Single Market.

Especially within the framework of food security, it became increasingly important as land became the target of large-scale investments. This research revises the previous approaches that the international community has used for land governance and how their consequences led to the wide negotiation process that concluded with the creation of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security is analyzed. The results show two fundamental facts suggesting that these guidelines represent a valuable tool to solve natural resources conflicts and strengthen peace processes, especially in the post-conflict countries.

Being focused on the monetary stability, central banks have generated a background that stimulated excessive risk-taking by banks and credit booms, and fostered speculative bubbles, making the economic cycle more prominent. These developments in the global financial system have had a major impact in shaping macroeconomic results, leading to serious financial disruptions and economic imbalances.

The authors take into consideration the demand dynamics for primary energy (fossil fuels) at global and European levels and also for Romania. They reveal that the fossil fuel industry is facing major risks nowadays and the decisions regarding the usage of large quantities of fossil fuel reserves until 2090 to 2100 depend on the willingness to enforce the regulations on the limitation of carbon emissions and moral persuasion induced by the lobby made by non-governmental organizations. The authors present original evolution scenarios for the production and consumption of fossil fuels by taking into consideration the natural resource reserves and ensuring continuous economic assessment. These scenarios were developed using specific mathematic models. The hypothesis for developing these scenarios is that fossil fuels represent an active factor for sustainable development when they are used efficiently and responsibly. Based on the empirical analyses for these scenarios, the authors made several quantitative judgments regarding the evolution of the fossil fuels' natural resources and economic assessments.","[Stancu, Stelian; Bodea, Constanta Nicoleta] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Informat & Econ Cybernet Dept, Bucharest, Romania; [Stancu, Stelian; Bodea, Constanta Nicoleta; Muscalu, Mihai Sabin] Romanian Acad, Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Stancu, S (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Informat & Econ Cybernet Dept, Bucharest, Romania.",stelian_stancu@yahoo.com; bodea@ase.ro; msmuscalu@yahoo.com,"Bodea, Constanta-Nicoleta/GXV-2034-2022; STANCU, Stelian/HRB-5488-2023","Bodea, Constanta-Nicoleta/0000-0001-5542-8133;",,,,,27,0,0,0,1,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5; 978-3-631-76221-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,351,361,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7SD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766346000031,0

In that respect, during 1918-1989 we can observe a movement from a less planned development of road and naval transportation toward a rapid growth of the road transport and the emergence of a new type of transport, by air. Particular characteristics gave the evolution path for each of the transportation areas but, in our opinion, for that time period the major influences on the evolution of transport was related to three important historical events: a) the territorial union in 1918, when several territories under foreign jurisdiction joined to form Romania, b) the Second World War, when during 1940-1944, Romania ceded some territories to foreign administration and c) the communist period, after 1945. Highlighting the mutual influences between the economic and social development of Romania and the evolution of the transport network represent the principal goal of this working paper. We divide our investigation period into two: the one before communism, and the communist period. A major conclusion of our research investigation is that transport shows permanent growth during that period, but shares of the specific transport modes, in total, have changed significantly, showing the historical importance given to each of them. The general socioeconomic and political conditions influenced that evolution, but several situations, such as the poor quality of the transport infrastructure, were due to inadequate management of the sector, or even worse, the disinterest in modernizing and permanently adapting the Romanian transport networks to meet the period's requirements.","[Fistung, Frantz Daniel; Popescu, Teodor] Romanian Acad, Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, 13 September Blvd,13,Sect 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Fistung, FD (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Ctr Ind & Serv Econ, 13 September Blvd,13,Sect 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania.",dfistung@yahoo.com; axel_me5678@yahoo.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,271,282,,,,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700025,0

Thus, the paper investigates the variation of these factors, i.e. areas and productivity, which are the main determinants of production stability. Grains have a significant share in human and animal consumption, and under these conditions, the investigation of grain production stability is important, as a stable production can cover the domestic consumption needs, attenuating price volatility. In order to attenuate the errors that can appear in the utilization of variation coefficient that can lead to an overestimation when we analyze the trend data series, the Cuddy-Della Valle instability index was used in the paper. Calculating the variability of average wheat and maize yields per hectare, across counties, we noticed that the counties with high yields also have the highest variations.","[Kruzslicika, Mihaela] Romanian Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Kruzslicika, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Agr Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13, Bucharest 050711, Romania.",mkruzslicika@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,PETER LANG GMBH,BERLIN,"INTL VERLAG WISSENSCH, SCHLUTERSTRASSE 42, 10707 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-653-06572-5,,,,2018,,,,,,,339,349,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Development Studies,BS7RW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000766315700031,0

We find that-prior to the horsemeat scandal-detection of fraud along the supply chain induced a small amount of trade diversion toward third-country sources, but did not substantially affect total trade into the EU. In contrast, in the years after the scandal, the detection of fraud by international suppliers was substantially trade destructive. Detection of fraud reduced trade, not only with the country from which the fraudulent product originated, but also from third-country exporters of the same product. These findings extend beyond trade in meat products and to importing countries outside Western and Northern Europe.","[Schaefer, K.

Vitamin, iron and zinc deficiencies affects 1 in 4 persons in the country and is responsible for early child nutritional disorder. The high prevalence of micronutrient malnutrition may be attributed to the dominant role in the diet of local sorghum varieties, deficient in essential micronutrients. To address this issue Africa Harvest is developing a biofortified sorghum variety. However the success of this innovation with farmers will depend on numerous factors such as product attributes, previous experience and socioeconomic factors. In this study, we applied a choice experiment to investigate the farmers' valuation of various sorghum seed attributes as well as to identify the factors that influence the farmers valuation. Our results show that there is a market for transgenic biofortified food in the country and thus that it could be a veritable instrument for reducing micronutrient malnutrition problems. We found that farmers are willing to pay more for biofortified sorghum, particularly if it also scores better on other attributes than the local varieties. Furthermore, we showed that those that have experience with the first-generation genetic modified crop (Bt cotton), are more likely to adopt the second-generation crop (biofortified sorghum). Given the importance of the other attributes and the heterogeneous preferences it is key to involve farmers in the development of the new product.","[Chinedu, Obi; Bartolini, Fabio] Univ Pisa, Dept Food Agr & Environm, Via S Michele Scalzi 2, I-56124 Pisa, PI, Italy; [Chinedu, Obi; Sanou, Edouard; Tur-Cardona, Juan; Speelman, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Gheysen, Godelieve] Univ Ghent, Dept Biotechnol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",University of Pisa; Ghent University; Ghent University,"Speelman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",stijn.speelman@ugent.be,"Obi, Chinedu/ABF-6036-2021; Bartolini, Fabio/C-5232-2011; Obi, Chinedu/AAG-8270-2021","Obi, Chinedu/0000-0003-2330-5571; Bartolini, Fabio/0000-0002-8946-3110; speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459",,,,,62,7,7,3,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,132,140,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.06.006,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500013,0

This study tests the feasibility of a market-based incentive mechanism by eliciting consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for rice produced and labeled under a national sustainable production standard in the South of Vietnam through experimental auctions. Domestic consumers are willing to pay a 9% price premium for certified sustainably-produced rice. This premium gradually increases up to 33% when incremental levels of information on certification and traceability are provided. Consumers willing to pay premiums for sustainably-produced rice are more health-conscious, have better knowledge of and greater trust in food quality certification for rice, and tend to be more environmentally conscious and to read food labels before purchasing. Findings suggest that sustainable production labels for rice should be accompanied by supplementary information on certification and traceability to increase consumers' awareness and appreciation of sustainably-produced rice. Promoting certified sustainably-produced rice hence crucially hinges on strengthening consumers' knowledge of and trust in food quality certification. Communication strategies are recommended to focus on the environmental and health benefits of sustainably-produced rice.","[My, Nguyen H.

Study data are from an impact evaluation of the Government of Malawi's Social Cash Transfer Program, a cluster-randomized control trial that employs both random selection and random assignment. We use the difference-in-differences specification to estimate average treatment effects of the program on three components of food and nutrition security- current economic vulnerability, diet quantity, and diet quality. Results show protective program impacts during the lean season on diet quantity as beneficiary households are 11 percentage points more likely to consume multiple meals per day than control households (p<.001), have a higher level of apparent caloric availability (267.49 kcal, p<.05), are 10 percentage points less likely to be food-energy deficient (p<.05), and have a reduced hunger depth (111.11 kcal, p<.05). However, study findings indicate that after one year of program exposure beneficiary households have experienced little improvement in diet quality or current economic vulnerability to food insecurity. Clear policy and program implications emerge related to the purchasing power of the cash transfer, particularly during the lean season, and the importance of integrated social protection initiatives.","[Brugh, Kristen] Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Campus Box 7445, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ N Carolina, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, 400 Meadowmont Village Circle,3rd Floor, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Populat Ctr, MEASURE Evaluat, 400 Meadowmont Village Circle,3rd Floor, Chapel Hill, NC 27517 USA; [Mvula, Peter; Tsoka, Maxton] Univ Malawi, Ctr Social Res, Zomba, Malawi; [Handa, Sudhanshu] UNICEF Off Res, Piazza SS Annunziata 12, I-50122 Florence, Italy; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Campus Box 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Carolina Populat Ctr, Campus Box 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Malawi; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Brugh, K (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Campus Box 7445, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",knbrugh@gmail.com; gustavo_angeles@unc.edu; petermvula58@yahoo.com; tsokamax@gmail.com; shanda@email.unc.edu,,,UNICEF; German Government through KfW; German Government through Irish Aid; German Government through FAO; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie); European Union (EU),UNICEF; German Government through KfW; German Government through Irish Aid; German Government through FAO; International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie); European Union (EU)(European Union (EU)CGIAR),"The Malawi Social Cash Transfer Program Impact Evaluation has been contracted to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Center for Social Research at the University of Malawi.

Second, grassroots and social innovation in a Chinese co-operative context have their own characters and indeed a hybrid of capitalism (e.g., agribusiness) and New Rural Re-structuring principles (i.e., similar to ICA ones).

The paper seeks to understand how geography drives these strategies, focusing on the role of agricultural potential and distance to urban areas. Specialization in on-farm activities continues to be the norm in rural Africa, practiced by 52 percent of households (as opposed to 21 percent of households in other regions). Regardless of distance and integration in the urban context, when agro-climatic conditions are favorable, farming remains the occupation of choice for most households in the African countries for which the study has geographically explicit information. However, the paper finds no evidence that African households are on a different trajectory than households in other regions in terms of transitioning to non-agricultural based income strategies.

Using recent survey data of 412 smallholder rice farmers from northern Ghana, we examine the role of farmer groups in improving yield and technical efficiency. Due to self-selection into farmer groups, we use a sample selection stochastic production frontier model to account for potential selection bias arising from observed and unobserved attributes. The empirical results reveal that participation in farmer groups is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency, relative to farmers who produce and market rice individually. Moreover, the yield and efficiency gaps between group members and nonmembers increase significantly when selection bias is taken into account in the analysis.","[Abdul-Rahaman, Awal; Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Food Policy, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Food Policy, Johanna Mestorf Str 5, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021; Abdul-Rahaman, Awal/GVS-8674-2022",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789; Abdul-Rahaman, Awal/0000-0002-7356-6326",,,,,47,91,98,2,57,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,DEC,2018,81.0,,,,,,95,105,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.10.007,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,HF6TV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454372100008,0

Trade played a very important role in the creation of the 'terror's' but the mechanisms through which trade stimulated GIs varied. For the Port and Chianti GIs it was exports to foreign markets (Britain) that were crucial; for Burgundy it was domestic trade to Paris; and for the Champagne GI it was not exports but pressure from wine imports and new wine regions that played a crucial role. For the expansions of the GIs later in history, other factors seem to have been more important Expansions of the GIs in the years and centuries after their introduction followed (1) major changes in political power, (2) the spread of a new philosophy in liberal and free markets across Europe; (3) and infrastructure investments which opened up markets and made exports cheaper from new producers.","Univ Leuven KU Leuven, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Dept Econ, Leuven, Belgium; Ctr European Policy Studies, Brussels, Belgium; European Univ Inst, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Fiesole, Italy",KU Leuven; European University Institute,"Meloni, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, KU Leuven, Dept Econ, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium.",giulia.meloni@kuleuven.be,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Meloni, Giulia/0000-0002-3670-446X",KU Leuven (Methusalem Program); Robert Solow Fellowship at the Cournot Center in Paris; Excellence of Science (EOS) Research project of FWO; EU [770680],KU Leuven (Methusalem Program); Robert Solow Fellowship at the Cournot Center in Paris; Excellence of Science (EOS) Research project of FWO; EU(European Union (EU)),"Research on this project was financially supported by the KU Leuven (Methusalem Program), the Robert Solow Fellowship at the Cournot Center in Paris, the Excellence of Science (EOS) Research project of FWO, and the EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 770680 (RESPECT).",,176,46,48,4,57,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,DEC,2018,81.0,,,,,,1,20,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.10.003,0.0,,,20,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,HF6TV,,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454372100001,0

In northern Kenya, these communities predominantly sell sheep and goats to local traders who connect them to different markets. This pastoral livestock supply chain is characterized by inadequate market information, without which it is difficult to improve the coordination of seller-buyer activities. This paper examines the information needs and constraints of producers and different categories of traders. Semi-structured and narrative interviews were conducted with 15 producers and 26 traders. Results revealed the particular information needs of traders; such as the range of prices in different markets, the extent of competition, grades of animals in high demand and further animal specifications. However, market information tended to change within a short time-span. Analysis of weekly prices for different grades revealed high price variability such that prices were only known on the market day. This unpredictability made it difficult for traders to improve prices offered to pastoral producers.

We investigate determinants of food security as measured by a well-known food security scale - the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - and as measured by value of household food consumption composed of own-production, market purchases and gifts received. We find that several dimensions of household vulnerability correlate more strongly with the food security measure than with food consumption. Labor constraints, which is a key vulnerability criterion used by the HSCT to target households, is an important predictor of the food security score but not food consumption, and its effect on food security is even larger during the lean season. Impact analysis shows that the program has had statistically significant impacts on Food Security and Diet Diversity scores but null to low impacts on food consumption. However aggregate food consumption hides dynamic activity taking place within the household where the cash is used to obtain more food from the market and rely less on food received as gifts. The cash in turn gives beneficiaries greater choice in their food basket, which improves diet diversity.","[Bhalla, Garima] Oxford Policy Management Ltd, Level 3,52 Cornmarket St, Oxford OX1 3HJ, England; [Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, Abernethy Hall,CB 3435, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Angeles, Gustavo] Univ N Carolina, UNC Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Maternal & Child Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Seidenfeld, David] Amer Inst Res, 1000 Thomas Jefferson St NW 200, Washington, DC 20007 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; American Institutes for Research,"Bhalla, G (通讯作者)，Oxford Policy Management Ltd, Level 3,52 Cornmarket St, Oxford OX1 3HJ, England.",garims@gmail.com,,,UNICEF [431-23421],UNICEF,This work was supported by UNICEF [431-23421].,,32,40,43,4,18,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,82,99,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.11.007,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,31692975.0,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400008,0

These changes in understanding have been accompanied by different food security measurement approaches. Despite the fact that the world has become increasingly urbanised and the developing world in particular, is experiencing its own urban transition, changes in food security measurement remain predominantly informed by a rural understanding of food security. In instances where urban measurement does take place, rural-oriented measurement approaches are adopted, occluding critical urban challenges and systemic drivers. This paper begins by highlighting the urban transition and attendant food security challenges in the Global South. It then reflects on existing food security measurement methods, detailing the positive components but also highlighting the shortfalls applicable to the urban context. At the urban scale, a food system assessment is argued to be one appropriate tool to respond to urban food insecurity while at the same time providing both the breadth and depth to inform effective food security programming and policy interventions. Theoretically, questions of scale, context and a critique of the rural bias in food systems work are essential informants guiding the approaches applied.","[Haysom, Gareth; Tawodzera, Godfrey] Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Private Bag X3, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Haysom, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Private Bag X3, ZA-7700 Cape Town, South Africa.",gareth.haysom@uct.ac.za; godfreyltawodzera@yahoo.com,"Tawodzera, Godfrey/V-4869-2019","Tawodzera, Godfrey/0000-0003-0367-453X; Haysom, Gareth/0000-0001-9443-7913",Economic and Social Research Council (UK); UK Department for International Development [ES/L008610/1]; Hungry Cities Partnership - Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) - Canada; International Development Research Centre (IDRC) - Canada; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L008610/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L008610/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK Department for International Development; Hungry Cities Partnership - Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) - Canada; International Development Research Centre (IDRC) - Canada(CGIAR); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The support of two funders is gratefully acknowledged.

They assume that food is allocated within households according to members' proportional energy requirements relative to an adult male (called an adult male equivalent, or AME). This study sought to validate AME-based estimates of individual consumption of calories, protein, iron, and animal source protein (ASP) across 10 age-sex categories, using data from Bangladesh and Ethiopia containing both household and individual-level consumption data. The study also assessed the accuracy of adjusting for meal partakers and physical activity levels (PAL), and compared energy-weighted AMEs to nutrient-specific AME predictions. Energy AME-based predictions of nutrient intake were generally accurate within ten percentage points of individually reported intakes, but were less accurate for infants 6-23 months and children in Bangladesh than for other demographic groups. AME predictions were more accurate: (1) in Ethiopia than in Bangladesh, (2) for predicting intake of the three nutrients rather than ASP, (3) for estimating nutrient intake rather than adequacy, (4) using energy-weighted AMEs rather than nutrient specific weights, and (5) using moderate PAL for youth and adults rather than high PAL. Adjusting for meal partakers did not consistently improve the AME-based predictions. Energy based AME estimates from household data can produce a useful proxy of average intake for certain population subgroups, however individually measured dietary assessment remains the best approach to identify groups at risk of nutrient inadequacy.","[Coates, Jennifer; Rogers, Beatrice Lorge; Lauer, Jacqueline] Tufts Univ, Gerald J & Dorothy R Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Poli, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Blau, Alexander] Ideas 42, 80 Broad St,Floor 30, New York, NY 10004 USA; [Roba, Alemzewed] Hawassa Univ, Hawassa, Ethiopia",Tufts University; Hawassa University,"Coates, J (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Gerald J & Dorothy R Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Poli, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",Jennifer.coates@tufts.edu; beatrice.rogers@tufts.edu; alexmblau@gmail.com; jacqueline.lauer@tufts.edu; alemzewedcr2000@yahoo.com,,,American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-663-A-11-00017],American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors would like to acknowledge Meghan Kershaw, Dr. Beyene Wondafrash, Yitbarek Kidane Woldetensay, Addisalem Fikre Tilahun, Yohannes Tesema, Dr. Kyungjae Kang, and DATA, Ltd. for their assistance in collecting and processing the study's dietary data.

Introduction to the special issue,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,Food consumption; Household surveys; Questionnaire design,,"This introductory paper presents the results of an international multi-disciplinary research project on the measurement of food consumption in national household surveys. Food consumption data from household surveys are possibly the single most important source of information on poverty, food security, and nutrition outcomes at national, sub-national and household level, and contribute building blocks to global efforts to monitor progress towards the major international development goals. The paper synthesizes case studies from a diverse set of developing and OECD countries, looking at some of the main outstanding research issues as identified by a recent international assessment of 100 existing national household surveys (Smith et al., 2014). The project mobilized expertise from different disciplines (statistics, economics, food security, nutrition) to work towards enhancing our understanding of how to improve the quality and availability of food consumption and expenditure data, while making them more valuable for a diverse set of users. The individual studies summarized in this paper analyze, both theoretically and empirically, how different surveys design options affect the quality of the data being collected and, in turn, the implications for statistical inference and policy analysis. The conclusions and recommendations derived from this collection of studies will be instrumental in advancing the methodological agenda for the collection of household level food data, and will provide national statistical offices and survey practitioners worldwide with practical insights for survey design, while providing poverty, food and nutrition policymakers with greater understanding of these issues, as well as improved tools for and better guidance in policy formulation.","[Zezza, Alberto; Carletto, Calogero; Jolliffe, Dean] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Gennari, Pietro] Food & Agr Org United Nat, Rome, RM, Italy; [Fiedler, John L.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Zezza, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",azezza@worldbank.org,,,Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics,Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics,"The authors, as Guest Editors of the Special Issue, would like to thank all those who contributed to this project: the authors, the peer reviewers, and participants in the November 2014 FAO Workshop on Improving the Relevance and Reliability of Food Data from Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys.

A data-driven approach was used to analyze trade flows in the tomato industry from 1970 to 2015 and all structural changes to policy interventions implemented during the same period were linked. Tests for endogenous breakpoints reveal that NAFTA and trade pricing policies are two of the main factors that caused structural changes in the tomato industry in 1992 and 1999. While U.S. agricultural policies sought to protect domestic tomato producers, they did not stop Mexican tomatoes from taking an important share of the U.S. market.

Promoting increased use of chemical fertilizer by lowering its price may be ineffective if demand is price inelastic. In theory, the price elasticity of demand depends on the returns to its use, but the evidence is scarce. Furthermore, while returns are often estimated for small changes in chemical fertilizer use, returns to larger changes in its use (intensive margins) are less understood. Through the inter-zonal comparisons in Nepal, we provide indicative evidence that greater returns to chemical fertilizer are associated with greater price elasticities of demand. Moreover, the evidence suggests that returns at the intensive margins, rather than returns to small changes, may largely account for inter-zonal differences in returns to chemical fertilizer within Nepal. The results suggest that better understanding the returns at the intensive margins is critical for effective agricultural inputs policies in developing countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

If consumers prefer a product with an ecolabel, the label will create product differentiation and a reduction in substitutability between ecolabeled and non-labeled products. Fisheries certification programs for sustainability have rapidly increased their significance within international seafood markets as a mechanism to create market-based incentives for improved global fisheries management and practices by differentiating seafood products with ecolabels. While there exists growing evidence of market benefits in the price dimension, this analysis investigates both price and quantity effects of fisheries certification by testing the hypothesis of structural changes in demand at the import (wholesale) level to determine if, in the period after sustainability certification, there were significant changes in market shares or substitutability between certified and uncertified frozen walleye (Alaska) pollock (Theragra chalcogranuna) imported by Germany. A linear, first-differenced, inverse almost ideal demand system (IAIDS), incorporating a dynamic transition function, is used to estimate German imports of certified pollock from the U.S. and uncertified pollock from Russia and China. Results indicate no statistically significant change in market shares, although there were significant effects on the price flexibilities. The price of certified US pollock became less sensitive not only to changes in own quantity of imports but also to changes in import volumes of non-certified Russian pollock. These market changes may provide insight into economic incentives that may have led the Russian government to strengthen its national fisheries management policies to gain certification.","[Roheim, Cathy A.] Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Zhang, Dengjun] Univ Stavanger, Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway",Idaho; University of Idaho; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Roheim, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",croheim@uidaho.edu; dengjun.zhang@uis.no,,,Norwegian Research Council [233709],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The authors wish to thank Frank Asche for comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Hence, it is often assumed that further diversifying small-farm production would be a good strategy to improve nutrition, but the evidence is mixed. We systematically review studies that have analyzed associations between production diversity, dietary diversity, and nutrition in smallholder households and provide a meta-analysis of estimated effects. We identified 45 original studies reporting results from 26 countries and using various indicators of diets and nutrition. While in the majority of these studies positive results are highlighted, less than 20% of the studies report consistently positive and significant associations between production diversity and dietary diversity and/or nutrition. Around 60% report positive associations only for certain subsamples or indicators, the rest found no significant associations at all. The average marginal effect of production diversity on dietary diversity is positive but small. The mean effect of 0.062 implies that farms would have to produce 16 additional crop pr livestock species to increase dietary diversity by one food group. The mean effect is somewhat larger in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other regions, but even in Africa farms would have to produce around 9 additional species to increase dietary diversity by one food group.

By looking at the dynamics of farmers' consumption over time and controlling for a variety of household and production characteristics as well as possible confounding factors, our results show that farmers' food security is positively affected by participation In the market chain, irrespective of the choice of outlet.

After ISPs were phased out during the 1980s and 1990s, the landscape has changed profoundly since the early 2000s. By 2010, at least 10 African governments initiated a new wave of subsidy programs that were designed to overcome past performance challenges. This study provides the most comprehensive review of recent evidence to date regarding the performance of these second generation ISPs, synthesizing nearly 80 ISP-related studies from seven countries (Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, and Ethiopia). We specifically evaluate ISP impacts on total fertilizer use, food production, commercial input distribution systems, food prices, wages, and poverty. We also consider measures that could enable ISPs to more cost-effectively achieve their objectives. We find that ISPs can quickly raise national food production, and that receiving subsidized inputs raises beneficiary households' grain yields and production levels at least in the short-term. However, the overall production and welfare effects of subsidy programs tend to be smaller than expected. Two characteristics of program implementation consistently mitigate the intended effects of ISPs: (1) subsidy programs partially crowd out commercial fertilizer demand due to difficulties associated with targeting and sale of inputs by program implementers, and (2) lower than expected crop yield response to fertilizer on smallholder managed fields. If these challenges could be addressed, ISPs could more effectively mitigate the concurrent challenges of rapid population growth and climate change in SSA.","[Jayne, Thomas S.; Mason, Nicole M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, 446 W Circle Dr,Rm 202, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Burke, William J.] Agr & Food Policy Consulting, 3016 St Paul St,3rd Floor, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Ariga, Joshua] Int Fertilizer Dev Ctr, Reservat Rd,Complex F, Muscle Shoals, AL 35662 USA",Michigan State University,"Burke, WJ (通讯作者)，Agr & Food Policy Consulting, 3016 St Paul St,3rd Floor, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",jayne@msu.eud; mason@msu.edu; burkewj2@gmail.com; jariga@ifdc.org,"Burke, William J/AAI-9265-2020","Burke, William J/0000-0003-4961-2211","World Bank; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification Grant [OPP1039151]; US Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security under the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab [AID-OAA-L-13-00001]; USAID Missions [611-A-00-11-00001-00, AID-623-A-12-00022]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1039151] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation",World Bank(The World Bank India); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification Grant; US Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security under the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); USAID Missions(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"This work was supported by the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under the Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agricultural Intensification Grant (OPP1039151), the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security under the Food Security Policy Innovation Lab [AID-OAA-L-13-00001], and the USAID Missions to Zambia [grant number 611-A-00-11-00001-00] and Kenya [grant number AID-623-A-12-00022].

One reason why is that attaining substantial yield advantages has been difficult in this harsh, heterogeneous growing environment. Release in Mali of the first sorghum hybrids in Sub-Saharan Africa that have been developed primarily from local germplasm has the potential to change this situation. Utilizing plot data collected in Mali, we explain the adoption of improved seed with an ordered logit model and apply a multivalued treatment effects model to measure impacts on farm families, differentiating between improved varieties and hybrids. Since farm families both consume and sell their sorghum, we consider effects on consumption patterns as well as productivity. Status within the household, conferred by gender combined with marital status, generation, and education, is strongly related to the improvement status of sorghum seed planted in these extended family households. Effects of hybrid use on yields are large, widening the range of food items consumed, reducing the share of sorghum in food purchases, and contributing to a greater share of the sorghum harvest sold. Use of improved seed appears to be associated with a shift toward consumption of other cereals, and also to greater sales shares. Findings support on-farm research concerning yield advantages, also suggesting that the use of well-adapted sorghum hybrids could contribute to diet diversification and the crop's commercialization by smallholders.","[Smale, Melinda; Assima, Amidou; Theriault, Veronique] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kergna, Alpha] Inst Econ Rural, Econ Filiere, Bamako, Mali; [Weltzien, Eva] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agron, Madison, WI USA",Michigan State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Smale, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",msmale@msu.edu; amidou.assima@gmail.com; akergna@yahoo.fr; theria13@msu.edu; e.weltzien@icrisatml.org,,,Michigan State University through grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under the project titled Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa (GISAIA); USAID's Innovation Laboratory for Food Security Policy [AID-OAA-L-13-00001],Michigan State University through grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under the project titled Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa (GISAIA); USAID's Innovation Laboratory for Food Security Policy(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),This study was funded Michigan State University through grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation under the project titled Guiding Investments in Sustainable Agriculture in Africa (GISAIA) and USAID's Innovation Laboratory for Food Security Policy (Contract AID-OAA-L-13-00001).,,29,43,44,3,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,162,171,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.01.001,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,29479132.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400016,0

More specifically, dairy production - which is labor-intensive but does not heavily rely on access to land - is generally expected to offer better prospects for income growth to the poorest among rural households. However, most policies aimed at increasing dairy production are based on ad hoc observations, with hardly any micro-level evidence. Using a unique primary dataset on 1000 rural households in Andhra Pradesh, this paper investigates the dairy production system, addressing three main research questions: First, we look at the typical profile of a dairy farmer and we find that both family traditions in dairy and owning (even a small piece of) land play a role in determining participation in dairy - while land size does not matter. Second, we show that dairy production is strongly and positively associated with improvement in rural livelihoods, in terms of income per capita, but that this positive relation only holds for larger dairy farms. In a third step, we look at the determinants of farm growth and we find that households having higher shares of graded dairy animals have grown more after 2005. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

At times they simply confirm our common understanding of the topic. But they also throw up a number of surprises, redirecting policy debates while fine-tuning others. Overall, the project calls for more attention to checking and updating our common wisdom.

Vending-machine interventions that stimulate low-calorie choices can therefore play a role in improving the healthfulness of the food environment landscape. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of four vending-machine interventions, varying in level of intrusiveness, on consumers' choices, consumers' acceptance of such interventions, and consumers' evaluations of the choice they made. In a between-subjects design experiment (N = 206), respondents were asked to purchase a snack and a beverage from a vending machine. In addition to a no-intervention condition, four types of incrementally intrusive interventions were implemented: calorie labelling, increasing accessibility of low-calorie choices, increasing prices of high-calorie choices, and restricting availability of high-calorie choices. A post-choice questionnaire included items concerning intervention acceptance, and assortment and choice evaluations. Compared to the no-intervention condition, the most intrusive intervention (i.e. restricting availability of high-calorie choices) led to more low-calorie choices (39% vs. 78%), while less intrusive interventions (i.e. calorie labelling, increasing accessibility of low-calorie choices, and increasing prices of high-calorie choices) did not. Intervention acceptance and choice evaluations were equally high across the four intervention types. Overall, the results suggest that restricting high-calorie options is a promising route to stimulate healthier choices from vending machines.

Grocery stores and supermarkets play a particularly important role in food choice, since they account for almost half of all retail food sales. We propose that conducting field experiments in grocery stores is an attractive methodology for learning about food purchasing behaviors and identifying policy levers that may be successful in shaping those behaviors. We summarize the challenges and barriers that researchers may face while carrying out field experiments in a retail grocery environment, and provide a simple 'how-to' guide that researchers can use to replicate field experiment best practices in this setting.","[Carroll, Kathryn A.] Univ Wisconsin, Behav Res Insights Expt BRITE Lab, Nancy Nicholas Hall,1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Carroll, Kathryn A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Consumer Sci, Nancy Nicholas Hall,1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Samek, Anya] Univ Southern Calif, Ctr Econ & Social Res, Verna & Peter Dauter Hall,635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Samek, Anya] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Econ, Verna & Peter Dauter Hall,635 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Carroll, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Behav Res Insights Expt BRITE Lab, Nancy Nicholas Hall,1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Carroll, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Consumer Sci, Nancy Nicholas Hall,1300 Linden Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",kcarroll3@wisc.edu,,"Carroll, Kathryn A./0000-0002-9746-5597",Produce for Better Health Foundation's Fruit & Vegetable Marketing Research Program,Produce for Better Health Foundation's Fruit & Vegetable Marketing Research Program,"This work was made possible through the support of a grant from the Produce for Better Health Foundation's Fruit & Vegetable Marketing Research Program.

However, global food systems are not delivering diverse and high quality diets: healthy food is unavailable and too expensive for many. Creating food environments that foster consumer access to fruit and vegetables will require coordinated policy action across sectors, mostly outside of the health sector. The aim of this paper is to identify opportunities to strengthen food system policy for nutrition, through an analysis of the policies relevant to the external food environment for fruit and vegetables in India. We conducted interviews based on policy theory with 55 stakeholders from national and state level, from within government, research, private sector and non-government agencies, and from health, agriculture and economic sectors. Specific strategies identified in this study to improve consumers' external food environment for fruit and vegetables in India were: development of strategic Public-Private Partnerships to increase access to diverse expertise across the supply chain; linking health and economic/agricultural policy agendas; and strengthening surveillance of policy impacts on consumer access to fruit and vegetables. We also found that public health actors can play an important role in advocating for 'consumer oriented' fruit and vegetable supply policy. This study demonstrates the usefulness of 'policy learning'-oriented qualitative policy analysis in identifying 'points of entry' for food policy change, and extends understanding of political dynamics in engendering agricultural policy change for nutrition. Improving access to affordable fruit and vegetables is a global priority, and given common global food supply challenges, the findings from this study are also likely to be relevant for other low and middle income countries.","[Thow, Anne Marie] Univ Sydney, Menzies Ctr Hlth Policy, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Verma, Garima; Soni, Deepa; Soni, Divya; Beri, Deepti Kumar; Kumar, Poorvaja; Khandelwal, Shweta] Publ Hlth Fdn India, New Delhi, India; [Siegel, Karen R.; Shaikh, Nida] Emory Univ, Nutr & Hlth Sci, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Siegel, Karen R.] Emory Univ, Dept Global Hlth, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Shaikh, Nida] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA",University of Sydney; Public Health Foundation of India; Emory University; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Fogarty International Center (FIC),"Thow, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Level 2,Charles Perkins Ctr D17, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;Khandelwal, S (通讯作者)，Publ Hlth Fdn India, ISID Campus,4 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",annemarie.thow@sydney.edu.au,"Thow, Anne Marie/JCE-5108-2023; soni, Divya/IAQ-5582-2023","soni, Divya/0000-0003-0000-010X; Beri, Deepti/0000-0002-4748-0334; Soni, Deepa/0000-0002-5312-5304",UK aid from the UK government,UK aid from the UK government(CGIAR),"We gratefully acknowledge the participation of the interviewees, and the constructive comments by the anonymous reviewers.

This paper presents an analysis of foods ordered from food banks by 110 food shelves in Minnesota and western Wisconsin in 2013. We examine whether and how food shelves' Healthy Eating Index scores for ordered food are associated with food shelf size and sourcing patterns, food bank providers, food shelf policies, food shelf manager characteristics, client characteristics and community-level demographics. We find a significant positive relationship between annual order quantity and the HEI-2010 score for ordered food. We also find strong associations between characteristics of the person placing food bank orders and the healthfulness of food ordered, which suggest that training programs designed to improve these individuals' skills and motivation for ordering a healthy assortment of foods may have an important impact. Finally, while the age structure of clients served does have a significant relationship with HEI-2010 scores, it is noteworthy that the ethnic profile of clients served by a food shelf does not have a strong relationship with the healthfulness of food ordered. This suggests that food shelves can respond successfully to wide variations in culturally based food preferences.","[Cureton, Colin; King, Robert P.; Warren, Cael] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Grannon, Katherine Young; Hoolihan, Courtney; Janowiec, Mark; Nanney, Marilyn S.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Family Med & Community Hlth, Program Hlth Dispar Res, 717 Delaware St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA; [Cureton, Colin] Cor Findings LLC, 1270 Buren Ave, St Paul, MN 55104 USA; [Hoolihan, Courtney] Emily Program, 2265 Como Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"King, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.",rking@umn.edu,,"Janowiec, Mark/0000-0002-8387-9916; Nanney, Marilyn/0000-0002-3463-6416","University of Minnesota Healthy Foods, Healthy Lives Institute; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship [00039202]","University of Minnesota Healthy Foods, Healthy Lives Institute; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Funding for this project was provided by the University of Minnesota Healthy Foods, Healthy Lives Institute.

It is slightly above 50% in Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, and substantially lower in Nigeria (37%), Ethiopia (29%), and Niger (24%). There are no systematic differences across crops and activities, but female labor shares tend to be higher in households where women own a larger share of the land and when they are more educated.

First, we estimate the determinants of improved chickpea adoption using a double hurdle model. We apply a control function approach with correlated random effects to control for possible endogeneity resulting from access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. To instrument for these variables we develop novel distance weighted measures of a household's neighbours' access to improved seed and technology transfer activities. Second, we estimate the impact of area under improved chickpea cultivation on household income and poverty. We apply a fixed effects instrumental variables approach where we use the predicted area under cultivation from the double hurdle model as an instrument for observed area under cultivation. We find that improved chickpea adoption significantly increases household income while also reducing household poverty. Finally, we disaggregate results by landholding to explore whether the impact of adoption has heterogeneous effects. Adoption favoured all but the largest landholders, for who the new technology did not have a significant impact on income. Overall, increasing access to improved chickpea appears a promising pathway for rural development in Ethiopia's chickpea growing regions.

We use data from household surveys of Mexican households during the income and price crises periods of 1994 to 1998 and 2006 to 2010. Our focus is on low-income Mexican households, those with the lowest 25% of expenditure per capita. There is little effect on calorie intake following an income decline in the short run. Once households are exposed to reduced incomes for a longer period, calorie intake falls. Households are able to weather short-term fluctuations in income by shifting consumption to food items that are cheaper per calorie, such as staple foods, by consuming more foods at home instead of outside the home, and by postponing expenditures on durable and semi-durable goods. When exposed to the income shock over a longer period of time, we posit that households are not able to defer durable and semi-durable purchases any more so their calorie consumption drops. Our results suggest that Mexican households may be able to sustain calorie intake when faced with an income shock, but it is less likely that they are able to do so if the income shock persists. The government may want to support poor constituents when they are faced with prolonged crises.","[Valero-Gil, Jorge] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Econ, Ave Lazaro Cardenas 4600 Ote, Monterrey 64930, NL, Mexico; [Valero, Magali] Univ Michigan, 19000 Hubbard Dr, Dearborn, MI 48126 USA",Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Valero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, 19000 Hubbard Dr, Dearborn, MI 48126 USA.",jorge.valerogl@uanl.edu.mx; mvalero@umich.edu,"Valero, Jorge/C-4118-2009; Valero, Jorge/N-1435-2019","Valero, Jorge/0000-0003-2294-5446; Valero, Jorge/0000-0003-2294-5446",,,,,44,1,2,2,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,APR,2018,76.0,,,,,,56,69,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.03.006,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GK5JW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436212400006,0

We account for official FMD status and for the impact of recent disease outbreaks. During and after a FMD outbreak, exporting countries substitute away from markets recognized as FMD-free toward lower value markets not recognized as FMD-free. Similarly, a country that has experienced BSE will export less to markets that have not experienced BSE and more to markets that have. Regaining official recognition of FMD-free status may aid recovery but does not negate the effects of a recent FMD outbreak. Models of FMD impacts should incorporate these market-switching effects, while analysis of FMD outbreaks should not focus solely on the loss of markets but rather should incorporate our finding that these loses are somewhat mitigated by market substitution. For countries not free of FMD, if the disease were to be eradicated an exporter should eventually be able to substitute towards higher value FMD-free markets. The value of this change in export market profile should be counted when considering the benefits of FMD eradication programs.","[Webb, Mike; Gibson, John; Strutt, Anna] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Waikato,"Gibson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Private Bag 3105, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",jkgibson@waikato.ac.nz,,,,,,,30,9,11,0,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,FEB,2018,75.0,,,,,,93,108,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.01.006,0.0,,,16,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GD8NQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430769600008,0

However, achieving that goal is challenging for smallholders given their lack of appropriate managerial practices, production technology and infrastructure. This paper examines the association between receiving trainings in two distinct entrepreneurial practices, one direct at the individual and farmer association level and another indirect at the community level, and commercialization in non-local markets at the extensive and intensive margins. We exploit a panel dataset of bean producers in Nicaragua that participated in an NGO program implemented between 2007 and 2012. We find opposite results for the two market-linkage activities, especially on the intensive margin or volume of sales. While reciving direct training on entrepreneurial practices (EP) is positively associated with commercialization, training on municipality engagement (ME) activities is negatively associated. These correlation patterns are mainly observed among entrant farmers as opposed to those already participating in commercial markets prior to the program implementation. We also find varying results for ME activities by plot size and leadership position. Additional estimations show that training activities that are positively correlated with bean commercialization are not necessarily correlated with the commercialization of other crops, and vice versa.","[Ebata, Ayako] Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England; [Hernandez, Manuel A.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Ebata, A (通讯作者)，Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",a.ebata@ids.ac.uk; m.a.hernandez@cgiar.org,,"Ebata, Ayako/0000-0001-8131-2759",,,,,51,11,12,3,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,DEC,2017,73.0,,,,,,34,44,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.09.003,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FP5MM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417663600004,0

There is limited research, however, on how national food and social programming support is perceived, received and used among Indigenous communities. We address this research gap by characterizing the preferred diet and coping mechanisms among Shawi Indigenous households, and investigating community perspectives on the national food program and national social supports. We used a mixed methods approach, including a quantitative survey among eleven Shawi communities in the Peruvian Amazon (n = 177 households), and semi-structured interviews with key informants (n = 24). We found that national food programs in Peru rarely provide foods that are desired and preferred among the Shawi, particularly familiar and locally-sourced protein sources such as bushmeat and fish. Food and social programming requirements do not integrate consideration of the remoteness of many vulnerable households, and are considered culturally or linguistically inaccessible to many families. In some cases, foods supplied by national programs are not consumed as they are perceived as unfamiliar. Key opportunities to improve food and social programing include: monitoring and revising eligibility requirements for remote and highly vulnerable households; increasing provision of locally-preferred protein food and familiar food types; avoiding use of written Spanish as a sole source of information to support programming; extending food provision outside of school months; developing contingency plans during education sector strikes; considering hiring of staff with working knowledge of local languages for community distributions; using visual or oral communication rather than written communication to increase accessibility of programs; increasing knowledge on the use and nutritional value of external food; and considering exemptions to school and health eligibility requirements during the rainy season and during sector strikes. Nationally-developed programming that does not consider Indigenous and cultural contexts risks inefficiency, limited improvement of health outcomes, and the potential to increase inequities in Indigenous health.","[Zavaleta, Carol; Berrang-Ford, Lea; Ford, James] McGill Univ, Geog Dept, Burnside Hall Bldg,Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A0B9, Canada; [Zavaleta, Carol; Llanos-Cuentas, Alejandro; Carcamo, Cesar; Silvera, Rosa] Univ Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Fac Salud Publ & Adm, SMP, Av Honorio Delgado 430, Lima 31, Peru; [Patterson, Kaitlin; Harper, Sherilee] Univ Guelph, Ontario Vet Coll, Dept Populat Med, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Marquis, Grace S.] McGill Univ, Sch Human Nutr, CINE Bldg,Macdonald Campus 21,111 Lokyshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada",McGill University; Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia; University of Guelph; McGill University,"Zavaleta, C (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Geog Dept, Burnside Hall Bldg,Room 705, Montreal, PQ H3A0B9, Canada.",Claudia.zavaleta@mail.mcgill.ca; lea.berrangford@mcgill.ca; alejandro.llanos.c@upch.pe; cesar.carcamo@upch.pe; james.ford@mcgill.ca; rosasilvera_nut@gmail.com; kaitlin.patterson@mail.mcgill.ca; grace.marquis@mcgill.ca; harpers@uoguelph.ca,"Silvera Ccallo, Rosa Mercedes/JKI-6459-2023; Ford, James/A-4284-2013","Silvera Ccallo, Rosa Mercedes/0000-0002-0362-560X; Ford, James/0000-0002-2066-3456; Llanos-Cuentas, Alejandro/0000-0002-7567-5534; Zavaleta, Carol/0000-0003-4969-8959; Patterson, Kaitlin/0000-0002-3444-0472",International Development Research Center (IDRC) of Canada's International Research Initiative on adaptation to Climate Change; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Global Health Research Capacity Strengthening Program (GHR-CAPS) from Canada,International Development Research Center (IDRC) of Canada's International Research Initiative on adaptation to Climate Change(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Global Health Research Capacity Strengthening Program (GHR-CAPS) from Canada,"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Shawi community members including authorities, research assistant and Guillermo Lancha, our field coordinator, for guiding us through their territory and nuances of their culture.

In countries where dietary surveys are scarce and rarely nationally representative, household budget surveys may serve as a useful alternative for assessing food consumption. The objective of this study was to evaluate how well household acquisition data reflects the actual intake of ultra-processed foods, using data from the 2008 to 2009 Brazilian Household Budget Survey. The food acquisition module was conducted for all households selected for the survey (n = 55,970) and a subsample corresponding to 25% of the households (n = 13,569) was randomly selected for the individual food intake module, which was conducted for all individuals aged 10 years or older (n = 34,003). Ultra-processed foods were defined as formulations made by the food industry mostly or entirely from substances extracted from foods or obtained with the further processing of constituents of foods or through chemical synthesis, with little if any whole food. Examples included candies, cookies, chips, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ready-to-eat dishes. Our results showed an important agreement between the estimates of ultra-processed food consumption obtained from household acquisition data and individual intake inside-the-home data, particularly for the relative (% of total energy) consumption of these foods. Our study thus indicates that household budget surveys are quite promising for tracking population-level changes in the consumption of ultra-processed foods. The trend toward increased consumption of food away from home in other low- and middle-income countries indicates that future household budget surveys should include the collection of these data.","[da Costa Louzada, Maria Laura; Steele, Euridice Martinez; Monteiro, Carlos Augusto] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Saude Publ, Dept Nutr, Av Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [da Costa Louzada, Maria Laura; Levy, Renata Bertazzi; Bortoletto Martins, Ana Paula; Claro, Rafael Moreira; Steele, Euridice Martinez; Monteiro, Carlos Augusto] Univ Sao Paulo, Nucleo Pesquisas Epidemiol Nutr & Saude, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Levy, Renata Bertazzi] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Dept Med Prevent, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Claro, Rafael Moreira] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Nutr, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Verly, Eliseu, Jr.] Univ Estado Rio de Janeiro, Inst Med Social, Dept Epidemiol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Cafiero, Carlo] United Nations Food & Agr Org, Stat Div, Rome, Italy",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Louzada, MLD (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Saude Publ, Dept Nutr, Av Dr Arnaldo 715, BR-01246907 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",maria.laura.louzada@gmail.com,"Claro, Rafael/F-8996-2012; Martins, Ana Paula Bortoletto/G-8807-2012; Verly, Eliseu/AFS-6374-2022; Louzada, Maria Laura/G-1851-2012; Levy, Renata Bertazzi/F-8931-2012; Monteiro, Carlos Augusto/F-9892-2012; Steele, Eurídice Martinez/AAP-9903-2021","Martins, Ana Paula Bortoletto/0000-0003-3560-4472; Louzada, Maria Laura/0000-0002-3756-2301; Levy, Renata Bertazzi/0000-0001-5388-7002; Monteiro, Carlos Augusto/0000-0002-3777-1533;",Sao Paulo Research Foundation [2015/25168-7]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [15/25168-7] Funding Source: FAPESP,Sao Paulo Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC)),M.L.C.

The benefit is computed from the marginal impact of the program's collective reputation on the individual reputation for sub-regions within Bordeaux. These different marginal impacts are estimated using detailed survey data about the image of Bordeaux wines in seven European countries. We find positive and significant spillover effects from the collective reputation (Bordeaux) that moreover increase with the reputation of the sub-region. These spillover effects, when significantly positive, vary from a minimum of 5% to a maximum of 15% of additional favorable quality opinions. We then calculate a measure of the average net benefits earned by producers from the regional promotion program in selected sub-regions within Bordeaux. Our results indicate that producers in some sub-regions are more likely to benefit from the promotion program and suggest that the current fee structure may not be properly aligned with market conditions.

Production diseases are particularly endemic in intensive production systems, and can negatively impact upon farm animal welfare. There is an increasing need to develop policies regarding animal production diseases, sustainable intensification, and animal welfare which incorporate consumer priorities as well as technical assessments of farm animal welfare. Consumers and/or citizens may have concerns about intensive production systems, and whether animal production disease represent a barrier to consumer acceptance of their increased use. There is a considerable body of research focused on consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for improved animal welfare. It is not clear how this relates specifically to a preference for reduced animal production disease incidence in animal production systems. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to establish the publics' WTP for farm animal welfare, with a focus on production diseases which arise in intensive systems. Systematic review methodology combined with data synthesis was applied to integrate existing knowledge regarding consumer WTP for animal welfare, and reduced incidence of animal production diseases. Multiple databases were searched to identify relevant studies. A screening process, using a set of predetermined inclusion criteria, identified 54 studies, with the strength of evidence and uncertainty for each study being assessed. A random effects meta-analysis was used to explore heterogeneity in relation to a number of factors, with a cumulative meta-analysis conducted to establish changes in WTP over time. The results indicated a small, positive WTP (0.63 standard deviations) for farm animal welfare varying in relation to a number of factors including animal type and region. Socio-demographic characteristics explained the most variation in the data. An evidence gap was highlighted in relation to reduced WTP for specific production diseases associated with the intensification of production, with only 4 of the 54 studies identified being related to this.

It develops a conceptual framework integrating the value chain concepts with agriculture and nutrition, and identifies key outcomes and requirements for value chains to be successful at delivering substantive and sustained consumption of nutrient dense foods by poor households. Other frameworks linking value chains with nutrition have been published, but this article provides the analytical lens to assess post-farm-gate value chains. To achieve improvements in the intake of nutritious foods by the target populations food must be: safe to eat on a sustained basis; nutrient dense at the point of consumption; and consumed in adequate amounts on a sustained basis. This shifts the focus to the role of public actions and policy in terms of shaping the functioning of food value chains. By assessing the limits of what business can and cannot contribute in a given market context, policy makers and other relevant stakeholders will be more capable of creating an appropriate institutional environment that shapes how value chains operate for the benefit of vulnerable target groups, designing and implementing effective policies and strategies with respect to the role and use of market-based interventions.

But what are the consequences for nutritional outcomes? The evidence to date has been scant and inconclusive. This study contributes to the debate by revisiting two prevailing wisdoms: (a) market participation by African smallholders remains low; and (b) the impact of commercialization on nutritional outcomes is generally positive. Using nationally representative data from three African countries, the analysis reveals high levels of commercialization by even the poorest and smallest landholders, with rates of market participation as high as 90%. Female farmers participate less, but tend to sell larger shares of their production, conditional on participation. Second, we find little evidence of a positive relationship between commercialization and nutritional status. As countries and international agencies prioritize the importance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture, better understanding of the transmission channels between crop choices and nutritional outcomes should remain a research priority.

This article aims to evaluate the overall effects of multi-dimensional interstate competitions on agricultural production, which is achieved using spatial production functions and model averaging methods. Using panel data, this article finds that interstate agricultural competition ought to be encouraged in the United States due to their positive impacts on spillovers and productivity but should be discouraged in China as it leads to negative spillovers and a decrease in productivity. Additionally, intrastate competition increases productivity in the United States but conversely decreases productivity in China. Other major drivers of productivity growth in the two countries are also found to vary, which provides evidence of a centrally planned system in China compared with the market system in the United States. U.S. agriculture enjoys the benefits of competition thanks to agricultural industrialization and a competitive market, while the planned system with government interference found in China has benefits as well as detriments.

This study explores whether and how dietary patterns of children within households changed over a four-year period in rural Nepal. Fixed-effects analysis of the panel data indicates that there were not disparities in dietary variability between girls and boys, but that there were disparities in dietary variability across age groups. Older children had slightly higher dietary diversity, and their diets were more likely to change as household diets changed, especially for animal sourced foods. For younger children, diets were less diverse but slightly more stable over time. This stability may protect younger children when household diets decline in quality, but younger children may be left out when household dietary quality improves. In contrast, older children reap more gains relative to younger children when household dietary quality improves, but would also bear the brunt of food shortages when they arise. These results emphasize the importance of examining differences in dietary quality within households across age groups, especially for children over five years of age who are less likely to be targeted by international nutrition interventions and programs.","[Finaret, A.

However, the implementation of multisectoral approaches presents tremendous challenges; one of the most often cited problems, in the literature and by practitioners, is coordination. This study investigates the perspectives of key national leaders on a range of issues regarding the coordination of a Multisectoral Action Plan for the Reduction of Chronic Undernutrition (PAMRDC) in Mozambique. Within this policy group, the principal researcher played the role of a researcher-participant for 14 months, and used Q methodology with a total of 21 key national leaders who had been actively engaged in coordination groups at the central level. Participants sorted 54 subjective statements on a range of issues that were present in the current national discourse. The results revealed four distinct perspectives. The Implementation perspective (n = 12) prioritized concrete actions to advance the operationalization of the plan, based on a guidance-based approach from the central level to the lower administrative levels. The Advocacy perspective (n = 3) emphasized advocacy to increase politicians' awareness of the problem and of potential solutions to enhance political commitment. The Structuralist perspective (n = 3) was concerned with the development of structures and mechanisms to facilitate coordination, funding and improving communication between the government and donors. The People-centered perspective (n = 3) focused on the importance of mobilizing individuals to compensate for the sub-optimal structures and processes for coordination. Areas of convergence across the perspectives included: low capacity and skills that limit the work; the agency in charge of coordination (SETSAN) should exercise an increased leadership to facilitate the multisectoral work; and SETSAN should advocate to mobilize politicians and donors for resources. Areas of divergence related to the type of guidance from national to sub-national levels (prescriptive or not) and the functions to be carried out by SETSAN. This study highlights lack of clarity on the meaning of coordination and on the functions of the multisectoral coordination body that appear to arise for two reasons: the lack of an explicit and shared framework for the policy process and the complex nature of coordination itself. These results are examined through the lenses of several related literatures, including governance, public policy and political economy of nutrition, leading to a three-dimensional conceptual framework for coordination that distinguishes the coordination space, forms, and instruments. Global guidance, such as provided through the SUN movement, could support countries in overcoming their coordination challenges by facilitating an analysis of their decision-making processes in order to choose the functions for the coordination body based on a shared understanding of countries' needs, context and opportunities. This paper moves the field beyond a broad consideration of horizontal and vertical coordination within multisectoral initiatives.

This also involves smallholder farmers in developing countries. While previous studies have looked at economic impacts of contract schemes on smallholder farmers, little is known about farmers' preferences for contracting in general, and for specific contract design attributes in particular. Better understanding farmers' preferences and constraints is important to make smallholder contract schemes more viable and beneficial. This article builds on a choice experiment to analyze farmers' preferences and preference heterogeneity for contracts in Kenya. In the study region, supermarkets use contracts to source fresh vegetables directly from preferred suppliers. However, farmer dropout rates are high. Mixed logit models are estimated to examine farmers' attitudes towards critical contract design attributes. Having to deliver their harvest to urban supermarkets is costly; hence farmers require a significant output price premium. Farmers also dislike delayed payments that are commonplace in contract schemes. The most problematic contract attribute is related to unpredictable product rejection rates, substantially adding to farmers' risk. Designing contracts with lower transaction costs, more transparent quality grading, and fairer risk sharing arrangements could enhance smallholder participation in supermarket procurement channels.

Food self-sufficiency is often presented in policy circles as the direct opposite of international trade in food, and is widely critiqued by economists as a misguided approach to food security that places political priorities ahead of economic efficiency. This paper takes a closer look at the concept of food self-sufficiency and makes the case that policy choice on this issue is far from a straightforward binary choice between the extremes of relying solely on homegrown food and a fully open trade policy for foodstuffs. It shows that in practice, food self-sufficiency is defined and measured in a number of different ways, and argues that a broader understanding of the concept opens up space for considering food self-sufficiency policy in relative terms, rather than as an either/or policy choice. Conceptualizing food self-sufficiency along a continuum may help to move the debate in a more productive direction, allowing for greater consideration of instances when the pursuit of policies to increase domestic food production may make sense both politically and economically.

We find that experimental measures of trust, risk and time preferences can predict preferences for contract attributes. Especially trust has economically important negative effects on the willingness to pay for high transparency in quality controls. Differences in preferences for timing of payment and timing of agreement making are partly explained by trust preferences and partly by time preferences. The importance of risk-sharing in form of lower quality grades accepted by the buyer increases with farmers' risk aversion, while risk preferences do not seem to be related to the timing of agreement making. Our results indicate that preferences affect farmers' participation constraints and argue that a diversification of contract offers might increase the willingness of farmers to participate in contract farming. This has implications for companies who aim at developing stable long-term relationships with farmers.","[Fischer, Sabine; Wollni, Meike] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Fischer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",sabine.fischer.econ@gmail.com; mwollni1@uni-goettingen.de,,"Wollni, Meike/0000-0002-8460-7840",German Research Foundation (DFG) [RTG 1666 GlobalFood],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"For helpful comments we thank Yasemin Boztug, Ossama Elshiewy, Eva Meemken, Emmanuel Peterle and David Wupper.

In the last decade, researchers and institutions have focused on designing sustainable school food procurements that include organic food. This study examines the public food procurement system in 524 of the 1554 municipalities of Lombardy in Northern Italy. A Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model is used to explore the factors affecting the initial adoption and the increase of organic food in PSFP at the regional level. Four sets of factors are investigated, including territorial indicators, market constraints, PSFP's management and governance and concern for local and certified origin products. The results show that the initial introduction of organic food correlates with higher population density and bigger farms in the area and strongly depends on pressure from municipal administrations and canteen committee for environmental sustainability and youth health. However, the introduction of organic food often must be driven by the initiative of catering service management and must take into account municipal policies to support the local production and certified origin products. Conversely, the adoption intensity increases when PSFP is managed by private companies and stakeholder pressure is strong, although the adoption intensity can be adversely affected by higher perceived costs of organic products when compared to conventional products. This analysis thus confirms the importance of the participation of local stakeholders in designing more sustainable PSFP. The analysis also provides local stakeholders with a systematic dataset at the regional scale regarding the factors that drive sustainable choices in PSFP. The analysis thus supports institutions and policy-makers in coordinating the alignment between food demand and supply in order to better address the sustainability.","[Filippini, Rosalia; Corsi, Stefano; Spigarolo, Roberto; Bocchi, Stefano] Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci Prod Landscape Agroenergy, Via Celoria 2, Milan, Italy; [De Noni, Ivan] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Method, Via Conservatorio 7, Milan, Italy",University of Milan; University of Milan,"Corsi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Agr & Environm Sci Prod Landscape Agroenergy, Via Celoria 2, Milan, Italy.",rosalia.filippini@unimi.it; ivan.denoni@unimi.it; stefano.corsi@unimi.it; roberto.spigarolo@unimi.it; stefano.bocchi@unimi.it,"Filippini, Rosalia/AAU-6791-2021; DE NONI, IVAN/AAF-2317-2021","Filippini, Rosalia/0000-0001-7949-6544; DE NONI, IVAN/0000-0001-8746-6572",Cariplo Foundation,Cariplo Foundation(Fondazione Cariplo),This work was supported by Cariplo Foundation in the framework of the project Bloregione,,58,36,36,2,63,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,APR,2018,76.0,,,,,,109,119,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.03.011,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GK5JW,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436212400010,0

The dynamics and implications of TSRs are discussed through an in-depth process study of the organization of a Swedish eco-label and the two TSRs of which this labeling organization has been a part of between 1985 and 2016. Using the theoretical concept hyper-organization, the article shows the development of four and five-fold organizational layers of control. Two implications of the hyper-organized TSRs are highlighted: (1) Public authorities play a much greater part in global food governance than previous research has acknowledged. The role of the state, in turn, has implications for how legitimacy and responsibility are sought. (2) In the complex organization of standards, certification and accreditation, responsibility is diffused and very hard to locate. Surprisingly, as the role of public authorities in TSRs becomes clearer and more articulate, the system grows more complex, making responsibility even harder to locate.","[Gustafsson, Ingrid] Score Stockholm Ctr Org Res, Frescativagen 14 A, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Hallstrom, Kristina Tamm] Score Stockholm Ctr Org Res, Stockholm Sch Econ, Frescativagen 14 A, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm School of Economics,"Gustafsson, I (通讯作者)，Score Stockholm Ctr Org Res, Frescativagen 14 A, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",ingrid.gustafsson@score.su.se; krth@score.su.se,,,Swedish Retail and Wholesale Council; Handelsbankens forskningsstiftelser; Swedish Research Council (VR) [2017-01284]; Formas [2017-01284] Funding Source: Formas; Swedish Research Council [2017-01284] Funding Source: Swedish Research Council,Swedish Retail and Wholesale Council; Handelsbankens forskningsstiftelser; Swedish Research Council (VR)(Swedish Research Council); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"The authors would like to thank the Swedish Retail and Wholesale Council for funding the study of KRAV (2012-2014), Handelsbankens forskningsstiftelser for funding both scholars within the project The (im)possible independence (2017-2019) and to The Swedish Research Council (VR) for generously funding the research project Who is watching the watchdog?

While shocks could lower the competence and capacity of households to adopt new agricultural innovations, households can also take-up agricultural innovations as a coping mechanism against the different shocks they face. Using a nationally representative household data from Ethiopia of the Living Standards Measurement Study Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (ISMS-ISA) of the World Bank, this paper analyzes the effect of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks on adoption of different agricultural innovations, assuming interdependence among the innovations. We find shocks to have heterogeneous effects on the adoption of agricultural innovations. Specifically, production and health shocks have negative effects on the adoption of high -cost innovations such as improved seeds, chemical fertilizer, and irrigation. However, production shocks are positively associated with low-cost innovations such as organic fertilizer. To enhance farmers' adoption of agricultural innovations, especially high -cost innovations, there is a greater need towards the design of policies and interventions that would reduce household's exposure to production and health shocks.","[Gebremariam, Gebrelibanos] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Dept Econ & Technol Change, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Tesfaye, Wondimagegn] United Nations Univ, Maastricht Econ & Social Res Inst Innovat & Tech, MERIT, Boschstr 24, NL-6211 AX Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Bonn; Maastricht University,"Gebremariam, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Dept Econ & Technol Change, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",g.gebremedhin@gmail.com; tesfaye@merit.unu.edu,,"Gebremariam, Gebrelibanos/0000-0001-8277-9027",,,,,67,38,39,6,61,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,154,161,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.12.010,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400015,0

A growing body of literature has analyzed the welfare effects, with mixed results. Yet, there are important knowledge gaps. First, most existing studies have looked at the effects of one standard in one country. When comparing between studies it is unclear whether dissimilar outcomes are the result of different standards or different local conditions. Second, most studies have used cross-section data, so that selectivity issues remain a challenge. Third, existing work has primarily analyzed effects in terms of purely economic indicators, such as prices and income, ignoring other dimensions of household welfare. We address these shortcomings using panel data from small-scale coffee producers in Uganda and comparing the effects of two of the most popular sustainability standards, namely Organic and Fairtrade. Welfare effects are analyzed in terms of household expenditures, child education, and nutrition. Results show that Organic and Fairtrade both have positive effects on total consumption expenditures. However, notable differences are observed in terms of the other outcomes. Organic contributes to improved nutrition but has no effect on education. For Fairtrade it is exactly the other way around. We explore the mechanisms behind these differences.","[Meemken, Eva-Marie; Qaim, Matin] Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Spielman, David J.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Gottingen; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Meemken, EM (通讯作者)，Heinrich Dueler Weg 12, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",emeemke@uni-goettingen.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; Meemken, Eva-Marie/0000-0001-9854-4150",German Research Foundation (DFG) through the GlobalFood Program,German Research Foundation (DFG) through the GlobalFood Program(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) through the GlobalFood Program.

We developed a policy analysis framework using existing literature and applied the framework to three Nepalese policies: Nepal's Multisectoral Nutrition Plan (MSNP) 2013-2017, Agricultural Development Strategy (ADS) 2015-2035 and National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) 2014-2020. Each policy was coded independently by two researchers to examine whether the different components of the sustainable diets framework were mentioned and if they had associated policy actions. We then used a health policy analysis tool to examine the overall quality of each policy. The ADS mentioned the most (89%) components of the sustainable diets framework as compared to the NBSAP (58%) and the MSNP (70%). If all three policies were fully implemented they would address all but one of the components of a sustainable diet, with the potential to deliver for health and the environment. However, there was a lack of clarity regarding how the resources to accomplish the policy objectives would be obtained as well as insufficient detail regarding the policies' monitoring and evaluation frameworks. The sustainable diets framework developed in this study enables the identification of gaps where policies need to broaden their focus in order to incorporate a more holistic view of the food system. This will become increasingly important as climate change continues to persist and the need for more resilient food systems becomes more recognized. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

But what exactly do we know? This study systematically measures seasonal price gaps at 193 markets for 13 food commodities in seven African countries. It shows that the commonly used dummy variable or moving average deviation methods to estimate the seasonal gap can yield substantial upward bias. This can be partially circumvented using trigonometric and saw tooth models, which are more parsimonious. Among staple crops, seasonality is highest for maize (33 percent on average) and lowest for rice (161/2 percent). This is two and a half to three times larger than in the international reference markets. Seasonality varies substantially across market places but maize is the only crop in which there are important systematic country effects. Malawi, where maize is the main staple, emerges as exhibiting the most acute seasonal differences. Reaching the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger requires renewed policy attention to seasonality in food prices and consumption. (C) 2016 The World Bank.

This paper focuses on one hybrid experimental session that mixed one voluntary contributions mechanism (VCM), influencing the indemnity received by participants, and one mechanism eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for milk bottles with public and private attributes. The VCM shows relatively high levels of contributions that are mainly influenced by the positive expectations of participants about the average group contribution, rather than by the variations in the design of this mechanism and the period of experiments. The WTP for milk bottles are particularly sensitive to the order of mechanisms and to the period of experiments. Conversely, the WTP differences between milk bottles for a given round of information are invariant across the order of mechanisms and the period of experiments. For each bottle, the variations of WTP coming from the messages about private and public attributes are also stable over the order of mechanisms and the period of experiments. This confers validity to experiments for measuring WTP for public and private attributes related to food. In other words, these variations of WTP contribute to welfare estimates and are useful to evaluate market regulations focusing on public and/or private attributes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to explore how nutrition indicators vary by data collection period (number of days of household consumption data available) using the 2010 Bangladesh HIES. Household availability and individual apparent consumption of nutrients, foods, and food groups were estimated for each of 7 consecutive 2-day recall periods, both separately and in combinations representing 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 days of data. Differences among cumulative data collection periods in mean apparent nutrient consumption and proportion with low values were statistically significant but small (< 4 percentage points), suggesting that a data collection period of one week or less would yield the same conclusions as a longer (and more costly) data collection period of 14 days for these outcomes if the recall period were held constant. For all food groups except staple foods, the proportion of households consuming food groups and selected potentially fortified foods increased, and the mean amount consumed among consumers (the 'conditional mean') decreased with longer data collection periods; this observation is likely related to frequency of consumption and suggests that the choice of data collection period for these items will be determined by the intended application.

We analyze weather-induced changes in wheat yield volatility as a systemic weather risk in Germany. We disentangle, however, the relative impacts of inputs and weather on regional yield volatility. For this purpose we augment a production function with phenologically aggregated weather variables. Increasing volatility can be traced back to weather changes only in some regions. On average, inputs explain 49% of the total actual wheat yield volatility, while weather explains 43%. Models with only weather variables deliver biased but reasonable approximations for climate impact research. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, we summarize the estimated magnitudes of losses, evaluate the methodologies used to generate those estimates, and explore the dearth of thoughtful assessment around optimal PHL levels. Third, we synthesize and critique the impact evaluation literature around on-farm and off-farm interventions expected to deliver PHL reduction. Fourth, we suggest a suite of other approaches to advancing these same objectives, some of which may prove more cost-effective. Finally, we conclude with a summary of main points.

In some circles, the relevant reforms are controversial. On the basis of nationally representative online surveys, we examine whether Europeans favour such nudges. The simplest answer is that majorities in six European nations (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and the UK) do so. We find majority approval for a series of nudges, including educational messages in movie theaters, calorie and warning labels, store placement promoting healthier food, sweet-free supermarket cashiers and meat-free days in cafeterias. At the same time, we find somewhat lower approval rates in Hungary and Denmark. An implication for policymakers is that citizens are highly likely to support health nudges. An implication for further research is the importance of identifying the reasons for cross-national differences, where they exist. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Trade has also reduced manufacturing wages in high income countries and made entire industries uncompetitive in some communities, giving rise to nationalist politics that seek to stop or reverse further trade expansion in the United States and Europe. Given complex and uncertain political support for trade, how might changes in trade policy affect the global food system's ability to adapt to climate change? Here we argue that we can best understand food security in a changing climate as a double exposure: the exposure of people and processes to both economic and climate-related shocks and stressors. Trade can help us adapt to climate change, or not. If trade restrictions proliferate, double exposure to both a rapidly changing climate and volatile markets will likely jeopardize the food security of millions. A changing climate will present both opportunities and challenges for the global food system, and adapting to its many impacts will affect food availability, food access, food utilization and food security stability for the poorest people across the world. Global trade can continue to play a central role in assuring that global food system adapts to a changing climate. This potential will only be realized, however, if trade is managed in ways that maximize the benefits of broadened access to new markets while minimizing the risks of increased exposure to international competition and market volatility. For regions like Africa, for example, enhanced transportation networks combined with greater national reserves of cash and enhanced social safety nets could reduce the impact of 'double exposure' on food security.

Random nth-price auctions are used to elicit WTP after subjects received one of five randomly assigned information treatments. We find large information effects, including asymmetric cross-market effects for natural and organic foods. Perhaps surprising is that organic premiums increase in response to subjects seeing the natural foods industry's perspective on its products. Demographics effects are also important.

Due to the elevated level of emotions during the conflict, the study used a qualitative research approach based on 34 in-depth interviews. The analysis uncovered the interlocking patterns of simplification and emotionalization by the smaller association and rationalizing by the larger association. Results indicate how an active opponent can use policy changes to its advantage and how to prevent such a development.

Acceptance varied considerably among different interventions; the least intrusive (i.e., a front-of-package label on products highlighting the sugar content and public health campaigns) garnered the most support, while more restrictive interventions (i.e., taxation, substitution with artificial sweeteners, and the reduction of portion sizes) generated higher resistance. Sugar consciousness and diet-related health consciousness were the strongest predictors of acceptance. Support was stronger among women, dieters, residents from the French-speaking areas of Switzerland, and people living in urban areas. Certain risk groups including overweight participants and those consuming higher amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages were more strongly opposed to these kinds of interventions.

This paper analyzes the retail price dynamics of organic, GMO-free, and conventional milk after the introduction of GMO-free labeling in Germany. Using weekly data of the GfK consumer home scan, data from German milk sales in the early period of its introduction in 2009 and 2010 were analyzed in a vector error correction model. The results indicated that cointegrating relations exist among prices of conventional, organic, and GMO-free milk. Long-term adjustment parameters indicated that deviations from equilibrium are corrected. According to the results, German dairy companies may successfully defend their price differentials due to adjustments existing between the prices of GMO-free and organic milk.","[Dolgopolova, Irina; Roosen, Jutta] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Management, Chair Mkt & Consumer Res, Alte Akad 16, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Dolgopolova, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Sch Management, Chair Mkt & Consumer Res, Alte Akad 16, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",irina.dolgopolova@tum.de,"Dolgopolova, Irina/AAA-6849-2019; Roosen, Jutta/AAN-2079-2021","Roosen, Jutta/0000-0002-3032-399X",,,,,21,6,6,1,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JUL,2018,78.0,,,,SI,,51,57,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.02.006,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GP6BA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440960700006,0

While tractor ownership is often associated with greater RTS in agriculture, whether the tractor ownership actually causes such increase in RTS has not been formally tested in the literature. We bridge this knowledge gap, using a unique survey data of tractor owning farm households in Ghana. We find that owning tractors significantly increases the RTS in maize production on the households' largest mono-cropped plot, and weakens inverse-relationship between land productivity and farm size. This is partly achieved through the rise in the RTS in tillage production (the amount of tillage conducted), rather than the RTS in maize production given a fixed amount of tillage produced. These sets of evidence are obtained by addressing jointly the multiple sources of endogeneity of tractor ownership, tractor values, tillage production, and other inputs used.","[Takeshima, Hiroyuki; Diao, Xinshen] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Houssou, Nazaire] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Ghana Off, CSIR Campus,PMB CT 112, Accra, Ghana",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Takeshima, H (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",H.takeshima@cgiar.org,"Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAO-3212-2021; Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAN-6611-2021","Takeshima, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1761-408X","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM); CGIAR Fund Donors; United States Agency for International Development Food Security Policy (FSP) project; Syngenta Foundation; Japanese Government; IFPRI's Ghana Strategy Support Program","CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR); United States Agency for International Development Food Security Policy (FSP) project(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Syngenta Foundation(Syngenta); Japanese Government; IFPRI's Ghana Strategy Support Program","We would like to thank Shashidhara Kolavalli and Yanyan Liu for providing constructive comments on this paper.

An accurate understanding of consumption economies of scale is vital for comparing poverty levels across households of varying size. Using Sri Lankan data on home-grown food consumption, we empirically confirm that such economies of scale exist and that large households tend to consume relatively more home-grown food than smaller households. The magnitude of these scale economies are found to be larger than those in market purchased food, but smaller than those found in housing expenditure. Consuming more home-grown food is also found to be positively correlated with per-capita calories consumed. Taking these effects into account in poverty estimates leads to a 15 per cent decline in the number of household who fall below the poverty line in rural regions.","[Jayasinghe, Maneka; Smith, Christine] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 9111, Australia; [Chai, Andreas; Ratnasiri, Shyama] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Chai, A (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia.",maneka.jayasinghe@griffithuni.edu.au; a.chai@griffith.edu.au; s.ratnasiri@griffith.edu.au; christine.smith@griffith.edu.au,"Jayasinghe, Maneka Savithri/AAP-3527-2020; Ratnasiri, Shyama/AAP-9863-2021","Jayasinghe, Maneka Savithri/0000-0002-3613-4073; Ratnasiri, Shyama/0000-0002-9295-4076; Chai, Andreas/0000-0003-0838-9324",,,,,68,7,7,3,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,DEC,2017,73.0,,,,,,62,74,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.09.005,0.0,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FP5MM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417663600006,0

The study is based on primary data collected from six high milk producing districts that captures the geographical and institutional diversity of milk production. Results show that the status of farm level compliance with FSM is not very encouraging. Also, the intensity of adoption of FSM exhibits significant inter- and intra-district variations. It varies positively with herd size but the additional cost of compliance with FSM varies negatively with herd size. Among other determinants, access to information, and incidence of inspection for conformity with safety and quality standards are also associated with higher adoption of FSM. Finally, we also estimate the impact of FSM on farm-gate prices and farmers' profits and conduct several robustness checks. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Within this approach, we estimate how respondents' money- and health-consciousness affects their WTP for bread containing GMOs. Our findings are consistent with previous studies of Russian consumer preferences, who find that Russian consumers' food purchases are often motivated by health concerns and the naturalness of foods. Our results indicate that information-seeking health-conscious consumers tend to be less likely to purchase GM foods, while more money-conscious consumers are more likely to purchase the GM product.

However, non-GMO labeling requires compliance with the national public non-GMO production standard, including a confirmation that no GM feed was used. In addition to the national standard, firms can adopt a private collaborative certification standard set by a multi-stakeholder organization. Using a survey of German dairies, we show that firms with more suppliers were more likely to adopt the multi-stakeholder standard or to stay conventional if their perceived risk of reputation loss and liability issues for non-GMO production were higher. Firms with lower perceived risks were more likely to comply only with the public standard for non-GMO labeling (i.e., not adopt the private standard). We discuss how potential incongruent interests of the various stakeholders that set the private production and certification standard may have incentivized firms to adopt the non-GMO standard in the initial phase after the introduction of the labeling option.","[Venus, Thomas J.] Tech Univ Munich, Agr Prod & Resource Econ Grp, Alte Akad 14, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Drabik, Dusan; Wesseler, Justus] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Technical University of Munich; Wageningen University & Research,"Venus, TJ (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Agr Prod & Resource Econ Grp, Alte Akad 14, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",Thomas.Venus@tum.de; Dusan.Drabik@wur.nl; Justus.Wesseler@wur.nl,"Venus, Thomas J./ABD-9634-2020; Wesseler, Justus/H-5347-2016","Venus, Thomas J./0000-0002-8902-8020;",European Union's Seventh Framework programme (FP7/2007-2013) [KBBE-2011-5-289157],European Union's Seventh Framework programme (FP7/2007-2013)(European Union (EU)),We thank two anonymous referees and the Special Issue Editor Jill McCluskey for their constructive comments.

OBR production, however, is highly susceptible to weather and pest risks. This study investigates the impact of smallholders' perceived production risks on their adoption of CF in OBR farming. We also assess the impact of CF in OBR production on yields, prices received, and the livelihood of OBR producers. We use farm-level data from smallholder organic basmati rice farms in India and the endogenous switching regression method to account for heterogeneity. Although CF in OBR led to lower yields, it increased the prices producers received and improved the livelihood of OBR producers. The impact of CF varied with farmers' revealed risk attitudes. Risk-loving OBR growers with CF experienced the highest loss in yields, and risk averse OBR growers with CF received the highest prices. We find that the OBR growers who did not adopt CF would benefit from adopting it, regardless of their risk attitudes, especially when it comes to prices received and livelihood.","[Mishra, Ashok K.; D'Souza, Alwin] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Kumar, Anjani; Joshi, Pramod K.; Tripathi, Gaurav] IFPRI, New Delhi, India",Arizona State University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Mishra, AK (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",ashok.k.mishra@asu.edu; adsouza3@asu.edu,"Kumar, Anjani/AGO-6128-2022; Dsouza, Alwin/J-6922-2019; Dsouza, Alwin/AAM-1870-2020; Kumar, Anjani/AAP-3673-2020","Dsouza, Alwin/0000-0003-3461-9736; Dsouza, Alwin/0000-0003-3461-9736;",,,,,51,50,54,1,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,FEB,2018,75.0,,,,,,147,157,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.01.007,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GD8NQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430769600012,0

Most of the ideas proposed to this point involve either behavioral nudges or administrative regulations that are either too paternalistic or piecemeal to represent viable solutions. In this study, we investigate the potential for commercial peer-to-peer mutualization systems (CPMSs), or sharing-economy firms, to emerge as market platforms for the exchange of surplus food. If a system of CPMSs is able to develop in a self-sustaining way, then the market prices they create will generate sufficient incentives for all actors to manage surplus food more efficiently. We develop an empirical model of a CPMS operating as a platform in a two-sided market, and examine its viability using data from one of the first CPMS firms in the surplus-harvest industry, Imperfect Produce, Inc. Empirical estimates of a two-sided network demand model show that user-demand rises in the number of growers shipping to the platform, and grower demand for distribution rises in the number of users. Our findings indicate that secondary markets have the key elements needed for CPMS success, and that policy tools designed to facilitate transactions in secondary markets can be highly effective in reducing food waste.","[Richards, Timothy J.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Hamilton, Stephen F.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, Econ Dept, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Richards, TJ (通讯作者)，7231 E,Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",trichards@asu.edu,"An, Hongda/GNH-4090-2022","Richards, Timothy/0000-0001-8832-9609","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (National Institute for Food and Agriculture, USDA) [2016-09900]","Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (National Institute for Food and Agriculture, USDA)","Funding from Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (National Institute for Food and Agriculture, USDA) Grant No. 2016-09900 is gratefully acknowledged.",,72,43,54,5,55,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,FEB,2018,75.0,,,,,,109,123,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.01.008,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GD8NQ,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430769600009,0

As a case study, we assessed the impacts of the diets of a representative sample of Dutch consumers (age 18-75 y, n = 1242). The health impact of their diets was assessed using the Dutch Healthy Diet-index (DHD) and the environmental impact by greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs). As expected, a significant negative correlation was found between DHD and the GHGEs, indicating that health and sustainability can, to some extent, be improved in synergy with one another. Looking at population subgroups, (young) employed males were identified as an important target group (lowest DHD and highest GHGEs). Four food groups and energy were observed of which a reduced intake makes a diet healthier and more environmentally sustainable: meat, energy, cheese, snacks (cakes, pastry, biscuits, salted and fried snacks, potato chips), and alcohol. Besides, three food groups were observed of which an increased intake makes a diet healthier, but less environmentally sustainable when they do not replace other food groups: fruit, fish, and vegetables. Based on real-life differences in dietary patterns, four transition strategies were formulated that can raise the DHD and lower GHGEs: (I) Replacing snacks with fruit, especially between meals, (II) Replacing cheese with vegetables, during lunch as well as dinner, (III) Partly replacing meat with fish, (IV) Lowering the total energy intake, through reducing the consumption of alcoholic drinks. If deriving the highest environmental gain is the purpose of dietary adjustment, then halving the portions of meat consumed is a strategy (V). Actual unsustainable diet practices of specific subgroups require dedicated transition strategies. The study provides in-sights into the opportunities for improving both health and environmental sustainability scores of different population subgroups and underlines that these cannot be successfully achieved by adopting a single strategy.","[van Dooren, C.] Netherlands Nutr Ctr, Voedingsctr, The Hague, Netherlands; [Keuchenius, C.] Motivact Res & Strategy, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [de Vries, J.

Mandatory labeling of products like genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) is subject to controversy and political debate. The exact outcome depends on the specific public decision-making process (direct vote by the public vs. voting by representatives), the political power distribution among groups, and the workings of legislative and regulatory processes. This paper presents a conceptual framework to assess the welfare implications of labeling decisions that are decided by political processes. We identify conditions under which there are gains from mandatory labeling compared to no labeling, and find that the gain from passing a mandatory labeling proposition is larger if the voluntary labeling option is not available. The conclusions suggest that when mandatory labeling is not feasible politically, promoters of labeling will introduce voluntary labeling. The paper uses the results of this conceptual framework to analyze different case studies of labeling propositions, including Proposition 37 that was voted on in California in 2012. The findings suggest that labeling decisions may evolve with new scientific knowledge, new information technologies, and changing attitudes.","[Zilberman, David; Kaplan, Scott; Gordon, Ben] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Zilberman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",zilber11@berkeley.edu,,"Kaplan, Scott/0000-0002-5492-4693",,,,,43,16,18,1,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JUL,2018,78.0,,,,SI,,6,13,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.02.008,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GP6BA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440960700002,0

We fmd that health consciousness has a higher positive influence on organic food identity with higher levels of all four investigated personal values. When openness to change is low, health consciousness has a positive effect on intentional organic food behavior through organic food identity, whereas social consciousness has a negative effect on intentional organic food behavior through organic food identity.

The legislation, now known as Public Law 114-216, also preempts states from setting their own standards for mandatory GE labels. This article discusses the implementation of the new law and its potential economic consequences. We conclude that PL 114-216 is worse than a complete absence of mandatory labeling laws. However, it should be better than the likely scenario of policies that it pre-empted, and could be reasonably inexpensive, depending on the implementation details of the new law which are yet to be determined and how producers and consumers choose to respond to it.","[Bovay, John] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Alston, Julian M.] Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Connecticut; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Bovay, J (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",john.bovay@uconn.edu; julian@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,46,28,37,2,61,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JUL,2018,78.0,,,,SI,,14,25,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.02.013,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GP6BA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440960700003,0

Our analysis is based on survey data collected in 2015 among 625 apple growing farm households in the provinces Shaanxi and Shandong. We employ endogenous switching probit models to deal with potential endogeneity of membership in estimating the determinants of marketing channel choices. We find that cooperative membership has a positive impact on selling to wholesalers and a negative impact on selling to small dealers, but no significant impact on selling to the cooperative itself. As products sold through cooperatives generally comply with relatively stringent food quality and safety standards, these results imply that policies promoting cooperative members to sell their products through cooperatives are likely to have a significant impact on food quality and food safety in China.","[Hao, Jinghui; Gardebroek, Cornelis; Heijman, Wim] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Bijman, Jos] Wageningen Univ, Management Studies Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Heerink, Nico] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Huo, Xuexi] Northwest A&F Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Yangling, Peoples R China",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research; Northwest A&F University - China,"Hao, JH (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands.",jinghui.hao@wur.nl,"Heerink, Nico/AAA-2045-2020; Huo, Xuexi/GPG-3739-2022; Bijman, Jos/C-2929-2015","Heerink, Nico/0000-0002-9911-3501; Huo, Xuexi/0000-0002-8263-9101; Bijman, Jos/0000-0001-9143-7870",Netherlands Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO); Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) through the Joint Scientific Thematic Research Programme (JSTP) [833.13.003],Netherlands Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) through the Joint Scientific Thematic Research Programme (JSTP),"Part of the research was funded through a grant provided by the Netherlands Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO) and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) through the Joint Scientific Thematic Research Programme (JSTP), dossier number 833.13.003.",,59,84,92,13,129,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,53,64,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.11.004,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400005,0

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of this problem in the case of Niger. The paper assesses the impact of three methods of food data collection on the welfare distribution, and poverty and inequality measures in Niger. The study leverages a food consumption experiment to evaluate the three methods of food data collection implemented in the country's most recent national household surveys. The first method was 7-day recall, the second was usual month, and the third was 7-day diary. The study finds that there was a large difference in measures of consumption and poverty between the first two methods (which yielded similar results) and the 7-day diary method. Annual per capita consumption from the 7-day recall method was, on average, 28 percent higher than that from the 7-day diary method. This gap exists not only at the mean of the distribution, but at every level. The observed differences in measured annual per capita consumption leads to differences in poverty and inequality measures even when alternate poverty lines are used.","[Backiny-Yetna, Prospere; Steele, Diane; Djima, Ismael Yacoubou] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Living Stand Measurement Study, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Backiny-Yetna, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Living Stand Measurement Study, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",pbackinyyetna@worldbank.org; dsteele@worldbank.org; iyacouboudjima@worldbank.org,,"Yacoubou Djima, Ismael/0000-0002-0476-2569",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation),"The authors would like to thank Alberto Zezza, Dean Jolliffe, two anonymous referees, and seminar participants at the World Bank for comments.

Gender systems, however, are diverse and complex. The nature and extent of gender inequity and the conditions necessary to empower women vary across countries, communities and regions. The study of different gender systems is thus fundamental to capture cross-cultural variations in gender specific needs and constraints to effectively address gender gaps. Although the status of women in agriculture has received extensive attention in the literature in recent decades, a research gap persists regarding the state of gender inequity in Southeast Asian agriculture. The current paper contributes to the geographical scope of the literature by presenting empirical evidence of gender inequity from four Southeast Asian countries: Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Using the framework recommended by the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAL), 37 focus group discussions were conducted with 290 women farmers in the above mentioned countries. The results reveal trends that contradict the conventional narratives of gender inequity in agriculture in certain domains of empowerment. In all four countries, women appear to have equal access to productive resources such as land and inputs, and greater control over household income than men. Important intra-regional heterogeneity is observed in terms of community-level empowerment. While women play an active role in agricultural groups in Thailand and in the Philippines, this is predominantly men's territory in Indonesia and Myanmar. These findings imply that country-specific gender intervention frameworks are necessary to overcome gender gaps in agriculture. (C) 2017 The Authors.

New measures of agro-ecological potential and urban gravity are developed to analyze their impact on population density and market access. The descriptive and regression analyses show that the patterns of intensification across countries are only partially consistent with the BR predictions. Fallow areas have disappeared, but cropping intensities remain very low. The use of organic and chemical fertilizers is too low to maintain soil fertility. Investments in irrigation are inadequate.

To assess the reliability of future strategies to reduce and manage FL along the food supply chain (FSC), not only their quantification but also the 'qualification' in both economic and nutritional terms must be considered. The methodology proposed in this work allows to quantify FL at the distinct stages of the FSC (agricultural production, postharvest and storage, processing, distribution, households and extradomestic consumption). In addition, economic and nutritional FL are estimated. A Nutritional Food Losses Footprint (NFLF) index is proposed to assess and balance the variables described. This index is used to define food recovery strategies focused on those food categories and stages of the FSC with lesser efficiency. NFLF distinguishes between food losses from cradle to gate (FL-ctog) and food losses from gate to grave (FL-gtog) depending on the scope of the analysis. The former provides information to producers, while the latter creates awareness among consumers. Furthermore, the potential for FL reduction is estimated through the quantification of avoidable and unavoidable FL. Our study is focused on the Mediterranean region, in particular on Spain. Almost 20% of the national food production is estimated to be lost or wasted. Vegetables, fruits and meat result the food categories less efficient. Household consumption is the main responsible of FL generation, followed by agricultural production. Each Spanish citizen is estimated to throw away around 180(sic) per year, while a 76% could be saved.","[Garcia-Herrero, I; Hoehn, D.; Margallo, M.; Laso, J.; Gonzalez, M. J.; Dura, M.

We make the argument that despite the centralized nature of practices, the manner in which inclusion takes place can vary significantly depending on structural features of local networks and governance factors, especially social capital and the role of lead organisations. Social network analysis allows us to investigate how different patterns of bonding, bridging and centrality of key actors in agricultural clusters can influence diffusion of knowledge. We frame this discussion through a typology that allows us to identify diverse scenarios of inclusion of small producers.

Taxing less healthy foods and subsidizing healthy foods as a strategy to improve diet and health has attracted growing interest among policy makers and researchers. We test this strategy by using national household purchase data to estimate a censored, price and expenditure endogenous demand system for 12 food groups that are commonly consumed at breakfast: low- and high-nutrition ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, eggs, breads, hot cereals, breakfast bars, juice, whole and reduced-fat milk, yogurt, meats, and coffee. The estimated demand elasticities are applied to nationally representative food intake data to simulate under the assumption of perfectly price elastic supply the potential dietary improvement from taxing low-nutrition and subsidizing high nutrition ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. We find that the demand for both types of cereals is own price inelastic, suggesting that consumers are not likely to make large shifts in consumption of cereals if the price changes. Thus only limited dietary improvement can be expected from taxes and subsidies. Furthermore, when the healthfulness of breakfast foods is evaluated using a comprehensive list of nutrients and food components, a price intervention strategy may result in unintended, adverse impacts. Our simulation results suggest that the hypothetical price intervention actually increases the calorie content of foods consumed at breakfast.

Such interventions face unique challenges in addressing the diets of SNAP recipients. First, current law prohibits differential treatment of SNAP recipients and other grocery store customers. Thus, the nudges cannot narrowly target those participating in SNAP. Second, SNAP participants make the majority of their qualifying purchases in grocery stores which are already heavily loaded with behavioral nudges. Not only must nudges compete for attention within the store, but they must be at least weakly beneficial to the store owner. We discuss examples that demonstrate the possibility of meeting these seemingly strict criteria, and the potential for using such nudge interventions as a part of SNAP.","[Just, David R.; Gabrielyan, Gnel] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Just, DR (通讯作者)，210C Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",drj3@cornell.edu,"Just, David R/K-7302-2012",,,,,,142,17,24,3,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,309,317,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.03.003,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500028,0

Existing research shows that use of mobile phones has improved smallholder farmers' market access and income. Beyond income, mobile phones can possibly affect other dimensions of social welfare, such as gender equality and nutrition. Such broader social welfare effects have hardly been analyzed up till now. Here, we address this research gap, using panel data from smallholder farm households in Uganda. Regression results show that mobile phone use is positively associated with household income, women empowerment, food security, and dietary quality. These results also hold after controlling for possible confounding factors. In addition to the household level analysis, we also look at who within the household actually uses mobile phones. Gender-disaggregation suggests that female mobile phone use has stronger positive associations with social welfare than if males alone use mobile phones. We cautiously conclude that equal access to mobile phones cannot only foster economic development, but can also contribute to gender equality, food security, and broader social development. Further research is required to corroborate the findings and analyze the underlying causal mechanisms.","[Sekabira, Haruna; Qaim, Matin] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Sekabira, H (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",haruna_sekabira@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Qaim, Matin/P-4489-2016","Qaim, Matin/0000-0003-4143-0763; SEKABIRA, HARUNA/0000-0001-5675-7211",German Research Foundation (DFG) [RTG 1666]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),This research was financially supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the GlobalFood Program (RTG 1666).

Previous findings on the prevalence and severity of food insecurity are inconsistent and often depend on the measure used. To overcome limitations in food security measurement, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations developed the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, which is the first survey protocol to measure people's direct experience of food insecurity on a global scale. Using this new measure, our study contributes to the understanding of the food insecure by examining the determinants of food insecurity within and across countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Using a series of multilevel linear models, we find the three determinants associated with the largest increase in the likelihood of experiencing food insecurity in LAC are: low levels of education, limited social capital, and living in a country with low GDP per capita. Results suggest the need to promote education of the most vulnerable, encourage social interactions that help build individuals' social capital, and adopt gender-sensitive programs. The results also suggest the need for a shift in policy from short-term strategies to long-term efforts that sustain household productive capacity and employment to promote sustained economic growth.

Yet few studies have examined retailer participation in contracts or agreements with suppliers of energy-dense, high-sugar, and high-fat foods and beverages. Given that these agreements may influence the placement and promotion of unhealthy products, this study aimed to: (a) describe incentive-based agreements between food/beverage suppliers and small food store retailers, including monetary value of incentives; (b) assess retailers' perceptions of these agreements, including issues related to importance and profitability. Both qualitative (open-ended) and structured interviews were conducted with 72 managers of small stores in four sites: Durham, NC; Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN; and San Diego, CA. Interviews focused on incentivized agreements with suppliers of candy, salty snacks, sweet snacks, sugary beverages and frozen desserts. On average, retailers had 1-2 agreements per product category (range 0-5). For candy, salty snacks and sweet snacks, median one-time, lump-sum incentives were valued at $100-$120 for each product category, in contrast to $2000 for sugary beverages. Incentives included product displays, free/discounted products, marketing materials, and slotting payments/fees. Perceived advantages of agreements included rebates and suppliers' support for product merchandizing, while disadvantages included minimum purchasing and product placement requirements. Retailers had mixed opinions about whether these incentives significantly contributed to profits overall. In summary, understanding the nature of these agreements and the ways in which they influence retailers' decision making could be valuable in advancing efforts to partner with retailers and improve the healthfulness of food environments.","[Laska, Melissa N.; Sindberg, Lesley Schmidt] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Epidemiol & Community Hlth, Minneapolis, MN 55454 USA; [Ayala, Guadalupe X.] San Diego State Univ, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Ayala, Guadalupe X.; Horton, Lucy A.; Olson, Christina] Inst Behav & Community Hlth, San Diego, CA USA; [D'Angelo, Heather; Ribisl, Kurt M.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Behav, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Kharmats, Anna; Gittelsohn, Joel] Johns Hopkins Univ, Global Obes Prevent Ctr, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Olson, Christina] San Diego State Univ, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Promot & Behav Sci, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [D'Angelo, Heather] Univ Wisconsin, Carbone Canc Ctr, Madison, WI USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Laska, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, 1300 South 2nd St,WBOB Suite 300, Minneapolis, MN 55454 USA.",mnlaska@umn.edu,"Ribisl, Kurt M/C-4867-2015; D'Angelo, Heather/W-5315-2019; D'Angelo, Heather/AAV-6132-2021; Kharmats, Anna/G-5678-2017","Cunningham, Lucy/0000-0002-8486-0264; Kharmats, Anna/0000-0002-9384-7344; Laska, Melissa/0000-0002-3836-0269",,,,,36,15,18,1,23,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,324,330,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.03.001,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500030,0

For the analysis we implement scenarios with a carbon tax on non-CO2 emissions and trade liberalization both individually and combined in CAPRI, a global partial equilibrium model for agriculture. Scenario results indicate that the simulated trade liberalization by itself has only modest effects on agricultural GHG emissions by 2030. Pricing agricultural non-CO2 emissions in the EU triggers the adoption of mitigation technologies, which contributes to emission reductions. Emission leakage, however, partially offsets the EU emission savings as production increases in less emission-efficient regions in the world. The combination of agricultural trade liberalization and carbon pricing increases emission leakage and, therefore, further undermines global mitigation gains. Our results hinge on the key assumptions that future trade agreements between non-EU countries are not considered and that the climate actions are limited to the EU only. Despite these limitations we conclude that, from a global GHG mitigation perspective, trade agreements should address emission leakage, for instance by being conditional on participating nations adopting measures directed towards GHG mitigation.","[Himics, Mihaly; Fellmann, Thomas; Barreiro-Hurle, Jesus; Dominguez, Ignacio Perez] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Himics, Mihaly] Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Jansson, Torbjorn] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Witzke, Heinz-Peter] EuroCARE Bonn GmbH, Buntspechtweg 22, D-53123 Bonn, Germany; [Weiss, Franz] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy",University of Bonn; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Himics, M (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",mihaly.himics@ec.europa.eu; thomas.fellmann@ec.europa.eu; jesus.barreiro-hurle@ec.europa.eu; peter.witzke@eurocare-bonn.de; ignacio.perez-dominguez@ec.europa.eu; torbjorn.jansson@slu.se; franz.weiss@ec.europa.eu,"Perez, Ignacio/B-3718-2018; barreiro-hurle, jesus/A-7042-2008","Perez, Ignacio/0000-0002-0279-6263; barreiro-hurle, jesus/0000-0002-6422-6047; Fellmann, Thomas/0000-0002-4798-329X; Himics, Mihaly/0000-0003-3923-9898; Jansson, Torbjorn/0000-0002-1005-5676",FTA,FTA,"Notwithstanding the above caveats, our paper provides an unambiguous message, as it points to the importance of designing future FTAs in the framework of national determined contributions (NDCs) within the Paris Agreement, assuring that mitigation efforts are not undermined in sectors where trade is forecasted to increase the most.

First, we estimate the determinants of adoption by applying a multivariate panel data model capturing their complementarities and/or substitutabilities. Second, after testing for their potential endogeneity, we study the impact of these practices (and combinations of them) on maize productivity controlling for weather shocks. Finally, we disaggregate results by presence/absence of seasonal rainfall and temperature shocks to explore the heterogeneous impact of adoption under weather shocks. We find strong complementarities between agricultural practices both in terms of adoption and yield impacts. Long-run variability in rainfall decreases the adoption of organic fertilizers and increases that of improved seeds. Farmers in areas where the cropping season's rainfall has been highly variable and temperature has been unexpectedly high have significantly lower maize yields. SWC emerges as one of the most important practices in increasing yields with significant benefits by itself, in combination with other practices, under average weather conditions as well as under rainfall and temperature shocks. Overall, increasing the adoption of SWC appears a promising policy option to buffer food security from increasingly frequent weather shocks in Tanzania. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

High food prices, low incomes, and limited access to nutritious perishable foods foster increased reliance on poor quality non-perishable foods. In northern Canada, Inuit experience food insecurity at over eight times the rate of the general Canadian population. This study aims to contribute to the evidence-base for informing food policy in remote northern communities by documenting food prices and investigating the economic dimensions of diet quality and nutrition in one region of Arctic Canada. A participatory food costing study was undertaken seasonally in six communities of the western Canadian Arctic during a 14-month period (late 2014 to early 2016). Community research assistants systematically collected food prices for a list of 106 market foods. Food prices in the region were markedly higher than the national average. The average cost of the Revised Northern Food Basket (to feed a family of four for one week) was CAD $410, over two times the equivalent cost of feeding a family of four in the capital city of Ottawa (CAD $192). Results from this study also provide evidence of significant price differentials between energy-dense nutrient-poor foods, and costlier nutrient-rich foods. Evidenced-based policy is needed to overcome the unique challenges of food retailing in remote northern environments. Such policies must be pursued with due recognition of community priorities and self-determination, and pursued in parallel to initiatives that enhance access to traditional (country) food.","[Kenny, Tiff-Annie; Chan, Hing Man] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Fillion, Myriam] Univ TELUQ, Dept Sci & Technol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [MacLean, Jullian] Inuvialuit Reg Corp, Inuvik, NT, Canada; [Wesche, Sonia D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ; University of Ottawa,"Chan, HM (通讯作者)，Gendron Hall,Room 180,30 Marie Currie, Ottawa, ON K1N 9A7, Canada.",Laurie.Chan@uOttawa.ca,,"Wesche, Sonia/0000-0002-8300-954X; Fillion, Myriam/0000-0002-7776-4039; Chan, Laurie/0000-0003-4351-7483; Kenny, Tiff-Annie/0000-0001-9688-6149",ArcticNet,ArcticNet,"We wish foremost to recognize and extend our appreciation to the community research assistants whose diligent work was instrumental to the realization of this project.

However, widespread adoption of recycled water by agriculture will depend on consumers' acceptance of food crops grown with this water. In a revealed-preference dichotomous-choice framed field experiment, this study elicits consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for fresh produce irrigated with recycled water. It also evaluates consumers' behavioral responses to information about benefits and potential risks of recycled irrigation water. The results suggest that consumers are less willing to pay for produce irrigated with recycled water than for produce irrigated with water of an unspecified type. Information about potential risks associated with recycled water reduces consumers' WTP by nearly 50% while information about its environmental benefits does not have a substantial impact. However, a behavioral intervention that presents individuals with a balanced information treatment leads to a 30% increase in mean WTP for produce irrigated with recycled water relative to the experimental control. However, this effect is only found with vegetables and not with fruit, perhaps because fruit is usually consumed raw. Most of the demographic characteristics analyzed in the experiment did not influence consumers' likelihood of purchasing produce irrigated with recycled water; the exception was presence of a child in the household-those consumers were less likely to purchase produce, particularly fruits, irrigated with recycled water. Finally, consumers experience welfare gains from a labeling policy that provides information about the use of recycled irrigation water.","[Savchenko, Olesya M.; Messer, Kent D.; Xu, Huidong] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Kecinski, Maik] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Li, Tongzhe] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON, Canada",University of Delaware; University of Alberta; University of Windsor,"Messer, KD (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 226 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",messer@udel.edu,"Messer, Kent/AAK-8811-2020",,USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture [20166800725064]; USDA Economic Research Service [59-6000-4-0064]; Center for Behavioral and Experimental Agri -Environmental Research (CBEAR),USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture; USDA Economic Research Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Center for Behavioral and Experimental Agri -Environmental Research (CBEAR),"Funding support for this research was provided by the USDA National Institute for Food and Agriculture (grant number: 20166800725064), that established CONSERVE: A Center of Excellence at the Nexus of Sustainable Water Reuse, Food and Health; the USDA Economic Research Service (grant number: 59-6000-4-0064), and the Center for Behavioral and Experimental Agri -Environmental Research (CBEAR).

In Nairobi, Kenya, the expansion of supermarkets has advanced much more compared to many other African cities with the Kenyan Government strongly promoting the retail modernization. In this study, we assess the impact of the pursued retail modernization on urban food access. The study reveals the limitations of using the supermarketization as a market solution to urban food insecurity. Supermarkets increase food access mainly for the higher income - and already food secure - consumers in the city, while the poor and food insecure are largely excluded from patronizing supermarkets and rely on the informal market. The study concludes by suggesting that food policies must embrace a new conceptualization of the food retail sector in which both formal and informal retailers coexist. Such more holistic food policies that stem from a food systems perspective are needed to build an inclusive urban food system that can tackle prevalent food insecurity in Nairobi. Although the research focused on Nairobi, the findings are of broader relevance to urban centers in the global South.","[Berger, Mira] Fac Geosci, Sustainable Dev Studies, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Helvoirt, Bram] Fac Geosci, Int Dev Studies, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Berger, M (通讯作者)，Fac Geosci, Sustainable Dev Studies, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",mira.t.berger@gmail.com; b.j.vanhelvoirt@uu.nl,,"Berger, Mira/0000-0003-4733-596X",,,,,86,20,27,1,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,12,22,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.04.004,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500002,0

Therefore if the voluntary moratorium on these foods were to end, consumers would be uncertain which items were products of cloned animals. This study examined consumer willingness to accept (WTA) milk that may or may not have come from cloned cows to judge the market impact of this policy. Non-hypothetical field experiments at four diverse locations were conducted to determine the amount consumers would require to switch from a cup of conventional milk to one with potentially cloned cow milk. Nearly a third of participants submitted the maximum request of $5, indicating a complete unwillingness to switch, while another quarter requested no compensation. Tobit model results showed opinions, attitudes, and shopping habits highly influenced consumers' WTA. Accompanying survey results found a neutral opinion and low knowledge of cloning, but strong support for labeling despite being informed of the FDA conclusions. Given these findings, in the absence of policy changes voluntary labeling of milk as not being from cloned cows could be a likely future outcome.","[Britwum, Kofi] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Winslow Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Bernard, John C.] Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 213 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Delaware,"Bernard, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, 213 Townsend Hall, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",kbritwum@udel.edu; jbernard@udel.edu,"Bernard, John C/A-5230-2008","Bernard, John C/0000-0001-7522-3194; Britwum, Kofi/0000-0002-3357-7506",Applied Economics and Statistics Department of the University of Delaware,Applied Economics and Statistics Department of the University of Delaware,The authors are grateful to the Applied Economics and Statistics Department of the University of Delaware for providing funding for the study.,,36,8,9,0,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.10.006,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400001,0

This variation may confound welfare comparisons in part because these alternative survey designs produce consumption estimates differentially influenced by contrasting types of survey response error. While previous studies have documented the extent of net error in alternative survey designs, little is known about the relative influence of the different response errors that underpin a survey estimate. This study leverages a recent randomized food consumption survey experiment in Tanzania to shed light on the relative influence of these various error types. The observed deviation of measured household consumption from a benchmark is decomposed into item-specific consumption incidence and consumption value so as to investigate effects related to (a) the omission of any consumption and then (b) the error in value reporting conditional on positive consumption. Results show that various survey designs exhibit widely differing error decompositions and hence a simple summary comparison of the total recorded consumption across surveys will obscure specific error patterns and inhibit lessons for improved consumption survey design. In light of these findings, the relative performance of common survey designs are discussed and design lessons are drawn in order to enhance the accuracy of item specific consumption reporting and, consequently, measures of total household food consumption.","[Friedman, Jed; Beegle, Kathleen] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [De Weerdt, Joachim] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium; [De Weerdt, Joachim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Gibson, John] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand",The World Bank; University of Antwerp; KU Leuven; University of Waikato,"Friedman, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",jfriedman@worldbank.org,"Friedman, Jed/AAA-1326-2020","De Weerdt, Joachim/0000-0002-5572-3332",,,,,23,20,22,1,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2017,72.0,,,,SI,,94,111,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.016,0.0,,,18,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FM3EX,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414888200010,0

The TCE framework is used in two different empirical models. The first distinguishes between the adoption of alternative governance forms including spot markets, hybrids, vertical integration and also considers the simultaneous and parallel adoption of these forms in plural forms. The second model focuses on plural forms and investigates their composition using hypotheses developed from TCE. Data was collected through a survey including 150 companies operating in the EU soybean supply chain. Companies range from international traders to retailers of 15 EU countries, representing a truly unique dataset of information. TCE framework proved significant to explain how the introduction of non-GMO standards has impacted the governance of the supply chain. However, TCE reasoning only offers partial explanation regarding the composition of plural form of governance, which is also the most frequently observed followed by pure hybrid choice, spot market, and vertical integration. Results also show that the supply chain is structured differently across its different stages, with vertical integration being rarely observed except at the retailer stage. Surprisingly, spot market transactions are still frequently observed despite the adoption of non-GMO standards.","[Ghozzi, Houda] HEC Carthage, ECSTRA, Tunis, Tunisia; [Platoni, Silvia] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy; [Tillie, Pascal] European Commiss, JRC, Directorate Sustainable Resources, Seville, Spain; [Soregaroli, Claudio] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Econ Agroalimentare, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Soregaroli, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Econ Agroalimentare, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy.",houda.ghozzi@msb.tn; silvia.platoni@unicatt.it; pascal.tillie@ec.europa.eu; claudio.soregaroli@unicatt.it,"SOREGAROLI, Claudio/AAB-3263-2021; Soregaroli, Claudio/JGL-9826-2023","SOREGAROLI, Claudio/0000-0003-0903-6352;",,,,,65,7,8,0,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JUL,2018,78.0,,,,SI,,68,80,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.02.011,0.0,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GP6BA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440960700008,0

Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture. We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers. We find that the program had substantial impacts on plantain revenue and production, while achieving nearly complete irrigation coverage of plantain land among beneficiaries.

We are the first to leverage the USDA's Farm to School Census to analyze factors associated with FTS participation, the types of FTS activities implemented, and the challenges faced by participating school districts. Because a school's participation is circumscribed by access to local foods, we control for the supply of local foods. We use spatially articulate data to estimate the spatial spillover effects of FTS participation. The results demonstrate that both school characteristics and local farm production factors are associated with FTS participation. The estimated spatial spillover effect is positive suggesting that areas with a high penetration of FTS activities have lower barriers associated with implementing FTS programs.","[Botkins, Elizabeth R.] US FDA, 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA; [Roe, Brian E.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Agr Environm & Dev Econ, 2120 Fyffe Rd, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Botkins, ER (通讯作者)，US FDA, 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA.",elizabeth.botkins@fda.hhs.gov; roe.30@osu.edu,"Roe, Brian E/A-7386-2009",,"USDA's National Institute of Food Agriculture [2014-67023-21810]; McCormick Program in Agricultural Marketing and Policy; Van Bums Program in Farm Management; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; NIFA [2014-67023-21810, 687618] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA's National Institute of Food Agriculture; McCormick Program in Agricultural Marketing and Policy; Van Bums Program in Farm Management; Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),This work was supported by the USDA's National Institute of Food & Agriculture grant 2014-67023-21810; the McCormick Program in Agricultural Marketing and Policy; the Van Bums Program in Farm Management; and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.

We find nutrition-sensitive aid can reduce undernourishment. Estimates suggest that a 10% increase in overall nutrition-sensitive aid would approximately decrease hunger by 1.1% 2 years later on average. Among nutrition sensitive aid inflows, we find that emergency food aid reduces hunger a year later and that food aid is more effective than emergency food aid at reducing medium-term hunger. A 10% increase in food aid per capita would result in a 1.3% decrease in hunger 3 years later on average, against 1% for a similar increase in emergency food aid per capita. Generally, the size of the aid effects on hunger depend on the time horizon considered in the empirical analysis. Our findings provide supporting evidence for the prioritization of specific nutrition-sensitive investments within the SDG agenda, while simultaneously challenging the relative reallocation of nutrition sensitive aid that has reduced the role of food and emergency food aid inflows.","[Mary, Sebastien] Depaul Univ, Driehaus Coll Business, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Saravia-Matus, Silvia] FAO, Santiago, Chile; [Gomez y Paloma, Sergio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Seville, Spain",DePaul University; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Mary, S (通讯作者)，Depaul Univ, Driehaus Coll Business, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",smary@depaul.edu; silvia.saraviamatus@fao.org; Sergio.gomez-y-paloma@ec.europa.eu,"Saravia-Matus, Silvia L./W-5437-2018","Saravia-Matus, Silvia L./0000-0003-3314-8661",,,,,65,15,17,2,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,100,116,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.11.008,0.0,,,17,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400009,0
J,"Fiedler, JL; Yadav, S",,,,"Fiedler, John L.; Yadav, Suryakant",,,How can can we better capture food away from Home? Lessons from India's linking person-level meal and household-level food data,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Household surveys; Measurement error; Questionnaire design; Food away from home; Dietary assessment; Food security assessment,DEMAND,"Despite acknowledged shortcomings, household consumption and expenditure surveys (HCES) are increasingly being used to proxy food consumption because they are relatively more available and affordable than surveys using more precise dietary assessment methods. One of the most common, significant sources of HCES measurement error is their under-estimation of food away from home (FAFH). In 2011, India's National Survey Sample Organization introduced revisions in its HCES questionnaire that included replacing cooked meals the single item in the food consumption module designed to capture FAFH at the household level with five more detailed and explicitly FAFH sub-categories. The survey also contained a section with seven, household member-specific questions about meal patterns during the reference period and included three sources of meals away from home (MAFH) that overlapped three of the new FAFH categories. By providing a conceptual framework with which to organize and consider each household member's meal pattern throughout the reference period, and breaking down the recalling (or estimating) process into household member-specific responses, we assume the MAFH approach makes the key respondent's task less memory- and arithmetically-demanding, and thus more accurate than the FAFH household level approach. We use the MAFH estimates as a reference point, and approximate one portion of FAFH measurement error as the differences in MAFH and FAFH estimates. The MAFH estimates reveal marked heterogeneity in intra-household meal patterns, reflecting the complexity of the HCES's key informant task of reporting household level data, and underscoring its importance as a source of measurement error. We find the household level-based estimates of FAFH increase from just 60.4% of the individual-based estimates in the round prior to the questionnaire modifications to 96.7% after the changes. We conclude that the MFAH-FAFH linked approach substantially reduced FAFH measurement error in India. The approach has wider applicability in global efforts to improve HCES.","[Fiedler, John L.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, Int Dietary Data Expans INDDEX Project, 2006 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Yadav, Suryakant] IIPS, Dept Dev Studies, Mumbai 88, Maharashtra, India",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); International Institute for Population Sciences,"Fiedler, JL (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, Int Dietary Data Expans INDDEX Project, 2006 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",J.Fiedler@cgiar.org; suryakant11@gmail.com,"Yadav, Suryakant/O-3907-2016","Yadav, Suryakant/0000-0003-1579-9524",,,,,30,18,23,0,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2017,72.0,,,,SI,,81,93,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.015,0.0,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FM3EX,29093609.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414888200009,0

By utilizing a legitimacy strategy framework and conducting 19 semi-structured interviews with actors and experts in the Dutch edible insect sector, we assess the sector's progress and limitations with regard to its legitimacy journey. The findings show that sector focus has thus far been on organization, intraindustry, and interindustry legitimacy strategies, and that additional emphasis on institutional strategies will be imperative to securing more accommodating legislation. In addition, the lack of a common vision, a strategic communication plan, and interfirm linkages may also be hindering sector legitimation.

It uses the nationally representative two-wave Integrated Household Panel Survey (IHPS) data of 2010 and 2013. The results suggest that subsidised fertilizer on average increases farmers' maize market participation as sellers, total quantity of maize sold, and maize commercialisation. In addition, participation in subsidised fertilizer programme is found to increase the probability of farmers to be net sellers and increases net quantity of maize sold. However, the study finds no evidence of effect on net quantity of maize bought and on household maize self-sufficiency. These results suggest that the farm input subsidy programme has contributed toward an increased level of maize market supply engagement for small farmers and in this sense, the policy has the potential to provide the wider external benefits. Furthermore, the results have implication on the sustainability of the subsidy programme, policy formulation and design of programmes for the agricultural sector and small farmers in developing countries.

A recent study from Ethiopia revealed that, while all age groups consumed calories in proportion to their fair share, iron and protein were inequitably allocated among household members. Further exploration of individual and household characteristics associated with these allocation patterns is necessary to gain a more complete understanding of existing disparities. Objective: This paper sought to quantify energy, protein, and iron allocation inequity between four age and sex groups of household members (children and adults) commonly assumed to be disadvantaged versus preferentially treated in intra-household resource distribution. It then sought to identify individual and household factors that explained the inequity of intra-household nutrient allocation among these paired groups. Methods: Data from a survey of 1185 households located in rural Oromiya and SNNPR regions of Ethiopia. A single quantitative 24-hour household-level dietary recall was collected from the primary food preparer who reported the proportion of household food distributed to each household member. Continuous ratios of relative calorie, protein, and iron adequacy for four pairs of age-sex groups (any child vs. any adult, any child vs. adult male, female child vs. male child, and adult female vs. adult male) in the household were computed and compared, along with a binary indicator of inequity. Logistic regressions and standard linear regression with Huber-White heteroseedasticity-adjusted standard errors were run to determine the predictors of household inequity for each pair-group and nutrient, on the full sample as well as on nutrient inadequate households. Results: Common assumptions about inequitable distribution of nutrients within households were not consistently supported by this analysis. Significant intra-household nutrient inequities did exist in these rural Ethiopian households for certain nutrients, but household subgroups commonly presumed to be nutritionally vulnerable in the Ethiopian context were not always affected by detrimental inequity. Generally, household inequity favored children over adults or adult males, and female children over male children for protein consumption. Inequities were greatest against presumed vulnerable groups (adult women, children) for 'invisible' nutrients (iron) rather than calories or protein. There were relatively few households in which one of the interest groups (groups presumed vulnerable) experienced inequitable nutrient allocation and nutrient inadequacy. The number of households where inequity was present for a subgroup who also experienced nutrient inadequacy while the reference group (group presumed to be preferred) was nutrient adequate was negligible, suggesting that in very few of these household are there members who are haves, benefiting nutritionally to the nutritional detriment of have nots. The analysis of determinants did not reveal any single, consistent set of factors driving decisions across all pair groups and nutrients, but these factors were not substantially different for households that were and were not nutrient adequate. Household dependency ratio, higher relative male education, female household headship, and women's decision-making power provided mixed results for pairwise comparisons. Conclusions: The variable pattern of nutrient inequities underscores the risk of overlooking intra-household nutrient allocation disparity or making assumptions about a particular infra-household food and nutrient distribution pattern in any context where programs are intended to benefit particular household members.","[Coates, Jennifer; Rogers, Beatrice Lorge] Tufts Univ, Gerald J & Dorothy R Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Poli, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Patenaude, Bryan N.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Int Hlth, Hlth Syst Program, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Roba, Alemzewed Challa] Hawassa Univ, Sch Nutr Food Sci & Technol, Hawassa, Ethiopia; [Woldetensay, Yitbarek Kidane] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Biol Chem & Nutr 140a, Stuttgart, Germany; [Tilahun, Addisalem Fikre] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Spielman, Kathryn L.] Populat Council, 4301 Connecticut Ave NW,Suite 280, Washington, DC 20008 USA",Tufts University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Hawassa University; University Hohenheim; Tufts University; Population Council,"Coates, J (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Gerald J & Dorothy R Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Poli, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",Jennifer.coates@tufts.edu; bnp706@mail.harvard.edu; beatrice.rogers@tufts.edu; alemzewed.challa2011@gmail.com; yitbarek.woldetensay@gmail.com; faddis22@gmail.com; kspielman@popcouncil.org,,"Patenaude, Bryan/0000-0002-5180-3626",American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-663-A-11-00017],American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),The authors would like to acknowledge Meghan Kershaw for her assistance in managing the data collection and Dr. Beyene Wondafrash for his role in helping to plan and oversee data collection.

We make novel contributions to the literature by employing a recently developed selectivity corrected stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to address possible self-selection biases stemming from both observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that TE for co-operative members ranges from 79 to 86 per cent and that for non-members ranges from 74 to 84 per cent, depending on how biases are controlled. In addition, the efficiency levels of both members and non-members of cooperatives appear to be underestimated if the selectivity bias is not appropriately addressed. Our findings conclude that the average TE is consistently higher for cooperative members relative to their counterparts, highlighting the positive role of contemporary agricultural cooperatives in promoting efficient usage of production inputs.","[Ma, Wanglin; Renwick, Alan; Ratna, Nazmun] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Yuan, Peng] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Rural Dev Inst, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China",Lincoln University - New Zealand; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Ma, WL (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, Christchurch, New Zealand.;Ma, WL (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Fac Agribusiness & Commerce, Dept Global Value Chains & Trade, POB 85084, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.",Wanglin.Ma@lincoln.ac.nz; Alan.Renwick@lincoln.ac.nz; yuanp@cass.org.cn; Nazmun.Ratna@lincoln.ac.nz,"Ma, Wanglin/M-7744-2019; Renwick, Alan/AAS-6588-2021; Ratna, Nazmun/W-3606-2018","Ma, Wanglin/0000-0001-7847-8459; Ratna, Nazmun/0000-0002-7565-2834; Renwick, Alan/0000-0002-4756-5709",National Natural Science Foundation of China Project [71333011],National Natural Science Foundation of China Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their invaluable comments and suggestions.

Evidence from case studies and agricultural location theory suggest so, but urban heterogeneity has not yet been found in a common economic test of functioning agricultural markets the separability result. The test is based on a key insight of the agricultural household model, which finds that a farm's profit should be maximized independently from household utility given perfect factor markets (i.e., separability), but not so if the household faces at least two market failures (i.e., non-separability). In this paper, I test for geographic heterogeneity in separability between rural, peri-urban, and urban districts using 2014-15 data from the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study and Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) from Tanzania. I find strong evidence that the correlation between pre-harvest labor demand and household size implying non-separability in rural areas is significantly weaker in three of Tanzania's five largest cities: Dar es Salaam, Arusha, and Mbeya. Given certain assumptions, this can be interpreted as evidence of increased agricultural market functionality around these cities relative to rural areas. Overall, these results contribute to the debate on how to achieve urban food security in SSA and give some validity to agricultural location theory and the separability test as tools to help policymakers characterize the nature of agricultural factor markets.","[Allen, James E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Allen, James E.] Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, 611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Allen, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, 611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Allen, JE (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Gerald R Ford Sch Publ Policy, 611 Tappan Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",alleniv@umich.edu,,"Allen, James/0000-0002-3084-7785",,,,,52,2,4,1,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,199,212,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.07.005,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500018,0

Some African countries, such as Ghana, managed to utilize rapid growth for poverty reduction and improving food and nutrition security. Transformation of agriculture appears to have played an important role in this context. However, the linkages between agricultural transformation and food and nutrition security at the household level are not well understood. This article examines the linkage between farm production diversity and household dietary diversity in rural Ghana and how that linkage changed between 2005-06 and 2012-13. The empirical analysis employs a regression model that controls for region- and time-fixed effects. The estimation results suggest that farm production diversification, as well as household income growth, continues to be strongly associated with increased household dietary diversity. The analysis further explores the mechanism that underlies this production-consumption linkage by systematically modifying the basic model specification.","[Ecker, Olivier] Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Ecker, O (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",o.ecker@cgiar.org,,"Ecker, Olivier/0000-0001-7549-2511","IFPRI's Ghana Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets","IFPRI's Ghana Strategy Support Program; United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets(CGIAR)","I am very thankful to several colleagues and former colleagues at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).

Post-harvest Losses (PHL) reduction has been identified as a key component to complement efforts to address food security challenges and improve farm incomes, especially for the rural poor. This study analyses the role of recommended post-harvest handling practices in PHL reduction; and conducts a cost-benefit analysis of adopting practices associated with lower losses. The study finds that maize farmers lose about 11.7 percent of their harvest in the post-harvest system. About two-thirds of this loss occurs during storage. The study shows that adoption of recommended post-harvest handling practices is highly correlated with lower PHL. Lastly the study finds that the cost of implementing some of the recommended practices outweighs the benefits associated with lower PHL. It then discusses the reasons why some farmers may not adopt some of the practices and points out some contributions to the literature.","[Chegere, Martin Julius] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Chegere, Martin Julius] Univ Dar es Salaam, Dept Econ, Box 35045, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania",University of Gothenburg; University of Dar es Salaam,"Chegere, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Box 640, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.;Chegere, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Dar es Salaam, Dept Econ, Box 35045, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.",chegeremartin@gmail.com,"Chegere, Martin/ABE-7888-2020","Chegere, Martin/0000-0003-2798-5199",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"I gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).

John Stuart Mill, in contrast, predicted that the threat of scarcity creates incentives for innovation that help to avoid some of the worst outcomes. Popular claims of marine ecologists often apply the Malthusian narrative to supplies of seafood, yet global supplies have continued to grow. We examine the modern seafood industry and evaluate Mill's claims about innovation. We argue that the mechanisms that Mill discusses-innovation in response to and in anticipation of scarcity-account for much of what we see. Scarcities induce technological, policy, and market innovations that enable seafood supplies to grow, and these innovations can build on each other. The challenge for policy makers is to avoid knee-jerk responses to Malthusian narratives and craft policy responses that encourage innovation while recognizing physical limits of ocean resources.","[Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger; Duke University; Duke University,"Smith, MD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Box 90328, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",marsmith@duke.edu,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728","Norwegian Research Council [233689, 233751, CT-267572]",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"For helpful comments and suggestions, the authors thank Spencer Banzhaf, an anonymous reviewer, and participants at the 2016 EfD Annual Meeting in Pucon, Chile and at the 2017 NAAFE Forum in La Paz, Mexico.

Surprisingly, the majority of household surveys have not kept up with its pace and still collect limited information on it. The implications for poverty and inequality measurement are far from clear, and the direction of the impact cannot be established a priori. This paper exploits rich data on food away from home collected as part of the National Household Survey in Peru, to shed light on the extent to which welfare measures differ depending on whether food away from home is accounted for or not. Peru is a relevant context, with the average Peruvian household spending over a quarter of their food budget on food away from home since 2010. The analysis indicates that failure to account for this consumption has important implications for poverty and inequality measures as well as the understanding of who the poor are. First, accounting for food away from home results in extreme poverty rates that are 18 percent higher and moderate poverty rates that are 16 percent lower. These results are also consistent, in fact more pronounced, with poverty gap and severity measures. Second, consumption inequality measured by the Gini coefficient decreases by 1.3 points when food away from home is included - a significant reduction. Finally, the inclusion of food away from home results in a reclassification of households across poor/non-poor status - 20 percent of the poor are different, resulting in small but significant differences in the profile of the poor in dimensions such as demographics, education, and labor market characteristics. Taken together, the results indicate that a serious rethinking of how to deal with the consumption of food away from home in measuring well-being is urgently needed to properly estimate and understand poverty around the world.","[Farfan, Gabriela; Genoni, Maria Eugenia; Vakis, Renos] World Bank, 1818H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Farfán, G (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gfarfan@worldbank.org,,,World Bank's KCP window; FAO through Global Strategy for Improving Agricultural and Rural Statistics initiative,World Bank's KCP window; FAO through Global Strategy for Improving Agricultural and Rural Statistics initiative,"We are grateful to colleagues at the National Statistics Office (INEI) in Peru, and especially Nancy Hidalgo, Lucia Gaslac, and Oscar Perfecto for their countless help and advice during the data preparation and analysis.

The practice of gleaning offers a mechanism for combining these problems to create a synergistic solution. We develop a stochastic optimization model to determine the schedule that maximizes the volume of excess crops rescued from farm fields for the purpose of feeding food-insecure households, thus maximizing social impact. We model gleaning as a service operation where donation calls arrive randomly requesting to be scheduled within a limited time window. The feature that distinguishes gleaning operations from other service settings is that there is uncertainty in both when donations will arrive and the attendance of the gleaners who are volunteers that are not obliged to attend gleaning trips. We apply our model to the gleaning operation of the Food Bank of the Southern Tier in New York State, focusing on five major crops produced in the region. By characterizing how the gleaning, operation behaves, our model allows us to optimize the gleaning schedule to maximize the expected total volume gleaned and determine under which conditions different operational strategies can be most useful for improving the performance of the gleaning operation. This in turn enables us to identify conditions under which alternative policy interventions (e.g., farm donation tax credits and government grants to strengthen operational capacity) are more effective for scaling up gleaning programs.

In this paper, we use cluster analysis to identify distinct consumer segments in Rwanda for four biofortified iron bean varieties. Data on consumer liking of various sensory attributes of beans was collected by using a 7-point hedonic scale through the application of home-use and central location tests implemented in two rural and two urban locations. Cluster analysis reveals the existence of several distinct consumer segments in each one of the four study locations. Further analysis is conducted by using multinomial probit and logit models to predict consumer segment membership based on the consumer characteristics. Results reveal that, depending on the location, consumer's source of income and whether or not they received information about nutritional benefits of the iron bean varieties have a bearing on their preference of these varieties.

We estimate the income effects of wage employment on large-scale farms in the horticultural export sector in Senegal, using data from two survey rounds covering a seven-years period of rapid expansion of the sector. We estimate average income effects as well as heterogeneous income effects, using fixed effects and quantile fixed effects regressions. We find that poverty and inequality reduced much faster in the research area than elsewhere in Senegal. Employment in the horticultural export sector is associated with higher household income and the income effect is strongest for the poorest households. Expansion of the horticultural export sector in Senegal has been particularly pro-poor through creating employment that is accessible and creates substantial income gains for the poorest half of the rural population. These pro-poor employment effects contrast with insights in the literature on increased inequality from rural wage employment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Welfare effects are measured as Compensation Variation (CV) for multiple price changes where Hicksian cross price elasticities, household expenditures and price changes are included in the calculations. Results show that taxes on meat are almost neutral over households when expenditures on meat are used as welfare indicators, and regressive if income is used. This can be explained by the households' similar shares of total expenditures on meat. The households with the smallest income levels need to be compensated with 904 SEK per person and year (equivalent to Euro 86.6 per year in the year 2009 exchange rate) to feel that utility is not lowered if taxes on meat are introduced, and the households with the highest income levels need to be compensated with 1141 SEK (Euro 109.3) per person and year. For the year 2009 these compensations correspond to 0.74% and 0.78% of total expenditures for the low and high income group, respectively. When instead comparing the compensation with income levels, the effects correspond to 0.99% for the households with the smallest income levels and to 0.51% for the households with the largest income.","[Sall, Sarah] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econy, Ulls Vag 27, S-75651 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Säll, S (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econy, Ulls Vag 27, S-75651 Uppsala, Sweden.",sarah.sall@slu.se,,,,,,,38,25,26,2,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,147,153,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.12.007,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400014,0

Analyzing biomedical definition of obesity as an epidemic and costly disease, this text aims is to unpack the conceptual structure of the obesity prevention model, and to reflect on the limitations of a top-down pattern of health education and communication in health that, focusing on individual aspects of lifestyles, has involved very little citizen participation in general, and less still by those diagnosed as overweight. In the process of translating international guidelines into national action plans, the effects of historical changes and socioeconomic interests have been largely ignored, and the symbolic and material needs of the stakeholders have gone unrecognized. The discussion considers the minor role attributed in public health policy to the food and eating as social practice, to the specific structural factors that have taken on greater importance during the economic crisis - job insecurity, depressed wages, austerity measures - and to the social determinants of the differential distribution of obesity - social class, gender, ethnicity, age - and suggests that this inattention to their impact may underlie the failure of these strategies to halt the apparently growing obesity rate.

New, micro-based measures of sector labor allocation and cross sector productivity differentials describe the incentives households face when allocating their labor. These measures are similar to national accounts-based measures that are typically used to characterize structural change. However, because agricultural workers supply far fewer hours of labor per year than do workers in other sectors in all of the countries analyzed, productivity gaps shrink by half, on average, when expressed on a per-hour basis. Underlying the productivity gaps that are prominently reflected in national accounts data are large employment gaps, which call into question the productivity gains that laborers can achieve through structural transformation. Furthermore, agriculture's continued relevance to structural change in Sub-Saharan Africa is highlighted by the strong linkages observed between rural non-farm activities and primary agricultural production.

In 2015, approximately 1 in 8 U.S. households experienced food insecurity at some point in the year. Low-income families are at higher risk for food insecurity than other families, and these families may also face higher levels of disruption (e.g., moves, loss of income, or individuals entering or leaving the household) than other families. I use data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to explore the relationship between food insecurity, the household's history during the previous year, and SNAP participation. The results indicate that a number of aspects of the household's recent experience including negative income shocks, moves, and both increases and decreases in household size increase the probability of being food insecure while SNAP participation is estimated to reduce the probability of being food insecure.","[Swann, Christopher A.] UNC Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Swann, CA (通讯作者)，UNC Greensboro, Dept Econ, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA.",chris_swann@uncg.edu,,,"IRP RIDGE Center for National Food and Nutrition Assistance Research at the University of Wisconsin, Madison","IRP RIDGE Center for National Food and Nutrition Assistance Research at the University of Wisconsin, Madison","This research was funded by the IRP RIDGE Center for National Food and Nutrition Assistance Research at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and has benefited from helpful discussion at the IRP RIDGE spring workshop, the RIDGE conference in Washington, DC, the SEA meetings in Atlanta, and from conversations with Ken Snowden, Jeremy Bray, and David Ribar.",,50,45,55,3,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,DEC,2017,73.0,,,,,,1,9,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.006,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FP5MM,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417663600001,0

We exploit the fact that the MSES uses a diversified approach to collect food data by measuring consumption, acquisition and stocks using both, diaries and recall interviews. First, we estimate the effect of diary length on reporting of food consumption, finding a significant decrease of reported food over time. We conclude that shorter diaries would increase the quality of estimates and lower the costs of inquiry. Second, we show that recall interviews, combined with a measurement of stocks, perform well in measuring household food consumption compared to diaries. Third, we find cyclical variation in food consumption and acquisition not only between months, but also within months and weeks. Especially for food acquisition, we detect large difference within months, which can lead to biased estimates of food acquisition. This highlights the need for enumeration to be spread over time to overcome cyclicality on food acquisition and consumption.","[Troubat, Nathalie; Grunberger, Klaus] FAO Stat Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy",,"Troubat, N (通讯作者)，FAO Stat Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",nathalie.troubat@fao.org,,,,,,,27,8,10,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2017,72.0,,,,SI,,132,145,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.019,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FM3EX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414888200013,0

Chile has the highest SSB consumption in the world, very high junk food intake and very rapid increases in these poor components of the diet plus obesity prevalence. This study's purpose is to compare the effect of different tax policies for SSBs and ultra-processed foods on nutrient availability, utilizing price-elasticities, which are estimated from a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model, using the 2011-2012 Income and Expenditure survey from Chile. We take into account the high proportion of households not purchasing various food and beverage groups (censored nature of data) and endogeneity on total expenditures. The food groups considered were: sweets and desserts; salty snacks and chips; meat products and fats; fruits, vegetables and seafood; grain-based staples; ready-to-drink SSB; SSB from concentrate; plain water, coffee and tea; and milk, which together represent 90% of food expenditures. The simulated taxes were: (1) 18% price tax on all foods and beverages exceeding thresholds on sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar and for which marketing is restricted (based on a Chilean law, effective June 16, 2016); (2) 40% tax on SSBs (22% above the current tax level); and (3) a 1 Chilean peso (0.2 US cents) per gram of sugar tax on products with added sugar. Unhealthy beverages and foods are price-elastic (1.95 for salty snacks and chips, 1.30 for ready-to drink SSBs, and 1.27 for SSBs from concentrate), meaning that the change in consumption is proportionally larger with respect to a change in price. Results are robust to different model specification, and consistent among different socioeconomic sub-populations. Overall, the tax on foods and beverages high in fat, salt and sugar is associated with the largest reduction in household purchases of sodium, added sugar, saturated fat and calorie purchases. Chile is unique in currently having instituted a small current SSB tax as well as marketing controls and front-of-package labelling of unhealthy foods and beverages. The design of a more comprehensive tax to enhance the overall effect of these policies on healthier diets is a next critical step. This study shows that a tax on the same foods and beverages already delineated as unhealthy by the marketing controls and front-of-pack labelling should promote a healthier diet.","[Caro, Juan Carlos] Univ Chile, Natl Inst Nutr & Food Technol INTA, Santiago, Chile; [Caro, Juan Carlos] Univ N Carolina, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Health Policy & Management, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Ng, Shu Wen; Taillie, Lindsey Smith; Popkin, Barry M.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Publ Hlth, Carolina Populat Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Ng, Shu Wen; Taillie, Lindsey Smith; Popkin, Barry M.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Universidad de Chile; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Popkin, BM (通讯作者)，Carolina Populat Ctr, 206 West Franklin St,Rm 208, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",Bjuancaro@live.unc.edu; shuwen@unc.edu; lindsey.smith@unc.edu; popkin@unc.edu,"Caro, Juan Carlos/IQW-6436-2023; Popkin, Barry/T-6633-2019","Caro, Juan C/0000-0002-1124-2617",Bloomberg Philanthropies; International Development Research Center [CPC P2C HD050924],Bloomberg Philanthropies; International Development Research Center(International Development Research Centre - IDRC),Funding for this research comes predominantly from Bloomberg Philanthropies with added funding from the International Development Research Center and CPC P2C HD050924.,,81,64,66,4,89,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2017,71.0,,,,,,86,100,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.001,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FH6RS,29375180.0,"Green Accepted, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411305000009,0

The Thai government has responded by developing a number of policies to protect and promote healthy eating. In particular, in 2008, the Thai Government passed a regulation to restrict unhealthy radio and television food advertising to children (RTA). In the following year, a voluntary front-of-pack nutrition labeling policy to promote those products that had reduced their sugar, fat and/or sodium content by at least 25% (25% SFS) was passed. However, the extent of implementation of both of these policies has been poor to date. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and potential facilitators to the implementation of both the RTA and 25% SFS policies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 participants holding senior positions in government, industry and civil society organizations closely involved in the implementation of these policies. The interview data were analyzed using the thematic framework analysis approach. The major barriers to policy implementation perceived by participants were a lack of a monitoring and evaluation system, a lack of organization knowledge regarding skills required for implementation, poor governance system, lack of funding and resources, lack of effective multi-sectoral platforms, influence of the food industry, lack of clear policy content, organizational culture and structure, and changes in policy priorities. Factors that potentially facilitated implementation of these policies, as identified by participants, were policy being compatible to implementer's context, individual support from government officials, good financial management mechanisms, inter-organization networks, and personal motivation to implementing policy. The successful implementation of policies to create healthy food environments in Thailand will likely require attention towards improving the capacity and authority of government agencies, infrastructure to support multi-sectoral platforms and inter-organizational networks, and adequate resources.","[Phulkerd, Sirinya] Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Phulkerd, Sirinya] Mahidol Univ, Inst Populat & Social Res, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Sacks, Gary] Deakin Univ, WHO Collaborating Ctr Obes Prevent, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Vandevijvere, Stefanie] Univ Auckland, Sch Populat Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Worsley, Anthony; Lawrence, Mark] Deakin Univ, Inst Phys Act & Nutr, Geelong, Vic, Australia",Deakin University; Mahidol University; World Health Organization; Deakin University; University of Auckland; Deakin University,"Phulkerd, S (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Sch Exercise & Nutr Sci, Fac Hlth, 221 Burwood Highway, Geelong, Vic 3125, Australia.",sphulker@deakin.edu.au,"Phulkerd, Sirinya/AAE-5167-2021; Sacks, Gary/I-5731-2014","Phulkerd, Sirinya/0000-0001-9373-3120; Sacks, Gary/0000-0001-9736-1539; Lawrence, Mark/0000-0001-6899-3983",NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Obesity Policy and Food Systems [APP1041020]; Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE160100307]; National Heart Foundation in New Zealand,NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Obesity Policy and Food Systems(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award(Australian Research Council); National Heart Foundation in New Zealand(National Heart Foundation of Australia),"The authors would like to thank all representatives from government agencies, NG0s, academia and the private sector in Thailand who participated in the study, Ms. Angkana Sommanustweechai from the International Health Policy Program who was the second reviewer analyzing the data, and Ms. Nattayapat Khammaneejan for administrative support.

Between 2006 and 2012, childhood stunting fell from 39 to 24%. Whilst the global policy and academic literature strongly emphasises the need to act on nutrition, there are still too few studies outlining the policy processes which been part of successful state-led strategies - particularly at a sub-national level. This study is intended to contribute to future policy via unpacking the unfolding story of policy and programme attention to nutrition. Stakeholder perceptions and opinions on the wider policy, political and contextual reasons for Maharashtra's decline in child undernutrition were sought and used alongside documentary evidence to construct a chronology of key events. Key factors identified via this process include the way in which issue framing and evidence helped catalyse a political response; the particular governance structures employed in response (the State's 'Nutrition Mission') and the way in which leadership and a focus on system-wide capacity combined in an innovative fashion to focus resources on pockets of deprivation in high-burden areas.

However, very few empirical studies provide evidence to support these concerns. This paper examines the relationship between women's time spent in domestic work and agriculture and women's and children's dietary diversity. Using data from Bangladesh, Nepal, Cambodia, Ghana, and Mozambique, we find that women's domestic work and cooking time are positively correlated with more diverse diets. We also fin differential effects depending on asset poverty status. In Mozambique, working long hours in agriculture is negatively associated with women's dietary diversity score in nonpoor women, but is positively associated with poor women's dietary diversity and poor children's minimum acceptable diet. This suggests that agriculture as a source of food and income is particularly important for the asset poor. Our results reveal that women's time allocation and nutrition responses to agricultural interventions are likely to vary by socioeconomic status and local context.","[Komatsu, Hitomi; Malapit, Hazel Jean L.; Theis, Sophie] IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Komatsu, H (通讯作者)，IFPRI, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",hitomi.komatsu@gmail.com,,"Malapit, Hazel/0000-0002-7394-8797","A4NH; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Feed the Future; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, USAID [EEM-G-00-04-00013-00]; US government's global hunger and food security initiative","A4NH; United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Feed the Future(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, USAID(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); US government's global hunger and food security initiative","This work was undertaken as part of the CGIAR Research Programs on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) and Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM).

Using split-sample, choice experiment data from a nationwide online survey of U.S. pork chop eaters, this research determines changes in pork chop demand in response to a potential change in U.S. government policy that would introduce a new pork quality grading system based on color scores. Our simulations include novel short-run projections in which the conditional and latent class logic models are inverted to yield inverse demand curves. The inverse demand curves are used to calculate equilibrium prices and pork revenue given a fixed supply of different pork qualities. We supplement these calculations with a more traditional long run analysis in which prices are fixed and quantities of different qualities adjust. Compared to the status quo (control) of no quality grades, we find that two grading systems based on alternative nomenclatures (Select, Choice, Prime vs. Good, Better, Best) both have the potential to increase pork chop sales and revenue to the pork industry; however, we also find that if only the highest quality is labeled, revenue could fall as the increase in demand for the higher quality is offset by the fall in demand for the lower qualities. Results also highlight important heterogeneity in consumer preferences, and although sensory studies strongly suggest redder pork chops are more highly preferred, there remains a non-trivial share of consumers who prefer whiter pork even after quality grade labeling. Overall, this study offers several insights that can help inform labeling and quality grading policies.","[Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Hayes, Dermot J.] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Tonsor, Glynn T.; Schroeder, Ted C.] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Iowa State University; Kansas State University,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 403 W State St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jlusk@purdue.edu; gtonsor@ksu.edu; tcs@ksu.edu; dhayes@iastate.edu,,,National Pork Board and Steve Larsen,National Pork Board and Steve Larsen,We gratefully acknowledge the National Pork Board and Steve Larsen for providing funding to support this project.,,37,29,37,4,34,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,MAY,2018,77.0,,,,,,91,102,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.04.011,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GJ9UD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000435749500008,0

In particular, we analyze how expenditures on food safety practices required by the Produce Rule vary with farm size using a double hurdle model to control for selectivity in both using food safety practices and reporting expenditures. We find that expenditures per acre decrease with farm size. We also find some evidence that growers using sustainable farming practices spend more than conventional growers on many food safety practices. We use our estimates to quantify how the cost burden of compliance varies with farm size. We then explore the policy implications of exemptions to the Rule by simulating how more stringent exemption thresholds for farm revenue and share of direct sales might affect the cost burden of each food safety practice on farms at the threshold.","[Adalja, Aaron] Cornell Univ, Sch Hotel Adm, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lichtenberg, Erik] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Cornell University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Lichtenberg, E (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",aaa362@cornell.edu; elichten@umd.edu,"Lichtenberg, Erik/C-3195-2014","Lichtenberg, Erik/0000-0003-0619-6254","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Specialty Crop Research Initiative [2011-51181-30767]","National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Specialty Crop Research Initiative","This material is based upon research supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Specialty Crop Research Initiative, Award No. 2011-51181-30767.

Yet, findings regarding the effectiveness of label use to decrease negative health outcomes, such as overweight and obesity, are mixed. As most studies focus on estimating mean effects of labels, little is known on whether labels have any effect at the tails of the body weight distribution, which, given the social gradient of obesity, often includes at-risk groups. Additionally, label use, overweight and obesity vary across population subgroups. Thus, the relationship between using food nutrition labels and body weight may be characterized by marked heterogeneity, which the current literature has failed to address. This study explores the non-linearity of the relationship between reading ingredients on the food label and Body Mass Index (BMI) using an unconditional quantile regression estimator and one year of data on adult Italians from the Multipurpose Household Survey. We study this relationship across the BMI distribution and for different groups of respondents, divided by gender, income above and below the sample average, education level, perceived hardships to access food, and regular practice of sport. The results indicate that reading ingredient labels has a negative association with BMI, mostly at higher BMI quartiles (overweight and obese), although a relationship at the highest quartile is only found in a few subsamples. Females, and individuals with a higher risk of being overweight and obese such as low-income, low educated, or those who do not practice sport seem to garner the highest benefit from reading ingredients in the food label. The paper concludes with policy implications, tapping into the recent debate regarding the revision of food labeling in the European Union.","[Bonanno, Alessandro] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B327 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bimbo, Francesco] Univ Foggia, Dipartimento Sci Agr Alimenti & Arnbien, Via Napoli 25, I-71122 Foggia, Italy; [Cleary, Rebecca] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B332 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Castellari, Elena] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dipartimento Econ Agroalimentare, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29122 Piacenza, Italy",Colorado State University; University of Foggia; Colorado State University; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Bonanno, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B327 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",alessandro.bonanno@colostate.edu; francesco.bimbo@unifg.it; rebecca.cleary@colostate.edu; elena.castellari@unicatt.it,"Siyal, Ayaz Latif/ABF-1617-2021; Castellari, Elena/AAS-5089-2020","Siyal, Ayaz Latif/0000-0002-1326-0560; Cleary, Rebecca/0000-0003-1515-9156; CASTELLARI, Elena/0000-0002-5012-7574; BIMBO, FRANCESCO/0000-0003-0070-2582",Colorado State Experiment station,Colorado State Experiment station,"The Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) is thankfully acknowledged for providing access to the Multipurpose Household Survey.

The mixed logit model shows preference heterogeneities, and the latent class model unveils two sources: pro-environmental behaviors with spillover effects, which are defined as catalyst behaviors, and the awareness about imperatives of ecological farming, which is defined as induced awareness. Classification results identify that using BP bags and sorting waste are catalyst behaviors. As the multivariate ordered probit model implies, consumers with higher educational attainment and family income levels are more likely to adopt these behaviors. Instead of creating the preference for eco-labels, the induced awareness is only found to strengthen preferences that already exist. The results of this study provide policy implications for the design of proper strategies to develop the eco-labeled food market, especially in developing economies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Failing to invest today in improvements of agricultural productivity cannot be simply corrected a few decades later if the world finds itself short of food at that point in time. This fundamental irreversibility is particularly problematic in light of uncertain future population, income, and climate change, as portrayed in the IPCC's Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs). This paper finds the optimal path of agricultural R&D spending over the 21st century for each SSP, along with valuation of those regrets associated with investment decisions later revealed to be in error. The maximum regret is minimized to find a robust optimal R&D pathway that factors in key uncertainties and the lag in productivity response to R&D. Results indicate that the whole of uncertainty's impact on R&D is greater than the sum of its individual parts. Uncertainty in future population has the dominant impact on the optimal R&D expenditure path. The robust solution suggests that the optimal R&D spending strategy is very close to the one that will increase agricultural productivity fast enough to feed the World under the most populous scenario. It also suggests that society should accelerate R&D spending up to mid-century, thereafter moderating this growth rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the reality is that many of these systems give rise to confusion and prevent consumers from obtaining a clear idea of them, making the purchasing process more difficult. The objective of this study was to propose a method that can be used as a basis or reference framework for analysing the suitability of any food classification system, based on maximising consumer comprehension and learning, before introducing it into the market. The model proposed establishes the procedure and the necessary indicators for identifying the advantages and drawbacks of each of the different systems, making it possible to compare their suitability. The model was tested empirically by comparing the current classification of orange juices and Iberian ham with two different proposals, in an experiment conducted with an online consumer panel, and using MANCOVA to analyse the differences between the six indicators related to consumer learning results. It was concluded that the model is suitable for assessing the suitability of the classification systems, as it shows technical viability, ease of introduction in practically any situation and the ability to facilitate and guide the process of drawing up consumer-oriented food classification systems.

Yet the scope, scale, and modalities of state activities vary substantially across countries. Drawing on data from Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, and Mozambique this article compares the relative degree of state intervention in the maize sector. We show that relative preferences for output market subsidies, input market subsidies, trade restrictions, or non-interventionist approaches reflect the interplay of interest group lobbying, patronage networks, and ethnic and regional political affiliations. These relationships have deep historical roots and have often been intensified in the context of the emergence of multiparty politics. We show that interventionist orientations in output markets and trade do not translate into better performance or welfare outcomes. Input subsidy preferences produce more ambiguous welfare results, when the opportunity costs are not fully accounted for. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The REDD policy which preserves forests and values standing forests, enables substantial emission reductions. Since agricultural production and area expansion is a primary driver of tropical deforestation, REDD policies might limit the expansion possibilities of agricultural land use and therefore influence competitiveness of the agricultural sector, agricultural prices, trade patterns, agricultural production and therefore food security in the world. This paper studies the impact of REDD policies on the agri-food sector and food security with a global CGE model called MAGNET using a scenario approach. It focuses on the restrictions on agricultural land expansion within the REDD policy package. Simulation results show that REDD policies start to affect the agri-food sector in some lower developed countries if more than 15% of potentially available agricultural areas are protected from deforestation. A stringent REDD policy that protects 90% of land reserves that could potentially be used for agriculture production results in a global real agricultural price increase of almost 7.6%, and a Worldwide agricultural production decrease of 1.7%. Regional differences are large, with real agricultural price changes ranging from 4% in North America to about 24% in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Food access rapidly deteriorates for low-income population in these regions in the case of high forest protection levels. Compensatory payments are necessary from a food security point of view if the level of forest protection increases. Our results indicate that from a food security perspective REDD policy should stop short of trying to protect more than 40% of global carbon if the compensation mechanism is not effectively implemented within REDD.

Exploiting the mandatory retirement age cut-off for public-sector male employees in urban China to obtain a source of exogenous variation in their retirement status, this paper identifies the causal impacts of retirement on four major aspects of their food consumption: food expenditure, time spent in food acquisition, the quantity and quality of food consumed. Based on data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, our fuzzy regression-discontinuity analysis finds that, consistent with the retirement-consumption puzzle, retirement reduces elderly males' total food expenditure by 49-55%. However, retirement barely changes the quantity of food they consume (measured by total calorie intakes). Further analysis suggests that elderly males substitute time for money in food acquisition upon retirement, which helps to reconcile the differential impacts of retirement on food expenditure and food consumption. Finally, retirement greatly changes elderly males' diet structure. They consume significantly less food with animal origins (and thus less fat and protein) and more grains (and thus more carbohydrate) upon retirement, which undermines their diet balance by the standards provided by the Chinese Nutrition Association.","[Chen, Qihui; Bai, Junfei] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Ctr Food & Hlth Econ Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Deng, Tinghe; He, Xiurong] China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; China Agricultural University,"Chen, QH (通讯作者)，China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Ctr Food & Hlth Econ Res, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",chen1006@umn.edu,"Chen, Qihui/I-2813-2019","Chen, Qihui/0000-0002-0944-0470","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R01-HD38700]; Fogarty International Center, NIH; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016RW003]; Chinese Universities Scientific Fund [2017RW005]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71273009]","National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; National Institutes of Health (NIH)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Fogarty International Center, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Chinese Universities Scientific Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors thank the Editor and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.

A comparative market analysis of organic wines from Tuscany,FOOD POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Biodynamic wine; Eco-labels; Hedonic analysis; Organic wine,FOOD; ATTITUDES; CONSUMERS,"Previous literature suggests that the price of wine is a function of its intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. Studies have examined the price of wines from various wine producing regions using the hedonic price model to determine the correlation between wine attributes and price. However few studies have examined the relationship between organic production or certification and price. This study uses a hedonic pricing model to examine the price premiums associated with organic production and organic certification for Tuscan red wines produced between 2000 and 2008 in both the Italian and American wine markets. Controlling for a variety of wine attributes, the analysis finds that wines produced with organic practices, but not certified as organic and wines certified, but not labeled as organic receive a higher price compared to conventional wine, for wines with low quality ratings. However, as the wine's quality rating increases, the positive effects of organic practices and certification on price decrease, and for wine with higher quality ratings, organic practices and certification is associated with lower prices relative to otherwise comparable conventional wines.

In this paper, using examples from the UK halal (sheep) meat supply chain, we outline a value extracting value chain through a mixed methods qualitative approach consisting of face-to-face-interviews and a documentary research strategy underpinned by Narrative Inquiry. Building on previous theoretical work on Illegal Rural Enterprise, we present a narrative of an individual rogue-farmer, and explore his involvement in the illegal halal ('smokies') trade over a fifteen-year period. The paper provides a compelling story that will enable investigators to better understand illegal enterprise from a supply chain perspective and more adequately address the concerns stated in the UK Fraud Act 2006. The paper will be useful to food standards agencies in that furthers our understanding of entrepreneurial practice and morality in the food industry. The results demonstrate that illegal rural enterprise is a multi-faceted concept that requires an understanding of business practices and processes alongside a multi-agency approach to enterprise orientated crime. Our approach suggests that supply chains can be 'flipped' in order to understand illegal processes in addition to conventional legal processes. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Consequently, policy makers need to find strategies to increase food safety while giving the industry time to improve their performance. In Thailand, policy makers have adopted the strategy of upgrading food safety standards gradually. Government and private food safety brands and labels were introduced onto the market but little is known whether Thai consumers have preferences for them or not. This study is aimed at evaluating Thai consumers' preferences for food safety labels and brands on fresh produce, using a surveyed based on discrete-choice experiments. A sample of 350 Thai consumers was surveyed in Bangkok and Nonthaburi in 2013. Quota sampling according to the shopping outlets and convenience sampling methods were adopted. Two hundred respondents were recruited at fresh-food markets and 150 respondents were recruited at supermarkets. We found that consumers are willing-to-pay more for both government led food safety label and private brands, but that there is high heterogeneity in their preferences. The high degree of social desirability for food safety labels confirms that food safety labelling policy should be supported. However, the provision of information and credibility are vital in order to mitigate the risk of consumer deception by self-claimed labels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Proponents of mandatory labeling have been effective in mobilizing supporters around these themes which may influence individual-level support for different GM policy outcomes due to how these themes interact with a person's cultural values. Consequently, we use cultural cognition theory to explore the relationship between cultural worldview and preferences for GM policy. Using a survey, we first examine the effect of cultural worldview on consumers' preferences for voluntary and mandatory GM labeling programs. Second, using a choice experiment, we explore how cultural worldview influences consumer valuations of and willingness to pay for non-GM and GM food labels. Our results establish a reliable connection between cultural worldview and preferences for GM policy and preferences for GM labeling. As predicted by cultural cognition theory, the most dramatic differences exist between those with relatively egalitarian-communitarian and hierarchical-individualistic worldviews. Egalitarian-comnumitaricuis were 42% less likely to support change in the current voluntary approach and 79% more likely to support mandatory labeling than hierarchical-individualists; these individuals were also willing to pay about 67% more to avoid GM foods by purchasing products with a non-GMO label. Although important differences do exist, our research demonstrates that there is common ground and individual attitudes towards labeling can be mediated by cultural worldview.","[Kemper, Nathan P.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, 217 Agr Bldg,1, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Popp, Jennie S.] Univ Arkansas, Honors Coll, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Popp, Jennie S.; Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Div Agr, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Kerr, J.

We tested the hypotheses that contracts in domestic grain chains improve farmers' incomes and reduce food insecurity. We studied the rice value chain in Senegal, where the national agricultural bank and rice millers draw up production and marketing contracts. We applied instrumental variables and propensity score matching models to a dataset of 470 observations to correct selection bias. We found that as a financial device, marketing contracts had no impact on agricultural practices, product quality or income but reduced food insecurity by mitigating price seasonality. Production contracts had a positive impact on the income of producers who were excluded from bank credit but included implicit interest and insurance costs, meaning that these producers make less profit than those financed by the bank. Policies supporting the modernization of domestic grain value chains in West Africa should promote credit insurance systems and support the negotiation of an incentive price in contracts.","[Soullier, Guillaume] UMR ART DEV, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Soullier, Guillaume] Univ Montpellier 3, ART DEV, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD,CNRS, Univ Perpignan Via Domitia, Montpellier, France; [Moustier, Paule] UMR MOISA, CIRAD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Moustier, Paule] Univ Montpellier, MOISA, CIHEAM IAMM, CIRAD,INRA,Montpellier,SupAgro, Montpellier, France",CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Montpellier; Universite Paul-Valery; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CIRAD; INRAE; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIHEAM; CIHEAM IAM Montpellier; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro,"Soullier, G (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier 3, ART DEV, Univ Montpellier, CIRAD,CNRS, Univ Perpignan Via Domitia, Montpellier, France.",guillaume.soullier@cirad.fr; moustier@cirad.fr,"soullier, guillaume/HGB-8022-2022","Moustier, Paule/0000-0003-2916-6496","Agropolis Fondation [1403-033, Labex Agro:ANR-10-LABX-0001-01]; French Ministry of Research (through Montpellier University); CIRAD",Agropolis Fondation(Agropolis Fondation); French Ministry of Research (through Montpellier University); CIRAD,"This paper was funded by Agropolis Fondation under reference ID 1403-033 through the 'Investissements d'avenir' program (Labex Agro:ANR-10-LABX-0001-01).

It is valuable in such research to use strong research designs, taking account of the endogeneity of household residential decisions. This article offers a literature review, emphasizing two promising approaches in the most recent research: (1) longitudinal studies of supermarket or retailer entry and exit within particular locations and (2) studies of variation in food choices across multiple households within particular locations. We review how these approaches address the endogeneity problem. Because this literature review indicates the importance of understanding variation across households within locations, our empirical analysis uses nationally representative data from USDA's National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) to measure the expected values, variances, and intracluster correlations for selected outcome variables and explanatory variables typical of those used in studies of the food retail environment. We find that geographic variation in supermarket proximity does not account for most of the variation of a household's choice of a primary food retailer and does not account for much of the high-level of variation across households in food security and dietary quality. These results and our review of the literature suggest that food store access may modestly influence food choices, but that other household -level factors may matter more.","[Ver Ploeg, Michele] Econ Res Serv, USDA, 355 E St SW,Room 5-132, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Wilde, Parke E.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Tufts University,"Ver Ploeg, M (通讯作者)，Econ Res Serv, USDA, 355 E St SW,Room 5-132, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",sverploeg@ers.usda.gov,"Wilde, Parke/B-6011-2009","Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281",USDA's Economic Research Service [58-5000-1-0051],USDA's Economic Research Service,Supported in part by a cooperative agreement with USDA's Economic Research Service (agreement number 58-5000-1-0051).,,22,31,36,0,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,300,308,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.03.005,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500027,0

We build a meta-sample consisting of 1523 food-income elasticities, 369 nutrient-income elasticities, and 123 calorie-income elasticities extracted from 66 primary studies covering 48 African countries. The sample displays a large heterogeneity in income elasticity estimates, which our meta-analysis aims to explain by looking into attributes of the primary studies and characteristics of the countries considered. There are significant differences in the size of the income elasticities across food and nutrient groups. Foods that make up basic diets tend to have lower income elasticities, while elasticities are considerably higher for less basic and more aspirational foods. The role of methodological attributes of the primary studies in explaining heterogeneity is found to be small. Overall, our results confirm that although income growth in Africa will increase food consumption and lead to more nutritionally diverse diets, it is also associated with excessive intakes of fats and sugars, raising concerns about over-, in addition to undernutrition. This suggests that income-based policies can still play a role in the fight against hunger, but that targeted programs are needed to promote nutritionally valuable and healthy diets.","[Colen, L.; Gomez Y Paloma, S.] European Commiss, JRC, Seville, Spain; [Colen, L.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, LICOS, Leuven, Belgium; [Melo, P.

Second, in the short-run the support granted under RDP 2007-2013 to newly established PO does not improve the farm performance; only established and older POs (and potentially supported in the past) generate benefits to their members. Third, the estimates provide indirect evidence that the disbursement of PO support granted in the financial period 2007-2013 was rather ineffective in selecting POs with the highest potential to generate benefits to its members. Our analysis confirms that many POs were created for the sole purpose just to benefit from the support. This result is reinforced by the observed high closure rate of supported POs.","[Ciaian, Pavel] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain; [Pokrivcak, Jan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra, Slovakia; [Pokrivcak, Jan] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Plzen, Czech Republic",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Ciaian, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, C Inca Garcilaso 3, Seville 41092, Spain.",pavel.claian@ec.europa.eu,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-16-0321]; Czech Science Foundation (GACR) [16-02760S],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency); Czech Science Foundation (GACR)(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Slovak Research and Development Agency (Grant No. APVV-16-0321) and the Czech Science Foundation (GACR) (Grant No. 16-02760S).

This study proposes a new approach to understanding extreme events and boom-bust processes in agricultural markets. Using weekly futures data for twelve indexed agricultural commodities during 2006 to 2016, we find that extreme price changes, located in the 10% tails of the distribution, cluster across agricultural markets. We then implement a multinomial logit model to investigate which factors are associated with the propagation of extreme events. Specifically, we disentangle three transmission conduits. (1) The macroeconomic conduit captures the possibility that the synchronized extreme price events are generated by business-cycle driven demand shifts mainly in emerging economies. (2) The financial conduit refers to potential links between extreme returns and the increasing flow of money from financial participants into agricultural futures markets. (3) Finally, the energy conduit accounts for possible spillover effects due to oil price shocks. Our results indicate an important role of managed money positions and oil prices while the real demand channel remains mostly insignificant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we use a large cross-country data to investigate the impact of trade openness and other factors on food security, measured by dietary energy consumption. We employ a system GMM approach to account for unobserved heterogeneity, correlated individual effects and potential endogeneity of the explanatory variables. The empirical results reveal that trade openness and economic growth exert positive and significant impacts on dietary energy consumption, and also contribute to improvements in dietary diversity. The results are robust to the inclusion of additional variables capturing specific agro-climatic constraints (e.g. weather-related) and regional/country characteristics and to the sample composition. Most geographical regions are found to have significantly higher food security levels compared to Sub-Saharan Africa. Additional results indicate that besides calorie consumption, trade openness also improves dietary diversity and diet quality related aspects of food security. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing evidence indicates that it is possible to develop diets that are both environmentally sustainable and healthy, but their potential success largely depends on consumers' willingness and ability to change their behavior. This study investigates consumer perceptions of the match, or mismatch, between healthy and sustainable diets, and gives insight into consumers' motivation to eat healthily and sustainably, as measured by involvement. Data were collected in Spring 2014 through a cross-sectional quantitative online survey with samples representative for age, gender and region in four European Union (EU) countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) (n = 2783). The images of a healthy diet, a sustainable diet and a plant-based diet were found to be highly compatible based on a strongly observed match between European consumers' perceptions of these concepts. Half of the participants were highly involved in healthy eating and one third in both healthy and sustainable eating. Informational food policy actions targeting both healthy and sustainable food consumption behavior are recommended to address issues relevant to the target segments, taking into account their levels of involvement. Increasing consumers' motivation and involvement in health and sustainability emerges as a key trigger for increasing healthy and sustainable eating. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The program increased diversity in crops grown and the number of months in which various food groups were harvested. In particular, the program substantially increased the percentage of households producing three nutritious crops it promoted (groundnuts, rape and tomatoes). As a consequence there were modest increases in household access to diverse food groups. Despite modest increases in the proportion of children consuming pulses, legumes and nuts, ultimately there were no significant improvements in the overall dietary diversity of young children or their mothers. A nutrition-sensitive agricultural program can increase diversity in agricultural production and to a lesser extent access to nutritious foods, but this may not always be sufficient to improve child diets or nutrition.","[Harris, Jody] IDS, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Mwanamwenge, Marjolein] Concern Worldwide, Mongu, Zambia; [Nguyen, Phuong H.] IFPRI, Washington, DC USA; [Tembo, Gelson] Univ Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia; [Rawat, Rahul] Gates Fdn, Seattle, WA USA",University of Sussex; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of Zambia; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,"Maluccio, JA (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, 14 Old Chapel Rd, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",amrosenberg@middlebury.edu; jmalucci@middlebury.edu; J.Harris@ids.ac.uck; P.H.Nguyen@cgiar.org; Rahul.Rawat@gatesfoundation.org,"Nguyen, Phuong H./C-6762-2011","Harris, Jody/0000-0002-3369-1253",,,,,62,33,37,0,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2018,80.0,,,,,,10,23,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.07.008,0.0,,,14,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GZ1PO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449140200002,0

With a panel database of U.S. seafood imports from 217 partner countries from 1991 to 2006, we employ a causal framework of analysis with a treatment group of U.S. seafood imports and two alternative control groups (U.S. food imports outside of HACCP rules and the European Union's 15 seafood imports). Further, we assess the effects of HACCP on the intensive and extensive margins of U.S. seafood imports. Contrary to previous work, we find that HAACP implementation has no effect on the flow of U.S. seafood imports, while the estimates of the other key variables are consistent across the models seen in previous work. Thus, we find evidence that non-tariff measures like HACCP had net null effect on imports, though the distribution of imports shifted.","[Chen, Rui] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 309A Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Ag Econ & Rural Sociol, 210 Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Hartarska, Valentina] Auburn Univ, Dept Finance, 210 Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Wilson, Norbert L.

These social media hypes are a concern to stakeholders because they can affect public opinion and policy, and are almost impossible to predict. This study develops a model for analysing social media hypes and builds a typology to provide insights into the dynamics of social media hypes in the context of agro-food governance. Five cases of peak social media activity in the Dutch livestock sector are analysed along four dimensions: (1) peak patterns of activity, (2) issues and frames, (3) interaction of actors, and (4) media interplay. An analysis of the dimensions and the interrelations across cases shows that social media hypes revolve around activism, scandals, and conflicts - each with characteristic patterns of activity, framing, interaction and media interplay. Hypes do not just result from important events in the sector, but are generated through the use of organizing concepts with a hashtag to evaluate and establish occasions. Peak activity thus revolves around a few themes and is recurrent and judgmental. Moreover, stakeholders play an active role in instigating and framing social media hypes. Our results show the need to adopt a proactive and interactive approach that transcends the view of social media as a mere communication channel to respond in crisis situations.","[Stevens, T.

We interviewed administrators at twenty Costa Rican coffee cooperatives about management practices related to voluntary certification. Voluntary certifications are popular among coffee cooperatives. Access to certified markets is facilitated by state support of the cooperative sector, regulation of the coffee sector and well-enforced environmental and social laws. However, there are no significant or consistent financial incentives for farmers to pursue certification. Multiple certifications may lower auditing and implementation costs, but cooperatives rarely receive the full premium for multiply-certified coffee. Low market demand for certified coffee, weak price incentives and high auditing and management costs encourage cooperatives to certify only a portion of their members. This strategy rewards compliant farmers rather than inducing widespread change to farming practices among the entire membership. Though financial incentives are weak, certifications offer non-financial benefits to both farmers and cooperatives, including better management and more resilient cooperatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Given current debates about the healthiness of food assistance recipients' diets, we also consider the impacts of placing restrictions on in-kind transfers that either prohibit soda purchases with the transfer or require the transfer be spent on fruits and vegetables. Overall, we find that, as theory predicts, in-kind transfers have the same effect on food expenditures as an unrestricted cash transfer for inframarginal consumers, and for extramarginal consumers, food expenditures are higher for in-kind than cash transfers. Participants also respond to the fruit and vegetable restriction as theory would predict. However, in contrast to the theoretical prediction, the soda restriction reduces soda expenditures for more than half the inframarginal consumers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although it represents only 1% of world agricultural area, organic is one of the most recognized food labels and most people in developed countries consume some amount of organic food today. There is a wide range of interpretations of what organic means by different actors in the sector. Here we examine eight different organic regulations from across the world to understand how they have codified the large diversity of ideas inherent in organic agriculture. Our analysis shows that organic practices and regulations do not differ substantially between countries- across the board organic regulations define organic mainly in terms of 'natural' vs. 'artificial' substances that are allowed (or not) as inputs. This interpretation of organic as chemical-free farming, largely void of broader environmental principles, does not fully incorporate the original ideas of organic theoreticians who conceived it as a holistic farming system aimed primarily at improving soil health, thereby leading to improved animal, human, and societal health. This narrow focus of organic regulations can be explained by the interest of organic consumers who predominantly buy organic because they believe it is healthier and more nutritious due to the absence of harmful substances. Organic regulations need to place more emphasis on environmental best practices in order to ensure that organic agriculture can contribute to sustainability objectives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Labor productivity differs widely: rural and female-headed enterprises, those located further away from population centers, and businesses that operate intermittently have lower levels of labor productivity compared to urban and male-owned enterprises, or enterprises that operate throughout the year.

Nutritional information is seen as an effective tool to help fight obesity and its associated co-morbidities, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, for which unhealthy diet represent a major preventable risk factor. This paper explores the influence of FoPL formats on consumer's stated choice of weekly food baskets using data from a discrete choice experiment carried out in Northern Ireland in 2011. Two of the three baskets were experimentally designed while the third represented the respondent's actual current food choice (or status-quo basket). Four nutritional attributes were used: (i) total fat, (ii) saturated fat, (iii) salt, and (iv) sugar. Baskets were portrayed at different price levels to elicit the sensitivity of choice to price and to derive marginal willingness to pay estimates. Results from random utility models with various forms of heterogeneity reject the null of no association between preference classes and healthier food baskets and also the null of no effect of the nutritional information described. We find that the influence of the FoPL format used to convey nutritional information combines with selected socio-demographic covariates to determine membership to preference classes. A sensitivity analysis is used to validate the preferred model and the response sensitivity of selection probabilities to potential policy levers, such as a more realistic appreciation of self-body image and the habit of reading labels.","[Thiene, Mara] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy; [Scarpa, Riccardo] Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Longo, Alberto; Hutchinson, William George] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Gibson Inst, IGFS, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",University of Padua; Durham University; University of Verona; University of Waikato; Queens University Belfast,"Thiene, M (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry TESAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy.",mara.thiene@unipd.it; riccardo.scarpa@durham.ac.uk; a.longo@qub.ac.uk; g.hutchinson@qub.ac.uk,"Scarpa, Riccardo/C-6691-2009; Thiene, Mara/H-1866-2014","Thiene, Mara/0000-0003-3265-5426","UKCRC [RES-590-28-0001, MR/K023241/1]; Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-52587-R]","UKCRC; Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government)","Funding for this research was provided by the UKCRC, grants number RES-590-28-0001 and MR/K023241/1, by the Department for Employment and Learning, Northern Ireland, and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through Grant No. ECO2014-52587-R.",,93,24,25,6,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2018,80.0,,,,,,84,102,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.09.004,0.0,,,19,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GZ1PO,,"Green Accepted, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000449140200007,0

Today, the U.S. produces more beef from fewer cattle due to the ability to get more meat from each animal. Average cattle slaughter weight has increased more than 330 pounds over the past 40 years. While the benefits of this increase in efficiency are well documented, unintended adverse consequences have been less well understood. This article aims to identify and quantify one of these adverse effects. With larger cattle have come larger steaks. In response, many retailers have begun offering thinner cuts to combat high total package prices. But, do consumers prefer larger, thinner steaks or smaller, thicker steaks? Using data from a nationwide survey, this article estimates consumer willingness to pay for beef steak dimensions to draw insights into the consumer welfare changes that have resulted from increasing steak sizes. Results imply that most consumers prefer thicker to thinner cuts steaks and that smaller surface areas are preferred to larger ones. Our estimates suggest that increases in welfare due to larger carcasses, say from lower prices and more ground beef, must offset an $8.6 billion annual loss in consumer welfare resulting from changing steak size.","[Maples, Joshua G.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Starkville, MS USA; [Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Peel, Derrell S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Mississippi State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Maples, JG (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, 318 Lloyd Ricks Watson Bldg, Starkville, MS 39759 USA.",josh.maples@msstate.edu,,,Willard Sparks Endowed Chair; Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service; Charles Breedlove Professorship; Sitlington Enriched Graduate Scholarship,Willard Sparks Endowed Chair; Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service; Charles Breedlove Professorship; Sitlington Enriched Graduate Scholarship,"The authors are grateful for the funding support of the Willard Sparks Endowed Chair, the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service, the Charles Breedlove Professorship, and the Sitlington Enriched Graduate Scholarship for this research.",,48,14,23,0,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JAN,2018,74.0,,,,,,65,73,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.11.005,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FX9IR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426412400006,0

Increasing food production while using fewer resources and reducing food waste while ensuring food safety are just two examples. Innovation at different levels in the food system will be needed to address future challenges. Fast technology uptake and the launch of new food-related products can put pressure on the ability to deliver timely risk assessments, the scope of which might also need to cover other legitimate factors. Future food policies need to be more sensitive to impacts on food safety and nutrition and health aspects.

We find a 7.51% reduction in total costs for DSR adopters; a decrease in total costs (by 3.71%) if the DSR method was adopted on PTR parcels. DSR farmers can significantly reduce their fertilizer and land preparation costs.

Building on behavioral regularities of consumer behavior, the analysis estimates the benefit of food at the individual level and at the world level. It finds an inverted-U relationship between food benefit and income. At the individual level, the food benefit/income ratio starts at 0 under extreme poverty, increases with income to reach a maximum of 4.4 when income per capita is around $13,000, and then declines slowly as income rises. The paper shows very large aggregate net benefit of food. The analysis also evaluates the cost of food insecurity. It shows that aversion to food insecurity is pervasive, the coefficient of relative risk aversion to food insecurity being around 2.7. The analysis evaluates empirically the cost of food insecurity. We report the cost of food insecurity under alternative scenarios, documenting that it can be large in situations of exposure to significant downside risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2002, potato products cooked to a high temperature were first reported to contain the human carcinogen acrylamide. Research discoveries using genetic engineering can substantially reduce carcinogenic-forming potential, and thereby increase food safety of potato products. Adult consumers from three distant regions of the U. S. were the subjects in lab auctions of potato products. They engaged in distinct rounds of bidding, first without packaged information and again after receiving information about the food safety risks and benefits of new biotech potato products. The study finds that willingness-to-pay (WTP) for these new potato products are not significantly different from conventional potato products under no information. However, exposure to a scientific perspective and scientific plus industry perspectives increases participants' willingness-to-pay for the new potato products and reduces willingness-to-pay for conventional products. Exposure to the negative perspective on the new technology significantly reduces willingness-to-pay.

To date, most of the literature has analyzed these collaborations as linked to a regulatory process and as a mean to comply with regulatory standards. In this paper, we take another stand and consider them as specific embedded institutions (meso-institutions) analysing them as Public Private Partnership specific to food safety provision. This new perspective allows us to take into account both information asymmetries and the industry-wide dimension of such programmes. Our overall intention is to provide a general enriched theoretical framework to highlight aligned incentive mechanisms in such partnerships. We then apply our framework to two case studies in order to better understand the main mechanisms at work that could explain their specific functioning and resilience. The two case studies are the cattle traceability system in Quebec (Canada) and monitoring programmes for pesticide residues in the French imports industry of fresh produce. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For completeness, when assessing the 'carbon footprint of their business activities, food retailers should also included the greenhouse gas emissions caused by their disposal of waste food, which will vary with the waste disposal option used. However, there is lack of quantitative guidance for food retailers on the net GHG emissions that are incurred in the disposal of specific food types by the various disposal options available. Here, we calculate the net GHG emissions of eight different waste disposal options for five core food types using life cycle assessment, accounting for both emissions incurred in transport and processing, and those mitigated by the creation of useful products. We also assess the extent to which the embodied emissions in waste foods at the retail checkout can be mitigated by each disposal option. In addition to food specific results, we calculate mass-weighted averages using data from a mid-sized retail chain. We find a strong correlation between net emissions and the energy density of foods, and the following mass weighted disposal hierarchy (from best to worst, with respect to greenhouse gas emissions): donation of edible food to food banks; anaerobic digestion; conversion to animal feed; incineration with energy recovery; aerobic composting; landfill with gas collection and utilisation; landfill with gas collection and flaring; landfill without gas collection. If waste food from retailers is unfit for human consumption, to minimise greenhouse gas emissions it should be disposed of by conversion to animal feed or anaerobic digestion. For all food types, landfill is the worst disposal option.","[Moult, J. A.; Hewitt, C.

Thus, agricultural interventions may fail to improve nutritional outcomes if they do not take account of time constraints, particularly of rural women who spend a considerable portion of their time in agriculture. Given the potential trade-offs pertaining to time in productive vs. reproductive activities and its implications for maternal and child nutrition, the goal of this review is to systematically map and assess the available evidence, both qualitative and quantitative studies, agriculture-time use-nutrition pathway. Through an analysis of 89 studies, identified through a systematic search, on rural areas of low and middle income countries, we observe three findings. First, women play a key role in agriculture, as reflected in their time commitments. Second, evidence from a very limited set of studies suggests that agricultural interventions tend to increase time commitments in agriculture of the household members for whom impact is measured. Third, while changing time use tends to change nutritional outcomes, it does so in a range of complex ways and there is no agreement on the impact. Nutritional impacts are varied because households and household members respond to increased time burden and workload in different ways.","[Johnston, Deborah; Hull, Elizabeth] SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Stevano, Sara] Univ West England UWE Bristol, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Malapit, Hazel J.] IFPRI, WEAI, CGIAR Res Program Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Kadiyala, Suneetha] LSHTM, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of West England; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Johnston, D (通讯作者)，SOAS Univ London, Dept Econ, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",Dj3@soas.ac.uk; Sara.Stevano@uwe.ac.uk; H.Malapit@cgiar.org; e.hull@soas.ac.uk; Suneetha.Kadiyala@lshtm.ac.uk,,"Kadiyala, Suneetha/0000-0002-9101-1471; Johnston, Deborah/0000-0003-0065-1105; Hull, Elizabeth/0000-0002-1981-3533",Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH),Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH),"Funding for this research came from Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) at International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and from the UK Leverhulme Centre for Integrative Research into Agriculture and Health (LCIRAH).

According to economic theory, SNAP benefits are fungible with cash for inframarginal households which may allow participants to spend benefits on non-FAH items. However, empirical evidence for this theory is mixed. This paper exploits an underutilized source of state-level variation, the early-2000 s recession, to determine the impact of SNAP participation on household Food Away From Home (FAFH) consumption. In a difference in difference framework, I compare households in high post-recession SNAP growth states to households in low post-recession SNAP growth states.

At the same time, governmental and non-governmental development projects aimed at improving farmers' welfare continue to be organized. It is not uncommon for CF activities and development projects to take place in the same communities. Yet so far there is no evidence on how development projects affect CF activities. We examine factors affecting entry in and exit from different maize CF schemes in Northern Ghana, and focus specifically on the role of development projects. We find that the presence of agricultural development projects in the community is associated with lower scheme entry, but this not the case for non-agricultural projects. CF exit is more strongly associated with maize projects, but not significantly with non maize or non-agricultural projects. Thus, our findings do not support concerns of a general moral hazard problem arising from the presence of any development project, but indicate possible negative associations of more closely related agricultural or maize projects with maize CF participation.","[Lambrecht, Isabel Brigitte] IFPRI, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Accra, Ghana; [Ragasa, Catherine] IFPRI, Dev Strategy & Governance Div, Washington, DC USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Lambrecht, IB (通讯作者)，CSIR Campus IFPRI, Airport Residential Area, PMB CT 112, Cantonment, Accra, Ghana.",i.lambrecht@cgiar.org,,"Ragasa, Catherine/0000-0002-8033-0784; Lambrecht, Isabel/0000-0003-1709-6611",United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Funding under the Ghana Strategic Support Program,United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Funding under the Ghana Strategic Support Program(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"The authors thank all farmers who responded to the questionnaires, and the contract farming scheme management for answering to the questions during the qualitative interviews.

Vouchers are distributed empowering eligible farmers to exchange them for fixed quantities of inputs at subsidized prices. Since its inception, there has been a debate at national level about whether the FISP's potential has been fully exploited, with policy makers exploring options to improve the programme. Proposals include targeting efficient and productive farmers to maximize returns. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of these proposed changes to the existing FISP design by utilizing two waves of the LSMS-ISA survey merged with climatic data. We estimate how the national demand for agricultural inputs varies according to a variation in the targeting criteria by means of a two-stage demand system. Then, we identify more efficient farmers by means of a stochastic frontier approach. We observe a mismatch between voucher recipients and efficiency, with approximately 60% of vouchers being allocated to the three bottom quintiles of efficiency. This mismatch is observed also at the spatial level with more vouchers going to districts characterized by less efficient production. While concerns on the distributional impacts of the new criteria are discussed together with some suggestions for spatially diversifying the structuring of the policy and incentivizing crop diversification, our results highlight a high substitutability of commercial with subsidized inputs by new eligible farmers. Consequently, simulating the targeting policy variation we obtain an outcome that would lead only to a limited increases in predicted food expenditure ranging from 0.27% to 0.8% and maize production from 0.2% to 1.3. Scope for analysing different adjustments in the functioning of FISP are, thus, proposed to policy makers.","[Asfaw, Solomon; Cattaneo, Andrea] Food & Agr Org FAO United Nations, Agr Dev Econ Div, Rome, Italy; [Pallante, Giacomo] TA Sogesid, Minist Environm Land & Sea, Rome, Italy; [Pallante, Giacomo] John Cabot Univ, Rome, Italy; [Palma, Alessandro] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, CEIS, Rome, Italy; [Palma, Alessandro] IEFE Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Rome Tor Vergata; Bocconi University,"Asfaw, S (通讯作者)，Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",solomon.asfaw@fao.org,,"Pallante, Giacomo/0000-0002-7255-5684; Palma, Alessandro/0000-0002-5153-6994",,,,,93,9,9,2,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,DEC,2017,73.0,,,,,,104,118,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.09.004,0.0,,,15,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FP5MM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417663600010,0

Adapting a model from Atkin (2013) and utilizing data from a national Peruvian household survey (ENAHO), I am able to deconstruct regional changes in household nutrition over time into several general equilibrium effects; in particular, I isolate the effect of regional tastes for quinoa on nutrition outcomes. This effect is identified by an exogenous spike in quinoa prices driven by international demand for quinoa. While I find evidence that regional tastes for quinoa do exist in the Puno region, these tastes do not have a statistically significant impact on nutrition outcomes. My results lend support to the conjecture that tastes for culturally appropriate food do not meaningfully affect household nutrition if the food in question is a sufficiently small component of a household's overall diet.","[Stevens, Andrew W.] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Stevens, AW (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, POB 5187, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",a.stevens@msstate.edu,"Stevens, Andrew W/K-4260-2019","Stevens, Andrew W/0000-0003-0960-5535",,,,,26,10,12,3,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2017,71.0,,,,,,132,142,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.003,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FH6RS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000411305000013,0

An interesting feature of this regulation is that it is based on both a decentralized examination by the rapporteur country and a centralized examination by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Our econometric analysis is based on standard survival and competing risks models. The data cover 393 active substances reviewed between 1993 and 2013. We show that the review process is affected by regulatory factors, the characteristics of the active substances and the characteristics of agri-chemical firms.

We also found that consumers' interest in healthy eating had a significant indirect effect on perceived dietary quality through mind/body healthy eating and that the relationships between interest in healthy eating, consumer definitions of healthy eating, and perceived dietary quality were moderated by different levels of personal values.

One of the main challenges this country faces is increasing agricultural productivity by integrating smallholder farmers into a high-value agricultural commodity supply chain. This paper examines an integrated project-the Agricultural Value Chains Project in Oromia (AVCPO)-that aims to improve the livelihoods of smallholders in the Bale Zone by involving them in the production of high-quality durum wheat and linking them to the pasta industry via farmers' cooperatives. Using primary data collected in 2014 and retrospective information, this paper investigates the AVCPO's effects on the quantity of cereal production, the share of cereals that have been sold through cooperatives, food security, and education. In order to account for potential violations of the exclusion restriction assumption, an instrumental variable approach is applied, together with three additional estimation strategies. The results suggest that the project has had a large and positive effect on gross and net values of cereal production per hectare, as well as on the share of production sold to pasta makers through cooperatives. These benefits accrue equally to land-rich and land-poor farmers. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AVCPO has improved educational outcomes and reduced food insecurity, without affecting crop rotation practices. Overall, our findings point to the effectiveness of the project. Before replicating or scaling up this intervention, however, it is necessary to understand how to better involve poorer farmers and which adjustments are needed if the areas selected have a lower potential than Bale Zone.","[Biggeri, Mario; Ciani, Federico] Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy; [Ciani, Federico] Polo Univ Citta Prato, PIN Scrl, ARCO Res Ctr, Prato, Italy; [Burchi, Francesco; Herrmann, Raoul] DIE, German Dev Inst, Tulpenfeld 6, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Florence; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE),"Biggeri, M (通讯作者)，Univ Florence, Dept Econ & Management, Via Pandette 9, I-50127 Florence, Italy.",mario.biggeri@unifi.it; Francesco.Burchi@die-gdi.de; federico.ciani@unifi.it; raoul.herrmann@die-gdi.de,"Ciani, Federico/HJA-2460-2022","BIGGERI, MARIO/0000-0001-7986-380X",German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Department of Economics and Management of the University of Florence (PIN); ARCO Research Center (PIN); DIE (German Development Institute) through BMZ,German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); Department of Economics and Management of the University of Florence (PIN); ARCO Research Center (PIN); DIE (German Development Institute) through BMZ,"We are grateful to prof.

As a starting point in our analysis, we report results from almost four years of monthly surveys with U.S. consumers, which show slight food safety concern for genetically engineered food with no discernable trend of increased or decreased concern over time. We find small differences in consumer preferences for policies related to different plant breeding methods, with the strongest support for the notion that bioengineered crops should be regulated based on health and environmental outcomes rather than the process used to create new crops. Other survey results reveal support or opposition for genetically engineered food depends on consumers' perceptions of who created the technology. We also find that food safety concerns related to genetically engineered food are related to perceptions about the distribution of benefits from the technology across the food supply chain.","[Lusk, Jayson L.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [McFadden, Brandon R.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Wilson, Norbert] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Tufts University,"Lusk, JL (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jlusk@purdue.edu,"Wilson, Norbert/E-9161-2010","Wilson, Norbert/0000-0002-4924-1505",,,,,27,64,76,2,99,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,JUL,2018,78.0,,,,SI,,81,90,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.02.007,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GP6BA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440960700009,0

One type of shared knowledge structure created through social, economic, and political communication related to health risks and benefits is social representations. To examine social representations of fish and seafood, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 adults ages 50-70 in rural New York State. Interview transcripts were analyzed for individual and shared social representations using open coding. Most participants held numerous social representations describing the health effects of eating fish. The social representations included five domains: intrinsic fish components, fish contaminants, fish as protein, health effects of fish, and types of fish. Nearly everyone discussed core representations of heart health, fish being good for you, and mercury exposure. Participants often held conflicting representations and incorporated conflicting representations in their eating routines. While individuals held similar sets of social representations, their involvement with the social representations varied. Four patterns of involvement with social representations of fish and seafood included: evangelists, safeguarded, oblivious, and risk managers. Social representations and individual patterns of involvement with shared sets of social representations is a unique approach to examining food and health that acknowledges the complexity of the topic as a policy issue as well as the process of knowledge transfer from the expert realm to the broader public in a risk society.","[Bostic, Stephanie M.; Sobal, Jeffery; Bisogni, Carole A.] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Savage Hall,244 Garden Ave, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Bostic, SM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Savage Hall,244 Garden Ave, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",smb482@cornell.edu,,,Cornell University,Cornell University,"Cornell University provided funding support for this project, and had no involvement with or influence over any stage of the research project.",,39,1,1,1,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,APR,2018,76.0,,,,,,99,108,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.03.010,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GK5JW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000436212400009,0

This observational study aimed to characterise the availability, quality and price of foods and beverages in a nationally representative sample of grocery stores in Malta using the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey for Stores (NEMS-S) instrument, and to examine the association between area-level density of different types of food stores and the likelihood of children living in these areas being overweight or obese. Fieldwork was carried out between March and May 2014. There was a strong positive correlation between store size and NEMS-S score (p = <0.001), suggesting that smaller grocery stores generally offered a smaller range of products and fewer healthy food/beverage options than larger supermarkets. Across all stores, median prices of certain 'healthier' versions of foods were more expensive than their less healthy alternatives. A significant association between risk of childhood overweight, and density of confectionery stores in children's locality of residence, was found (OR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.37). These baseline findings highlight opportunities to improve the food environment in Malta to support more healthful eating, and may be of particular interest to public health practitioners in island settings.

These dynamic areas, subjected to pressure from urban planning, are contributing to the uncoupling of consumption and local agriculture. In this article we study the feasibility of recoupling production and consumption within the agri-food system of the peri-urban area of the Saclay plateau near Paris. By using a nitrogen flow analysis based on the concept of territorial ecology, we analysed quantitative and qualitative data providing information in terms of system performances. By calculating two local efficiency indicators (one production-based indicator and one consumption-based) and a self-sufficiency capacity indicator, we assess the current and potential coupling between production and consumtion. A typology of farming systems was constructed to assess the more efficient type of farms in terms of localisation within the agri-food system. The Saclay plateau has many assets to increase local agri-food system efficiency and to work towards agricultural symbiosis. However, a number of obstacles remain on both the production and the demand sides. Our study illustrates the lack of consideration of the productive function of urban and peri-urban agriculture in urban planning projects.

Saint Lucia, a small island developing state located in the Caribbean, has been grappling with a wide range of agriculture, food and nutrition security challenges with varying degrees of policy success. Recognizing the significance of the challenge, this paper explores the nature of the stakeholder interactions surrounding the development of Saint Lucia's 2009-2015 National Agricultural Policy and considers some of the implications for food and agriculture-related policy outcomes. Results reveal a general lack of supportive conditions for effective multi-stakeholder processes, including low stakeholder participation levels, conflicting roles of different forms of social capital in the interactions between stakeholders, and missing boundary organizations capable of facilitating a transition towards more flexible and adaptive institutions, enhanced knowledge exchange and learning, and greater trust among stakeholders in the policy network. Future avenues for research and development are subsequently identified. (C) 2017 The Authors.

More specifically, we analyze to what extent the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) in combination with regional warehouses have contributed to a reduction in price spreads between regional markets. Our hypothesis is that warehouses connected to the ECX reduce the dispersion between export prices and local retail prices in different coffee growing areas, as well as the dispersion between export prices and local retail prices in different coffee growing areas. By doing so, the ECX has the potential to improve the market efficiency. To identify the causal effect, we combine retail price data with information on the gradual rollout of warehouses connected to the ECX from 2007 to 2012. Our results suggest that, when two markets both have access to an operating warehouse, the average price spread is 0.86-1.78 ETB lower than it is for markets where at least one part lacks warehouse access. This is a substantial reduction considering that the average price spread over the full period is 3.33 ETB. The main results are robust to various econometric specifications, and our analysis thus suggests that local warehouses connected to the ECX have indeed improved market efficiency.

Methods: We conducted 32 interviews with rural corner store owners across six states in response to USDA's proposed rule. We asked owners about potential barriers to and facilitators of stocking healthier foods. Findings: Among the interviews, there were six main themes discussed: (1) SNAP Retailer Rule definition concerns; (2) challenges to implementation; (3) facilitators to implementation; (4) perceptions of SNAP customers; (5) benefits of being a participating retailer in SNAP; and (6) concerns about the threat to the store's economic viability if required to carry additional healthier items in line with the proposed rule. Conclusions: Rural corner stores need help promoting healthier food options, appropriately handling perishable items, finding suppliers that can adhere to their food delivery requirements, and maintaining their SNAP retailer license. Recognizing the implementation challenges of stocking healthier foods for corner stores and presenting feasible solutions to them can improve the likelihood of successful passages of healthy food access policies and programs. Future policies or programs focusing on stocking healthier foods should take into consideration rural corner stores' unique geographic landscape and business practices.","[Haynes-Maslow, Lindsey] NC State Univ, Dept Agr & Human Sci, 512 Brickhaven Dr Campus Box 7606, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Osborne, Isabel] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, 445 Paul Hardin Dr, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA; [Pitts, Stephanie Jilcott] East Carolina Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, 600 Moye Blvd,Lakeside Annex 8,Room 126, Greenville, NC 27834 USA; [Sitaker, Marilyn] Evergreen State Coll, 2700 Evergreen Pkwy NW, Olympia, WA 98505 USA; [Byker-Shanks, Carmen] Montana State Univ, Food & Nutr & Sustainable Food Syst, 344 Reid Hall, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Leone, Lucia] Univ Buffalo, 333 Kimball Tower, Buffalo, NY 14214 USA; [Maldonado, Adriana; Baquero, Barbara] Univ Iowa, Dept Community & Behav Hlth, 145 N Riverside Dr,100 CPHB, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [McGuirth, Jared] UNC Greensboro, Dept Nutr, 319 Coll Ave,318 Stone Bldg, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Andress, Lauri] West Virginia Univ, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Leadership, POB 9190 Third Floor,HSC South Room 3305, Morgantown, WV USA; [Bailey-Davis, Lisa] Geisinger Hlth Syst, Geisinger Ctr Hlth Res, 100 North Acad Ave, Danville, PA 17822 USA; [Kolodinsky, Jane] Univ Vermont, Community Dev & Appl Econ, 202 Morrill Hall, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Lo, Brian; Morgan, Emily; Senguin, Rebecca] Cornell Univ, Div Nutr Sci, Reservoir Ave, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Ammerman, Alice] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr, 1700 Martin Luther King Blvd,CB 7426, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",North Carolina State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; East Carolina University; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of Iowa; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; West Virginia University; Geisinger Health System; University of Vermont; Cornell University; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Haynes-Maslow, L (通讯作者)，NC State Univ, Dept Agr & Human Sci, 512 Brickhaven Dr Campus Box 7606, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",Lhmaslow@ncsu.edu; iosborne@live.unc.edu; jilcotts@ecu.edu; cbykershanks@montana.edu; lucialeo@buffalo.edu; adriana-maldonado@uiowa.edu; jtmcguir@uncg.edu; LAANDRESS@hsc.wvu.edu; ldbaileydavis@geisinger.edu; barbara-baquero@uiowa.edu; Jane.Kolodinsky@uvm.edu; bl592@cornell.edu; ehm72@cornell.edu; rebeccaseguin@cornell.edu; alice_ammerman@unc.edu,"andress, lauri/AID-9809-2022; Kolodinsky, Jane/AAS-4241-2020","andress, lauri/0000-0001-8326-9635; Kolodinsky, Jane/0000-0001-7322-0889; Byker Shanks, Carmen/0000-0002-9030-9938; Bailey-Davis, Lisa/0000-0002-8781-1521; Haynes-Maslow, Lindsey/0000-0001-9571-1478","Healthy Eating Research, A National Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network (NOPREN) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [5U48-DP001911]","Healthy Eating Research, A National Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network (NOPREN) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","This research was supported by a grant from Healthy Eating Research, A National Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Our findings suggest that women's empowerment is associated with better dietary quality of individuals within the household, but the strength of this association varies across the life course. Women's empowerment is correlated with more diverse diets of children under five, but empowerment measures are not consistently associated with increases in nutrient intake for this age group. Rather, maternal schooling and household socio-economic status play a more important role for younger children. Women's empowerment is positively and significantly associated with adult men's and women's dietary diversity and nutrient intakes. Empowerment does not benefit all individuals within the household equally, with gender bias emerging in adolescence. Variations in the strength of the association between women's empowerment and different individuals' dietary quality across the life course has implications for the design and targeting of interventions to improve dietary quality, particularly of women, children, and adolescent girls.","[Sraboni, Esha] Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Maxcy Hall,108 George St, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Quisumbing, Agnes] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brown University; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Sraboni, E (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Maxcy Hall,108 George St, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",esha_sraboni@brown.edu,,"Sraboni, Esha/0000-0002-0914-4997","NIH [T32 HD007338, P2C HD041020]; United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index through USAID [EEM-G-00-04-00013-00]; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH)",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index through USAID; CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH),"Background support for this study was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for the Policy Research and Strategy Support Program in Bangladesh and the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index through USAID Grant Number EEM-G-00-04-00013-00 and the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH).

Using an ecological study design and multivariate regression longitudinal estimation approaches, we find that carbonated soft drink sales were significantly positively related to BMI, overweight and obesity but only in the low and lower-middle income countries. This finding was robust to a number of sensitivity and falsification checks. In this sub-sample, an increase in per capita soft drink sales by 1 litre per year was related to an increase of BMI by about 0.009 kg/m(2) (p < 0.1).. This is a small effect, implying that halving annual consumption per capita in this group of countries would result in a drop of BMI by only about 0.03 kg/m(2). Although soft drink prices were negatively related to weight-related outcomes in the sample of higher middle income and high income countries, this finding was not robust to falsification checks. The results thus suggest that sales restrictions to steer consumers away from soft drinks could indeed have a beneficial health effects in poorer countries, although the effect magnitude appears to be very small. However, given potential limitations of using ecological research design, results from individual level studies would be required to further ascertain the role of soft drink sales and prices in obesity and diabetes.","[Goryakin, Yevgeniy] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Monsivais, Pablo] Univ Cambridge, Sch Clin Med, UKCRC Ctr Diet & Act Res, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Suhrcke, Marc] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Monsivais, Pablo] Washington State Univ, Elson S Floyd Coll Med, Dept Nutr & Exercise Physiol, Spokane, WA 99210 USA; [Suhrcke, Marc] Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette Belval, Luxembourg",University of East Anglia; University of Cambridge; University of York - UK; Washington State University,"Suhrcke, M (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.;Suhrcke, M (通讯作者)，Luxembourg Inst Socioecon Res, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette Belval, Luxembourg.",y.goryakin@uea.ac.uk; pm491@medschl.cam.ac.uk; marc.suhrcke@york.ac.uk,"Goryakin, Yevgeniy/E-4658-2015; Suhrcke, Marc/AAE-9024-2019","Goryakin, Yevgeniy/0000-0002-3063-6099; Monsivais, Pablo/0000-0002-7088-6674; Suhrcke, Marc/0000-0001-7263-8626","Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), a UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Public Health Research Centre of Excellence; British Heart Foundation; Cancer Research UK; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research [ES/G007462/1]; Wellcome Trust under UK Clinical Research Collaboration [087636/Z/08/Z]; ESRC [ES/G007462/1] Funding Source: UKRI; MRC [MR/K023187/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G007462/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MR/K023187/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), a UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) Public Health Research Centre of Excellence; British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Wellcome Trust under UK Clinical Research Collaboration(Wellcome Trust); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))","We thank seminar participants at iHEA 2015 in Milan and at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine for valuable comments received.

We test for within-firm, within-industry, and vertical effects. We find that the effect of FDI on the productivity of Chinese food firms depends significantly on the type of FDI and its countries of origin. FDI from non-HMT (Hong Kong, Macaw and Taiwan) regions can improve the productivity of the invested firm, and also increases the productivity of domestic food firms through vertical industry linkages. However, domestic food firms may be crowded out by non-HMT investment in the same industry. HMT investment can generate positive within-industry productivity spillovers, but negative vertical spillovers.

Yet, the notion that fertilizer use is too low is predicated on the assumption that it is profitable to use rates higher than currently observed. There is, however, limited empirical evidence to support this. Using a nationally representative panel dataset, this paper empirically estimates the profitability of fertilizer use for maize production in Nigeria. We find that fertilizer use in Nigeria is not as low as conventional wisdom suggests. Low marginal physical product and high transportation costs significantly reduce the profitability of fertilizer use. Apart from reduced transportation costs, other constraints such as soil quality, timely access to the product, and availability of complementary inputs such as improved seeds, irrigation and credit, as well as good management practices are also necessary for sustained agricultural productivity improvements.

It is found that smallholder farmers sell more to informal channels i.e. local traders and input dealers, and typically receive lower prices from them compared to the government-set minimum support prices (MSP). The prices realized from the sales in regulated markets are also less than the MSP despite these being claimed to be more transparent in price discovery. Econometric results show that farmers' access to transportation and information enables them to obtain better price terms from informal as well as formal channels. The effect of information is relatively stronger, implying that farmers' access to transportation itself is not sufficient but is effective when combined with provision of market information. Further, our proposition is that despite a positive impact of the improved market access on price realization from informal traders, farmer-trader relations are unlikely to undergo a meaningful change because of the tied transactions involving inputs, credit and outputs.","[Negi, Digvijay S.] Indian Stat Inst, New Delhi, India; [Birthal, Pratap S.] Natl Inst Agr Econ & Policy Res, New Delhi, India; [Roy, Devesh] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Agr Nutr & Hlth A4NH, New Delhi, India; [Khan, Md.

In the present study we analyse the GHGE and the potential climate change mitigation through dietary changes in a country with high beef consumption, to contribute to the debate on what constitutes a healthy and sustainable diet. Data collected in the National Survey of Household Income and Expenditure 2012/2013 was used to estimate the composition of the current diet in Argentina, and four dietary scenarios were developed following the nutritional recommendations of the National Dietary Guidelines (NDG). We found that the GHGE related to the current Argentinian diet are very high (5.48 +/- 1.71 kg CO2-eq/person/day), with beef production contributing to the largest share of emissions (71%). The NDG suggest a 50% reduction of total daily intake of meats compared to current consumption, which, if adopted, would reduce GHGE in 28%, to 3.95 +/- 0.96. Further reductions in GHGE appear possible while maintaining a healthy and balanced diet. The scenarios with non-ruminant meats and lacto-ovo vegetarian lead to similar GHGE, 2.11 +/- 0.41 and 1.73 +/- 0.37 kg CO2-eq/day/person, respectively; and the vegan diet results in the lowest, 1.47 +/- 0.34 kg CO2-eq/day/person. Indicators for nutrient efficiencies were also developed. All nutrient efficiencies decreased in diets with bovine meat with respect to the non-ruminant, vegetarian and vegan ones. The results of this study therefore indicate that a set of dietary changes would significantly contribute to lower GHGE. Argentina's NDG should include the environmental impacts of food consumption with the aim of raising consumer awareness.","[Arrieta, E.

But evidence on the implications of changing to low carbon food choices for both diet quality and food affordability are limited in the U.S. The objective of this study was to (a) estimate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) from U.S. household food purchases; (b) examine the source of GHGEs across U.S. food production industries and stages of the supply chain; and (c) show the association between GHGEs and spending by food categories and household sociodemographics. GHGEs from food expenditures made by households participating in the National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey were calculated using Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment. Results indicate that food purchases accounted for 16% of U.S. GHGEs in 2013 and average weekly household GHGEs were 71.8 kg carbon dioxide equivalents per standard adult. 68% of average weekly household GHGEs from food spending came from agriculture and food manufacturing stages of the food supply chain. Industries that produce animal proteins accounted for 30% of average weekly household GHGEs, the largest share of any food industry. Households generating the highest levels of GHGEs spent a significantly larger share of their food budget on protein foods compared to households generating lower levels of GHGEs. White households and those with higher education levels generated more GHGEs from food spending compared to non-white and less educated households. Overall these findings inform the ongoing debate about which diets or food spending patterns in the U.S. are best for mitigating GHGEs in the food system and if they are feasible for consumers to purchase.","[Boehm, Rebecca] Univ Connecticut, Zwick Ctr Food & Resource Policy, Rudd Ctr Food Policy & Obes, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Wilde, Parke E.; Cash, Sean B.] Tufts Univ, Friedman Sch Nutr Sci & Policy, 150 Harrison Ave, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Ver Ploeg, Michele] Econ Res Serv, USDA, 355 E St SW, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Costello, Christine] Univ Missouri, Coll Engn, W1024 Lafferre Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Connecticut; Tufts University; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Boehm, R (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Zwick Ctr Food & Resource Policy, Rudd Ctr Food Policy & Obes, 1376 Storrs Rd,Unit 4021, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",Rebecca.boehm@uconn.edu,"Wilde, Parke/B-6011-2009","Cash, Sean/0000-0002-7561-3392; Ver Ploeg, Michele/0000-0001-8476-7281",Friedman Family Foundation; Tufts University Institute of the Environment,Friedman Family Foundation; Tufts University Institute of the Environment,This work was funded by the Friedman Family Foundation Doctoral Fellowship and the Tufts University Institute of the Environment.,,33,44,59,7,67,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,67,76,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.05.004,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500007,0

We also observed indirect influence of sugarcane in non-producing regions. Two periods have been analyzed, 2006-2009, which is the beginning of the sugarcane expansion, and 2009-2013, which is the main expansion phase. In this state, sugarcane is essentially used for ethanol production, and soybean and livestock production are the main food products, together with corn. The shift-share method was used, with decomposition of the evolution in area, productivity and geographic location effects. The area effect was divided between scale and substitution effects. Data were collected from national and local databases. From 2006 to 2009, sugarcane areas replaced soybean in the best land areas. In the second period, sugarcane and soybeans occupied pasture areas. None of the activities surveyed decreased its production between 2006 and 2013. Sugarcane generated positive externalities on food production in the state, forcing the evolution of productivity, mainly in cattle raising. Positive impact of sugarcane on the productivity of livestock and soybean reduces indirect effects of the production of biofuels on land use and didn't have a negative effect on food production. The increase in food consumption had a much greater impact on the evolution of crops, with a high increase in cultivated areas of soybean and pastures in Brazil.","[Defante, Lilliane Renata; Sauer, Leandro] Fed Univ Mato Grosso Sul UFMS, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Vilpoux, Olivier Francois] Catholic Univ Campo Grande UCDB, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul,"Vilpoux, OF (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Campo Grande UCDB, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.",vilpoux@ucdb.br; leandrosauer@uol.com.br,"Vilpoux, Olivier Francois/E-7816-2015","Vilpoux, Olivier Francois/0000-0001-8457-2070",,,,,51,16,19,0,29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,121,131,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.06.005,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500012,0

The fundamental purpose of this reform is to implement people-centered development and to improve the level of social productivity. As different types of farmers have different needs in terms of management incentives, it is necessary to evaluate the attitudes of Chinese farmers in the period of agricultural supply-side structural reform. In this study we used the Q-methodology to divide 26 grain-planting farmers in the Huaihe Basin into three types, positive development farmer (PD), negative development farmer (ND) and family support farmer (FS), based on their attitudes towards policy, land, livelihood and planting plan. We found that: (1) Policy: FS-type evaluated the direct subsidy policy most highly. In contrast, ND-type had the most negative attitudes toward food-related policies. (2) Land: PD-type, which are representative of the new generation of grain farmers, had the highest dependence on the land, and land resources are likely to become their most scarce resource. (3) Livelihood: ND type had the highest responsiveness to livelihoods, and they were most inclined to co-op. (4) Planting plan: FS type were the most likely to replace food crops with cash crops. PD-type's planting plan is limited by the sales capacity, and ND-type's planting plan is most affected by technology. According to the characteristics of Chinese farmers, expanding the classification of different aspects is not only the development of the Q classification in the study of farmers, but also a new perspective to study the individual differences of Chinese farmers under the background of supply-side structural reform.","[Hu, Yun-fei; You, Fei; Luo, Qi-you] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Agricultural Resources & Regional Planning, CAAS","You, F (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Resources & Reg Planning, Beijing, Peoples R China.",huyunfei2015@qq.com; youfei@caas.cn,,,,,,,46,8,8,2,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,AUG,2018,79.0,,,,,,224,234,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2018.07.007,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,GV3KT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445993500020,0

This exploratory qualitative study examines obstacles to PP adoption and their relative importance, strategies used to protect PPs from livestock damage, and the conditions that shape the emergence and effectiveness of Community Based Livestock Management (CBLM) arrangements to prevent PP damage. We conducted focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and key-informant interviews in five communities at different levels and duration of PP adoption, and used theoretical insights from agrarian political economy. Livestock damage was the biggest obstacle to PP growing in new PP sites; poor markets and production factors dominated in the established sites. Individual crop-protection strategies were often time-consuming, costly, and/or ineffective. While chief-based livestock-management systems protected all crops satisfactorily during the rainy season, they were insufficient to protect PPs during the dry season. CBLM arrangements controlled livestock damage and protected PP relatively effectively throughout the year. Implemented only at the relatively established PP-growing sites, CBLM arrangements were most effective at the site (Mpokwa) where PP prices were good and markets reliable, PP was the top or major cash crop, PP growers were powerful and in the majority, and institutions pre-existed for use in CBLM. The findings lead to the following hypothesis: smallholder farmers are likely to invest time and energy in collective livestock-management approaches to prevent damage to pigeon peas when expected economic benefits of adoption exceed perceived costs for most growers, mediated by socioeconomic differentiation and power relations among major stakeholders. Future research should empirically examine determinants of CBLM emergence for PP protection and scale-up.","[Zulu, Leo Charles] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Adams, Ellis Adjei] Georgia State Univ, Dept Geosci, Global Studies Inst, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Chikowo, Regis] Univ Zimbabwe, Dept Soil Sci & Agr Engn, POB MP167, Harare, Zimbabwe; [Snapp, Sieglinde] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, Dept Plant Soil & Microbial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Zimbabwe; Michigan State University,"Zulu, LC (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",zulu@msu.edu,"Snapp, Sieg/GWQ-5774-2022","Snapp, Sieg/0000-0002-9738-0649; Adams, Ellis/0000-0003-3783-9005",Global Center for Food Systems Innovation (GCFSI) - United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [D-OAA-A-13-00006],Global Center for Food Systems Innovation (GCFSI) - United States Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"This research was supported by the Global Center for Food Systems Innovation (GCFSI) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID, Grant D-OAA-A-13-00006), although the views expressed in the manuscript are of the authors alone and do not reflect those of USAID.

Any policy designed to improve food access in non-metro U.S. areas should recognize that improving stores' profitability is crucial to policy success in the long-run. We adapt an empirical entry model to assess the effectiveness of two types of policies to improve food access - demand-stimulating policies (DSP), such as increases in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollars, and supply-side policies (SSP), such as subsidies to reduce establishment costs - by estimating the minimum market size needed for one or more large food stores in non-metro U.S. counties to be profitable. We find that neither type of intervention is preferred a priori and that the cost-effectiveness of each policy type depends upon the presence of an adjacent metropolitan county, the number of preexisting stores, and the duration of the demand-side stimuli. Additionally, our results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of broad-based policy solutions to improve physical access to large food stores or to stimulate demand may be limited when it comes to easing entry in areas with multiple stores.","[Cleary, Rebecca] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B332 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Bonanno, Alessandro] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B327 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Chenarides, Lauren] Arizona State Univ, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, WP Carey Sch Business, 7231 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall,Santan 235D, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, 207-C Armsby Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Colorado State University; Colorado State University; Arizona State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Bonanno, A (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, B327 Clark Bldg, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",rebecca.cleary@colostate.edu; alessandro.bonanno@colostate.edu; lauren.chenarides@asu.edu; sgoetz@psu.edu,,"Cleary, Rebecca/0000-0003-1515-9156; Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X","USDA/NIFA under Global Food Security Grant [2011-68004-30057]; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania State University; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania Colorado State University; NIFA [2011-68004-30057, 687258] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",USDA/NIFA under Global Food Security Grant; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania State University; Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania Colorado State University; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from USDA/NIFA under Global Food Security Grant No. 2011-68004-30057 (Enhancing the Food Security of Underserved Populations in the Northeast U.S. through Sustainable Regional Food Systems Development) and the Agricultural Experiment Station of The Pennsylvania State University and Colorado State University.

This paper analyses the impact of survey characteristics on the measurement of food consumption from a sample of 81 national surveys. Results highlight regularities that can inform best practices in designing surveys and promoting the use of the data for multiple purposes. Surveys focused on food acquisition collect higher food quantities compared to those that target food consumption. Surveys based on recall interviews collect higher food quantities compared to those based on diaries, but the difference decreases with long reference periods. The use of standard units of measurement as well as the consideration of partakers in meals and of seasonality generates significant differences in the survey results. The impact of the different survey characteristics carries substantive implications when food consumption data are employed for assessing food security conditions. The results are part of a wider work program aimed at improving the quality of household survey data. More evidence is needed, ideally through coordinated sets of analyses and experiments in different contexts. Additionally, survey characteristics must be complemented by effective field work in order to generate high quality data. Towards this end, statistical capacity development is crucial to promote better data and more evidence-based decision making.","[Conforti, Piero; Grunberger, Klaus; Troubat, Nathalie] FAO Stat Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy",,"Conforti, P (通讯作者)，FAO Stat Div, Viale Terme Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy.",Piero.Conforti@fao.org,,,,,,,36,6,7,1,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2017,72.0,,,,SI,,43,52,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.011,0.0,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FM3EX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414888200005,0

Usually the analysis assumes that the household's food is distributed among its members in direct proportion to each member's share of the household's total energy requirements; what is referred to as the adult male equivalent (AME) approach. Using the 2011-2012 Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey which collected consumption data for all members of rural households using combined 24-hour recall (24HR) and food weighing methods this study directly compared probability-based average estimates of intakes, intake gaps, and the prevalence of inadequacies as estimated by the 24HR and those calculated using the AME approach for energy and each of four micronutrients: vitamin A, iron, zinc, and calcium. At the population level, for iron, vitamin A, and calcium, more than 97% of all individuals had the same estimated prevalence of adequate or inadequate nutrient intakes using 24HR and AME-based estimates. In the case of energy and zinc, roughly 77 and 83% of the sample population had identical adequacy statuses, respectively. The magnitude of inadequacies (the nutrient gaps) differed by 8 percentage points for energy and less than 3 percentage points for the four micronutrients. Disaggregating intakes and inadequacies by age groups revealed that the vast majority of variance between the two methods was highly concentrated in the first few years of life. Children 3 years of age and younger constituted 7.5% of the population but had 13.1% of the inconsistencies in intake adequacy status. 54% of children 3 and under had at least one pair of inconsistent prevalence estimates. While there are important differences in the levels of estimated energy and micronutrient intakes using 24HR and the AME-based estimates for children 3 and under, the results are remarkably comparable for the rest of the population.","[Sununtnasuk, Celeste] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA; [Fiedler, John L.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Agr Nutr & Hlth & Poverty A4NH, Hlth & Nutr Div, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Sununtnasuk, C (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Poverty Hlth & Nutr Div, 1201 Eye St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA.",c.sununtnasuk@cgiar.org; fiedler.jack@gmail.com,,,"Strengthening Partnerships, Results and Innovations in Nutrition Globally (SPRING) Project of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) [AID-OAA-A-11-00031]","Strengthening Partnerships, Results and Innovations in Nutrition Globally (SPRING) Project of the US Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID))","This work was undertaken as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health (A4NH) and supported by the Strengthening Partnerships, Results and Innovations in Nutrition Globally (SPRING) Project of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under Cooperative Agreement No. AID-OAA-A-11-00031.",,42,39,44,0,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-9192,1873-5657,,FOOD POLICY,Food Policy,OCT,2017,72.0,,,,SI,,121,131,,10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.08.018,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology; Nutrition & Dietetics,FM3EX,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000414888200012,0

This paper develops a multi-market simulation model to evaluate the impact of common production and world-price shocks on food consumption of vulnerable groups in Sahelian West Africa. Empirical analysis confirms that poor households bear the brunt of ensuing consumption risks, particularly in closed markets, where trade barriers restrict imports, and the poor find themselves in a bidding war with richer consumers for limited food supplies. In the absence of trade, a drought that reduces domestic rainfed cereal production by 20% would compress already low calorie consumption of the rural poor by as much as 15%, four times as much as other household groups. Conversely, a 50% spike in world rice prices hits the urban poor hardest, compressing calorie consumption by up to 8%. Policy responses need to focus on two basic mechanisms that can help to moderate this pressure consumer substitution among staple foods and trade. Immediately south of the Sahel, coastal West African countries enjoy higher rainfall, dual rainy seasons, more stable staple food production based on root crops (cassava and yams) as well as frequent double cropping of maize. Our simulation results suggest that regional trade in maize, yams and cassava-based prepared foods like gari and attieke could fill over one-third of the consumption shortfall resulting from a major drought in the Sahel. Increasing substitutability across starchy staples, for example through expansion of maize, cassava and sorghum-based convenience foods, would further moderate consumption pressure by expanding the array of food alternatives and hence supply responses available during periods of stress.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are studied in the context of changing political environments. Explaining two different trajectories, we combine path dependency theories and a Polanyi inspired 'varieties of capitalism' framework with corporate strategy theories on food industry M&As.

Under complete and competitive markets, households can solve their consumption and production problems separately, so that household factor endowments do not predict input demand. This paper implements a simple, theoretically grounded test of this separation hypothesis, which can be interpreted as a reduced form test of market failure. In all five study countries, the analysis finds strong evidence of factor market failure. Moreover, those failures appear general and structural, not specific to subpopulations defined by gender, geography, human capital, or land quality. However, we show that rural markets are not generally missing in an absolute sense, suggesting that market existence is less of a problem than market function. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Most studies either focus on women who experience healthy pregnancy or mixed risk samples. These results may not be generalised across the childbearing continuum to women with risk factors. This review critically evaluates studies that measure the cost of care for women with complex pregnancies, with a focus on method and quality. To critically appraise and summarise the evidence relating to the combined cost-effectiveness, resource use and clinical effectiveness of midwifery continuity models for women who experience complex pregnancies and their babies in developed countries. Structured review of the literature utilising a matrix method to critique the methods and quality of studies. A search of Medline, CINAHL, MIDIRS, DARE, EMBASE, OVID, PubMed, ProQuest, Informit, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHSEED) for the years 1994 - 2018 was conducted. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The review identified four areas of economic evaluation that related to women who experienced complex pregnancy and continuity of midwifery care. (1) cost and clinical effectiveness comparisons between continuity of midwifery care versus obstetric-led units; (2) cost of continuity of midwifery care and/or team midwifery compared to Standard Care; (3) cost-effectiveness of continuity of midwifery care for Australian Aboriginal women versus standard care; (4) patterns of antenatal care for women of high obstetric risk and comparative provider cost. Cost savings specific to women from high risk samples who received continuity of midwifery care compared with obstetric-led standard care was stated for only one study in the review. Kenny et al. 1994 identified cost savings of AUS $29 in the antenatal period for women who received the midwifery team model from a stratified sub-set of high-risk pregnant woman within a mixed risk sample of 446 women. One systematic review relevant to the UK context, Ryan et al. (2013), applied sensitivity analysis to include women of all risk categories. Where risk ratio for overall fetal/neonatal death was systematically varied based on the 95% confidence interval of 0.79 to 1.09 from pooled studies, the aggregate annual net monetary benefit for continuity of midwifery care ranged extremely widely from an estimated gain of A 472 pound million to a loss of A 202 pound million. Net health benefit ranged from an annual gain of 15 723 QALYs to a loss of 6 738 QALYs. All other studies in this review reported cost savings narratively or within mixed risk samples where risk stratification was not clearly stated or related to the midwifery team model only. Studies that measure the cost of continuity of midwifery care for women with complex pregnancy across the childbearing continuum are limited and apply inconsistent methods of economic evaluation. The cost and outcomes of implementing continuity of midwifery care for women with complex pregnancy is an important issue that requires further investigation. Robust cost-effectiveness evidence is essential to inform decision makers, to implement sustainable systems change in comparative maternity models for pregnant women at risk and to address health inequity.","[Donnellan-Fernandez, Roslyn E.; Creedy, Debra K.] Griffith Univ, Transforming Matern Care Collaborat Nursing & Mid, Logan Campus,Univ Dr, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia; [Callander, Emily J.] Griffith Univ, Menzies Hlth Inst Queensland, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Logan Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Menzies Health Institute Queensland,"Donnellan-Fernandez, RE (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Transforming Matern Care Collaborat Nursing & Mid, Logan Campus,Univ Dr, Meadowbrook, Qld 4131, Australia.",r.donnellan-fernandez@griffith.edu.au,"Creedy, Debra K./AAD-2600-2021; Donnellan-Fernandez, Roslyn/L-9790-2019; Callander, Emily/M-5679-2017","Creedy, Debra K./0000-0002-3046-4143; Donnellan-Fernandez, Roslyn/0000-0002-7011-8923; Callander, Emily/0000-0001-7233-6804",WCH Foundation SA,WCH Foundation SA,Doctoral research of the first author was supported through a Midwifery Fellowship provided by WCH Foundation SA.,,73,9,9,1,13,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

This involves aligning the views and interests of diverse actors, guiding and intervening as a means of realizing a long-term vision. Backcasting is a technique often used in sustainability transitions, but its use is relatively new to emerging and developing countries. This paper follows Energy 2050, a long-term policy design exercise developed in Chile. In a country with few mechanisms for energy planning, Energy 2050 was to produce a long-term policy with social legitimacy; a roadmap of interventions leading the transition to a sustainable energy system. We analyse the introduction of novel, future-oriented methods in the Chilean context as a policy innovation, focusing on the trade-offs between long-term thinking and the instrument's immediate value. Focusing on the role of consensus-building, visioning and scenario building, and participation, we show the reflexive relation between promises and expectations, and the process that shapes them, highlighting how expectations about policies shape and limit the way in which futures are imagined and articulated. In this respect, we stress the importance of designing backcasting exercises which consider the political cultures in which they are embedded.","[Alvial-Palavicino, Carla; Opazo-Bunster, Jose] Nucleo Milenio Invest Energia & Soc NUMIES, Alameda 1845 Dept 301, Santiago, Chile; [Alvial-Palavicino, Carla] Univ Diego Portales, Inst Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile; [Opazo-Bunster, Jose] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Business Sch, Santiago, Chile",University Diego Portales; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Alvial-Palavicino, C (通讯作者)，Nucleo Milenio Invest Energia & Soc NUMIES, Alameda 1845 Dept 301, Santiago, Chile.;Alvial-Palavicino, C (通讯作者)，Univ Diego Portales, Inst Ciencias Sociales, Santiago, Chile.",carla.alvial@gmail.com; jose.opazo@uai.cl,,"Alvial Palavicino, Carla/0000-0002-6098-0501","Iniciativa Milenio, Nikko Milenio de Investigacion en Energia y Sociedad of the Government of Chile [NS 130024]","Iniciativa Milenio, Nikko Milenio de Investigacion en Energia y Sociedad of the Government of Chile","This research was funded by Iniciativa Milenio, Nikko Milenio de Investigacion en Energia y Sociedad NS 130024 of the Government of Chile.

However in the last few decades cash has been progressively losing its preeminence in favour of electronic handling of money transactions. The shift to a cashless society, in which physical money is completely or almost completely replaced by electronic records is on the horizon. Regardless of its advantages and disadvantages, electronic handling of money needs the support of a complex technological infrastructure which operation depends on many factors. This paper discusses this subject in detail, identifies the main threats linked to electronic money handling and evaluates their possible impacts on societies that no longer rely on cash.","[de Almeida, Pedro; Fazendeiro, Paulo; Inacio, Pedro R.

We study the quality of K-12 public school placements relative to revealed family preferences using data from New Orleans, where a market-based school system allocates most seats through a centralized enrollment lottery. We propose a theory of family utility maximization under school choice systems with and without guaranteed placements. Using an instrumental variables strategy, we estimate the causal effect of losing a school placement lottery on the school quality a student receives. We find a significant gap between preferred and actual school quality for students who do not win a first-choice assignment, some of which is regained when multiple rounds of assignment are offered. From the supply side, this allows schools of choice to operate with weak demand by enrolling students who fail to win assignment to oversubscribed schools of greater quality and higher preference ranking.","[Lincove, Jane Arnold] Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Sch Publ Policy, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA; [Valant, Jon] Brookings Inst, 1775 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Cowen, Joshua M.] Michigan State Univ, Coll Educ, Erickson Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore County; Brookings Institution; Michigan State University,"Lincove, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Sch Publ Policy, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA.",jlincove@umbc.edu; jvalant@brookings.edu; jcowen@msu.edu,,"Lincove, Jane/0000-0001-6656-8537",ERA-New Orleans,ERA-New Orleans,"We thank the Louisiana Recovery School District and Louisiana Department of Education for data access, Abigail Goodman for research assistance, and other ERA-New Orleans colleagues for research support.

We find that upstream use of rivers for bathing and associated sanitary practices can explain as many as 7.5% of all diarrhea-related deaths annually. We also find suggestive evidence for differential avoidance behavior in response to different pollutants.

In a market that covers multiple sectors, the optimal design combines auctioned permits with output-based allocations that are specific to each sector and increasing in its volatility.

The central government has designated the three rivers and three lakes basins (3Rs3Ls) as key regions for water pollution control and has imposed a variety of regulations to improve water quality in those basins. This paper evaluates the effects of the water quality regulations on firms' emissions of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and productivity in the 3Rs3Ls basins. We find that although the water quality regulations forced many small, heavily-polluting firms to shut down, they had no statistically significant effects on surviving firms' productivity because they were ineffective in reducing their COD emissions. A policy that forces the surviving firms to reduce their emissions would reduce their output values and productivity, at least in the short run. However, the effect is likely to be small. Specifically, a 10% reduction in total COD emissions from the industrial sectors would require only a 0.1% reduction in output values under the current production technologies. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and sampling strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Results suggest heterogeneous effects. Taking developmental reading and writing versus just writing coursework has no impact on the educational outcomes of native English-speaking students.

Such a concept has emerged as an overarching horizontal discipline in the latest generation of preferential trade agreements and aims to reduce unnecessary regulatory incompatibilities between countries in order to facilitate cross-border trade and investment. Differing approaches to regulatory convergence found in recently concluded PTAs, or are currently under negotiation, are examined, with a special focus on the regulatory cooperation' approach embedded in CETA, the path of regulatory improvement' taken by members of the Pacific Alliance, and the regulatory coherence' track included in the TPP. We also refer to the TTIP negotiations conducted between the EU and the US. The article offers a broad understanding of the different ways in which regulatory convergence is implemented across PTAs, and the legal complexities resulting from the ambiguity of the concept. It further describes the scope and effects of the different mechanisms used to achieve regulatory convergence, on both substantive and procedural matters.","[Lazo, Rodrigo Polanco] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Sauve, Pierre] World Bank Grp Trade & Competitiveness Global Pra, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Lazo, RP (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland.",rodrigo.polanco@wti.org; psauve@worldbank.org,"Lazo, Rodrigo Polanco/K-2775-2015","Lazo, Rodrigo Polanco/0000-0003-1974-5523",,,,,68,14,16,1,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2018,17.0,4,,,,,575,607,,10.1017/S1474745617000519,0.0,,,33,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GX1QX,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447494100002,0

Duration analysis is employed to measure the duration of U.S. exports and imports of forest products over 1996-2016 and to examine the underlying determinants. Outcomes from the descriptive statistical analysis reveal that the duration of U.S. forest products trade is remarkably short, with a median duration of one quarter based on the quarterly data, or one year for the annual data. The duration of trade spells also varies across different types of forest products. Based on the discrete-time duration model, several determinants of export and import duration are identified at the country and product level. Gravity-type variables (e.g., distance and income) are found to affect the likelihood of trade ceasing. Better endowments in forest resources can improve the survival rate of forest products trade. In designing policies to reduce the pressure of import growth, promote exports of forest products, or have a better trade balance, the differences in trade direction and product features should be considered.","[Sun, Changyou; Zhang, Xufang] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA",Mississippi State University,"Sun, CY (通讯作者)，Mississippi State Univ, Dept Forestry, Mississippi State, MS 39762 USA.",cs258@msstate.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station [15-JV-11261975-024]","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service)","The study was partially supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station under agreement 15-JV-11261975-024.

Methods: Systematic searches were performed in the databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database for relevant studies before May 2016. The quality of the methodological design was assessed with items regarding methodology from the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). The systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Thirty-two relevant studies were included. None of the reviewed studied fully complied with the CHEERS methodological checklist. Background and objectives, Target population and subgroups and Setting and location were covered in sufficient details in all studies whereas the Study perspective, Justification of the time horizon, Discount rate, and Estimating resources and costs were covered in less than 50%. Most of the studies (29/32) used the health care sector perspective whereas the societal perspective was applied in three studies. The time horizon was stated in 18/32 of the studies. Conclusions: The methodological quality of studies evaluating costs of robotic surgery was low.

Key determinants, such as purchasing, maintenance costs of the robotic platform, and the use of surgical equipment, were rarely reported.

The restriction imposed a uniform quota on water use with a 5-year allocation and allowed trading of the quota within the restricted area. Our analysis exploits unique micro-level data on irrigated water use, irrigated acreage, and crops. We use a difference-in-differences econometric strategy that also includes farmer-time fixed effects to estimate the response to the restriction, where we exploit water rights between 2 and 5 miles of the policy boundary as a control group. Results indicate that farmers reduced water use by 26% due to the policy with most of the response due to reductions in water use intensity on the same crops rather than through reductions in irrigated acreage or changes in crops. The results imply that the short run welfare impact of the policy was smaller than a policy that reduces irrigated acreage. (C) 2018 The Authors.

We developed a recreation demand model to monetize economic damages associated with lost shoreline recreational user days attributable to the spill. The unprecedented magnitude of the spill disruption led to a variety of innovations. We estimate a model of shoreline recreation trips to the Gulf Coast region from the general population of the contiguous U.S., combining single and multiple day trips, calculating travel costs that incorporate detailed information on flying costs and transportation mode choice, and using alternative-specific constants to control for site characteristics. Losses per recreational user day are assessed using utility adjustments that reproduce the decline in recreation observed through onsite counts. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate our lost user day value is robust to changes in income imputation, nesting structure, site aggregation and spill calibration, and show the importance of accounting for flying as a mode choice. Estimated losses from the primary shoreline study are $520 million (166) out of the total recreational damages of $661 million (2015$). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The new budgets incorporate increases in consumer prices and community standards and reflect changes in item availability, retail practices and shopping behaviour, as well as improved research methods, 20years of use and experience, and new data. They are designed to achieve a minimum income for healthy living standard and apply to families with a breadwinner who is either in full-time work and receiving the minimum wage, or unemployed and receiving Newstart Allowance. The estimates suggest that although the minimum wage is adequate for single people, it is not adequate to meet the needs of many couple families with and without children, while Newstart Allowance does not provide an adequate safety net for the unemployed, whatever their family status.","[Saunders, Peter] Univ New South Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Bedford, Megan] Univ New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Saunders, P (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",p.saunders@unsw.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [LP120200481]; Catholic Social Services Australia; United Voice (National Office); Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS); Australian Research Council [LP120200481] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Catholic Social Services Australia; United Voice (National Office); Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The research described here was funded by the Australian Research Council (under Linkage Grant project LP120200481) and was conducted in partnership with Catholic Social Services Australia, United Voice (National Office) and the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), who provided a mix of cash and in-kind support.",,30,7,7,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

However, to communicate, prioritize and mitigate such risks it is important to estimate their relative significance. Risk probabilities are typically used, but for existential risks they are problematic due to ambiguity, and because quantitative probabilities do not represent some aspects of these risks. Thus, a standardized and easily comprehensible instrument is called for, to communicate dangers from various global catastrophic and existential risks. In this article, inspired by the Torino scale of asteroid danger, we suggest a color coded scale to communicate the magnitude of global catastrophic and existential risks. The scale is based on the probability intervals of risks in the next century if they are available. The risks' estimations could be adjusted based on their severities and other factors. The scale covers not only existential risks, but smaller size global catastrophic risks. It consists of six color levels, which correspond to previously suggested levels of prevention activity. We estimate artificial intelligence risks as red, while orange risks include nanoteclmology, synthetic biology, full scale nuclear war and a large global agricultural shortfall (caused by regional nuclear war, coincident extreme weather, etc.) The risks of natural pandemic, supervolcanic eruption and global warming are marked as yellow and the danger from asteroids is green.","[Turchin, Alexey] Sci Life Extens Fdn, Moscow, Russia; [Denkenberger, David] Tennessee State Univ, Global Catastroph Risk Inst, Alliance Feed Earth Disasters, Nashville, TN 37203 USA",Tennessee State University,"Turchin, A (通讯作者)，Sci Life Extens Fdn, Moscow, Russia.",a.turchin@scienceagainstaging.com; ddenkenb@tnstate.edu,"Denkenberger, David/M-1383-2019",,,,,,69,21,21,2,25,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,27,38,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.003,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900004,0

By eliminating these deaths, the life expectancy could be prolonged. Since the mortality of population during working period has higher importance in terms of economic consequences of diseases, this article aims to assess the potential gains in life expectancy (PGLEs) of the Slovak population comparing the entire life span and working life-time. Methods: Data are obtained from the National Health Information Center mortality reports by sex during 1996-2014, and the method of constructing abridged life tables is used to compute the corresponding PGLEs. The added years, which would be gained by eliminating causes of deaths, are decomposed by the two sets of working age groups population (25-44 and 45-64 years). Results: The highest impact on life expectancy was recorded in chronic ischemic heart disease for both sexes aged 45-64 years (0.078 for males, 0.019 added years for females) over 1996-2014. However, they showed a small declining trend (- 16%) for males and even an increasing trend (2%) for females. At present, the labour force potential of working group (25-44 years) is most threatened by deaths from cerebrovascular diseases, while population of working age (45-64 years) by deaths from chronic ischemic heart disease. Relative importance of acute coronary syndrome for males (45-64 years) increased, when comparing the entire with working time life. Conclusions: The findings pose new and immediate challenges to policy makers and provoke discussion about prevention program strategies leading to increasing the life expectancy.","[Gavurova, Beata; Vagasova, Tatiana] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [1/0846/18]","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This study was funded by the VEGA Project No. 1/0846/18: Evaluation of the efficiency of public procurement of selected commodities in healthcare facilities in the Slovak Republic from The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.",,26,7,7,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

This study aimed to evaluate whether age is associated with health care costs in the senior elderly, using electronic health records for 98,220 participants aged 80 years and over registered with the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and linked Hospital Episode Statistics (2010-2014). Annual costs of health care utilization were estimated from a two-part model; multiple fractional polynomial models were employed to evaluate the non-linear association of age with predicted health care costs while also controlling for comorbidities, impairments, and death proximity. Annual health care costs increased from 80 years (A 2972 pound in men, A 2603 pound in women) to 97 (men; A 4721) pound or 98 years (women; A 3963) pound, before declining. Costs were significantly elevated in the last year of life but this effect declined with age, from A 10,027 pound in younger octogenarians to A 7021 pound in centenarians. This decline was steeper in participants with comorbidities or impairments; A 14,500 pound for 80-84-year-olds and A 6752 pound for centenarians with 7+ impairments. At other times, comorbidity and impairments, not age, were main drivers of costs. We conclude that comorbidities, impairments, and proximity to death are key mediators of age-related increases in health care costs. While the costs of comorbidity among survivors are not generally associated with age, additional costs in the last year of life decline with age.","[Hazra, Nisha C.; Gulliford, Martin C.] Kings Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Guys Campus,3rd Floor Addison House, London SE1 1UL, England; [Rudisill, Caroline] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy, London, England; [Gulliford, Martin C.] Guys & St Thomas Natl Hlth Serv Fdn Trust, Biomed Res Ctr, Natl Inst Hlth Res, London, England",University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,"Hazra, NC (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Primary Care & Publ Hlth Sci, Guys Campus,3rd Floor Addison House, London SE1 1UL, England.",nisha.hazra@kcl.ac.uk,"Rudisill, Caroline/IUO-5377-2023; Gulliford, Martin/I-8606-2018","Hazra, Nisha/0000-0002-1424-6525; Gulliford, Martin/0000-0003-1898-9075",Dunhill Medical Trust [R392/1114]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London,Dunhill Medical Trust(Dunhill Medical Trust); National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London; St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London,This work was supported in part by the Dunhill Medical Trust [Grant number: R392/1114].

Our purpose is to examine the extent to which the concept can still be considered tenable for describing and explaining the development of the interaction between the political economy and concepts of production, notably in Germany. First, we show why and in which ways DQP was more heterogeneous than we had originally understood. Then, on the basis of evidence with respect to political, business, and economic changes in Germany, we show that DQP Mark I, a regime by and large characteristic of the 1980s, turned into DQP Mark II. In the process, major 'complementarities' disappeared between the late 1980s and now- mainly the complementarity between production modes on the one hand and industrial relations and economic regulation on the other. While the latter exhibit greater change, business strategies and production organization show more continuity, which helps explain how Germany maintained economic performance after the mid-2000s, more than other countries in Europe. Conceptually, our most important result is that the complementarities emphasized in political economy are historically relative and limited, so that they should not be postulated as stable configurations.","[Sorge, Arndt] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; [Streeck, Wolfgang] Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",University of Potsdam; Max Planck Society,"Sorge, A (通讯作者)，Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany.",arsorge@uni-potsdam.de,,,,,,,23,20,22,2,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This study of the impacts of forest certification on Chilean forestry businesses is based in-depth interviews with 72 actors representing a diversity of roles and perspectives in the Chilean forestry sector. The impacts of certification have been greatest in the plantation forestry sector, and for larger businesses. These impacts include the cessation of deforestation for plantation establishment, rehabilitation of natural ecosystems, greater benefits to local communities, and the development of a positive dialogue between forestry businesses and their stakeholders. However, certification has not resolved some long-standing conflicts between forestry businesses and other actors, notably in relation to Indigenous peoples' land claims and workers' rights. Both certification schemes in Chile have promoted legal compliance; FSC certification is encouraging improvements beyond legal compliance, and deepening the changes initiated by CERTFOR. The results illustrate how certification can contribute to effective hybrid governance regimes, but also of the limits of certification in addressing deeply-entrenched social conflicts. Nevertheless, the impacts of certification for Chilean forestry businesses and their stakeholders have largely been positive.","[Tricallotis, Marcos] ANU Coll Med Biol & Environm, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Bldg 48 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Gunningham, Neil] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Asia & Pacific, Regulatory Inst Network, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Kanowski, Peter] Australian Natl Univ, Univ House, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; Australian National University,"Tricallotis, M (通讯作者)，ANU Coll Med Biol & Environm, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Bldg 48 Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",marcos.tricallotis@anu.edu.au; neil.gunningham@anu.edu.au; peter.kanowski@anu.edu.au,,"Gunningham, Neil/0000-0002-3279-6344",National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT) [72090401],National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT),"We thank Fred Gale for his contribution to this research, which was part of the senior author's PhD studies at the Fenner School of Environment and Society, The Australian National University, supported by the National Commission of Scientific and Technological Research of Chile (CONICYT) (grant number 72090401).

Four databases were investigated using a strategy refined through a highly sensitive filter for systematic reviews. References were screened and a search for grey literature was performed. Identified citations were scrutinized against pre-defined eligibility criteria and data were extracted using a customized extraction template. Evidence on known group validity, convergent validity and responsiveness was extracted and reviewed by narrative synthesis. Quality of the included reviews was assessed using a modified version of the AMSTAR checklist. Thirty reviews were included, sixteen of which were of excellent or good quality. The body of evidence, covering more than 180 studies, was heavily skewed towards EQ-5D, with significantly fewer studies investigating HUI3 and SF-6D, and very few the 15D and AQoL. There was also lack of head-to-head comparisons between GPBMs and the tests reported by the reviews were often weak. Where there was evidence, EQ-5D, SF-6D, HUI3, 15D and AQoL seemed generally valid and responsive instruments, although not for all conditions. Evidence was not consistently reported across reviews. Although generally valid, EQ-5D, SF-6D and HUI3 suffer from some problems and perform inconsistently in some populations. The lack of head-to-head comparisons and the poor reporting impedes the comparative assessment of the performance of GPBMs. This highlights the need for large comparative studies designed to test instruments' performance.","[Finch, Aureliano Paolo; Brazier, John Edward; Mukuria, Clara] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 1 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Finch, AP (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 1 Mappin St, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England.",APFinch1@sheffield.ac.uk,"Finch, Aureliano/AAU-5885-2021; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",,,,,48,68,71,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Lymphatic diseases have considerable public health significance, but yet few professionals are specialised in their management causing a substantial burden on health resources. Aims and objectives: This study aims to give an overview of the approximate number of medical professionals, professional societies, institutions and companies dealing with lymphoedema in various countries. Concepts of improvement for current human resources are considered. Methods: An online database analysis (Google search engine and PubMed) was carried out for each country of the world. Additionally, relevant congress participant lists as well as member lists of significant medical societies and reports of the World Health Organisation were analysed. Results: Overall distribution of tertiary level professionals specialised in this field is heterogenous. A decrescent gradient of professionals can be seen between developed and developing countries and between urban and rural areas. Countries in general do not seem to have yet met the current demand for specialists at tertiary level in this field. Conclusions: This study intends to draw attention to the current medical coverage gaps due to a low number of lymphoedema specialists at tertiary level. It wishes to start a discussion about structured reimbursement and certification of knowledge and skills that are essential incentives for experts to act as multiplicators and change the lack of care in the mid-term. Current fail prescriptions and evitable disability and sick certificates represent a high financial burden that could be reinvested in a correct management. Policy makers must focus in the two above mentioned essential measures. Medical training and the consequent development of the industry will then naturally take place, as it was the case for other professional groups in the past.","[Schulze, Henrike; Gutenbrunner, Christoph] Hannover Med Sch, Clin Rehabil Med, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany; [Nacke, Marisa] Canc Res UK, Beatson Inst, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Hadamitzky, Catarina] Practice Lympho Vasc Dis, Bahnhofstr 12, Hannover, Germany",Hannover Medical School; Beatson Institute; Cancer Research UK,"Schulze, H (通讯作者)，Hannover Med Sch, Clin Rehabil Med, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.",henrikeschulze@hotmail.de,,,European Union [527658 - LLP-1-2012-1-DE-ERASMUS-ESMO],European Union(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by the European Union [527658 - LLP-1-2012-1-DE-ERASMUS-ESMO].

We employ a class of non-parametric methods to explore the complex structure of the data and a set of correlated random effects models to identify key determinants of the quality of stroke care. The organisational quality of the process of stroke care appears as a fundamental driver of clinical quality of stroke care. There are rich complementarities amongst drivers of quality of stroke care.

These populations meet with specific obstacles leading to late diagnosis and access to medical care. Delayed access to care (ATC) for HIV-infected migrants reduces their life expectancy and quality of life. Given the reduction of infectivity under antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, delayed ATC for HIV-infected migrants may also hinder the control of the HIV epidemic. The objective of this study is to measure the public health and economic consequences of delayed ATC for migrants living with HIV in France. Using a healthcare payer perspective, our model compares the lifetime averted infections and costs of early vs. late ATC for migrants living with HIV in France. Early and late ATC are defined by an entry into care with a CD4 cell count of 350 and 100/mm(3), respectively. Our results show that an early ATC is dominant, even in the worst-case scenario. In the most favorable scenario, early ATC generates an average net saving of a,notsign198,000 per patient, and prevents 0.542 secondary infection. In the worst-case scenario, early ATC generates an average net saving of a,notsign32,000 per patient, and prevents 0.299 secondary infection. These results are robust to various adverse changes in key parameters and to a definition of late ATC as an access to care at a CD4 level of 200/mm(3). In addition to individual health benefits, improving ATC for migrants living with HIV proves efficient in terms of public health and economics. These results stress the benefit of ensuring early ATC for all individuals living with HIV in France.","[Guillon, Marlene] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, 63-65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Guillon, Marlene] Paris Sch Econ, 63-65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Celse, Michel] Conseil Natl Sida, French Natl AIDS Council, 39-43 Quai Andre Citroea, F-75902 Paris 15, France; [Geoffard, Pierre-Yves] Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics,"Guillon, M (通讯作者)，Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, CERDI, 63-65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.;Guillon, M (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, 63-65 Blvd Francois Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",marlene.guillon@uca.fr,,"Guillon, Marlene/0000-0003-2369-8547",,,,,33,9,9,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Based on scientific approaches of strategy development and participatory decision making (e.g. Buchy and Hoverman, 2000; Gane, 2007; Saarikoski et al., 2010), the article explains the connections between National Forest Programmes (NFP), forest strategies and related fora for dialogue. Moreover, participatory approaches in a multi-level governance context (e.g. Bernstein and Cashore, 2012; Lindstad and Solberg, 2012) are discussed at the example of Germany. The Forest Strategy 2020 (Waldstrategie 2020) was adopted on national level by the German parliament in 2011. The strategy was considered as an alternative to the NFP process to provide solutions for problems and conflicts arising by a magnitude of societal interests. On sub-national level, several Lander have revised their forest policies accordingly by developing sub-national NFPs as well as conventional strategies. Both on national and on sub-national level, supporting fora (forest summits, fora for dialogue etc.) provided input to strategy development. Participation by representation predominates, deliberation takes place only in a small number of cases. Moreover, there seems to be a development from information to public deliberation and later on to the involvement of a small number of interest groups as a kind of consultative participation.","[Weber, Norbert] Tech Univ Dresden, Professorship Forest Policy & Forest Resource Eco, D-01737 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Weber, N (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Professorship Forest Policy & Forest Resource Eco, D-01737 Dresden, Germany.",nweber@forst.tu-dresden.de,,"Weber, Norbert Werner Christian/0000-0001-7179-9364",,,,,54,9,9,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,APR,2018,89.0,,,,SI,,98,106,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.002,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8IN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430756200012,0

We focus our attention on student outliers. Students whose first-year college average is far below expectations (divers) have a high propensity for procrastination they self report cramming for exams and wait longer before starting assignments. They are also considerably less conscientious than their peers. Divers are more likely to express superficial goals, hoping to 'get rich' quickly. In contrast, students who exceed expectations (thrivers) express more philanthropic goals, are purpose-driven, and are willing to study more hours per week to obtain the higher GPA they expect. A simple seven-variable average of these key non-academic variables does well in predicting college achievement relative to adding more variables or letting a machine-algorithm choose, and improves our ability to predict at-risk students when used jointly with past grades.","[Beattie, Graham] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Laliberte, Jean-William P.; Oreopoulos, Philip] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Oreopoulos, Philip] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR),"Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Oreopoulos, P (通讯作者)，Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.",philip.oreopoulos@utoronto.ca,,,Ontario Human Capital Research and Innovation Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant [435-2015-0180]; JPAL Pilot Grant,Ontario Human Capital Research and Innovation Fund; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); JPAL Pilot Grant,"We are very grateful to Aloysius Siow, Nathalie Bau, Yosh Halberstarn, Uros Petronijevic for helpful discussions and to seminar participants at the University of Toronto and at the NBER Education meeting for comments.

We show an example of how to study a large variety of experiments to understand the emergence of niches before predetermining these as analytical constructs. By analyzing 118 experiments, we can identify the emergence of two niches: an automated mobility niche and a mobility services niche. The automated niche is characterized by large involvement of incumbents and a strong technological orientation. The services niche focuses more on organizational innovations and involves many new entrants. The involvement of a third actor category, 'mature entrants', applies to both niches and concern those actors that fall more or less in-between the common 'incumbent-new entrant' dichotomy. In general, experiments in the automated niche seem to strengthen the dominant role of the car in the automobility system, while services niche experiments mainly portray an altered role of the car in an alternative mobility system. We conclude that we gained a better understanding of the experiments and emerging niches, but at this stage, developments can still head in different directions. Nevertheless, the involvement of mature entrants in both niches, we argue, can be an important indication that more substantial change is likely to occur.","[Manders, T. N.; Wieczorek, A.

Data collection and statistical analysis are detailed, discussing the findings and research limitations, as well as potential directions for the future studies. In line with previous literature, the present study finds the positive influences of education and civic engagement on socially responsible consumption behavior.

Shareholders reacted positively to block trades without a control transfer in the Polish market, and their reaction was stronger than in the US market. Abnormal returns of block trades concluded at a discount were twice as high as those for the entire sample. Moreover, cross-border block trades had a negative impact on shareholder value creation, as did financial investors as an acquirer. However, cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) were driven up by the relative power of minority shareholders (ocean) prior to the transaction. The absolute size of the block acquired by an investor was also observed to have a positive impact on price rises and abnormal returns.","[Byrka-Kita, Katarzyna; Czerwinski, Mateusz] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Management & Investment, Dept Investments & Business Valuat, Szczecin, Poland; [Pres-Perepeczo, Agnieszka] Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Finance, Dept Financial Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin; University of Szczecin,"Pres-Perepeczo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Finance, Dept Financial Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",agnieszka.perepeczo@wneiz.pl,"Preś-Perepeczo, Agnieszka/ABA-3361-2020; Preś-Perepeczo, Agnieszka/AAC-8993-2020; Czerwiński, Mateusz/AAD-4939-2021","Preś-Perepeczo, Agnieszka/0000-0002-1080-7989; Preś-Perepeczo, Agnieszka/0000-0002-1080-7989; Czerwinski, Mateusz/0000-0003-2060-4867",,,,,50,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We find that member firms in more competitive markets have less disparity between the control and cash flow rights of controlling shareholders. The adjustment in ownership due to product market competition is implemented mainly through an adjustment in the ownership of affiliates rather than in the direct ownership of controlling shareholders. The disciplinary effect of product market competition is observed only in member firms with lower market power in their own industries. The result implies that product market competition works as a disciplinary mechanism that reduces the incentive of chaebols' controlling shareholders to pursue the private benefits of control.,"[Byun, Hee Sub] Hallym Univ, Coll Business, Dept Finance, Chunchon, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Lee, Ji Hye] Construct & Econ Res Inst Korea, 11F Construct Bldg 711, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Kyung Suh] Korea Univ, Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",Hallym University; Korea University,"Lee, JH (通讯作者)，Construct & Econ Res Inst Korea, 11F Construct Bldg 711, Seoul, South Korea.",jihyelee@-cerik.re.kr,,,Korea University Business School; AICG,Korea University Business School; AICG,Kyung Suh Park appreciates the financial support of the Korea University Business School and the AICG.,,40,5,5,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Helping social enterprises grow and compete is an essential priority for all economies, as they carry out fundamental and necessary functions. Consequently, the search for new methods of financing must become a challenge to pursue and overcome. One of the main problems that social enterprises face is access to credit. In fact, access models to traditional financing instruments fail to comprehend the peculiarity of this type of nonprofit entrepreneurship. To this, the so-called credit crunch is added, that is, the restriction of credit offers that affected all enterprises indiscriminately, further aggravating the circumstances of social enterprises. To deal with this situation, a new model, easily applied by social enterprises, is crowdfunding. It is one of the swifter, more social and transparent solutions to gain capital, in stark contrast to the bureaucratic approaches by banks and credit institutions. This paper highlights how the crowdfunding model has become an instrument with a notable impact in terms of fundraising and low implementation costs.","[Comite, Ubaldo] Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy",University of Calabria,"Comite, U (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy.",ubaldo.comite@unical.it,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-76288-3; 978-3-319-76287-6,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,9.0,,,,,,203,220,,10.1007/978-3-319-76288-3_15,0.0,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO7XE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000525862100015,0

It uses an adapted framework of the ICE model to illustrate how ecological processes and caring activities are structurally devalued by the monetized economy in a growth paradigm. On the one hand, this paradigm perpetuates gender injustices by reinforcing dualisms and devaluing care. On the other hand, environmental injustices are perpetuated since green growth does not succeed in dematerializing production processes. In its critique of the growth imperative, degrowth not only promotes the alleviation of environmental injustices but also calls for a recentering of society around care. This paper concludes that, if designed in a gender-sensitive way, a degrowth work-sharing proposal as part of a broader value transformation has the potential to address both gender and environmental injustices.","[Dengler, Corinna] Univ Vechta, Dept Econ & Eth, Vechta, Germany; [Strunk, Birte] Maastricht Univ, Univ Coll Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Dengler, C (通讯作者)，Univ Vechta, Dept Econ & Eth, Vechta, Germany.",corinna.dengler@uni-vechta.de; birte@strunk-mg.de,,"Dengler, Corinna/0000-0002-2646-3789; Dengler, Corinna/0000-0003-2144-5677; Strunk, Birte/0000-0001-9629-3175",,,,,75,36,37,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The goal of this paper is to develop a method reducing computational time, based on the cluster analysis, for the purpose of dynamic asset liability management tasks. These tasks focus on asset and liability mismatch stemming from different sensitivity on different risk factors such as the interest rate, mortality rate or lapse rate. Faster estimates can be used to deliver more stress tests and sensitivity tests, which allow actuaries to understand the risks of asset and liability mismatch in higher detail.

The classic approach to this issue is based on a system of large production batches, which will minimize the number of changeovers, thus eliminating the costs associated with them. However, customer requirements often do not allow them to produce in large batches, which also entail relatively high storage costs. Therefore, it is necessary to focus attention on their efficient operation when reducing production batches and simultaneously increasing the frequency of changeovers. One way of actively influencing the cost and downtime that occurs during the changeovers is the Single Minute Exchange of Die method. The presented article approximates a case study that deals with the implementation of this method in a specific food industry company. The results obtained show that saving only thirty minutes of the average length of one of the most frequent changeover can save up to CZK 130,000 per year.","[Galova, Katerina] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Gálová, K (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Nam TG Masaryka 5555, Zlin, Czech Republic.",kgalova@utb.cz,,,,,,,28,0,1,0,10,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-730-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,103,115,,10.7441/dokbat.2018.10,0.0,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6FI,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466529800010,0

The analysis described in this article is based on the globalization index, which combines the following in one figure: actual economic flows, economic restrictions, data on information flows, data on personal contact and data on cultural proximity. The research analysis was based on wavelet analysis, discrete wavelet analysis and non-linear ordering. Non-linear ordering consists, in geometric terms, in projecting objects placed in a multidimensional space of variables onto a plane. It does not allow the objects to be placed in a hierarchy, but only permits definition of objects similar to each of the objects. A discrete wavelet was used for wavelet analysis of the time series studied. In the process of discrete wavelet transformation, the received signal is divided into so-called approximation and detail. Approximation is then subjected to a subsequent division into further approximation and detail, while details are not subject to further divisions. In this way, the signal is presented as the sum of the approximation of the last level and the details from all levels. In the article, globalization is understood as a process of interaction and integration among the people, companies, and governments of different nations, a process driven by international trade and investment and aided by information technology. This process has effects on the environment, on culture, on political systems, on economic development and prosperity, and on human physical well-being in societies around the world.","[Hadas-Dyduch, Monika] Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Econ, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Hadas-Dyduch, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Fac Econ, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",monika.dyduch@ue.katowice.pl,"Hadas-Dyduch, Monika/G-7959-2015","Hadas-Dyduch, Monika/0000-0001-9281-7488",,,,,12,4,4,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,179,189,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300019,0

The article deals with examining VAT Gap in selected EU countries. The analysis is based on theoretical background about tax gap. Besides the dimension of VAT Gap in selected Member States we have analyzed other significant indicators, which affect the VAT Gap too. Further we have focused on the situation within the European Union and compared the Member States among themselves. During the comparing we observed some similarity between countries, so we used the cluster analysis to verify this this assumption of similarity.

The main source of information is the mass-media, which helps people better understand the environment. Initially, the written or the broadcasted press has a considerable input on the public opinion formation, thus becoming a pillar for transmitting the image intended by the communicator to the users of the media channels. Currently, another important factor that influences people's opinion is the Internet. The technological ascension in the past few years has transformed the Internet into an alternative for information and interaction that is currently indispensable for all the population segments, but mostly for the youth. That is a reason to conduct research in this area. The main goal of this paper is to identify and carry out an analysis of future economists' perception and consider the influence of the mass-media on education process, in order to understand how they see the effects that modern media have on the development of their personality. The following theoretical methods were used in the research: textual analysis, document analysis and content analysis, the survey method, methods of data processing and statistical analysis. The survey part of the research took place from November 2017 until February 2018 and consists of more than 900 students' responses with economics specialization from universities in Latvia, Poland and Romania. This research brings new findings into this area by analyzing future economists' perception of relatively homogeneous groups such as age, cultural and training levels, the target groups belonging to European countries with similar social, economic and political experiences. The first main conclusion of the research is a synthesis of both aspects - the positive and negative - in terms of the influence the mass-media has upon the young generation that is hungry for knowledge, leaving the right to judge and action, and being fully informed. The second important conclusion is that nowadays the online reading is the mainly used mass-media. The results of research demonstrated a clear digital medium preference and in particular the Internet. From these findings, there are some lessons that can be conveyed to policymakers, teachers, parents and students.","[Kotowska, Beata] Univ Gdansk, Ul Jana Bazynskiego 8, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland; [Rupeika-Apoga, Ramona] Univ Latvia, Aspazijas Bulv 5, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia; [Treapat, Laurentiu-Mihai] Natl Univ Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Bd Expozitiei 30A, Bucharest 010324, Romania",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk; University of Latvia,"Kotowska, B (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Ul Jana Bazynskiego 8, PL-80309 Gdansk, Poland.",beata.kotowska@ug.edu.pl; ramona.rupeika-apoga@lu.lv; laurentiu.treapat@facultateademanagement.ro,"Rupeika-Apoga, Ramona/AAF-6929-2019","Rupeika-Apoga, Ramona/0000-0002-3941-0723; Kotowska, Beata/0000-0002-0709-9934",,,,,18,2,2,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,955,969,,,,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200081,0

The CAP is one of the few EU policies which is chiefly implemented at the EU level and closely linked to the subsidiarity principle, according to which the EU takes on tasks which it can implement more effectively than the Member State governments and regions. EAV derived from the CAP has its own specificity. It creates new values in rural areas and agriculture, but also provides economic, social and environmental effects beyond agriculture. A couple of new values and effects are exemplified in the present paper. It shows the CAP's contribution to other areas as well as to the UN's sustainable development objectives.

It has come to the conclusion that the level of financial integration for the capital markets of these countries increases in good economic times and decreases in times of crisis when the volatility in equity markets increases. It was also observed that Romania was the country that recorded the most important progress, both in terms of sigma-convergence (which captures the reduction of discrepancies) and in terms of beta-convergence (speed of convergence). Also, the past few years have come together with the highest level of integration in capital markets in CEE countries, mainly due to the strong recovery after the recession from 2008, but also due to the improvements that each country has made in the field of correlating its business cycle with Euro Zone.

G-33 countries have proposed that existing limits be lifted while other WTO members have not acquiesced. This impasse has threatened the success of WTO Ministerial Meetings in both Bali and Nairobi. Currently, a Peace Clause pertaining to cases being brought to the disputes settlement system has been agreed while members seek a permanent solution. The debate over public stockholdings, however, is being conducted with limited information - in particular whether the WTO de minimis limits restrict the policy space for developing countries pursuing food security goals. This article examines the restrictiveness of the limits on G-33 countries. Using conservative assumptions, it finds that for high food security risk G-33 countries the current de minimis levels are constraining. They are less constraining on medium and low food security risk countries. As a result, the policy space for some developing countries is restricted. The results also suggest that the current 'one size fits all' limits may not be appropriate and could be replaced by a flexible system.","[Nakuja, Tekuni] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Kerr, William A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Nakuja, T (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",tekuni.nakuja@usask.ca; william.kerr@usask.ca,,,,,,,37,4,4,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In order to measure the digital economy at national level ten diagnostic variables were used, which were provided by Eurostat. To compare the countries taxonomic measure of development proposed by Zdzislaw Hellwig was applied. Based on the method a synthetic measure of development was obtained after assessing the distance of the analysed objects to pattern of development. The method was chosen due to its universality and high applicability in economic sciences. The research was done for the years 2011 and 2017. The conducted research enabled to propose ranking of the countries. Additionally, the obtained taxonomic measure of development enabled to group the analysed economies. In spite of the fact that creating the digital economy is often pointed as a potential chance for lower developed countries for closing their development gap to the best developed economies, the research confirmed the traditional disparities between the old European member states.","[Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Ziemkiewicz, Bartosz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Probabil Theory & Stochast Anal, Ul Chopina 12-18, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",michal.pietrzak@umk.pl; bartek@mat.umk.pl,"Ziemkiewicz, Bartosz/AAN-5583-2021; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Ziemkiewicz, Bartosz/0000-0003-0159-7067; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,16,8,8,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1431,1439,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400141,0

Further, the Gaussian membership functions are selected for the fuzzy sets and 27 rules are established. Data are processes using MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. The results prove that the number of stands and the number of employees per shift directly influence the average waiting time and as such, have a major impact on the perceived service quality.

Postfordist type of transition created subcontractors from all the transition countries (now mostly members of EU) and made them subordinated participants of multinational chains, dependent on international companies. This tendency has had a very important impact on the whole socio-economic process. All post-socialistic societies had an idealistic hope to establish an economic system of social justice. However, the real transition took a direction of changes, which were not expected by its citizens. A dream of welfare of social market economy and state providence have become the reality of liberal capitalism (capitalism of subcontractors), As some countries adopted to the model of postfordist dependent development, the other transition societies had implemented an oligarchic model. In this system a social order has been ideologically based on foundation of an idealistic vision of  the golden age (e.g. idealized welfare of soviet past).","[Poplawski, Wieslaw Tadeusz] Bialystok Tech Univ, Engn Management Dept, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Poplawski, WT (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Engn Management Dept, Bialystok, Poland.",tpoplaw@tlen.pl,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,508,519,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300056,0

Currently, three multipliers (expenditure, tax, and transfer multiplier) are calculated in three economies according to the market entities (two-sector, three-sector, and four-sector). So, there are nine basic multipliers. However, the feedbacks considered are very simplistic: the marginal propensity to consume as a positive relationship between product and consumption; the rate of the income tax as a negative relationship between product and consumption; the marginal propensity to import as a negative relationship between product and net exports. The paper shows that there are much more potential feedbacks in macroeconomic models. The tool to reach the contribution goal is to find more macroeconomic feedbacks and add them into now multipliers that will be a more accurate reflection of reality. The added value of the author's work is to define new system feedbacks and implement them into new multipliers. Created cybernetic systems are a simplified abstraction of real macroeconomic relationships. The more complicated calculation will then be offset by more accurate results and closer reflection of reality.","[Rousek, Pavel] Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Sch Expertness & Valuat, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Rousek, P (通讯作者)，Inst Technol & Business Ceske Budejovice, Sch Expertness & Valuat, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",rousek@mail.vstecb.cz,"Rousek, Pavel/AAF-3162-2021","Rousek, Pavel/0000-0002-2566-0203",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1506,1515,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400149,0

We analyze how perceptions of social support and loneliness of first year undergraduate students enrolled in a mentoring scheme operating in a peer-to-peer network logic are linked with academic success and a risk of withdrawal. Findings suggest that dropout intentions are related to experiences of higher Family loneliness and Romantic loneliness. Students who considered withdrawing reported less appraisal support and tangible social support. A perception of academic integration was higher in students with no overdue courses. Social support appears to be an important element of student integration and academic success. Universities should address students' well-being since their admission with policies that foster student integration and engagement in activities.

The analysis first reveals that a lower level of corruption had a positive impact on bank stability and is associated with fewer credit losses and with more moderate credit growth. It then highlights the importance of bank and country characteristics in identifying the asymmetric effects of corruption on bank stability. Our evidence suggests that stability of banks that are acting in a country that has not adopted a corporate governance code or is not a member of the European Union is affected more by the corruption. Also, in countries with higher levels of corruption banks could increase their stability if they implement rigorous corporate governance practices.","[Toader, Tudorel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Law, Iasi, Romania; [Onofrei, Mihaela; Popescu, Ada-Iuliana] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania; [Andries, Alin Marius] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Res Ctr Finance, 22 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Andries, Alin Marius] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 22 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Andries, AM (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Res Ctr Finance, 22 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania.;Andries, AM (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, 22 Carol I Blvd, Iasi 700505, Romania.",alin.andries@uaic.ro,"Andries, Alin Marius/B-5980-2011; Onofrei, Mihaela/K-3668-2015","Andries, Alin Marius/0000-0002-4415-4197; Onofrei, Mihaela/0000-0002-6525-3346","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-RUTE-2014-4-0443]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","Andries gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RUTE-2014-4-0443.",,84,42,43,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We find that monetary policy has a significant effect on the stock market, but is only responsible for a small proportion of market variation. The analysis at the sector level with expected returns identifies that the financial sector is the most affected by this policy, whereas with excess returns only industrial goods are significantly affected. Moreover, individual assets respond in a rather heterogeneous fashion to monetary policy; however, when we look at excess returns, we identify a reduction in the intensity and in the number of companies impacted by monetary policy. Finally, the monetary shock is explained by unanticipated variations in the unemployment rate, in the Industrial Production Index, in the General Market Price Index, and in the Broad Consumer Price Index.","[Val, Flavio de Freitas; da Silveira Barbedo, Claudio Henrique] Cent Bank Brazil, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Klotzle, Marcelo Cabus; Figueiredo Pinto, Antonio Carlos] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Rua Marques Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [da Silveira Barbedo, Claudio Henrique] IBMEC Business Sch, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Central Bank of Brazil; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro,"Klotzle, MC (通讯作者)，Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Rua Marques Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",klotzle@iag.puc-rio.br,"Barbedo, Claudio/AAB-8578-2022; Klotzle, Marcelo Cabus/J-9024-2018","Klotzle, Marcelo Cabus/0000-0002-5463-6333",,,,,33,10,10,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

First, employed workers, trying to avoid entrepreneurial risks, have a conservative attitude on entrepreneurship generically. Second, even if the degree of individual specific technology or know-how is high enough, the likelihood of employed worker's career path transition can be decreased interacting with individual-wise risk aversion. Third, it is demonstrated if employed workers are more likely to transit to entrepreneurial career path as the younger the employed workers are or the higher the gains from entrepreneurship are expected. The predictions of the model are empirically tested using a cross-country panel data collected from Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Main empirical findings support the theoretic predictions. As long as it is socially more efficient to transit those employed workers to entrepreneurs rather than incubating nascent entrepreneurs, a government needs to put a more emphasis on enlightening entrepreneurial courage rather than encouraging innovations or technologies to novice entrepreneurs, which is, to the least, a way to decrease society-wise opportunity costs. This implicit effect needs to be more importantly considered than casually quoted the direct effect of entrepreneurship, i.e. job creation effect.","[Yim, Hyung Rok] Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Yim, HR (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Sch Business, Seoul, South Korea.",hryim@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,24,2,3,0,8,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The results show that the principal driver of a switching action is the credit needs of the firm. The binding force of the Communist Party in state-owned banks and enterprises would suggest that switching should be a rare phenomenon in Chinese commercial relations. But switching occurs. The findings support the extant literature that transparent firms are able to switch more readily than opaque firms. The results also suggest that banks that develop their fee income services are more effective in locking-in their borrowers and that firms tend to switch from state-owned banks to smaller non-state owned banks. However, in other areas switching does not conform with the mainstream explanations.","[Yin, Wei] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dongnandaxue Rd 2, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Matthews, Kent] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Matthews, Kent] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Publ Finance & Taxat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Cardiff University; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Yin, W (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dongnandaxue Rd 2, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yinwei_seu@126.com,"Matthews, Kent/AAE-5927-2020","Matthews, Kent/0000-0001-6968-3098; Yin, Wei/0000-0003-0432-4355",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71503041]; open project of Jiangsu key laboratory of financial engineering [NSK2015-18],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); open project of Jiangsu key laboratory of financial engineering,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71503041) and the open project of Jiangsu key laboratory of financial engineering (NSK2015-18).,,40,8,8,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

There are, however, many different methodological approaches to scenario building. In order to be able to make better use of the diversity of approaches at hand, a systematic overview of the scenario methodologies, which is currently missing in the forest sector, is needed. This paper analysed and reviewed 129 forest management-related scenario studies that have been carried out in Europe during the past decade. The studies were classified by means of cluster analysis in four groups: (1) management scenarios, (2) environmental scenarios, (3) optimization scenarios, and (4) participatory scenarios. Despite differences between the four groups, almost all scenario studies can be characterized as rather quantitative, non-participatory, and single factor in nature. The analysis also found a temporal trend reflecting a broadening of the scenario methodology for forest management over time towards scenarios that incorporate longer time horizons, reflecting issues on a larger scale, including land-use considerations. Considering the complexity and urgency of the issues in forest management that need to be addressed and the opportunities offered by the scenario methodologies not yet fully used, we expect to see a further broadening of the scenario methodology with mixed-methodrparticipatory, and complex scenarios.

By applying a discrete choice experiment to a large representative sample of Portuguese junior doctors (N = 503) in 2014, we provide an indication that this shortage may be addressed with a careful policy design that mixes pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives for these junior physicians. According to our simulations, a policy that includes such incentives may increase uptake of general practitioners (GPs) in rural areas from 18% to 30%. Marginal wages estimated from our model are realistic and close to market prices: an extra hour of work would require an hourly wage of 16.5a,notsign; moving to an inland rural setting would involve an increase in monthly income of 1.150a,notsign (almost doubling residents' current income); a shift to a GP career would imply an 849a,notsign increase in monthly income. Additional opportunities to work outside the National Health Service overcome an income reduction of 433a,notsign. Our simulation predicts that an income increase of 350a,notsign would lead to a 3 percentage point increase in choice probability, which implies an income elasticity of 3.37, a higher estimation compared to previous studies.","[Ramos, Pedro] Univ Sao Paulo, Hosp Clin, Med Director Off, Fac Med, Av Dr Eneas de Carvalho Aguiar ,255, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Ramos, Pedro; Alves, Helio; Ferreira, Maria A.] Univ Porto, Fac Med, Oporto, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Bank Portugal, Oporto, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade do Porto; Banco de Portugal; Universidade do Porto,"Ramos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Hosp Clin, Med Director Off, Fac Med, Av Dr Eneas de Carvalho Aguiar ,255, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.;Ramos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Med, Oporto, Portugal.",pedrosaldanharamos@live.com.pt,"Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008; Ferreira, Maria Amélia/AAQ-5080-2021","Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028; Ferreira, Maria Amélia/0000-0001-6789-3796; Alves, Helio/0000-0002-5879-3838; Ramos, Pedro/0000-0002-6825-6577",,,,,51,4,6,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Recommendations will be made to inform future research addressing the impact of a physical exercise component on cost-effectiveness. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for economic evaluations of exercise-based CR programs published in English between 2000 and 2014. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement was used to review the methodological quality of included economic evaluations. Results: Fifteen economic evaluations met the review inclusion criteria. Assessed study characteristics exhibited wide variability, particularly in their economic perspective, time horizon, setting, comparators and included costs, with significant heterogeneity in exercise dose across interventions. Ten evaluations were based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) spanning 6-24 months but often with weak or inconclusive results; two were modelling studies; and the final three utilised longer time horizons of 3.5-5 years from which findings suggest that long-term exercise-based CR results in lower costs, reduced hospitalisations and a longer cumulative patient lifetime. None of the 15 articles met all the CHEERS quality criteria, with the majority either fully or partially meeting a selection of the assessed variables. Conclusion: Evidence exists supporting the cost-effectiveness of exercise-based CR for cardiovascular disease patients. However, variability in CR program delivery and weak consistency between study perspective and design limits study comparability and therefore the accumulation of evidence in support of a particular exercise regime. The generalisability of study findings was limited due to the exclusion of patients with comorbidities as would typically be found in a real-world setting. The use of longer time-horizons would be more comparable with a chronic condition and enable economic assessments of the long-term effects of CR. As none of the articles met recent reporting standards for the economic assessment of healthcare interventions, it is recommended that future studies adhere to such guidelines.","[Edwards, Katherine; Jones, Natasha; Newton, Julia; Judge, Andrew; Jackson, Kate; Arden, Nigel K.; Pinedo-Villanueva, Rafael] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford, England; [Jones, Natasha] Fac Sport & Exercise Med, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Jones, Natasha] Nuffield Orthopaed Ctr, Oxford, England; [Newton, Julia; Arden, Nigel K.] Univ Oxford, Arthrit Res UK Ctr Sport Exercise & Osteoarthrit, Oxford, England; [Foster, Charlie] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford, England; [Judge, Andrew; Arden, Nigel K.; Pinedo-Villanueva, Rafael] Univ Southampton, MRC Lifecourse Epidemiol Unit, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Oxford; Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Southampton,"Edwards, K (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Oxford, England.",katherine.edwards@ndorms.ox.ac.uk,"; Pinedo-Villanueva, Rafael/D-2309-2016","Judge, Andrew/0000-0003-3015-0432; Foster, Charlie/0000-0002-5041-0601; Pinedo-Villanueva, Rafael/0000-0002-4723-5128",,,,,31,28,30,1,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Accounting for the existence of stochastic events that generate spatial interactions in the context of a dynamic decision process is crucial for determining optimal management. This paper demonstrates a method for incorporating spatial information and interactions into management decisions made over time. A machine learning technique called approximate dynamic programming is applied to determine the optimal timing and location of fuel treatments and timber harvests for a fire-threatened landscape. Larger net present values can be achieved using policies that explicitly consider evolving spatial interactions created by fire spread, compared to policies that ignore the spatial dimension of the inter-temporal optimization problem.","[Lauer, Christopher J.] Oregon State Univ, Appl Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Montgomery, Claire A.] Oregon State Univ, Forest Engn Resources &Management, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Dietterich, Thomas G.] Oregon State Univ, Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 2067 Kelly Engn Ctr, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University; Oregon State University,"Lauer, CJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Appl Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",lauerc@oregonstate.edu; claire.montgomery@oregonstate.edu; tgd@cs.orst.edu,,,National Science Foundation under CyberSEES Computing and Visualizing Optimal Policies for Ecosystem Management [1331932]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations [1331932] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1521687] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation under CyberSEES Computing and Visualizing Optimal Policies for Ecosystem Management; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Division of Computing and Communication Foundations(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),"This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under CyberSEES Computing and Visualizing Optimal Policies for Ecosystem Management (grant no. 1331932).

Using a Roy model with multiple unobserved abilities and longitudinal data from NLSY79, we find that this ability has a positive effect on overall earnings. However, in contrast to cognitive and socioemotional abilities, mechanical ability reduces the likelihood of 4-year college attendance. The rationale for this asymmetry comes from its large estimated impact on earnings conditional on not attending a 4-year college.

Americans were the most concerned with societal issues and Australians the least. Societal concerns increased with age. Both sets of concerns, but especially personal, were predictors of perceived personal stress, although specific concerns were both positively and negatively associated with stress. The ranking of societal concerns, country differences, age differences, and the relationship between concerns and stress are discussed.

The question of how transdisciplinary practise can manage to break with existing structures to realize its envisaged co-production is hardly addressed, however, crucial acknowledging inherent power dynamics. Using a transdisciplinary project as a case study, we picture the structures that position those involved regarding their influence on and benefit of (a) the research setup, (b) resource allocations, (c) project discourses, (d) project output and (e) decision-making and steering. By combining quantitative with qualitative data, we reveal the herein materialised power imbalances between social and natural sciences, academic degrees, science and society and, in our specific setup, between the Global North and South. Our results indicate a pervasive reproduction of hierarchical, academic, postcolonial knowledge orders that make doing transdisciplinarity a privilege for some, although not without risk.

In our hyper-mediated world of online technologies, where it seems that even national policy can be forged in the 140 characters of Twitter, it is more important than ever to retain spaces for in-depth debate of emergent phenomena that have disruptive and transformative potential. In this article, we follow this logic and argue that to fully understand the diverse range of practices and potential consequences of activities uncomfortably corralled under the ambiguous term 'the sharing economy' requires not a simplification of arguments, but an opening out of horizons to explore the many ways in which these phenomena have emerged and are evolving. It is argued that this will require attention to multiple terrains, from diverse intellectual traditions across many disciplines to the thus far largely reactive responses of government and regulation, and from the world of techno-innovation start-ups to the optics of media (including social media) reporting on what it means to 'share' in the 21st century. Building on this, we make the case for viewing 'the sharing economy' as a matrix of diverse economies with clear links to past practices. We propose that to build a grammar for understanding these diverse sharing economies requires further attention to: (1) The etymology of sharing and sharing economies; (2) The differentiated geographies to which sharing economies contribute; (3) What it means to labour, work and be employed in sharing economies; (4) The role of the state and others in governing, regulating and shaping the organisation and practice of sharing economies; and (5) the impacts of sharing economies. In conclusion, we suggest that while media interest may fade as their presence in everyday lives becomes less novel, understanding sharing economies remains an urgent activity if we are to ensure that the new ways of living and labouring, to which sharing economies are contributing, work to promote sustainable and inclusive development in this world that ultimately we all share.","[Davies, Anna R.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin, Ireland; [Donald, Betsy] Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; [Gray, Mia] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Knox-Hayes, Janelle] MIT, Sch Architecture & Planning, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Trinity College Dublin; Queens University - Canada; University of Cambridge; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Davies, AR (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Museum Bldg, Dublin, Ireland.",daviesa@tcd.ie; betsy.donald@queensu.ca; mia.gray@geog.cam.ac.uk; jankh@mit.edu,"Davies, Anna/AAB-4254-2020",,European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [646883],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)),This paper draws on research conducted as part of the SHARECITY project which has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no 646883).,,96,44,51,3,212,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

It challenges varieties of capitalism's argument that manufacturing employers in Coordinated Market Economies (CMEs) will tend to defend non-liberal institutions because of the comparative institutional advantage that they provide. It examines Germany and Sweden, two critical cases in this debate. It is based on interviews with key officials and an in-depth examination of the Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft (INSM) and Timbro, think-tanks sponsored by German and Swedish employers to shape public opinion. In line with power resource theory, I find that both German and Swedish employers have a strong preference for liberalization. In both cases, they responded to left-wing threats, institutional constraints and situations of ` crisis' by launching a counteroffensive and promoting welfare state reform, labor market flexibility and deregulation. Employers have used discourse as a power resource to pursue an aggressive liberalizing agenda and to attack institutions that required active deregulation on the part of the state. Whether employers in CMEs seek to dismantle existing institutions altogether or soften and reengineer these institutions from within, one thing is clear: their use of radical neoliberal discourse is incompatible with the claim that they defend traditional institutions in any meaningful sense.","[Kinderman, Daniel] Univ Delaware, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Kinderman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",kindermd@udel.edu,"Kinderman, Daniel/I-2695-2019","Kinderman, Daniel/0000-0003-2874-4549",,,,,79,53,55,5,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This paper aims to explain how oil palm companies accumulate power that enables them to control forestland and convert it into oil palm. Specifically, this paper identifies empirical evidence pointing to why oil palm companies emerge as powerful actors in land use conflicts. This paper uses the case of forest lands claimed by different actors - i.e. a timber plantation company, an oil palm company, and local communities - in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Before the decentralisation policy, the interests of timber plantations were principally safeguarded by coercion from the forest ministry. The timber company was also supported by local communities by promising financial incentives to them. Following the decentralisation policy, additional actors get involved in the land use conflicts leading to more complex power interplays. In fact, some forestlands licensed for timber plantations are used by the oil palm company. Oil palm interests resonate with the economic interests of local governments, who use their legal mandates on land use allocation to facilitate the establishment of oil palm. The power of the oil palm company is also enhanced by the support from local communities, to which it handed more financial incentives than those of the timber plantation. It also used dominant information of customary claims and land appropriation by the ministry of forestry, with which it persuades local communities to pressurize government institutions to support oil palm operations.

This paper explores the importance of those additional climatic variables other than temperature and precipitation. Using the county-level agricultural data from 1980 to 2010 in China, we find that those additional climatic variables, especially humidity and wind speed, are critical for crop growth. Therefore, omitting those variables is likely to bias the predicted impacts of climate change on crop yields. In particular, omitting humidity tends to overpredict the cost of climate change on crop yields, while ignoring wind speed is likely to underpredict the effect. Our preferred specification indicates that climate change is likely to decrease the yields of rice, wheat, and corn in China by 36.25%, 18.26%, and 45.10%, respectively, by the end of this century.

In its recent compliance decision in the US-Tuna II dispute, the AB reaffirmed its view that regulatory distinctions embedded in the US dolphin-safe tuna-labeling regime were not legitimate because they were not sufficiently calibrated to the risks to dolphins associated with different tuna fishing conditions. This paper analyzes the AB's application of the notion of risk-based regulation in the US-Tuna II dispute and finds the AB's reasoning lacking in coherence. Although risk analysis and calibration can in principle play useful roles in TBT cases, the AB needs to provide more explicit and careful guidance to WTO members and to panels to avoid the kind of ad hoc decision-making exhibited throughout the US-Tuna II dispute.","[Coglianese, Cary] Univ Penn, Sch Law, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sapir, Andre] Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Bruegel, Belgium; [Sapir, Andre] CEPR, London, England",University of Pennsylvania; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Coglianese, C (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Sch Law, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",cary_coglianese@law.upenn.edu; andre.sapir@ulb.ac.be,"Sapir, Andre/IAS-0343-2023","Sapir, Andre/0000-0001-6493-0352; Coglianese, Cary/0000-0002-5496-2104",,,,,18,7,8,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2017,16.0,2,,,,,327,348,,10.1017/S1474745616000562,0.0,,,22,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,EQ6NA,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000398197500009,0

These measures were introduced with the goal of advancing the Argentine government's stated policies of re-industrialization, import substitution, and elimination of trade balance deficits. From a legal point of view, the least interesting feature of the dispute was the substantive compatibility of these measures with Article XI:1 GATT as they clearly constituted import restrictions. Identifying and classifying the measures involved, however, proved more challenging: based on vague policy guidelines, devoid of any legal basis, and consisting largely of wholly discretionary ad hoc action by the authorities, clouded in confidential obscurity, the measures escaped familiar categories and distinctions of WTO law.

An often-used strategy is for the physician or other health professional to encourage behavior changes by providing advice on the health consequences of such behaviors. However, adherence to advice on health behavior change varies across individuals. This paper uses data from a population-based cross-sectional survey of 1849 individuals with chronic disease to explore whether differences in individuals' time and risk preferences can help explain differences in adherence. Health behaviors are viewed as investments in health capital within the Grossman model. Physician advice plays a role in the model in that it improves the understanding of the future health consequences of investments. It can be hypothesized that the effect of advice on health behavior will depend on an individuals' time and risk preference. Within the survey, which measured a variety of health-related behaviors and outcomes, including receipt and compliance with advice on dietary and physical activity changes, time preferences were measured using financial planning horizon, and risk preferences were measured through a commonly used question which asked respondents to indicate their willingness to take risks on a ten-point scale. Results suggest that time preferences play a role in adherence to physical activity advice. While time preferences also play a role in adherence to dietary advice, this effect is only apparent for males. Risk preferences do not seem to be associated with adherence. The results suggest that increasing the salience of more immediate benefits of health behavior change may improve adherence.","[van der Pol, Marjon] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Hennessy, Deirdre] STAT Canada, Hlth Anal Div, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Manns, Braden] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Aberdeen; Statistics Canada; University of Calgary,"van der Pol, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",m.vanderpol@abdn.ac.uk,"Manns, Braden J/I-8942-2012","van der Pol, Marjon/0000-0003-0636-1184",Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (AHFMR) Inter-disciplinary Team Grants Program; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish,Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (AHFMR) Inter-disciplinary Team Grants Program; Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),"The Interdisciplinary Chronic Disease Collaboration (ICDC) is funded through the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (AHFMR) Inter-disciplinary Team Grants Program.

Health conditions are described using a generic health utility system (EQ-513). Estimated WTP is proportional to the stated reduction in probability of illness and independent of small differences in baseline risk, consistent with conventional economic theory, and is an increasing but highly concave function of the severity and duration of the illness. WTP to reduce nonfatal health risks can be estimated as a function of the severity and duration of the effect, but the relationship is not linear as assumed by the common practice of multiplying the expected QALY gain by a constant monetary value per QALY.

The main objective of this study is to analyse the development of standardised mortality rates for cerebrovascular disease, which is one of the most common causes of deaths, in relation to income inequality in individual regions of the Slovak Republic. Direct standardisation was applied using data from the Slovak mortality database, covering the time period from 1996 to 2013. The standardised mortality rate declined by 4.23% in the Slovak Republic. However, since 1996, the rate has been higher by almost 33% in men than in women. Standardised mortality rates were lower in the northern part of the Slovak Republic than in the southern part. The regression models demonstrated an impact of the observed income-related dimensions on these rates. The income quintile ratio and Gini coefficient appeared to be the most influencing variables. The results of the analysis highlight valuable baseline information for creating new support programmes aimed at eliminating health inequalities in relation to health and social policy.","[Gavurova, Beata; Kovac, Viliam; Vagasova, Tatiana] Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Gavurová, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Nemcovej 32, Kosice, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Kováč, Viliam/AAH-5542-2019","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Kováč, Viliam/0000-0002-5265-9005","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [1/0986/15]; Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic; Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic","This paper was created within the project supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic 1/0986/15 Proposal of the dimensional models of the management effectiveness of ICT and information systems in health facilities in Slovakia and the economic-financial quantification of their effects on the health system in Slovakia.r Our acknowledgments also belong to the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic for its cooperation in creation of the new conceptions and methodologies and for its support of our research activities.",,39,10,10,0,16,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

There is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the types of REDD+ costs and benefits reported in the literature. In this paper, we conducted a review of 60 unique REDD+ costs and benefits studies. We found that no single study covers all categories of costs and benefits in a comparable form. A total of 56 comparable estimates were available for opportunity costs, 21 for transaction and imPlementation costs, 23 for total costs, and only four for direct monetary benefits. We found that, on average, the total REDD+ cost ($24.87/tCO(2)e) was 2.23 times higher than the opportunity cost and the opportunity cost was 3.28 times higher than the transaction and implementation costs. Costs estimates among studies vary widely based on estimation approach used and the scale of the studies. We noted that future REDD+ costs and benefits studies should provide estimates of all relevant costs and benefits, and the distribution of these costs and benefits among project stakeholders. These findings have implications in REDD+ project design and impletnentation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To test the strong version of the Porter Hypothesis (PH), we extend a neo-Schumpeterian productivity model to allow for effects of environmental policies. We use a new environmental policy stringency (EPS) index and let the effect of countries' environmental policies vary with the pollution intensity of the industry and with the countries' and firms' technological advancement. A tightening of environmental policy is associated with a short-term increase in industry-level productivity growth in the most technologically advanced countries. This effect diminishes with the distance to the global productivity frontier, eventually becoming insignificant. For the average firm, no evidence of PH is found. However, the most productive firms see a temporary boost in productivity growth, while the less productive ones experience a productivity slowdown. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is essentially MDBs' legal efforts to address complaints made by people adversely affected by an MDB-funded project. Such complaints arise from concerns with environmental and social implications, including involuntary resettlement and human rights violations. Under this system, Bank investigators assess Bank staff's compliance (or noncompliance) with Bank operational policies and procedures relating to project design, appraisal and/or implementation. The World Bank's Inspection Panel is a leading example for establishing a credible accountability culture and mechanism. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is the first MDB initiated by a group of Asian developing countries with China at the centre. The AIIB's committed high standards can only be possible with a fair and effective accountability mechanism.","[Bin, Gu] Beijing Foreign Studies Univ, Law School, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Foreign Studies University,"Bin, G (通讯作者)，Beijing Foreign Studies Univ, Law School, Beijing, Peoples R China.",gubin@bfsu.edu.cn,,,,,,,25,3,3,1,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

While over the past two decades there has been a remarkable growth in consumption, and to a lesser extent of consumption per capita, the GDP share of the consumption has declined by a considerable amount in Asia. The article presents projections of the GDP consumption share. The projections are based on time series models and an econometric model that relates the GDP share of consumption to GDP growth. Instrumental variables estimates show that the GDP share of consumption is significantly negatively related to growth: A decrease in PPP GDP per capita growth of 1 percentage point increases the GDP share of consumption by around 2 percentage points. Slower growth in Asia would thus significantly contribute to a higher GDP share of consumption in that region.","[Brueckner, Markus] Australian Natl Univ, LF Crisp Bldg 26A, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Brueckner, M (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, LF Crisp Bldg 26A, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",markus.brueckner@anu.edu.au,"Vachadze, George/O-2680-2014",,,,,,11,3,3,6,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Through a description of the historical evolution of civil-military relations, I explain the dissolution of the military tutelary regime with reference to a combination of push and pull factors.

The specific issue addressed is the robustness of benefit-cost analyses of climate-change policy alternatives to relaxation of Savage's original axioms. Two alternatives to subjective expected utility (SEU) are considered: maximin expected utility (MEU) and incomplete expected utility (IEU). Among other results, it is demonstrated that polar opposite recommendations can emerge in an ambiguous decision setting even if all agree on Society's rate of time preference, Society's risk attitudes, the degree of ambiguity faced, and the scientific primitives. We show that, for a simple numerical simulation of our model, an MEU decision maker favors policies which immediately tackle climate change while an IEU decision prefers business as usual.Each agency shall assess the costs and benefits of the intended regulation, and recognizing that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its cost.

Then, else equal, a fall in income inequality will lower the economy-wide saving rate. The model predicts an augmented aggregate saving function: the aggregate saving rate depends positively not only on the aggregate income level, but also on the dispersion of income. We find some empirical support for this hypothesis using China's province-level longitudinal data.","[Chen, Yi; Hu, Jiamin] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Kong, Lu] Evalueserve Business Consulting Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui] Columbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY USA",Peking University; Columbia University,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",ychen.econ@pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,24,3,3,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Historically, nutrient trading programs have been restricted to credits between point sources or for agricultural mitigation technologies, such as the planting of cover crops. However, the denitrification and nutrient sequestration associated with oyster reefs has recently been a topic of much biological research. We investigate the role that nutrient credits for ecosystem services provided by restored oyster reefs can play in optimally managing oyster reef complexes by developing a coupled bioeconomic model of oyster reef growth and harvest. Our findings suggest that, along with harvest, the regulating services of denitrification and nutrient sequestration lead to positive net benefits in a majority of scenarios analyzed, although local environmental conditions play a prominent role in the ultimate outcomes.","[DePiper, Geret S.] NOAA Fisheries, 166 Water St,MB 19, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Lipton, Douglas W.] NOAA Fisheries, Econ, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Lipcius, Romuald N.] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Marine Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science,"DePiper, GS (通讯作者)，NOAA Fisheries, 166 Water St,MB 19, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",geret.depiper@noaa.gov; douglas.lipton@noaa.gov; rom@vims.edu,"DePiper, Geret/JXK-0664-2024","DePiper, Geret/0000-0001-9178-9673; Lipcius, Romuald/0000-0001-7485-797X",US National Science Foundation [DMS-1313093]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1313093] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank participants at a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Biology Department Seminar, particularly Julie Kellner, for helpful suggestions in the link between filtration rates and denitrification.

In this research, we followed the manner in which the different types of IT influence the activity of the persons employed in the accounting departments of the companies functioning in Romania. We pursued all the aspects which have to be taken into account by a person who decides to implement technologies: the way the company obtained IT (by purchasing them or by developing them within the company), the types of application used within the accounting department (an ERP system or independent applications), the expected benefits, the difficulties encountered, the future effects which can be exploited.","[Dumitru, Valentin Florentin; Calu, Daniela Artemisa; Sofian, Ioana; Alkoutaini, Hasan] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dumitru, VF (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",valentin.dumitru@cig.ase.ro,"Dumitru, Valentin Florentin E/N-2862-2014; Calu, Daniela Artemisa/N-5763-2017; St. Calu, Daniela Artemisa/C-3786-2011","Calu, Daniela Artemisa/0000-0002-2306-5275;",,,,,34,0,0,0,3,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-4-7,,,,2017,,,,,,,187,195,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393100014,0

Two methods of estimation are used: (1) increase in book value of fishing rights, and (2) annual amortization of quotas multiplied by their time of validity. It is found that the price of quotas, in most cases, exceeds the profit rate in the fishery and is often higher than the contribution margin. Hence quota prices in most cases exceed the resource rent and are more consistent with a willingness to pay for additional quotas bought to improve the utilization of existing equipment, in which case fixed costs are irrelevant. The puzzle of quota prices in many cases exceeding the contribution margin can be resolved by assuming that boat owners expect to keep a substantial portion of their purchased quotas through redistribution and use a low discount rate when evaluating quotas.","[Hannesson, Rognvaldur] Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Hannesson, R (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",rognvaldur.hannesson@nhh.no,,,,,,,0,15,15,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

We find that non-FDI inflows boost credit growth and increase the likelihood of credit booms in both household and corporate sectors. For household credit, the composition of inflows appears to be more important than financial system characteristics. In contrast, for corporate credit, both the composition and the financial system matter. Regardless of sectors and financial systems, other inflows are always linked to rapid credit growth. Firm-level data corroborate these findings and hint at a causal link: other inflows are related to more rapid credit growth for firms that rely more heavily on external financing. Further explorations on how capital inflows translate into more credit indicate that both demand and supply side factors play a role.","[Igan, Deniz] Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Tan, Zhibo] Fudan Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tan, Zhibo] Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China",International Monetary Fund; Fudan University,"Igan, D (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",digan@imf.org,"Igan, Deniz/HMP-1276-2023","Igan, Deniz/0000-0002-9501-1807","Shanghai Planning Projects of Social Science; Youth Projects [2015ECK001, 71603057]; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Gaofeng Plan of Fudan University (Theoretical Economics)",Shanghai Planning Projects of Social Science; Youth Projects; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Gaofeng Plan of Fudan University (Theoretical Economics),"Zhibo Tan thanks for the funding from Shanghai Planning Projects of Social Science, Youth Projects (Grant No. 2015ECK001), National Natural Science Foundation of China, Youth Projects (Grant No. 71603057), and Gaofeng Plan of Fudan University (Theoretical Economics).",,36,15,18,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Mixed complementarity programming is used to solve a 21-region, global trade model that is calibrated to 2011 observed bilateral trade flows using positive mathematical programming. In addition, the model employs a mechanism for analyzing the effects of the tariff rate quota used in the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA). It is estimated that the SLA created an annual deadweight loss of $28 million, paid by U.S. consumers. The quota constrained Alberta lumber producers while BC producers had excess quota. The lack of a proper mechanism for capturing quota rent, such as a tradable quota scheme or quota auction resulted in the survival of high-cost firms, perhaps to the detriment of lower-cost firms in Alberta. In the absence of SLA, it is estimated that Alberta would supply an additional 9% of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., eroding the supply share of all other regions while improving aggregate welfare.

Results show that mothers in West Germany in all cohorts tended to remain in part-time employment for longer periods than those in East Germany. Part-time employment more often provided a stepping-stone into full-time employment in East Germany than in West Germany. East German women who gave birth after reunification were less likely than older cohorts to experience a transition from part-time to full-time work.

By tracing the history of decades-long encryption control, this article underscores how this clause implicates international order. Modern encryption technology was conceived and developed during World Wars. Painted by such a war-time legacy, encryption has been treated as a 'dual-use' technology and has been subject to export control since the end of World War II via the Coordinating Committee for the Control of Multinational Trade (COCOM) and, later, the Wassenaar Arrangement. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Western bloc became divided on encryption policies. The US was most concerned with national security and once attempted to introduce the mandatory key escrow scheme to provide a level playing field for its high-tech industry. Resistance to the US's hard line approach towards encryption at home and abroad led the nation to relax its export controls, thereby ending Crypto War 1.0. With the rise of emerging economies, however, Crypto War 2.0 is now resurfacing, and through the Encryption Clause, the US seeks to remove trade barriers that are hostile towards products employing foreign cryptography. Yet, underlying intellectual property right (IPR)(issues and the role of intelligence units in the formation of technical standards may once again move trade negotiations into the shadows.","[Liu, Han-Wei] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University,"Liu, HW (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",han-wei.liu@graduateinstitute.ch,"Liu, Han-Wei/V-9408-2019","Liu, Han-Wei/0000-0001-9135-4258","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [105-2410-H-007-002]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","I am grateful to anonymous reviewers for valuable comments and Sylvia Lu, Jung-Ming Chang, and Yi-Ting Cheng for research assistance.

Non-implementation of a National Forest Programme and redefined transposition of NATURA 2000 in Bialowieza Forest,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,International forest policy; International forest regime complex; Institutional elements; Political influence; Domestic consequences; Bureaucratic politics,POLICY; EU; MANAGEMENT; INTERESTS; STRATEGY; POLITICS; ISSUES; SITES,"The International Forest Regime Complex consists of a number of institutional elements aiming to regulate forests. Among them the main line of conflict runs between production-oriented and conservation-oriented elements. Voluntary National Forest Programmes as well as biodiversity conservation policies, such as the Convention on Biodiversity and the EU Natura 2000 policy, reflect the main institutional elements of the forest regime complex. The implementation of such individual regime elements as well as the resulting domestic political customizations and consequences in countries, however, so far received little scrutiny. Before this background, this article aims to analyses the political influence of implementing important production- as well as conservation-oriented elements of the International Forest Regime Complex in Poland alongside with important customizations in both processes. Theoretically, we draw on the framework of four pathways of international influences and combine it with bureaucratic politics theory. Empirically, the current study focuses on qualitative in depths insights into the so far failed implementation of a National Forest Programme in Poland, as well as the implementation and transposition of the EU NATURA 2000 policy, usingBialowieza Forest as an exemplary case. Our results indicate that the Polish Ministry of Environment has driven both processes. Both regime elements were clearly customized by bureaucratic action during the implementation process. While Nature 2000 triggered international support for protection-oriented interests, the dominant production-oriented bureaucracy overweighed it. The forestry bureaucracy offered to accept additional restrictions of forestry for nature protection, but only because they were linked to a gain in territorial authority over Bialowieza National Park and reduced political expectations about Natura 2000 sites all over the country. This re-definition of a formerly conservation-oriented element into a useful tool for production interests can be seen as an intentional, strategic customization of a regime element. In contrast, the process of creating the National Forest Programme so far failed once and since then is under conflictive negotiation. It was drafted as a detailed, nation-wide management plan, rather than a vague and general symbolic policy document as in most other countries. This exceptional customization of the NFP element in the tradition of management planning eventually threatened the dominant forestry interests and, hence, is seen a case of policy non-implementation.

This empirical approach provides a factual basis about the GI deals which are acceptable to the EU. Across the EU's six recent Global Europe treaties the EU has achieved a good degree of success in obtaining strong-form GI rights (no use of -like, -style qualifiers on labels) for a number of specific products. The article also identifies GI outcomes in recent treaties driven by US negotiating demands. While US-driven treaties prioritize a trademark approach to GIs, they also allow for coexistence with EU-style strong-form GIs. Comparing these two sets of outcomes provides useful insights for future EU trade negotiations, such as the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the US or the proposed Free Trade Agreement with Australia and New Zealand. In particular the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) shows how the interests of domestic cheese and meat producers can be protected while allowing for strong-form GI privileges for a reasonable number (135 in CETA) of listed product names.","[Moir, Hazel V.

The respondents' satisfaction with services provided by the analysed advisory centre was most often found to be at satisfactory level.","[Prus, Piotr; Drzazdzynska, Ksenia] UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Dept Econ & Advising Agribusiness, Bydgoszcz, Poland",Bydgoszcz University of Science & Technology,"Prus, P (通讯作者)，UTP Univ Sci & Technol Bydgoszcz, Dept Econ & Advising Agribusiness, Bydgoszcz, Poland.",piotr.prus@utp.edu.pl,"Prus, Piotr/L-6034-2019","Prus, Piotr/0000-0002-4447-4019",,,,,23,16,16,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-260-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,44,,,,,338,344,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406529200041,0

The subject of the paper researches corruption as a jeopardizing factor for the development of the health care system. The objective of the paper is to acquire a suitable, scientific and social knowledge of the various forms of corruption and mechanisms that the state authorities should use in the combat against this type of threat to society as a whole. Health care refers to the organized and comprehensive action of the society whose aim is to achieve the highest level of preserving the health of citizens and families. Therefore, the main hypotheses in this study are that a higher level of corruption in the health sector means a lower level of health care in society, that is, if the quality of health care is poorer, the slower economic development of society will be. What is particularly emphasized in the paper is that the combat against corruption in the health care system is one of the conditions for joining the EU. The data in this paper have been obtained through content analysis of the documents by associations of patients, judicial bodies and other organizations related to corruption in the health care system of Republic of Serbia.","[Rajakovic, Dusan; Milovanovic, Anatolij] John Naisbitt Univ, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Rajakovic, D (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Belgrade, Serbia.",dusan.rajakovic@gmail.com,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,235,242,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000024,0

In this context, fishing activities not only provide commodity goods but also have other functions. In this respect, the concept of the multifunctionality of fishing activities is emerging. We focus on the provision of amenities from the fishing sector, such as the presence of fishing boats or the direct sale of seafood, for which there is a demand that partly conditions an individual's choice of places to visit on the coast. We used a choice experiments method to estimate willingness to pay for these amenities which are produced jointly by commercial fishing.

There is little defense of the claim that maximizing surplus is normatively important, which is not obvious to non-economists. Difficulties with the claim that society should maximize surplus are generally not addressed. Economists are thus frequently criticized by non-economists for having a poor moral foundation for our normative claims. We should tell a more sophisticated normative story that justifies the moral importance of surplus, but acknowledges that other moral values may conflict with generating surplus and that distribution is not always separable from efficiency. This would allow students to make more compelling arguments in favor of normative positions they accept, regardless of the values they hold.","[Schmidt, Stephen] Union Coll, Dept Econ, Lippmann Hall 209,807 Union St, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Union College,"Schmidt, S (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Dept Econ, Lippmann Hall 209,807 Union St, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",schmidsj@union.edu,"Schmidt, Stephen/HTP-9086-2023",,,,,,19,2,3,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

In this study, we first investigate this issue by employing spatial econometric techniques using Chinese OFDI data between 2003 and 2014. We find that Chinese OFDI to the host country is positively associated with China's economic cooperation with it after considering the traditional determinants of OFDI, and its effect is robust with a different sub-sample. We also find strong support for the argument that Chinese OFDI shows a significant spatial agglomeration pattern. Furthermore, the host country's market size, openness to FDI, and well-developed infrastructure attract Chinese OFDI, while the effect of geographic distance to China, and the cultural proximity to China do not hold using different samples.","[Sun, Changfu] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shao, Yanmin] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Donlinks Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Jiaotong University; University of Science & Technology Beijing,"Shao, YM (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Donlinks Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yanminshao@amss.ac.cn,"sun, chang/ITV-6759-2023; SUN, CHANG/GXM-3680-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573251, 71103177]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The article acknowledges the funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71573251, 71103177).",,46,8,8,6,57,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The Political Economy of SOE Reform Backsliding in Vietnam,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLICY; STATES,"Conventional wisdom holds that international trade agreements can serve as a source of external pressure and credible commitment to overcome opposition and to lock in domestic economic reforms. This belief, however, underestimates the ability of politicians not only to circumvent these pressures, but to leverage international trade agreements to advance their own policy preferences - preferences that may be highly anti-reformist. Thus, trade agreements do not necessarily induce reforms and, in certain circumstances, they can even be counterproductive.

This article is the first to thoroughly exam the performance of EIFs in the Chinese market. Our analysis shows that EIFs in China perform worse than their benchmarks. We note that EIF managers are good market timers when the market does not move significantly. The underperformance of EIFs is primarily attributed to a fund manager's stock-picking ability; former managing experience is also a factor. Our results suggest that passive index funds are better choices than active funds for fund investments in the Chinese market.","[Weng, Yin-Che] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Dept Accounting, Room 201,13 Fayuan St, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rui] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Dept Appl Econ, Harbin, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Harbin Institute of Technology,"Weng, YC (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Dept Accounting, Room 201,13 Fayuan St, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",ycw@hit.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HIT.HSS.201502],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),The authors acknowledge financial support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (HIT.HSS.201502).,,23,6,6,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

They regard the kindergarten as the first starting line for their children and the stage of primary school learning as a second starting line. And What's more, they believe the process of entering senior high school from junior high school is the most important staring line for all the children. On the one hand, the Compulsory Education Law in China bans the tracking practice of separating students into different groups according to their ability in junior high schools below the county level. On the other hand, the tracking teaching practice is very common and popular among all the junior high schools below the county level for several reasons. First, it is demanded by the parents because they want their children to study with those hard-working students together. If the schools don't do so, they will lose a lot of top students in academic studies as they don't want to be disturbed by the underachievers. The enrolment rates of the schools will also be severely reduced. The tracking system in junior high schools will retain some of the outstanding students. Meanwhile, high enrolment rates will also bring good reputation to the school. However, due to the tracking system, the developments of the students in the ordinary classes have been largely influenced at an early age because of inferior learning environment, teachers, and management and personal foundations. How can we change that? Under the environment of compulsory education system, how can the students in township junior high schools be well educated in different levels? How to make every student become a useful person in the society in the future? This is the key question to be discussed in this paper.","[Yang, Zhiwen] Jiangxi Inst Fash Technol, Business Sch, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Pingzhen] Jiangxi Inst Fash Technol, Design Sch, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",,"Yang, ZW (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Inst Fash Technol, Business Sch, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",,"yang, zhiwen/HTS-4958-2023",,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-442-2,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,156.0,,,,,,86,89,,,,,,4,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6GD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426646800020,0

We develop a theoretical household model of land expansion, and test hypotheses by estimating a double hurdle model using household survey data from 368 smallholders in rural Zambia. About 19% of the farmers expanded cropland into forests, clearing an average of 0.14 ha over one year. Overall, we do not find significant associations between MT adoption and reduced deforestation among households in our sample, while higher labor availability and crop yield stimulate expansion.

Missing observations in the trial were classified as smoking. For our reference case, we took a societal perspective and used a 3% discount rate for costs and benefits. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to account for model and trial-estimated parameter uncertainty. We also conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis (cost per additional intermediate cessation) using direct costs of the intervention and two trial-based estimates of intermediate cessation: (a) biochemically verified (BV) 6-month continuous abstinence and (b) BV 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 6months.ResultsMultiple contests resulted in a significantly higher BV 6-month continuous abstinence rate (RD0.04), at a cost of $1275 per additional quit, and increased the duration of continuous abstinence among quitters. In the long run, multiple contests lead to an average gain of 0.03 QALYs and were cost saving. Incorporating parameter uncertainty into the analyses, the expected INMB was greater than $1000 for any realistic willingness to pay (WTP) for a QALY.ConclusionsAssuming missing values were smoking, multiple contests appear to dominate a single contest from a societal perspective. Funding agencies seeking to promote population health by funding a Quit-and-Win contest in a university setting should strongly consider offering multiple consecutive contests. Further research is needed to evaluate multiple contests compared to no contest.","[Popp, Jonah; Nyman, John A.] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 729, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA; [Luo, Xianghua] Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Luo, Xianghua] Univ Minnesota, Masonic Canc Ctr, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Bengtson, Jill; Thomas, Janet L.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Box 736 UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Lust, Katherine] Univ Minnesota, Boynton Hlth Serv, Minneapolis, MN USA; [An, Lawrence] Univ Michigan, Ctr Hlth Commun Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Ahluwalia, Jasjit S.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Brown University,"Popp, J (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Policy & Management, 420 Delaware St SE,MMC 729, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.",jhpopp@gmail.com,,"Popp, Jonah/0000-0003-3280-2748","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [5R01-HL094183-05]","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (5R01-HL094183-05, Thomas, PI).

Without effective policymaking, NCDs will continue to undermine health and economic systems globally. We propose that climate policy measuressuch as carbon pricingcan yield significant health-related co-benefits aside from their intended greenhouse gas emission reduction. We simulate three carbon tax scenarios in the energy and food sector in Belgium and assess the resulting health-related co-benefits. These benefits originate from decreased exposure to two leading NCD risk factors: fine particulate matter and dietary regimes excessive in animal products. The carbon tax could prevent 42,300-78,800 Disability-Adjusted Life Years in Belgium, or save 0.6-1.1% of total health care expenditure and an additional 0.06-0.12% of Belgian GDP. We conclude that these health-related co-benefits should be included in the cost-benefit analysis of carbon pricing.","[Vandenberghe, Desiree; Albrecht, Johan] Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Vandenberghe, D (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Desiree.Vandenberghe@UGent.be,,"Vandenberghe, Desiree/0000-0002-6734-5367; Albrecht, Johan/0000-0003-2485-4062",,,,,106,7,8,5,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Once they agree upon a price, they must submit the resulting price to the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), which can then authorize it. Swiss law requires the prices in health care to be based on empirical data. There has been little research on how to derive such a price for health care from empirical data and which data should be used. Based on a collaboration with psychological psychotherapists in Switzerland, we have designed a pricing system. The empirical basis were two representative surveys: a survey about costs and earnings of psychotherapists, as well as a time-use survey for psychotherapy. This paper shows the methodology followed to establish an empirically based pricing system. The paper may serve as a practical guide for health service providers who want to develop a pricing system. Our approach offers a high degree of freedom because it involves the collection of the data and an explicit modelling phase. At the same time, it might be more resource intensive than other approaches that are based on existing data sources.","[Hulliger, Beat; Sterchi, Martin] Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHN, Inst Competitiveness & Commun, Riggenbachstr 16, CH-4600 Olten, Switzerland",FHNW University of Applied Sciences & Arts Northwestern Switzerland,"Hulliger, B (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci & Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHN, Inst Competitiveness & Commun, Riggenbachstr 16, CH-4600 Olten, Switzerland.",beat.hulliger@fhnw.ch,,"Sterchi, Martin/0000-0002-1105-8780; Hulliger, Beat/0000-0001-5252-8606","'Foderation der Schweizer Psychologinnen und Psychologen' (FSP); 'Schweizerischer Berufsverband fur Angewandte Psychologie' (SBAP); 'Assoziation Schweizer Psychotherapeutinnen und Psychotherapeuten' (ASP); University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), School of Business","'Foderation der Schweizer Psychologinnen und Psychologen' (FSP); 'Schweizerischer Berufsverband fur Angewandte Psychologie' (SBAP); 'Assoziation Schweizer Psychotherapeutinnen und Psychotherapeuten' (ASP); University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), School of Business","This study was funded by 'Foderation der Schweizer Psychologinnen und Psychologen' (FSP), 'Schweizerischer Berufsverband fur Angewandte Psychologie' (SBAP), 'Assoziation Schweizer Psychotherapeutinnen und Psychotherapeuten' (ASP) and by the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW), School of Business.",,9,0,0,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The anticipation of learning through experimentation introduces two effects. The Inquisitive Effect appears because the planner wants to invest in geoengineering to gather socially valuable information on its effects. This effect encourages investments in geoengineering and may justify field tests even where the expected benefits fall short of the costs. The Flexibility Effect stems from the planner optimally preparing for the post-learning stage, where the field test is either ramped up or scaled down, depending on the outcome of the experiment. This effect can encourage or discourage investments in geoengineering. We demonstrate this set-up through an economic analysis of an artificial oxygenation scheme designed to mitigate eutrophication in the Baltic Sea and find that while the expected marginal benefit falls short of costs, a field test representing some 10 percent of full deployment would be optimal.

Rights-based output controls can promote selective fishing; however, this ability may be limited and insufficient in achieving full utilization of catch quotas. We measure fishing selectivity for bottom trawlers catching federally regulated groundfish in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank before and after the introduction of rights-based output controls. Directional distance functions are applied to tow-level catch data collected by fishery observers to construct a measure of selectivity equal to the difference between strong and weak output disposal efficient production frontiers. Quantile regressions are then used to estimate the change in median selectivity associated with the introduction of catch share management, controlling for spatial, temporal, and individual factors. A significant improvement in selectivity was found for tows in Georges Bank following the 2010 management change, though production is still largely characterized by imperfect selectivity.","[Scheld, Andrew M.] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Fisheries Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Walden, John] NOAA Fisheries, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 166 Water St,MB 19, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Scheld, AM (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Dept Fisheries Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",scheld@vims.edu; john.walden@noaa.gov,,"Scheld, Andrew/0000-0001-7490-3040",,,,,38,6,6,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The screening resulted in 36 case studies, most of which focused on scenarios for the environment, biodiversity and climate change but also covering territorial development, urban development, energy and transport. Only 2 case studies focused exclusively on forests. Most scenarios were developed to provide policy recommendations, they have as such, irrespective of the approaches and storylines used, in many cases influenced policy developments in Europe. The clearest example being that of climate and energy policy targets. The results demonstrate that most scenario frameworks are still not generating integrative visions of the environment that include forests in its entirety, reflecting sectoral fragmentation at the EU level. Forest-related scenarios will have to become more integrative to explore opportunities for policy actions aiming for a more sustainable future. This would require that future scenarios coherently assess impacts across sectors and adequately address the wide (and increasing) range of demands being placed on our forest resources.","[Aggestam, Filip] European Forest Inst Bonn Off, Resilience Programme, Pl Vereinten Nationen 7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Wolfslehner, Bernhard] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, European Forest Inst Cent, Inst Forest Environm & Nat Resource Policy, East European Reg Off, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Aggestam, F (通讯作者)，European Forest Inst Bonn Off, Resilience Programme, Pl Vereinten Nationen 7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",filip.aggestam@efi.int,"Aggestam, Filip/M-8483-2013","Aggestam, Filip/0000-0002-3842-7929",7th Framework Programme of the European Commission [289437],7th Framework Programme of the European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"This study was conducted within the framework of the ARANGE (Advanced multifunctional forest management in European mountain ranges) project, funded under the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission grant agreement no. 289437.",,48,9,9,1,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,SEP,2018,94.0,,,,,,21,26,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.06.004,0.0,,,6,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GP0VG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440528900003,0

Local commissioning bodies need to prioritise investments in health care, but previous studies provide limited evidence to inform the decision to expand existing services on the basis of cost-effectiveness. We examine the impact of specialist rehabilitation services in the subregion on hospital length of stay (LoS) and associated costs compared to routine care. Methods Comparison of hospital LoS and associated costs in centres with greater access (Hull) and limited access (i.e. routine care, York and Northern Lincolnshire), to specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex disabilities following illness or injury, using Hospital Episodes Statistics data. Results Average LoS and duration costs by Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) were lower for the majority of patients with greater access to specialist rehabilitation compared to routine care. Difference in LoS between groups widened with level of complexity within each HRG. For the more frequent HRG codes, the LoS difference was as high as 34 days longer for York compared to Hull and pound 7900 more costly. Conclusion Rehabilitation patients within York and Northern Lincolnshire areas appear to have longer LoS and higher associated costs compared to those admitted to the Hull Trust. This analysis suggests that specialist rehabilitation may be cost saving compared to routine care and supports the case for expansion of the existing services to improve coverage in the area.","[Duarte, A.; Bojke, L.; Richardson, G.] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Bojke, C.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Acad Unit Hlth Econ, Fac Med & Hlth, Leeds LS2 9NL, W Yorkshire, England; [Cayton, W.; Salawu, A.] Hull & East Yorkshire Hosp NHS Trust, Kingston Upon Hull HU3 2JZ, N Humberside, England; [Salawu, A.] Hull York Med Sch, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Salawu, A.] Univ Hull, Dept Hlth Sports & Exercise Sci, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Case, B.] NHS Vale York Clin Commissioning Grp, York YO1 6GA, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK; University of Leeds; University of York - UK; University of Hull; University of Hull,"Duarte, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",ana.duarte@york.ac.uk,,"Salawu, Abayomi/0000-0003-2496-0826; Duarte, Ana/0000-0002-0528-4773; Bojke, Chris/0000-0003-2601-0314; Richardson, Gerald Anthony/0000-0002-2360-4566",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) Yorkshire and Humber,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) Yorkshire and Humber(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This study has been partly funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) Yorkshire and Humber.

This study sought to analyse utilization and claims expenditure data before and after introduction of capitation payment policy to understand whether the intended objective was achieved. Methods: The study was cross-sectional, using a non-equivalent pre-test and post-test control group design. We did trend analysis, comparing utilization and claims expenditure data from three administrative regions of Ghana, one being an intervention region and two being control regions, over a 5-year period, 2010-2014. We performed multivariate analysis to determine differences in utilization and claims expenditure between the intervention and control regions, and a difference-in-differences analysis to determine the effect of capitation payment on utilization and claims expenditure in the intervention region. Results: Findings indicate that growth in outpatient utilization and claims expenditure increased in the pre capitation period in all three regions but slowed in post capitation period in the intervention region. The linear regression analysis showed that there were significant differences in outpatient utilization (p = 0.0029) and claims expenditure (p = 0.0003) between the intervention and the control regions before implementation of the capitation payment. However, only claims expenditure showed significant difference (p = 0.0361) between the intervention and control regions after the introduction of capitation payment. A difference-in-differences analysis, however, showed that capitation payment had a significant negative effect on utilization only, in the Ashanti region (p < 0.007). Factors including availability of district hospitals and clinics were significant predictors of outpatient health care utilization. Conclusion: We conclude that outpatient utilization and related claims expenditure increased in both pre and post capitation periods, but the increase in post capitation period was at slower rate, suggesting that implementation of capitation payment yielded some positive results. Health policy makers in Ghana may, therefore, want to consider capitation a key provider payment method for primary outpatient care in order to control cost in health care delivery.","[Andoh-Adjei, Francis-Xavier; Nsiah-Boateng, Eric] Natl Hlth Insurance Author, PMB Minist Post Off, 36-6th Ave, Ridge, Accra, Ghana; [Boudewijns, Bronke; Spaan, Ernst] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr Netherlands, Radboud Inst Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Evidence, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Asante, Felix Ankomah] Univ Ghana, ISSER, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [van der Velden, Koos] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Med Ctr Netherlands, Radboud Inst Hlth Sci, Dept Primary & Community Hlth, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Ghana; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Andoh-Adjei, FX (通讯作者)，Natl Hlth Insurance Author, PMB Minist Post Off, 36-6th Ave, Ridge, Accra, Ghana.",faxandoh@gmail.com,"Nsiah-Boateng, Eric/I-7095-2019; Spaan, Ernst/L-4659-2015; Spaan, Ernst/AAM-5595-2020; van der Velden, J./H-8101-2014","Nsiah-Boateng, Eric/0000-0001-5217-9805; Spaan, Ernst/0000-0002-7291-3699;",Netherlands organization for international co-operation in higher education (NUFFIC) through the Netherlands Fellowship Programme (NFP),Netherlands organization for international co-operation in higher education (NUFFIC) through the Netherlands Fellowship Programme (NFP),This manuscript is a product of a study financed by the Netherlands organization for international co-operation in higher education (NUFFIC) through the Netherlands Fellowship Programme (NFP).,,39,15,17,1,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Political support from firms can be pivotal for governments trying to protect the environment. I offer an explanation for this phenomenon, suggesting firms behave as they do in order to steal market share from their rivals. I develop a model in which a polluting firm makes a clean technology investment and then lobbies successfully for strong environmental protection, since this will shift market share away from its rival who has not made the clean investment. The key result concerns the impact of lobbying on the equilibrium outcome: for a region of the parameter space, it is only because of firms' lobbying that environmental protection is achieved. This is because lobbying increases a firm's returns to going green, by increasing the market share it can steel. The net effect of this distortion is an increase in welfare.

The epidemiology of three-vessel CHD and data about the application of different revascularisation strategies raise suspicion of deviation from the guidelines in the treatment of those patients. Claims data containing records of almost 10 million patients of the largest German statutory health insurance fund (Techniker Krankenkasse) were utilised to measure adherence to the guidelines for treatment of groups of patients with one-, two-, and three-vessel CHD, respectively. The impact of age, sex, and comorbidity on each patient's revascularisation procedure was investigated as well. There was no significant difference in the rate of PCI between the groups. In conclusion, the hypothesis that patients with a coronary three-vessel disease are not always treated according to the recommendations of the national guidelines could not be disproved by this study. Finally, the results of this study suggest that the best revascularisation strategy for each patient with two- and three-vessel disease should be decided upon by an interdisciplinary discussion between both cardiologists and cardiac surgeons.","[Linder, Roland; Verheyen, F.] Wissensch Inst Tech Krankenkasse WINEG, Bramfelder Str 140, D-22305 Hamburg, Germany; [Zeidler, J.; von der Schulenburg, J. -M.

However, the quality and rationale of such planning remains largely unexplored. Using a multiple case study approach, we aimed to assess the quality of community forest inventories in the mid-hill region of Nepal. We therefore conducted inventory in nine community forests, reviewed forest management plans and guidelines, and interviewed forest officials and representatives of community forest user groups to understand the procedures applied. Further we compared our inventory results with results presented in the plans and explored reasons for deviations. We found that the Inventory Guideline was frequently disregarded, both in design and implementation. Forest inventories were either poorly conducted or results simply fabricated. Significant differences were observed between the results of our inventories and those presented in the management plans. Furthermore, it turned out that growing stock volume was frequently manipulated to align with government circulars, specifying an upper limit of growing stock volume of 178 m(3) ha(-1). Seemingly, community forest inventories contribute to recentralizing community forestry through strengthening bureaucratic authority. Thus the inventory requirement serves mainly as a tool to satisfy bureaucratic requirements, rather than being a tool for guiding forest management decisions.","[Baral, Srijana; Chettri, Bir Bahadur Khanal; Basnyat, Bijendra; Rayamajhi, Santosh; Awale, Srijana] Inst Forestry, Hariyo Kharka 33700, Pokhara, Nepal; [Baral, Srijana; Meilby, Henrik; Basnyat, Bijendra] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Fac Sci, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Tribhuvan University; Institute of Forestry (IOF) - Nepal; University of Copenhagen,"Baral, S (通讯作者)，Inst Forestry, Hariyo Kharka 33700, Pokhara, Nepal.",srijnabaral@yahoo.com; heme@ifro.ku.dk,"Chhetri, Bir/HPE-9116-2023; Baral, Srijana/Q-5800-2019; Chhetri, Bir/AAH-6400-2019; Meilby, Henrik/E-1404-2015","Chhetri, Bir/0000-0002-6845-3773; Meilby, Henrik/0000-0002-3770-3880",'Science and Power in Participatory Forestry' project - Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs [13-05KU],'Science and Power in Participatory Forestry' project - Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs,This work was supported by the 'Science and Power in Participatory Forestry' project (13-05KU) funded by the Consultative Research Committee for Development Research under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.,,50,30,30,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUN,2018,91.0,,,,SI,,19,26,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.007,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GG5VL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432763700003,0

Through audits, accredited certification bodies assess the level of conformity of a firm's performance against the standard to grant or not the certificate on behalf of the FSC. In this paper, we assess the scope auditors have to shape the implementation of the FSC standard in Brazil. Our work is based on the analysis of certification bodies' rules and of available public full assessment and annual audit reports covering the period 2009-2013, completed with interviews with key informants. We show that most indicators of the Brazilian FSC standard leave no scope for interpretation. However, firms are certified and re-certified with a significant number of minor non-conformance with social, legal and environmental indicators. Moreover, the gradual improvement of the performance of the firm cannot always be considered as final. We conclude that some Indicators are too broad and need to be clarified, that the FSC should limit the number of minor non-conformance issues allowed and prohibit their recurrence. More systematic surveys could narrow possible interpretations by auditors and certification bodies.","[Piketty, Marie-Gabrielle] Cirad Green, Campus Int Baillarguet,TA C-105-F, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Drigo, Isabel Garcia] Nexus Socioambiental Ltda, CX Postal 233 Ibiuna, BR-18150970 Sao Paulo, Brazil",CIRAD,"Piketty, MG (通讯作者)，Cirad Green, Campus Int Baillarguet,TA C-105-F, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",marie-gabrielle.piketty@cirad.fr,,,French National Research Agency [ANR-11-CEPL-0009]; CGIAR Fund Donors; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-11-CEPL-0009] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),French National Research Agency(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work was supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR-11-CEPL-0009).

Leveraging a mass transit expansion in Mexico City's suburbs as a natural experiment, we find that a new train raised demand for elite and more distant schools, but only among high-achieving students with highly-educated parents. These students were also more likely to be assigned to elite and more distant schools under the test-based assignment mechanism. In contrast, we find little effect on the choices or assignments of low-achievers or those with lower-education parents.

We estimated the cost of illness (COI) of working-aged individuals with MS, from the societal perspective, overall and in different groups. A population-based study was conducted, using data linked from several nationwide registers, on 14,077 individuals with MS, aged 20-64 years and living in Sweden. Prevalence-based direct and indirect costs in 2010 were calculated, including costs for prescription drug use, specialized healthcare, sick leave, and disability pension. The estimated COI of all the MS patients were SEK 3950 million, of which 75% were indirect costs. MS was the main diagnosis for resource use, causing 38% of healthcare costs and 67% of indirect costs. The distribution of costs was skewed, in which less than 25% of the patients accounted for half the total COI.

Although most of the measures challenged by the EU were individual tariff lines, the final measure in its complaint was a 'more general measure' referred to as the systematic duty variation. A WTO Dispute Panel eventually ruled that the EU failed to establish the systematic nature of the duty treatment afforded by Russia to certain products. In this paper, we explore the Dispute Panel's ruling, as well as how claims of systematic non-compliance are treated in other legal settings. We conclude by exploring whether future WTO Panels should instead consider statistical evidence of systematic treatment to promote compliance.","[Reynolds, Kara M.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Rigod, Boris] Hausfeld LLP, Berlin, Germany",American University,"Reynolds, KM (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",reynolds@american.edu; boris.rigod@hausfeld,,"Reynolds, Kara/0000-0002-2570-4384",,,,,12,2,2,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2018,17.0,2,,,,,291,312,,10.1017/S1474745617000659,0.0,,,22,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,GD7PN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430704500006,0

Policy makers need quantitative knowledge to design effective and targeted policies. In this paper, the regional efficiency of healthcare facilities in Slovakia is measured (2008-2015) using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The DEA is the dominant approach to assessing the efficiency of the healthcare system but also other economic areas. In this study, the window approach is introduced as an extension to the basic DEA models to evaluate healthcare technical efficiency in individual regions and quantify the basic regional disparities and discrepancies. The window DEA method was chosen since it leads to increased discrimination on results especially when applied to small samples and it enables year-by-year comparisons of the results. Two stable inputs (number of beds, number of medical staff), three variable inputs (number of all medical equipment, number of magnetic resonance (MR) devices, number of computed tomography (CT) devices) and two stable outputs (use of beds, average nursing time) were chosen as production variable in an output-oriented 4-year window DEA model for the assessment of technical efficiency in 8 regions. The database was made available from the National Health Information Center and the Slovak Statistical Office, as well as from the online databases Slovstat and DataCube. The aim of the paper is to quantify the impact of the non-standard Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) variables as the use of medical technologies (MR, CT) on the results of the assessment of the efficiency of the healthcare facilities and their adequacy in the evaluation of the monitored processes. The results of the analysis have shown that there is an indirect dependence between the values of the variables over time and the results of the estimated efficiency in all regions. The regions that had low values of the variables over time achieved a high degree of efficiency and vice versa. Interesting knowledge was that the gradual addition of variables number of MR, number of CT and number of medical devices together, to the input side did not have a significant impact on the overall estimated efficiency of healthcare facilities.","[Stefko, Robert] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Presov, Slovakia; [Gavurova, Beata; Kocisova, Kristina] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",University of Presov; Technical University Kosice,"Gavurova, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Stefko, Robert/I-2763-2018; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018; Kocisova, Kristina/AAA-5401-2020","Stefko, Robert/0000-0002-0650-7780; Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X; Kocisova, Kristina/0000-0003-0784-441X; Stefko, Robert/0000-0003-0877-8880","VEGA Project - Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, science, research and sport of the Slovak Republic [1/0945/17]; Slovak Academy of Sciences","VEGA Project - Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, science, research and sport of the Slovak Republic; Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences)","VEGA Project No. 1/0945/17 - Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, science, research and sport of the Slovak Republic and the Slovak Academy of Sciences.",,69,80,83,11,64,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

One area researchers have not examined is the effects of different school types within the same urban region. We fill this gap by analyzing longitudinal data for students (grades 3-8) in Indianapolis, using student fixed effects models to estimate the impacts of students switching from a traditional public school to a charter, magnet, Catholic, or other private school. We find that students experience no differences in their achievement gains after transferring from a traditional public school to a charter school. However, students switching to magnet schools experience modest annual losses of -0.09 standard deviation (SD) in mathematics and -0.11 SD in English Language Arts. Students switching to Catholic schools also experience annual losses of -0.18 SD in mathematics. These findings are robust to a series of alternative model specifications. Additionally, we find some variability in the mean school type impacts by students' race/ethnicity, English language learner status, and number of years enrolled in a choice school. We discuss our results in the context of the variability of choice school effects across an entire urban area, something future research needs to examine.","[Berends, Mark] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Sociol, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Waddington, R.

This paper investigates the causal impact of participating in a specialized high school-based CTE delivery system on high school persistence, completion, earning professional certifications, and standardized test scores, with a focus on individuals from low-income families, a group that is overrepresented in CTE and high school non-completers. Using administrative data from Massachusetts, I combine ordinary least squares with a regression discontinuity design that capitalizes on admissions data at three schools that are oversubscribed. All estimates suggest that participation in a high-quality CTE program boosts the probability of on-time graduation from high school by 7 to 10 percentage points for higher income students, and suggestively larger effects for their lower-income peers and students on the margin of being admitted to oversubscribed schools. This work informs an understanding of the potential impact of specific CTE program participation on the accumulation of human capital even in a high-stakes policy environment. This evidence of a productive CTE model in Massachusetts may inform the current policy dialog related to improving career pathways and readiness.","[Dougherty, Shaun M.] Univ Connecticut, Neag Sch Educ, Dept Publ Policy, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Dougherty, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Neag Sch Educ, Dept Publ Policy, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",shaun.dougherty@uconn.edu,"Dougherty, Shaun/GVS-8504-2022","Dougherty, Shaun/0000-0003-3362-8948",Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin [456K470]; Smith Richardson Foundation,Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin; Smith Richardson Foundation,"I am grateful to the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin for funding this research (grant no. 456K470), and to the Smith Richardson Foundation for underwriting the July 2014 Building Human Capital and Economic Potential conference.

We show analytically and numerically that the level of emissions leakage depends on the level of trade friction in the service sector. In the model, production in the manufacturing sector is associated with pollution emissions, and production in the service sector is clean. In a special case with free trade in manufacturing and no trade in services, no leakage occurs. Allowing for trade in services, we solve for the relationship between trade frictions in the service sector and leakage. At lower levels of service sector's trade friction, leakage from a small strengthening of environmental regulation decreases (increases) if services are imported (exported). Finally, we simulate the model, calibrating the to the Canadian economy to compare these effects' relative sizes over a range of plausible parameter values. Leakage is about 18% lower when using trade friction levels estimated from the literature rather than assuming no trade friction in services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, it matters whether policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic agree on a conception of global order, on how to handle future technologies, and on the use of military force. Building on these drivers we develop and discuss four scenarios. The first describes a world of selective cooperation as the EU disintegrates. In the second, the US withdraws from the global stage and Europeans are forced to assume a leadership position. The third depicts negative consequences from populist nationalism, reducing transatlantic cooperation to military action against perceived Islamist threats.

Displacement involves specific capital loss. Some voluntary occupational mobility, for example, promotions, reflects augmented skills rather than specific human capital loss. Wage losses following displacement are strongly related to distance and direction. This is reflected in a downward shift in the skill portfolio. By contrast, the skill portfolio change in total occupational mobility shows a neutral or modest upward pattern, suggesting limited or no specific human capital loss from voluntary occupational mobility. The mean distance in occupational mobility following displacement declined significantly in the 1980s and 1990s suggesting the labor market was more efficiently reemploying workers following displacement, lowering displacement costs in that period.","[Robinson, Chris] Univ Western Ontario, Econ, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Robinson, C (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Econ, London, ON, Canada.",robinson@uwo.ca,,,Human Capital and Productivity Centre at the University of Western Ontario,Human Capital and Productivity Centre at the University of Western Ontario,"Chris Robinson is a professor of economics at the University of Western Ontario.

Participatory scenario processes are believed to enhance participants' systems understanding, learning, networking and subsequent changes in practices. However, limited empirical evidence is available to prove these assumptions. This study aimed to contribute to this knowledge gap. It evaluates whether these outcomes had resulted from the scenario planning exercise and the extent to which they can contribute to transformational processes. The research focused on a district level case study in rural Mali which examined food security and necessary policy changes in the context of climate change. The analyses of interviews with 26 participants carried out 12 months after the workshop suggested positive changes in learning and networking, but only limited influence on systems understanding. There was limited change in practice, but the reported changes occurred at the individual level, and no policy outcomes were evident. However, by building the adaptive capacity of participants, the scenario process had laid the foundation for ongoing collective action, and potential institutional and policy transformation. We conclude that to enhance the resilience of agricultural and food systems under climate change, participatory scenario processes require a broader range of cross-scale actors' engagement to support transformational changes. Such process will both catalyse deeper learning and more effective link with national level policy making process. In addition, individual scenario planning exercises are unlikely to generate sufficient learning and reflection, and instead they should form one component of more extensive and deliberate stakeholder engagement, learning and evaluation processes.","[Totin, Edmond; Sidibe, Amadou; Partey, Samuel; Tabo, Ramadjita] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, POB 320, Bamako, Mali; [Totin, Edmond] Univ Natl Agr Benin, POB 43, Ketou, Benin; [Butler, James R.] CSIRO Land & Water Flagship, Australian Trop Sci & Innovat Precinct, Private Mail Bag, Aitkenvale, Qld 4814, Australia; [Sidibe, Amadou] Inst Polytech Rural Format & Rech Appl Katibougou, POB 06, Koulikoro, Mali; [Thornton, Philip K.] CGIAR Res Programme Climate Change Agr & Food Sec, POB 30709, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); CGIAR,"Totin, E (通讯作者)，Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, POB 320, Bamako, Mali.;Totin, E (通讯作者)，Univ Natl Agr Benin, POB 43, Ketou, Benin.",edmond.totin@gmail.com,"Thornton, Philip/AAB-8806-2020; Butler, James RA/D-7446-2011","Thornton, Philip/0000-0002-1854-0182; Butler, James RA/0000-0001-8333-947X; Totin, Edmond/0000-0003-3377-6190","CGIAR Fund Council; ACIAR (Australia); European Union; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), New Zealand; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Netherlands; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Switzerland; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), UK; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Thailand; Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA), from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada","CGIAR Fund Council(CGIAR); ACIAR (Australia)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res); European Union(European Union (EU)); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), New Zealand; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Netherlands(Netherlands Government); International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Switzerland; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), UK; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Thailand; Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA), from the UK Government's Department for International Development (DFID); International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada(International Development Research Centre - IDRC)","The authors acknowledge the CGIAR Fund Council, ACIAR (Australia), European Union, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), New Zealand, Netherlands, Switzerland, UK and Thailand for funding to the CGIAR Research Programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

Further, the experience of the newly industrialized economies suggests that human capital investments will be a vital ingredient of the transition from middle income to high income. Those investments can also affect equity and public finances. In this article, we use data from the National Transfer Accounts to empirically analyze the effect of human capital investment in Asian countries on economic growth, inequality, and fiscal balance. Our empirical evidence suggests that human capital investments have a positive effect on labor productivity and, hence, output.

Then, the bias-corrected cost-efficiency scores were regressed on a set of explanatory variables using a bootstrapped truncated regression. The results show that substantial cost-inefficiency occurs in lobster aquaculture due to the overuse of inputs, which, given the prevailing input prices, are also used in inappropriate ratios. Cost-efficiency is shown to be significantly impacted by the age of the farmer, total cage volume and by variables affecting the production environment such as the cage cleaning, distance to the nearest farms and the presence of other discharges into the marine environment.","[Au Ton Nu Hai; Speelman, Stijn] Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, BW01 Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Au Ton Nu Hai; The Bui Dung] Hue Univ, Univ Econ, Hue, Vietnam",Ghent University; Hue University,"Hai, ATN (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Agr Econ, Fac Biosci Engn, BW01 Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Au.tonNuHai@Ugent.be,"Hai, Au Ton Nu/AAR-5386-2021","Hai, Au Ton Nu/0000-0001-9782-4580; speelman, stijn/0000-0001-7692-3459",,,,,45,20,20,2,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Social media networks have a tremendous potential in terms of bringing the companies closer to customers. Through social media, consumers can interact with businesses to get the value they are looking for, whether we are talking about discounts or specific information. Unfortunately, not all companies are aware of customers' needs and do not properly use social media networks to facilitate experiences and collaborative dialogue that customers value. In this regard, the authors used a questionnaire containing 11 items that can be divided into 4 sections: social media networks used by employees and customers, employees' perceptions about the reasons consumers interact with companies via social media, the reasons employees think companies interact with customers via social media, social media networks used by companies to interact with customers for different reasons. Data were collected from a group of engineers who graduate from Politehnica University of Bucharest and who work for companies from different domains. Then, data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20.0 Software. The conceptual framework contains 3 variables: Customers' reasons for using social media, Companies' reasons for using social media, and Social media networks, each being defined through different items. Our findings indicate that Facebook and Linkedln are the internet users' favorite platforms for interacting with companies or customers, while unlike other countries, Twitter is one of the social media networks used very little by internet users from our country. The results pointed out that there are positive moderate correlations between why consumers use social media for seeking information and why companies use social media for marketing and social interaction. There are also positive moderate correlations between companies' and consumers' reasons for using social media for communication, and also between why companies use social media for their development and why consumers use social media for improving services/products offered by a company. The results of our study should be interpreted with caution, this study being an exploratory one, with a few limitations. Only the perceptions of the people surveyed have been considered. The people surveyed played a double role in our study; customers who use social media and employees who are working in companies that use social media. Therefore, in the future, the authors want to reconsider studying companies' reasons for using social media by analyzing the managers' responses that are responsible for marketing and online marketing in organizations.","[Barbu, Andreea; Militaru, Gheorghe] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Barbu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, 313 Splaiul Independentei, Bucharest 060042, Romania.",andreea.barbu2901@upb.ro; gheorghe.militaru@upb.ro,"Militaru, Gheorghe/W-9923-2018; Barbu, Andreea/H-7276-2018","Barbu, Andreea/0000-0003-3119-8753",,,,,21,1,1,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,881,893,,,,,,13,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200075,0

In order to achieve our scientific goal, we gradually present and discuss what we consider to be key issues for the research topic. First of all, we present our perspective on the complexity of the knowledge dynamics concept and explain why and how knowledge dynamics must be approached differently in order to obtain individual and organizational performance. For an organization is of fundamental importance to have a clear perspective on the types of existing knowledge. Correct identification of knowledge according to various criteria helps to manage them effectively and therefore contributes to the successful achievement of organizational objectives. Throughout another section of this paper, we argue that knowledge dynamics represents multiple transfers through different processes of which the best known are: socialization, externalization, internalization, combination. These processes are possible due to the existence of two forms of knowledge as tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Intellectual capital and knowledge dynamics are largely debated concepts and the global evolution provides continuously new issues for discussion due to their dynamic nature. The intellectual capital of an organization is a complex structure, a very dynamic component and an endless source of innovation and development if it is appropriately capitalized. Therefore, we underline the interdependences of knowledge dynamics processes and intellectual capital components within the organization. Finally, throughout this paper, we will approach in depth important issues about the influence of knowledge dynamics processes and intellectual capital at the organizational level.","[Bejinaru, Ruxandra] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Acad Romanian Scientists, 13 Univ, Suceava 720229, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR),"Bejinaru, R (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Acad Romanian Scientists, 13 Univ, Suceava 720229, Romania.",ruxandrabejinaru@yahoo.com,"BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/CAF-3746-2022; Bejinaru, Ruxandra/AAW-4372-2021","BEJINARU, RUXANDRA/0000-0003-2331-155X; Bejinaru, Ruxandra/0000-0003-2331-155X",,,,,40,0,0,0,0,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,599,609,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200053,0

Indonesia was an early leader on REDD +, and set up the regulatory frameworks and monitoring systems to support demonstration projects that could trade credits in voluntary carbon markets. This article applies a neoliberal govemmentality framework to evaluate the development of REDD + market institutions in Indonesia during the Readiness period between 2008 and 2013. It critiques the role of the state in this process, and how the authority of public agencies shapes the actions of private subjects. The case of Indonesia indicates a pivotal role for government agencies at multiple levels in integrating the operation of FtEDD + market activities within a supportive regime of forest and land management. Critical to this process was legislation to trade in forest carbon and obtain project licenses, devolved land-use planning and forest management that could support conunercial activities, and robust MRV surveillance systems to oversee on-ground activities. Despite these efforts, projects were often subject to an uncertain and highly contested forest management regime, undermining attempts to demonstrate the viability of operationalising market mechanisms at the local scale.","[Boer, Henry James] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Griffith University,"Boer, HJ (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Sch Govt & Int Relat, Ctr Governance & Publ Policy, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",h.boet@griffith.edu.au,,"Boer, Henry/0000-0002-3007-1358",,,,,69,16,16,1,29,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JAN,2018,86.0,,,,,,4,12,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.10.004,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FR9VD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419420300002,0

Corruption affects individuals acting on behalf of any organisation that may make beneficial economic decisions in exchange for obtaining material or personal benefits, or the promise of receiving them for making a particular decision. It is therefore always a violation of the performance of duties falling within the scope of one's work. One of the most dangerous dimensions of corruption is currently known as great corruption, which relates to economic and political elites. This article will present organisations, whose objective is to combat corruption in France (Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption-SCPC) and the estimated scale of corruption, which is constantly increasing.

In other words, what is the 'climate beta'? In this paper we argue using a combination of theory and integrated assessment modelling that the climate beta is positive and close to unity for maturities of up to about one hundred years. This is because the positive effect on the climate beta of uncertainty about exogenous, emissions-neutral technological progress overwhelms the negative effect on the climate beta of uncertainty about the carbon-climate-response, particularly the climate sensitivity, and the damage intensity of warming. Mitigating climate change therefore has no insurance value to hedge the aggregate consumption risk borne by future generations. On the contrary, it increases that risk, which justifies a relatively high discount rate on the expected benefits of emissions reductions. However, the stream of undiscounted expected benefits is also increasing in the climate beta, and this dominates the discounting effect so that overall the net present value of carbon emissions abatement is increasing in the climate beta.

In this article, we examine the impact of an economically important, policy-relevant public land management regulation designed to protect coastal biodiversity. We focus our attention on the land use conflict at Cape Hatteras National Seashore between off-road vehicle (ORV) access and nesting habitat protection for a number of endangered species. We combine site choice and participation data to estimate a repeated discrete choice model of recreational angler behavior in response to time-varying access restrictions. Our results suggest the economic costs of this policy are relatively modest, ranging from $403,000 to $2.07 million annually. Our results provide general support for the National Park Service's recently implemented ORV management plan, as an upper bound of recreation costs is likely less than conservative estimates of the benefits associated with endangered species protection.","[Dundas, Steven J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [von Haefen, Roger H.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 2801 Founders Dr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Mansfield, Carol] RTI Int, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Oregon State University; North Carolina State University; Research Triangle Institute,"Dundas, SJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 213 Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",steven.dundas@oregonstate.edu; rhhaefen@ncsu.edu; carolm@rti.org,"Dundas, Steven/AAV-9779-2020","Dundas, Steven/0000-0003-3000-3395; von Haefen, Roger/0000-0002-5604-8754","National Park Service [T2310081036, GS-10F-0283K]",National Park Service,"The authors thank Laura Taylor, Wally Thurman, Marty Smith, Zack Brown, Matthew Godfrey, Rob Johnston, and participants at the 2016 W-3133 Meeting and the 2015 AAEA Annual Meeting for helpful comments.

However, the analysis of statistical data on the structure of remuneration in the Polish ICT sector illustrates that in itself there is inequality that has not been eradicated - inequality in the remuneration of women and men who provide work at the same positions. Therefore, the aim of the presented study is to analyse the existence of the phenomenon of gender pay gap at individual positions in the ICT sector in Poland (in general and with division into voivodeships) in 2010-2016. The structure of the study is as follows: the first part of the article exemplifies the overall characteristics of the ICT sector in Poland in the analysed period and presents the structure of remuneration at individual positions, with division into gender; then, an analysis of the relationship between the profession and the gender pay gap in the studied years was depicted. For this purpose, the Pearson's correlation coefficient was used, which determined the level of linear dependence between the position held and the gender pay gap. The study is completed by a summary and the most vital conclusions from previous deliberations. The literature studies on the phenomenon of gender pay gap and the analysis of statistical data made available by the Central Statistical Office in Poland and Voivodeship Statistical Offices for the years of 2010-2016 constitute the research methods.","[Gomolka, Agata] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Management & Social Commun, Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Gomolka, A (通讯作者)，Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Management & Social Commun, Krakow, Poland.",agata.gomolka@doctoral.uj.edu.pl,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,813,822,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300091,0

Using latent class analysis (LCA), we identify important differences between respondents in their consistency with the validity tests and control for much of this heterogeneity. Estimates of VSL from the latent class that is consistent with the validity tests are smaller than estimates from the standard analysis.

The findings indicate that CSR plays a significant role in reducing the risk premium of corporate bonds through an insurance-like effect.

The following article aims to tackle the difficult questions regarding who, when or what might influence the process of migration, but also the main questions regarding whether religious radicalization is the source of the problems and how exactly it might be prevented? The research method starts from proving that human resource management often comes as a useful tool in overcoming cultural differences caused by migration, therefore it need to be used to address the main dilemmas regarding cultural differencing. At the same time, the origins and identity of migrants play an important part in understanding how challenges regarding particular migrants might be tackled. The idea is to establish that religion, culture and civilization developed in the original war-zone countries from the Middle East play a key role into the development of certain values, visions of life, beliefs and many more particular aspects that define migrants that come from those areas. In addition to that, key questions should be asked regarding the ways people interact with different cultures such as the Islamic ones in different territories. In the and it is to be recognized that there are at least five key actors that are currently involved into merging or/and accepting migrants, and each of their role need to be detailed so that human resource managers can have a clear path on how to address problems regarding migration from conflict zones. One of the future research questions that the article proposes is whether the failure of the western values in the Muslim conflict countries is a permanent one and will it lead to future permanent conflicts between migrants coming from those areas and Christians with western values.","[Iurian, Sergiu-Dan; Jaradat, Mohammad] Valahia Univ Torgoviste, 2 Carol I Blvd, Targoviste 130024, Romania",Valahia University of Targoviste,"Iurian, SD (通讯作者)，Valahia Univ Torgoviste, 2 Carol I Blvd, Targoviste 130024, Romania.",iurian_sergiu@yahoo.com; jaradat_hadi@yahoo.com,"JARADAT, Mohammad/AAK-8603-2021",,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,528,533,,,,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200047,0

The goal of the present paper is to analyse strength and direction of correlation between weather variables and insurance indemnity in case of winter plants to state whether these influence amounts of money paid to farmers for their crops' losses.","[Klapkiv, Lyubov; Kedra, Arleta] Maria Curie Sklodowska Univ Lublin, Fac Econ, Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Klapkiv, L; Kedra, A (通讯作者)，Pl Marii Curie Sklodowskiej 5, Lublin, Poland.",liuba.klapkiv@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl; arleta.kedra@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,"Klapkiv, Luba/AAR-8947-2020; Kędra, Arleta/AAG-6048-2020","Klapkiv, Luba/0000-0002-5495-7786; Kędra, Arleta/0000-0002-5867-3078",,,,,15,0,0,1,2,Warsaw Univ Life Sciences Pr,Warsaw,"Nowoursynowska 166, Warsaw, POLAND",,,978-83-7583-802-2,,,,2018,,,,,,,358,363,,10.22630/ESARE.2018.1.50,0.0,,,6,Development Studies; Economics; Geography,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Geography,BO1TN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000502413100050,0

He conveys the mutual dependence and reciprocal protection between human beings and nature in the course of the development of modern society. His poetry is based on an idealistic poetic realm of Chinese Zen thoughts and Thoreau. The ideal existence practice of Thoreau humanism and the Native American literary ecological thought are the main concepts in his poetry. Snyder integrates the quintessence of Zen ideology and the method of eco-poetic salvation in poetic creation. He hopes to find a new spiritual sustenance for the soul, return purely to the heart, enlighten in the secular world, and eventually achieve the bright heart. Gary Snyder, an environmentalist and great American poet, won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1975 for his poetry collection Turtle Island. As a Zen believer, under the influence of Dependent Origination and the Emptiness of Nature, Snyder integrates Zen thoughts that are the very Zen aesthetics in his poetry. He comprehended the taste of life philosophy in his daily life, experienced various dwelling forms of life in practice, purifies the soul, and expressed the inner feelings through his works. His works are concerning the return to nature, advocating the way of natural harmony and Buddhist compassion. Taoist and Confucian thought in Snyder's poetry are manifested as a unity of the heaven and the earth, demonstrating his awareness of ecological salvation.","[Liu Zhijie] Beihang Univ, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Beihang University,"Liu, ZJ (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,4,FRANCIS ACAD PRESS,LONDON,"35 IVOR PL, LOWER GROUND, LONDON, NW1 6EA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-912407-98-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,102,105,,,,,,4,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BL4ID,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450418800021,0

On the basis of the analyzes it can be stated that if the clusters are overlaped, the ability of the CHF coefficient is lower than in the case of well separated clusters. Success rate was in all cases lower than 60%. The best results are always achieved using the Farthest neighbor method.

This paper uses the relationship among countries as the primary unit of analysis and introduces different procedures of social network analysis, where the goal is to demonstrate their applicability to the study of international trade of forest products. Compared to statistical analysis, additional benefit of social network analysis is the fact that the assumption of independence of observations does not hold true; and thus enables a more thorough insight into the structure of the international trade network. Data on international trade of chemical wood pulp, truffles, and aggregate forest products in the 1988-2006 period is used to demonstrate the applicability of selected network indices as descriptors of economic flows among countries. The analysis covers topics of network visualization, characteristics of the network, grouping of countries, their individual positions and modelling of international trade that includes endogenous effects such as reciprocity, and exogenous effects such as forest certification and contribution of forestry to the gross domestic product. Results show that many procedures of social network analysis can be used in the field of interriational trade of forest products, but that great care is needed in their contextual interpretation. Prominent topics of application are the structural trends and impact of different policies, such as the EU Timber Regulation on international trade of wood-based products.","[Lovric, Marko; Mavsar, Robert] European Forest Inst, Yliopistokatu 6, Joensuu 80100, Finland; [Da Re, Riccardo; Vidale, Enrico; Pettenella, Davide] Univ Padua, TESAF Dept, Agripolis, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy",University of Padua,"Lovric, M (通讯作者)，European Forest Inst, Yliopistokatu 6, Joensuu 80100, Finland.",marko.lovric@efi.int,"Pettenella, Davide/B-6874-2012","Pettenella, Davide/0000-0002-7403-9560; Lovric, Marko/0000-0002-7729-4743",Project StarTree [311919],Project StarTree,"This research was conducted as part of the FP7 Project StarTree (grant agreement No. 311919).

In compliance with legal regulations in Poland, this involves for-profit manufacturing, construction, commercial and service activity as well as prospection, exploration and extraction of mineral reserves as well as professional activity carried out in an organized and continuous manner(1). The necessity of self-financing and market competition forces enterprises to constantly search for new manufacturing, technical, organizational and financial solutions as well as to improve their financial performance. In these conditions, the basic characteristics of an enterprise are(2): a) volatility resulting from the need to constantly adapt to market conditions, b) uncertainty and the resulting risk inherently involved with an enterprise's operations, c) economic rationale of decisions and the systematic and professional nature of the conducted activity, d) the need to sustain innovation and entrepreneurship in an enterprise's activity. Economic sciences encompass, on the one hand, theories related to economic growth and development and, on the other, enterprise development theories. These theories come together with the concept of value(3). In the late 20th century, theoreticians and practitioners of management began to advocate a closer connection of company management with creating shareholder value. Shifting the focus from maximizing profit to maximizing value for owners changed the approach to assessing the performance of an enterprise. Business management that is focused on stimulating value maximization for owners is referred to as Value Based Management (VBM). It points to the need to maximize value for all stakeholders. It is a management philosophy that uses analytical tools and processes to bring individual objects of an organization around creating value for owners(4).","[Mackowiak, Ewa; Kumor, Iwona] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Accounting, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Mackowiak, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Accounting, Katowice, Poland.",ewa.mackowiak@ue.katowice.pl; iwona.kumor@ue.katowice.pl,,"Mackowiak, Ewa/0000-0001-5694-8237",,,,,11,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,235,240,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300025,0

We find that the quote rule correctly classifies 100% of transactions initiated by buyers and sellers. Almost the same excellent job does the Lee and Ready rule. The Ellis, Michaely and O'Hara rule is less successful albeit its success rate exceeds 95% of the transactions assigned to both sides. The tick and the reverse tick rules exhibit a very low accuracy. The tick rule correctly classifies only 25.35% of transactions initiated by buyers and 25.95% of transactions initiated by sellers. The reverse tick rule performs even worse classifying as much as 16.66% and 16.67% of such transactions accordingly. The reason for their low accuracy is that the stock prices remain unchanged at the WSE at about 70% of all transactions.

In order to get rid of stress and feelings of helplessness, it is important to realize that the problems are not from the outside, not the others are to blame. Things we strongly believe have a significant impact on us. Our beliefs about our own person, about the world, about others, about our life perspectives - all our thoughts have an enormous impact on the man we become. The image we have of ourselves, of the others and of the surrounding world influences our behavior. There is a direct link between the style of communication and the effects we have on the sometimes positive, sometimes negative ones. Transactional Analysis is both a theory of communication and human personality. It is the analysis of the verbal and nonverbal messages exchanged on the communication process. It has evolved over the past decades, providing support in psychotherapy, personal development, education, management, marketing, sales, negotiation and communication in organizations. The way of being of individuals is observed in their behavior and in their style of communication. We analyzed the communication style predominant among the students at the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the Ovidius University of Constanta, a style of communication that reflects their dominant behavior. For this purpose, we used the questionnaire written by Julie Hay. Based on the questionnaires we analyzed, we selected 5 groups of 5 questions to see what motivates students in our university about their habits and self-confidence: the firmness with which they deal with those around them; the rationality they demonstrate in critical moments; obedience to others; the compassion it manifests; the attitude of giving orders. As a result of the analysis of these questionnaires, we noticed that the media of communication styles is attributed to an individual who has the predominant style of communication and behavior - the state of the Free Child, followed at very small differences by Adult and Careful Parent states. This means that predominantly university students predominate in their amiable and unstable attitude, the students being very relaxed, but also spontaneous and uninhibited, energetic and unguarded, predominantly predominant behavior in the first year of college. Likewise, this student also has the attitude of here and now, but always carefully and caring about those around him.","[Popovici, Norina; Condrea, Elena; Stanciu, Anca Cristina] OVIDIUS Univ Constanta, 1Univ St, Constanta 900470, Romania",Ovidius University,"Popovici, N (通讯作者)，OVIDIUS Univ Constanta, 1Univ St, Constanta 900470, Romania.",norinapopovici@yahoo.com; elenacondrea2003@yahoo.com; castan22us@yahoo.com,"Condrea, Elena/ABE-2893-2021","Condrea, Elena/0000-0002-1930-5694",,,,,11,0,0,1,11,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,431,441,,,,,,11,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200038,0

Like other forms of non-state actor involvement in the WTO, amicus curiae access has been controversial. Despite this controversy, non-state actors have made use of this access and submitted amicus curiae briefs. This article asks: What has come of these briefs once they are submitted and what explains how amicus are treated by the DSM? This article empirically maps amici in all disputes from 1998 (after amicus access was first recognized) through 2014, arguing that amicus access is conditioned by a combination of political and legal constraints faced by the WTO panels and AB. In particular, whether the content of an amicus is considered hinges on it having the endorsement of a disputing party and whether its consideration interferes with the WTO DSM's reputation for coherence. In all, these findings have implications for the debate over whether amicus curiae access is good or bad news for the WTO and non-state actor involvement.","[Squatrito, Theresa] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Squatrito, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",theresa.squatrito@jus.uio.no,,,Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence Funding Scheme [223274],Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence Funding Scheme(Research Council of Norway),"Previous versions of this paper have been presented at the 2015 ECPR Joint Sessions in Warsaw and the 2014 American Society of International Law Research Forum.

We make several key findings: First, we find the presence of VCs can significantly raise the executive compensation. Second, high reputation VCs and private VCs increases the likelihood of granting executive equity incentives, whereas foreign VCs are significantly negatively related with executive equity incentive. Third, the pay-performance sensitivity of government VCs and foreign VCs is significant on stock return (RET) whereas insignificant on accounting performance (ROA). Moreover, the increasing VCs share in portfolio companies enhance the pay performance sensitivity on RET. Our results show that before VCs final exiting their post-IPO portfolio companies in China, VCs' impact on executive compensation are more consistent with grandstanding theories and intending to provide higher cash compensation to encourage executives to raise the companies' stock price, which is indicating VCs' changing role from a coach into a speculator after the portfolio companies' IPO.","[Sun, Yangbin; Cheng, Cheng; Yang, Shenggang] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Cheng, C (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",ccheng@hnu.edu.cn,,"Cheng, Cheng/0000-0002-9780-4018",,,,,44,6,7,4,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

However, the volume of foreign investment since 2014 has fallen sharply. This problem is relevant not only at the level of the national economy, but also at the level of the economies of Russian regions. The current economic situation is characterized by a deficit of foreign investment and tight monetary policy. The article substantiates the thesis that in such conditions, for the regional authorities, one of the main tools for supporting investment activity is the development of the institution of public-private partnership. The experience of Tambov region shows that its success in ensuring a high rate of investment in fixed assets (especially in comparison with the other regions of the Central Federal District) is associated with a high dynamics of public-private partnership development.

In order to see the effect of the global crisis and whether this effect changes across ownership, the analysis is conducted in subperiods covering the precrisis and the postcrisis periods and estimations are repeated by an ownership breakdown. Findings show that the determinants of NPLs have changed, and macroeconomic and policy-related determinants have higher significance after the crisis. Accordingly, strong economic activity and sound fiscal policy improve loan quality, while higher policy rate induces NPLs. Meanwhile, the significance of bank-specific determinants depends on ownership. Yet, a common theme applies suggesting that asset size should grow in favor of loans, but this should be backed with efficient loan monitoring, while capital adequacy is stringent enough to limit NPLs.","[Us, Vuslat] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Us, V (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, TCMB Idare Merkezi, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Istiklal Cad 10, TR-06050 Ankara, Turkey.",vuslat.us@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,94,10,10,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The question is how to aggregate partial measures using appropriate weighting coefficients that will not rely on subjective judgments concerning their relative significance. In line with a number of studies we propose a rather simple but comprehensive approach based on principal component analysis widely used in multidimensional statistics. Though the first principal component or the set of principal components are known to be used as an aggregate economic indicator, this approach usually implies significant loss in variance of initial factors. However, we argue that the problem has a rather straightforward solution. The whole set of principal components weighted by the corresponding proportions of explained variance can serve as a universal natural aggregate measure of various types of economic activities. The proposed methodology is applied to evaluate the national competitiveness and to build the corresponding ranking of the countries in Eurasian region.","[Verenikin, Alexei] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, 3rd New Educ Bldg, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Verenikina, Anna] RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, 6 Miklukho Maklaya Str, Moscow 117198, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Verenikin, A (通讯作者)，Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, 3rd New Educ Bldg, Moscow 119991, Russia.",verenikin@mail.ru; verenikina_ayu@pfur.ru,"Verenikina, Anna/Q-5344-2018; Verenikin, Alexei/AAB-4436-2021; Verenikin, Alexei/M-8521-2013; Verenikina, Anna/AAI-5737-2021","Verenikin, Alexei/0000-0002-8293-3431; Verenikina, Anna/0000-0003-0400-0799",RUDN University Program 5-100,RUDN University Program 5-100,The publication was prepared with the support of the RUDN University Program 5-100.,,12,4,4,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1830,1841,,,,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400182,0

Its unique feature is complexity. Individual elements form one whole, although they are managed by different entities. It means that the regional tourist product consists of many elements which are complementary to one another. Cooperation of entities developing the regional tourist product is particularly important, and it is often even a prerequisite for such products. Regional tourism policy is crucial as it should focus on enhancing motivation for cooperation among entities in the region and outside it. Such cooperation affects the scope, structure, quality as well as the availability and image of regional tourist products, among others, and therefore the region's competitiveness. The aim of this paper is to present the unique nature of regional tourist products, where the development of such products is determined by cooperation. This paper also seeks to show the diversity of regional tourist products, depending on the entities involved and their objectives. Research has been conducted in order to identify the motives for cooperation, to show the level of willingness and satisfaction from such cooperation and the awareness of undertaking joint actions. The representatives of the entities participating in the development of joint regional products were surveyed. A diagnostic survey was carried out using questionnaires. A sample of 643 various entities (local governments, commercial entities, nonprofit tourism organisations) were surveyed during 2013-2016 in Poland. The problem analysis has shown that regional tourist products are particularly difficult to develop. Their scope, structure, quality as well as availability and image depend on a range of factors that result from cooperation of many entities. They are the basis for the region's tourism attractiveness and competitiveness. The results of the research have shown that entities are willing to cooperate provided that the product achieves their individual objectives and there is a leading entity which motivates them properly to take action. The research has also shown that entities prefer to cooperate with the same or similar type of entities; for example, a local government with other local governments, commercial entities with other commercial entities. It is much more difficult to establish and implement cooperation with entities of different nature. Nonprofit organisations usually manage to do that. Also, it must be noted that the awareness that cooperation is necessary for developing regional tourist products is very high among the surveyed entities.","[Wanagos, Marzena; Marciszewska, Barbara] Gdynia Maritime Univ Gdynia, Gdynia, Poland",,"Wanagos, M (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ Gdynia, Gdynia, Poland.",m.wanagos@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; b.marciszewska@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Marciszewska, Barbara/X-8540-2018",,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,559,566,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300061,0

Country-specific properties used in this study are GDP, population, and other geographical properties of the countries. Moreover, to analyze the differences among countries in terms of development, we also divide data into developed and developing countries. Network indices employed apart from the country-specific properties as explanatory variables in this paper are local centrality measures such as degree and strength, and global centrality measures which are closeness and eigenvector. We find that centrality measures positively and significantly affect countries' bilateral trade. Since these measures are actually related to the position of the countries in the network, we conclude that countries with high centralities tend to have higher trade volumes.","[Yanikkaya, Halit; Karaboga, Hasan] Gebze Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey",Gebze Technical University,"Yanikkaya, H (通讯作者)，Gebze Tech Univ, Dept Econ, TR-41400 Gebze, Turkey.",halityanikkaya@gtu.edu.tr; hkaraboga@gtu.edu.tr,"Karaboga, Hasan/Y-8001-2018; YANIKKAYA, Halit/J-3678-2019","YANIKKAYA, Halit/0000-0003-1542-0174",,,,,12,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1962,1971,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400195,0

Based on data from a booming corporate bond market in China, we confirm that fraudulent issuers have higher corporate bond costs. Specifically, they are more likely to push upward price revisions, pay higher issue fees and coupon spreads, and encounter larger underpricing after issuance. Moreover, we demonstrate that severe corporate fraud is also significantly related to the costs of corporate bonds. Furthermore, we find that investors pay more attention to fraud in accounting information and disclosure. These results remain robust to a strand of endogeneity and through the robustness tests. In additional research, we find that bonds issued by fraudulent firms tend to receive lower ratings and show inferior performance after issuance. We also demonstrate that the effects of corporate fraud on bond costs erode as time passes, although the mitigation speed is slow. Finally, we find that hiring reputable financial intermediaries can partially mitigate the negative effects of corporate fraud.","[Zhang, Min; Gong, Guangming] Hunan Univ, Business Sch, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Si] South China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gong, Xun] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University; South China Normal University; Hunan University,"Xu, S (通讯作者)，South China Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",xusi@m.scnu.edu.cn,,,Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [20130161110045],"Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",All authors acknowledge the funding support from the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant number 20130161110045).,,87,12,13,9,83,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved in many countries for ADHD treatment in children, adolescents, and adults. Estimate the cost-effectiveness of LDX as a first- or second-line treatment for adults with ADHD from the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) perspective compared with methylphenidate extended release (MPH-ER) and atomoxetine (ATX). A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed. Health outcomes included response, non-response and inability to tolerate. Efficacy data were obtained from a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC). Response was a score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates due to adverse events. Utilities were identified via a systematic literature review. Health care resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. Daily drug costs were estimated from mean doses reported in the trials used in the MTC. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed. LDX dominated MPH-ER and ATX; reducing mean per-patient annual cost by A 5 pound and A 200 pound, and increasing mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.005 and 0.009, respectively. In the PSA, the probability of cost-effectiveness for LDX vs. MPH-ER and ATX at a threshold of A 20,000 pound per QALY was 61% and 80%, respectively. From the perspective of the UK NHS, LDX is likely to provide a cost-effective treatment for adults with ADHD. This conclusion may be drawn with more certainty in comparison with ATX than with MPH-ER.","[Zimovetz, Evelina A.] RTI Hlth Solut, 2nd Floor,Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England; [Joseph, Alain] Shire, Zahlerweg 10, CH-6301 Zug, Switzerland; [Ayyagari, Rajeev] Anal Grp Inc, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA; [Mauskopf, Josephine A.] RTI Hlth Solut, 200 Pk Off Dr, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA",Research Triangle Institute; Shire Pharmaceuticals Limited; Analysis Group Inc.; Research Triangle Institute,"Zimovetz, EA (通讯作者)，RTI Hlth Solut, 2nd Floor,Towers Business Pk,Wilmslow Rd, Manchester M20 2LS, Lancs, England.",ezimovetz@rti.org,,"Mauskopf, Josephine/0000-0002-6098-5548; ZIMOVETZ, EVELINA/0000-0002-8939-7838","Shire International GmbH, Switzerland; Shire International GmbH","Shire International GmbH, Switzerland; Shire International GmbH","All authors contributed to the study design and coordination.

Previous studies have reported mixed findings on the relationship between female executives and CSR. We select a sample of Chinese listed firms and use propensity score matching to construct a new sample of firms and evaluate the gender transition (from male to female) of chief executive officers or board chairpersons (executives) who are randomly assigned to firms (i.e., the gender transition of executives is regarded as an exogenous event). Subsequently, we use a difference-in-differences approach to identify the pure effect of female executives on CSR. Our results indicate that female executives are more likely to encourage CSR reporting. Moreover, we suggest that the mechanism behind female executives prioritizing CSR is altruism preference rather than risk aversion preference.","[Zou, Ziang; Yang, Shenggang] Hunan Univ, Coll Finance & Stat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yuqing; Zhu, Qi] Guotai Junan Secur Co Ltd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qi] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China",Hunan University; Fudan University,"Zhu, Q (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China.",zhuqi@hnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71790593, 71521061]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M631984]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71790593 and 71521061] and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [No: 2018M631984].,,52,31,32,8,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Using survey and interview data from the Maharashtra affiliates of two national union federations, this article examines whether social partnership with employers is a viable option for Indian unions to regain influence and protect workers' interests, as some analysts have advocated. Its findings indicate that despite Maharashtra's supportive regulatory framework, which in theory should facilitate cooperative industrial relations, the realities of workplace employment relations - coupled with state indifference and adverse judicial interventions - weaken labour's prospects for meaningful social partnership.","[Badigannavar, Vidu] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Badigannavar, V (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",drb.vidyadhar@gmail.com,,"Badigannavar, Vidu/0000-0002-8421-3614",Nuffield Foundation [37325],Nuffield Foundation,"The author gratefully acknowledges the funding for this research, which was provided by the Nuffield Foundation (Grant No. 37325).

We collected 178 news articles from four media outlets in Cambodia and examined the media discourses led by the National REDD + Program Secretariat, TVK and Radio FM102 for the period of 2011-2016. The findings revealed that the media attention led by the Secretariat in collaboration with two media outlets spread the REDD + message nationwide and journalists gained knowledge and jointly set the media agenda with the government institutions. Four other reputable national media outlets published few news articles on REDD +. The e-Delphi survey of experts found that the key challenges limiting media discourses on REDD + were that the responsible institutions did not share information about REDD + events with the general media and that journalists had limited knowledge of REDD + and found the technical issues difficult. The study strongly highlighted that media framing is the most comprehensive choice to gain attention from policy makers and the public on REDD + policy, opportunity and impact.","[Nhem, Sareth; Lee, Young Jin] Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Forest Resources, 1 Daehak Ri,Yesan Eup, Chungnam 34370, South Korea; [Nhem, Sareth] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Fac Dev Studies, Dept Nat Resource Management & Dev, Russian Federat Blvd, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Nhem, Sareth] Royal Univ Law & Econ, Fac Law & Econ Sci, French Cooperat Program, Monivong Blvd, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Phin, Sopheap] Prek Leap Natl Coll Agr, Natl Rd 6, Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Kongju National University,"Lee, YJ (通讯作者)，Kongju Natl Univ, Dept Forest Resources, 1 Daehak Ri,Yesan Eup, Chungnam 34370, South Korea.",leeyj@kongju.ac.kr,,,"R & D Program for Forest Science Technology by Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute) [2013069D10-1719-AA03, 2014068E10-1719-AA03]",R & D Program for Forest Science Technology by Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute)(Korea Forest ServiceKorea Forestry Promotion Institute (KOFPI)),"The authors would like to express our deep gratitude to AFoCo for providing full a PhD scholarship to our author, Nhem Sareth, Cambodian.

In this setting, we document a shift in who uses forest edge land and how it is used. In developing countries, protected forest edges are traditionally sites where marginalized people can subsist, but increasing land competition has the potential to change this scenario. We used longitudinal field data spanning two decades to characterize the evolution of landownership and land use neighboring Kibale National Park. The number of households has more than doubled since 1993. Land values are rising, and people buying land near the park in recent years are significantly wealthier and have more off-farm income than those who acquired land there in earlier periods. The reverse is true of renters. More people are growing inedible perennial cash crops like eucalyptus, tea, and coffee, especially those with larger amounts of land and capital. Some long-term residents are prospering, while others are squeezed onto ever smaller pieces of land and opting for precarious rental arrangements as land competition increases. We discuss the implications of this transitioning park neighborhood, both for conservation and local livelihoods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A necessary step in advancing SRWC is defining regions suitable for SRWC commercial activities and assessing the relative economic viability among suitable regions. The goal of this study was to assess the potential profitability, based on obtainable yield and economic feasibility; of Pinus taeda L. (loblolly pine) across 13 states of the southern USA. A process-based growth model, 3PG, produced estimated yields of P. taeda in terms of mean annual increment (MAI) that were evaluated as internal rate of return on investment (IRR) and land expectation value (LEV). Coastal areas (southeast Texas, southwest Louisiana, and northern Florida) have the highest potential MAI production ranging from 13.7 to 18.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). LEVs ranged from - 1126 to 3111 $ ha(-1) on upland sites and - 2261 to 2341 $ ha(-1) on lowland sites. IRR ranged from - 0.3% to 14.2% on uplands and - 2.9% to 10.4% on lowlands. On soils of the same textural class, LEV and IRR were higher on uplands relative to lowlands given lower site preparation costs, although the projected yield from upland soils are generally lower than those from lowland soils. The highest LEV and IRR were in northern Florida, southern Alabama, southern Georgia, and southern South Carolina. The lowest LEV and IRR were in Virginia and northern North Carolina. Spatially categorizing suitable lands in biological and economic terms can use geographic information system technology to advantage in combination with societal considerations to begin to answer sustainability questions as well as identify suitable sites for bioenergy plantations.","[Perdue, James H.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 2506 Jacob Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Stanturf, John A.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 320 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Young, Timothy M.; Huang, Xia] Univ Tennessee, Knoxville Ctr Renewable Carbon, 2506 Jacob Dr, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Dougherty, Derek; Pigott, Michael] Dougherty & Dougherty Forestry Serv Inc, POB 82013, Athens, GA 30608 USA; [Guo, Zhimei] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, 203 Comer Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; UT Institute of Agriculture; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Stanturf, JA (通讯作者)，US Forest Serv, USDA, Southern Res Stn, 320 Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jperdue@fs.fed.us; jstanturf@fs.fed.us; tmyoung1@utk.edu; ddougherty@progressiveforestry.com; mpigott@progressiveforestry.com; Zzg0001@auburn.edu,"Young, Timothy M/D-9949-2011; Stanturf, John A./M-4171-2019","Young, Timothy M/0000-0001-9564-6506; Stanturf, John A./0000-0002-6828-9459","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station [FS 07CR11330115087]; USDA Southeastern Sun Grant Center; USDA McIntire-Stennis [TENOOMS-101]; University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, Center for Renewable Carbon, and Department of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries; NASA LaRC POWER Project","U.S. Forest Service, Southern Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); USDA Southeastern Sun Grant Center; USDA McIntire-Stennis; University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, Center for Renewable Carbon, and Department of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries; NASA LaRC POWER Project","We thank three anonymous reviewers for valuable comments that helped improve the paper.

However, implemented policies gradually decapitalize forest values over time that threatens the sustainability of ecosystem and wood industries. Different business units of a forest-product supply chain have different ways of valuing forestry resources, different supply and demand policies, and corresponding business policy models to implement them. The objective of this study was to evaluate ecological and economic impacts to participating business units of a supply chain when implementing different business policies. We constructed six business models in a linear programming framework and solved them using data from commercially-managed forests. Our empirical results showed that compared to a base model (Model 1; unilateral decision by forest,business unit), the best model (Model 6; integrated harvest and production planning) reduced the median harvest volume and area by 25% (12-31%) and 24% (7-40%), respectively, but increased net revenue by 88% (6-218%) over a 150-year planning horizon. Hence, efficiency increased by 158% (20-373%) per unit of harvest area and 163% (23-364%) per unit of harvest volume. Furthermore, when the models were simulated using a hard constraint to preserve at least 20% of old-growth forest area, the revenue was least affected (15%; 11-19%) by Model 6 compared to Model 1 (26%; 14-45%). We conclude that vertically-integrated harvest policy that embeds forest values in the planning model reduces the gap between the business units, and enhances ecosystem conservation with the least fluctuation of harvest and revenue by period over a planning horizon.","[Rijal, Baburam] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, 2405 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Lussier, Jean-Martin] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Serv, Canadian Wood Fibre Ctr, 1055 PEPS,POB 10380, Quebec City, PQ G1V 4C7, Canada",Laval University; Natural Resources Canada; Canadian Forest Service,"Rijal, B (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, 2405 Rue Terrasse, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",baburam.rijal.1@ulaval.ca,"Rijal, Baburam/JOZ-8450-2023","Rijal, Baburam/0000-0003-0499-7816; Lussier, Jean-Martin/0000-0003-1474-6674",,,,,67,7,7,1,21,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2017,83.0,,,,,,45,57,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.06.003,0.0,,,13,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FK6JW,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413611000006,0

We employ a latent class cluster analysis to determine the optimal number of livelihood clusters and assign individual households to particular cluster; and regression models were used to examine the covariates of change in environmental income and reliance. The analysis identifies six distinct livelihood clusters in terms of asset investment in different livelihood activities. Results show that majority of households persist in the relatively lower remunerative livelihood strategies between 2009 and 2012. Environmental income is important to all livelihood strategies. However, households in the least remunerative strategy and downward transition group have higher environmental reliance. It is also found that households with upward transition are likely to have reduced environmental dependency. Hence, enhancement of poverty reduction strategies in supporting poorer household in asset accumulation and undertake alternative higher remunerative livelihood strategies will eventually reduce the pressure and dependency on environment. Furthermore, conservation policies and natural resource management are critical in the study areas to sustain the increased demands on environmental products and services.","[Walelign, Solomon Zena; Jiao, Xi] Univ Copenhagen, Global Dev Sect, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Jiao, X (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Global Dev Sect, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.",xj@ifro.ku.dk,"Walelign, Solomon Zena/F-4820-2015","Walelign, Solomon Zena/0000-0001-8408-6005",Erasmus Mundus Consortium Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO); University of Copenhagen,Erasmus Mundus Consortium Forest and Nature for Society (FONASO); University of Copenhagen,"The authors would like to acknowledge the ComForM project, responsible for collecting the data used in this study.

Using data from the National Vital Statistics System for the period 1969-2004, we estimate the relationship between prenatal exposure to the Super Bowl and low birth weight. Although sporting events can elicit intense emotions, they do not pollute the environment or threaten viewers with direct physical harm. We find that Super Bowl exposure is associated with a small, but precisely estimated, increase in the probability of low birth weight.","[Duncan, Brian; Mansour, Hani; Rees, Daniel I.] Univ Colorado, Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Duncan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Econ, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",brian.duncan@ucdenver.edu,,,,,,,66,19,21,2,10,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

How exam structure affects perceptions of innovative assignments in a masters of science microeconomics course,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Active learning; Application; Bloom's taxonomy; Flipped classroom; Writing assignments,STUDENT PERCEPTIONS; ECONOMICS,"During the 2014 and 2015 offerings of a Masters of Science-level microeconomics course in an agricultural economics department, writing assignments and in-class application exercises were added to reach higher learning objectives, including application, analysis, synthesis, or evaluation. In 2014, problem sets and exams remained focused on knowledge and comprehension. At the end of the semester, for each assignment type, the students were asked about how well the experimental assignments increased their understanding of course material. Second, they were asked to rank assignments based on how helpful they were in developing understanding of material. While students were observed applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating models learned in class while working on the experimental assignments, in 2014 problem sets and exams ranked higher than the experimental assignments. In 2015, application-type questions were added to exams, under the hypothesis that students used exam performance as their benchmark of knowledge acquisition. In 2015, students still ranked problem sets first according to questions 1 and 2, but writing assignments moved into second place. Interestingly, studying for exams ranked last according to question 2 in 2015. Comparing across years, the level of importance attributed to writing assignments was statistically significantly higher in 2015, suggesting that exam content affected students' perceptions of the writing assignments.","[Grogan, Kelly A.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Grogan, KA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ, POB 110240, Gainesville, FL 32601 USA.",kellyagrogan@ufl.edu,,,"College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Florida","College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Florida","Funding and support for this project were provided by the Roche Fellows Program from the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Florida.",,15,1,1,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1477-3880,2352-4421,,INT REV ECON EDUC,Int.

J,"Groves, C",,,,"Groves, Christopher",,,Emptying the future: On the environmental politics of anticipation,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Anticipation Future horizons; Energy infrastructure; Technological unconscious; Uncertainty,EXPECTATIONS,"Anticipation may be seen as structured by images and representations, an approach that has informed recent work in science and technology studies on the sociology of expectations. But anticipation, as a capacity or characteristic, is not solely manifested in the form of representations, even where such representations of the 'not yet' are performative in nature. It also comprises material capacities, technological, biophysical and affective in nature. The politics of anticipation is shaped by how these symbolic and material capacities, and the forms of agency they make possible, are distributed. As anticipation is an environmentally distributed capacity, it is suggested that the politics of anticipation is also an environmental politics. A conceptual framework for analysing anticipation as comprised of environmental capabilities is introduced, and fleshed out using a case study of energy infrastructure planning from the UK. Key elements of this framework include the concepts of anticipatory assemblages and future horizons or 'styles' of anticipation. Working through the case study as an empirical example of a conflict concerning the politics of anticipation and of 'environments', it is demonstrated how the relationships between styles of anticipation are materially constitutive of such conflicts.

To protect domestic industry, two sequential antidumping and countervailing investigations against several major supplying countries (e.g., China) were conducted in 2006 and 2009. In this study, the effectiveness of these trade interventions is evaluated with the almost ideal demand system and cointegration techniques. Three types of trade effects are found through the analysis: trade investigation effect during the 15-month investigation process, trade depression effect on targeted countries subject to duty collection, and positive trade diversion effect on non-targeted suppliers. Imports from China and Indonesia have been suppressed since the duties were levied in 2010. However, other suppliers (i.e., Korea and Germany) have filled the market gap and gained a larger market share over time. The findings reveal that market competition in a specific sector has become more complicated within the increasingly globalized world economy, and sequential trade interventions can generate unpredictable results.

I develop a theoretical model wherein polluting firms borrow externally to finance investment in various assets, subject to a credit constraint. The main insight of the model is that credit constraints distort the composition of assets towards over-investment in tangible assets, which can be pledged as collateral, thereby increasing the intensity of emissions. The predictions of the model are tested using a unique dataset consisting of plant-level measures of pollution emissions and creditworthiness. The empirical results indicate that credit constraints significantly increase pollution emissions (even after accounting for the scale effect), and the results withstand multiple robustness checks. Moreover, the effect of credit constraints is particularly acute in industries with greater reliance on external credit. Finally, I demonstrate that firm-level credit constraints distort the composition of assets and that the composition of assets influences pollution emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The two models correspond to different durations of project exposure. The difference-in-differences model captures greater exposure and shows that there are modest and sustained impacts on child developmentespecially for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds.

This article develops a distinctly sociological explanation of that crisis by focusing on the organization of firms in the production of mortgage-backed securities. We use archival and secondary sources to show that the industry became dominated by an ` industrial' conception of control whereby financial firms vertically integrated in order to capture profits in all phases of the mortgage industry. The results of multivariate regression analyses show that the ` industrial' model drove the deterioration in the quality of securities that firms issued and significantly contributed to the eventual failure of the firms that pursued the strategy. Among large banks globally, those which were more vertically integrated also experienced greater investment losses. The findings challenge existing conventional accounts of the crisis and provide important theoretical implications for the social-scientific study of financial markets.","[Goldstein, Adam] Dept Sociol, 106 Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fligstein, Neil] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Goldstein, A (通讯作者)，Dept Sociol, 106 Wallace Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",amg5@princeton.edu,,,Tobin Project; Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California; National Science Foundation,Tobin Project; Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authorship of this article is jointly shared.

To fill this gap in the literature, this study examined healthcare disparities in relation to the welfare reform that the US implemented in 1996 and then compared significant indicators of immigrants' healthcare use during the pre- and post-reform periods. The difference-in-difference (DD) analyses and post hoc probing of the DD analyses were used in multivariate logistic regression of the National Health Information Survey data that were pooled for the pre- and post-reform periods. The results revealed that while inequalities in healthcare existed before the reform, they significantly increased after the reform. A further test showed that the changes in the inequalities were significant among relatively long-stay immigrants, but not significant among immigrants who entered the US before the reform and thus were exempted from the reform restrictions. During the pre-reform period, insurance, employment, sex, and race/ethnicity were related to healthcare use; however, the enabling factors (i.e., insurance, income, and education) and social structural factors (i.e., marital status, family structure, length of US residency, race/ethnicity, and geographical region) explained the post-reform immigrants' healthcare use, while controlling for healthcare needs factors. These findings suggest that welfare reform may be the driving force of inequalities in healthcare.","[Yeo, Younsook] St Cloud State Univ, Dept Social Work, 720 Fourth Ave South, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Saint Cloud State University,"Yeo, Y (通讯作者)，St Cloud State Univ, Dept Social Work, 720 Fourth Ave South, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA.",yyeo@stcloudstate.edu,,,Faculty Research Grant Committee at St. Cloud State University,Faculty Research Grant Committee at St. Cloud State University,This study was supported by a grant from the Faculty Research Grant Committee at St. Cloud State University.,,121,8,11,2,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This paper examines the extent to which the quality star rating scheme affected insurer behavior in the MA market. We identify the causal effect of 2009 star ratings on 2010 MA premiums using a regression discontinuity design that exploits plausibly random variation around threshold values underlying the star rating calculations. We find that contracts with higher star ratings in 2009 significantly increased their average 2010 monthly premiums relative to contracts just below the respective threshold values, with increases of more than $26 per month among 3.5- and 4-star contracts. We present additional evidence that the estimated premium increases in 2010 are not purely the result of demand shifts in the prior year. Furthermore, the 2009 star ratings have a significant effect on plan mix, where 3-star contracts disproportionately dropped their $0 premium plans while 2.5-, 3.5-, and 4-star contracts disproportionately expanded plans into new markets, particularly plans with positive monthly premiums. Broadly, our analysis reveals a relatively large supply-side response to published quality ratings, suggesting some level of caution as policy makers extend quality rating systems into new health-care markets.","[McCarthy, Ian M.] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Darden, Michael] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",Emory University; Tulane University,"McCarthy, IM (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",ian.mccarthy@emory.edu,,"McCarthy, Ian/0000-0001-7942-3468",,,,,24,9,9,0,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

A qualitative comparative analysis method was used to determine which conditions or combinations of conditions led to or prevented a forest transition. Under the condition of public ownership with no private forest tenure or ownership of forest land, there was no instance of forest transition among the nine countries studied. Under the condition of non-liberal timber trade policies, there was no instance of forest transition in the countries studied. The results of this analysis suggest that for a forest transition to occur, the country should liberalize timber import and provide forest tenure to the private sector. Based on these results, we argue that in order for a forest transition to take place or for REDD + to be effective, the state should allow for private sector to participate in forest management and create market conditions that meet the demand for timber via trade policy alignment.

The goal of this study is to estimate the costs of productivity losses due to occupational cancer in Canada, and to evaluate the factors associated with these costs. Methods: Two sources of data are used: (i) Individual level administrative claims data from the Workers Compensation Board of Nova Scotia; and (ii) provincial aggregated cancer claims statistics from the Association of Workers Compensation Boards of Canada. Benefits paid to claimants are based on actuarial estimates of wage-loss, but do not include medical costs that are covered by the Canadian publicly funded healthcare system. Regional claims level data are used to estimate the total and average (per claim) cost of occupational cancer to the insurance system, and to assess which characteristics of the claim/claimant influence costs. Cost estimates from one region are weighted using regional multipliers to adjust for system differences between regions, and extrapolated to estimate national costs of occupational cancer. Results/Discussion: We estimate that the total cost of occupational cancer to the Workers' Compensation system in Canada between 1996 and 2013 was $1.2 billion. The average annual cost was $68 million. The cancer being identified as asbestos related were significantly positively associated with costs, whereas the age of the claimant was significantly negatively associated with costs. The industry type/region, injury type or part of body affected by cancer were not significant cost determinants. Conclusion: Given the severity of the cancer burden, it is important to understand the financial implications of the disease on workers. Our study shows that productivity losses associated with cancer in the workplace are not negligible, particularly for workers exposed to asbestos.","[Wranik, W.

Changes in forest cover are influenced by spatially-varying biophysical and anthropogenic factors mainly associated with urban-rural, coastal-inland and elevation gradients. The present study investigates the relationship between the socioeconomic structure of local communities and selected indicators of forest landscape in Italy, including change in forest area over time (2000 - 2012), using an exploratory multivariate analysis based on principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and discriminant analysis. We assess the importance of socio-spatial structures, economic dynamics and demographic patterns in the geography of forest cover, expansion and loss, considering 149 statistical indicators that are used to evaluate the multiple dimensions of sustainable development. The results point to agriculture, income, education arid labour market indicators as a key predictors of contexts with high forest cover and moderate changes in forest area (both gain and loss) from those with low forest cover and marked changes in forest area. High forest cover in rural districts was spatially associated with local communities featuring depopulation, unemployment, low educational levels and subsistence agriculture. These factors consolidate land abandonment and soil erosion. The highest rate of change in forest area was observed in economically-growing, accessible local contexts with dynamic socio-demographic profiles. Integrated environmental and socioeconomic policies for sustainable development are required to incorporate forest cover and changes in wooded area as pivotal variables and may benefit from a better understanding of the role of local communities in forest management.

Eurostat database data was employed in analyses, basing on plant and livestock products information in particular. Presented research confirms, that Poland is one of important manufacturers more focusing on plant and livestock products. The analysis of the selected EU countries proved that in terms of agriculture France and Germany appear to be powerful leaders. At the end of the ranking list the countries characterised by the smallest area are placed (Esthonia, Ciprus, Luxemburg, Slowenia)","[Chrzanowska, Mariola] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Chrzanowska, M (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",mariola_chrzanowska@sggw.pl,,,,,,,16,4,4,0,6,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-260-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2017,,44,,,,,323,329,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BI1NX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000406529200039,0

Research objective of this paper is to define innovations as the crucial factor for increasing company's market share and its competitiveness in the long run. Research was carried out in 2016 based on a specially designed questionnaire on a sample of 100 organizations in the territory of Serbia. There were 96 returned and validly filled out questionnaires that were taken into consideration during data processing. Methods used in this research are hypothetic-deductive, analytic-deductive and comparative methods, historical and statistical-descriptive methods and finally methods of comparative statistics (chi(2) test, ANOVA). In key results of the research it is confirmed that the innovation of the organisation and innovative activities of its employees influence the increase of its market share and competitiveness, with significant differences of the values depending on the organisation size, years of operating, level and different kind of industry the organisation operates in. Paper contribution can be seen in support of organization's innovativeness and competitiveness as the function of business success, the linkages between innovative capacity, innovativeness and business. Positive results support also the greater investments into new and innovative projects of business subjects, from innovations of products, technology and material, organization and methods of management, to market innovations.","[Curcic, Nikola V.; Vukajlovic, Djurdjica Dj.] Fac Appl Managemet Econ & Finance, Belgrade, Serbia; [Grozdanic, Radmila] Fac BA & Entrepreneruship Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia",,"Curcic, NV (通讯作者)，Fac Appl Managemet Econ & Finance, Belgrade, Serbia.",nikolavcurcic@yahoo.com; vukajlovicdj@gmail.com; sme_rada@hotmail.com,"Grozdanic, Radmila/GXN-2969-2022",,,,,,11,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,126,137,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000014,0

The TPP's services component has been hailed as one of the agreement's major accomplishments. To assess the agreement's impact on national policy in the major services sectors, we created a new public database. This database reveals that TPP commitments seldom go beyond countries' applied policies, suggesting the explicit liberalization resulting from the agreement is limited only to a few countries and a few areas. However, the TPP enhances transparency and policy certainty because parties' services commitments cover more trading partners, more sectors and are in some cases closer to applied policies than their commitments under previous agreements. Furthermore, new TPP rules, including on state-owned enterprises, government procurement and competition policy, could enhance services market access. In particular, the TPP breaks new ground in prohibiting restrictions on international data flows, while at the same time creating unprecedented obligations on all parties to protect consumers from fraud and protect privacy. These dual obligations on importing and exporting countries represent a model for regulatory cooperation that could elicit greater market opening if applied to other areas.","[Gootiiz, Batshur; Mattoo, Aaditya] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Gootiiz, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",bgootiiz@gmail.com; amattoo@worldbank.org,,,Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program,Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program,"This article is part of a World Bank research project on trade in services, supported in part by the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development and by the Strategic Research Program.

As a consequence, flexibility or adaptability has become an indispensable part of running a business. Flexibility of an organization is one of the main challenges of modern management. This issue has been widely described in the sphere of theory. Generally, flexibility is defined as the ability to adapt to a changing environment without losing the organization's identity (Regev, Wegmann, 2011, pp. 91-98). However, it should be noted that the term flexibility is often used to describe concepts of a different meaning, so its essence is not always clear (Soffer, 2005, p. 35). Many contemporary concepts of management emphasize the fact that rapid response to ambient signals is one of the key success factors in the market. The issue of business flexibility and the factors affecting them may relate to different areas of the organization's functioning: production processes, human resources, products in offer, size of operations etc. The purpose of this article is to present flexibility as a factor influencing the competitive advantage of a construction company. The paper was based on the analysis of secondary sources: literature, reports, analysis, statistical data and analysis of author'sown empirical research - a case study of a construction company. The article presents the essence and dimensions of flexibility of an organization, some factors affecting flexibility and variability of prosperity in the construction industry that determines the adaptation of an enterprises to its environment.","[Grzes-Buklaho, Justyna] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Grzes-Buklaho, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",j.grzes@pb.edu.pl,,,Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland [MB/WZ/2/2017],"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The study has been implemented from the resources of the MB/WZ/2/2017 work financed by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland.,,21,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,403,411,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ6MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426857700043,0

Using import data, we calculate average per capita monthly salmon consumption in Taiwan, where all supply is imported, and use weighted least squares regression to relate it to economic variables, such as price, income, product types, and the exchange rate. By doing so, we interpret importers' willingness to import and the features of salmon consumption. Results show complementarity between frozen and fresh salmon import quantities, insignificant exchange rate pass-through effects, and strong seasonal factors affecting salmon import quantity. In addition, the import price elasticity of fresh salmon is slightly larger than one, and the income elasticity is 1.33. We conclude that salmon has already become an important item for Taiwanese consumers, representing a case of globalization and liberalization. By explicating attributes of emerging seafood markets, this analysis will support stakeholders to formulate seafood trade policies and marketing strategies.","[Kuo, Heng-Hung] Chung Hua Univ, Dept Finance, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan; [Chuang, Ching-Ta] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Inst Marine Affairs & Resource Management, Keelung, Taiwan",Chung Hua University; National Taiwan Ocean University,"Kuo, HH (通讯作者)，Chung Hua Univ, Dept Finance, Hsinchu 30012, Taiwan.",hhkuo@chu.edu.tw,,,,,,,40,2,2,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

We show that institutionally driven spatial selection leads to only a partial exploration of the full production set, yielding poorly identified estimates of production possibilities outside of the institutionally dependent status quo. The implication is that many estimated fisheries production functions suffer from a lack of policy invariance and may yield misleading predictions for even the most short-run of policy evaluation tasks. Our findings suggest that accurate assessment of the impacts of a policy intervention requires a description of the fishing production process that is sufficiently structural so as to be invariant to institutional changes.","[Reimer, Matthew N.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainabil, Global Inst Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Abbott, Joshua K.] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Environm Econ & Sustainabil, POB 875502, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Wilen, James E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Social Sci & Humanities 2116, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Reimer, MN (通讯作者)，Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Econ & Publ Policy, Inst Social & Econ Res, 3211 Providence Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",mreimer2@alaska.edu; joshua.k.abbott@asu.edu; wilen@primal.ucdavis.edu,,"Reimer, Matthew/0000-0001-6087-9115",,,,,86,30,33,1,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The effects of the global financial crisis on the Arab economies reflected the financial crisis on the economies of countries. Arab countries have been affected on the grounds that it part of the global economy and economic ties. It is certain that the degree of impact varies between Arab countries as they relate to the degree of integration into the global economy. About four billion people worldwide find themselves excluded from the protections provided by the rule of law. In urban slums and rural villages, poor people often have no legal identity, no birth certificate, no legal address, no rights to their home or business, and no protection of their labor. It calls for focus on property, labor, entrepreneurial rights and access to justice. As a package, these rights can help prevent legal exclusion and foster economic and reduction in poverty. With rising unemployment, wages are likely to fall, working conditions to deteriorate and labor rights to be violated. This work is a review of the concept of the global financial crisis and its causes, and their impact on Arab economics and people legal protection. Financial crisis is the collapse of the entire financial system accompanied by failure of a large number of financial and non-financial institutions with the sharp contraction in overall economic activity. Protection of law is essential for people living in poverty to shield them against oppression, create economic opportunities, and enable them to secure decent standards of living with dignity.","[Rhuma, Hatem] John Naisbitt Univ, Tripoli, Libya",,"Rhuma, H (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Tripoli, Libya.",Lakilee@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,667,670,,,,,,4,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ2BZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000418819000073,0

The first is that there are both private and social benefits of schooling whence we derive the rationale for government intervention.

A common data-set comparing usual orthopedic care (UC) to an orthopedic physiotherapy screening clinic and multidisciplinary treatment service (OPSC) was used to develop a MM and a DES without (DES-no-DQ) and with DQ (DES-DQ). Model results were then compared in detail. The MM predicted an incremental CE ratio (ICER) of $495 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for OPSC over UC. The DES-no-DQ showed OPSC dominating UC; the DES-DQ generated an ICER of $2342 per QALY. The MM and DES-no-DQ ICER estimates differed due to the MM having implicit delays built into its structure as a result of having fixed cycle lengths, which are not a feature of DES. The non-DQ models assume that queues are at a steady state. Conversely, queues in the DES-DQ develop flexibly with supply and demand for resources, in this case, leading to different estimates of resource use and CE. The choice of MM or DES (with or without DQ) would not alter the reimbursement of OPSC as it was highly cost-effective compared to UC in all analyses. However, the modeling method may influence decisions where ICERs are closer to the CE acceptability threshold, or where capacity constraints and DQ are important features of the system. In these cases, DES-DQ would be the preferred modeling technique to avoid incorrect resource allocation decisions.","[Standfield, L. B.; Comans, T. A.; Scuffham, P.

We examined the effects in gravity equation and found a significant positive effect of swap agreements on trade. In our benchmark model, the negotiations of swap agreement would improve 30.4% of bilateral trade values between China and its partners. For Belt and Road countries, the effect is even stronger. This effect is both statistically and economically significant. It is also robust for alternative measure of swap agreements and alternative estimation method.

Empirical evidence shows a strong relationship between housing and investment of risky financial assets, but with varying and conflicting results. We contribute to the literature by distinguishing housing for consumption and for investment, and by considering the role of housing price expectation when exploring households' participation in stock markets. We find that home equity ratio and housing area play significant roles in households' participation in stock markets. Households with higher home equity ratio or larger housing are less likely to own, and hold fewer stock assets if they do. We also find that the number of houses has a positive effect on stock investment for households with the same home equity ratio and housing size, which could be explained by credit rationing. Furthermore, housing price expectation has a negative effect on stock investment; this effect is larger for homeowners with multiple houses who are more likely to take houses for investment. Our results show insights into conflicting results of the relationship between real estate and stock investment.","[Zhou, Qin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Qing; Yuan, Yan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, Res Inst Econ & Management, RIEM Hall 501,55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Yuan, Y (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ SWUFE, Res Inst Econ & Management, RIEM Hall 501,55 Guanghuacun St, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",yuanyan@swufe.edu.cn,,,,,,,25,7,7,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

In this paper, the optimal reinsurance contract design problem for catastrophe insurance is studied using the general structure of reinsurance contracts, change-loss reinsurance. Closed-form solutions are derived under two tail risk measures, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE). The results show that CTE is a robust risk measure in that the structure of the optimal reinsurance contract under CTE measure is always change-loss reinsurance. While the optimal reinsurance contract under VaR measure degenerates from change-loss reinsurance to quota-share reinsurance when the ceding company is less risk averse. The theoretical approach is also applied to earthquake insurance market in China's Yunnan Province, and explicit solutions to the optimal reinsurance contract design problem under both VaR and CTE measures are obtained in the paper.","[Zhu, Nanjun] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yulin] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Tsinghua University,"Zhu, NJ (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhunanjun@163.com; fengyl.13@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,23,1,1,1,3,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

First, we use spatial-panel data from Wisconsin to estimate parcel-level subdivision probabilities and density expectations, controlling for the endogenous location of open space. Second, we use these subdivision probabilities and density expectations in a landscape simulation model. Our simulation results indicate that 57% of conserved open space created between 1978 and 2009 generated close to zero net change in local development. This suggests that conserved open space mostly reallocated development in a small neighborhood (in a half-mile radius) rather than altering the total amount of development We explore the landscape conditions that may lead to conservation having either a positive or negative effect on local development.

The BIA was performed to compare both treatment periods with respect to health-related costs. A subsequent univariate sensitivity analysis examined the robustness of the results.ResultsAfter switching the treatment to aripiprazole-depot, the total psychiatric hospitalization rates for the 6-month treatment period were significantly (p<0.001) lower (14%) compared to the hospitalization rates when treated with oral antipsychotics (55.1%). 18.2% of the patients reported to be employed, with 29.2% having work incapacities. The mean number of schizophrenia episodes was 2.58 episodes per patient during the oral-antipsychotic treatment compared to 0.41 episodes per patient during the aripiprazole-depot phase (p<0.001). The treatment with aripiprazole-depot also significantly reduced the mean number of hospitalizations per patient (0.63 to 0.16, p<0.001) and the mean number of hospitalized days (27.39 to 5.56, p<0.001) compared to the oral antipsychotic treatment. Additionally a significant reduction of the mean stay in day-clinics and psychiatric institute ambulances (PIAs) was observed (46.13days to 7.29days, p<0.01).Treatment of a patient suffering from schizophrenia with oral antipsychotics produced costs of 9935.38Euro (direct costs: 9498.36 Euro), while aripiprazole-depot generated costs of 4557.56Euro (direct costs: 4449.83 Euro) per patient for a one-year observation period. This resulted in total costs of 6,517,606,265.43Euro for the oral antipsychotic treatment and 2,989,756,603.05Euro for aripiprazole-depot treatment from the perspective of the German health care system. The results remained robust during sensitivity analysis, with aripiprazole-depot being the more cost-effective strategy.ConclusionsThe results suggest that aripiprazole-depot treatment for schizophrenia patients has major potential in terms of cost savings for the German statutory health insurance.","[Potempa, Christoph; Rychlik, Reinhard] Inst Empir Hlth Econ, Ziegelfeld 28, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany",,"Potempa, C (通讯作者)，Inst Empir Hlth Econ, Ziegelfeld 28, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany.",christoph.potempa@ifeg.de,,,"Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc.; Lundbeck GmbH","Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc.(Otsuka Pharmaceutical); Lundbeck GmbH(Lundbeck Corporation)","This study was sponsored by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc. and Lundbeck GmbH.

In this context, knowledge on public expectations of forestry is valuable to forest owners as well as administrations, especially in the face of the growing critical citizenship they encounter during their work. This paper examines findings from opinion surveys as well as studies of conflict and participation in order to describe the current dynamics in the relationship between forestry and the general public. It then explains in detail how a praxeological research design, grounded in American pragmatism, helps to conceptualize forest conflicts as interactional phenomena. The value of such an approach is exemplified through one case analysis from a broader Sociocultural Forest Monitoring carried out by institution anonymized. The article concludes with an assessment of the knowledge to be gained by the con-ceptualization of citizens' relationship to forestry as dynamic opinion formation with the help of a praxeological epistemology and methodology.","[Bethman, Stephanie; Simminger, Eva; Schraml, Ulrich] Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, Dept Forest & Soc, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany; [Baldy, Jana] Univ Freiburg, Chair Forest & Environm Policy, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Bethman, S (通讯作者)，Forest Res Inst Baden Wuerttemberg, Dept Forest & Soc, Wonnhaldestr 4, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",stephanie.bethmann@forst.bwl.de; eva.simminger@forst.bwl.de; jana.baldy@ifp.uni-freiburg.de; ulrich.schraml@forst.bwl.de,,,Forest Research Institute Baden-Wuerttemberg; Ministry for Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection Baden-Wuerttemberg,Forest Research Institute Baden-Wuerttemberg; Ministry for Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection Baden-Wuerttemberg,"This project was funded by the Forest Research Institute Baden-Wuerttemberg, which is associated with the Ministry for Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection Baden-Wuerttemberg.",,82,15,16,1,20,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,NOV,2018,96.0,,,,,,93,101,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.08.005,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GV3HM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445985000010,0

However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics","[Cooper, Matthew; Zvoleff, Alex; Gonzalez-Roglich, Mariano; Noon, Monica; Alele, Peter] Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr 500, Arlington, VA 20222 USA; [Cooper, Matthew] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 Samuel J LeFrak Hall,7251 Preinkert Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Tusiime, Felly] Africa Innovat Inst, Plot 1544,Old Kiira Rd, Kampala, Uganda; [Musumba, Mark] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, POB 110180, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Nyiratuza, Madeleine] Wildlife Conservat Soc, KG 635 St, Kigali, Rwanda",Conservation International; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Cooper, M (通讯作者)，Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr 500, Arlington, VA 20222 USA.",mattcoop@terpmail.umd.edu; azvoleff@conservation.org; mgonzalez-roglich@conservation.org; mmusumba@ufl.edu; mnoon@conservation.org; palele@conservation.org; mnyiratuza@wcs.org,"Zvoleff, Alexander/P-4813-2019; Sunderland, Terence/AAS-5080-2021; Gonzalez-Roglich, Mariano/J-7510-2019","Zvoleff, Alexander/0000-0002-6008-4918; Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849; Cooper, Matthew/0000-0002-7133-3801","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [OPPGD943, OPP1140919]; Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY [016 GRP 301]; MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, IL [15-107423-000-INP]; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPPGD943, OPP1140919] Funding Source: Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation","Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY; MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, IL; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)","This work was made possible through grants OPPGD943 and OPP1140919 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA; grant 016 GRP 301 from the Rockefeller Foundation, New York, NY; and grant 15-107423-000-INP from the MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, IL.

It is most prominent in basic service sectors such as water and energy, but it is also evident in a range of diverse utility and infrastructure areas-from education, health, refuse and other areas of local government. As a reaction to the problems and contradictions arising from four decades of privatisation and marketisation of public services, remunicipalisation represents a compelling contemporary phenomenon of urban politics and governance. In this article, we critically interrogate remunicipalisation in the face of ongoing and mutating processes of neoliberal urbanism. Drawing upon evidence from the German Rekommunalisierung process in the energy sector, we explore both the wider conceptual significance of remunicipalisation and its progressive potential in contributing to an alternative urban politics beyond neoliberalism.","[Cumbers, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Becker, Soeren] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Bonn, Germany; [Becker, Soeren] Humboldt Univ, IRI Transformat Human Environm Syst, Berlin, Germany",University of Glasgow; University of Bonn; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Cumbers, A (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",andrew.cumbers@glasgow.ac.uk; soeren.becker@uni-bonn.de,,"Becker, Soren/0000-0002-9391-7912","Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, Scottish Charity [SC015600]; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdients (DAAD) programme [50015559/52856EB4371]","Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, Scottish Charity; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdients (DAAD) programme(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","The research behind this article benefited from the financial support of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, Scottish Charity number SC015600 and the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdients (DAAD) programme for research stays by university academics an scientists (Forderprogramm 50015559/52856EB4371).",,62,37,38,1,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

The paper shows that countries that want to slow down climate change but are also concerned about tax revenues from mobile tax bases have a rationale to supplement environmental taxes on fossil fuels with source-based capital taxes (or subsidies). More specifically, countries find it beneficial to subsidize capital in period one and tax it in period two. The first-period subsidy on capital facilitates a higher environmental tax by counteracting its adverse effects, and increases national and global welfare in equilibrium. By contrast, the capital tax in period two induces inter- and intratemporal distortions that lead to lower welfare. The rate of resource extraction is inefficiently high in equilibrium, no matter which tax portfolio is at the governments' disposal. Furthermore, unintended ('Green Paradox') effects of demand-side policies are shown to arise even in general equilibrium with factor mobility. Finally, factor mobility does not necessarily lead to a higher rate of extraction and lower welfare compared to autarky. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

An alternative route to government monitoring and enforcement involves partnerships with private firms and non-governmental organizations. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the Responsible Soy Project, a partnership between Cargill and The Nature Conservancy, to curb deforestation following the opening of a new soybean export facility in the Brazilian Amazon. We find that the project significantly decreased deforestation rates in properties enrolled in the project, despite its late arrival two years after the opening of the export facility. Theoretical predictions and empirical results show that the impacts of the project were greater on smaller properties that are more likely to be credit-constrained, and on properties initially not in compliance with Brazil's Forest Code that faced binding constraints on deforestation.

However, researchers, practitioners, and policy analysts question the utility of current forest transition theory. Does it accurately describe and provide insight into strategies to influence patterns of forest change in countries where forest cover continues to decline? Forest transition theory has provided important insights into the 'necessary but not sufficient' conditions for countries shifting from net deforestation to net reforestation. To advance forest transition theory, scholars should recognize forests as complex and dynamic social-ecological systems and use analytical methods that accommodate that complexity. Transdisciplinary research that incorporates a broader range of qualitative and quantitative methods and tools is required. We analyzed the historical, social, and political factors influencing forest transition pathways in Cambodia. Cambodia exhibits similar economic pre-conditions to its neighbors, which have passed through a forest transition, yet deforestation rates remain high with no indication of slowing. We found that complex governance arrangements at multiple scales negatively influences Cambodia's forest cover and development trajectory. Attempts to nurture Cambodia's forest transition will require strengthening governance and institutions across all of the natural resource sectors. Further research that incorporates governance into forest transition frameworks is required to improve policy responses for post-transition forest outcomes.","[Riggs, Rebecca Anne; Langston, James Douglas; Sayer, Jeffrey] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Coll Sci & Engn, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia; [Riggs, Rebecca Anne; Langston, James Douglas; Sayer, Jeffrey] Tanah Air Beta, Wongaya Gede 82152, Bali, Indonesia; [Sayer, Jeffrey] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Forest Sci Ctr, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",James Cook University; University of British Columbia,"Riggs, RA (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci, Coll Sci & Engn, Cairns, Qld 4870, Australia.",Rebecca.riggs@my.jcu.edu.au; james.langston@my.jcu.edu.au; Jeffrey.sayer@ubc.ca,"Riggs, Rebecca Anne/KCY-8924-2024; Sayer, Jeffrey/H-5504-2011; Langston, James/H-8563-2017","Riggs, Rebecca Anne/0000-0002-0403-8669; Sayer, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4087-0794; Langston, James/0000-0003-3529-0039","Climate and Land Use Alliance [0001]; Skyrail Rainforest Foundation, QLD, Australia [23506]","Climate and Land Use Alliance; Skyrail Rainforest Foundation, QLD, Australia","We are very grateful to communities and institutions that shared their experiences and supported our research.

It is assumed that workers have a potential income/productivity which basically depends on their human capital, but due to several health problems, situations could exist where workers fail to reach their potential income frontier. The estimation of a true-random-effects model allows us to conclude that the potential hourly wage of workers is significantly influenced by their level of education and their job experience. However, health problems, especially those strongly influencing work activities, contribute towards an individual not attaining the potential income which would otherwise be guaranteed by their human capital endowment. Suffering a strong limitation reduces gross wage per hour by 6.1%. This wage reduction is also observed in the case of a weak limitation, but here the wage difference with respect to workers without any limitation is 2.6%. Additionally, other factors, such as being a woman, the economic cycle or having a temporary contract, appear to distance an individual from their wage frontier.","[Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana; Rodriguez-Gutierrez, Cesar] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Rodriguez-Alvarez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Avda Cristo S-N, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",ana@uniovi.es; crodri@uniovi.es,"Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/G-6344-2010","Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana/0000-0002-2492-5070; Rodriguez Gutierrez, Cesar/0000-0001-6689-6119",Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2017-86402-C2-1-R]; FEDER [FC-15-GRUPIN14-048]; Principality of Asturias [FC-15-GRUPIN14-048],Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias),"The authors acknowledge financial support from the project ECO2017-86402-C2-1-R (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness) and the project Oviedo Efficiency Group FC-15-GRUPIN14-048 (FEDER and Principality of Asturias).

We show how considering Body(1)- Language- Emotions- History- Eros- Silence can configure a nurturing technology call CLEHES. This tool has been applied for diverse people, groups, communities, and organizations that need and wish to develop their own skills to inquire conflict practice resolutions, in order to learn as a human decision support system. Conflict situations are understood as interactions, a breakdown in-between CLEHES from the individual or social standpoints. This tool allows observing the boundaries of conflict situations and building an observer system with the ability to manage, solve, or attenuate the situation, enabling fresh decision making attending to the context in which the organization moves. This learning process happens in a constructed place called an Enactive Laboratory where strategies are developed to cope with the domains and context in the perceived individual and human activities systems. We present a case study focusing on a Learning Family Mediators System.","[Garcia De la Cerda, Osvaldo] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Humphreys, Patrick] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Saavedra Ulloa, Maria Soledad] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Educ, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile",Universidad de Santiago de Chile; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"De la Cerda, OG (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile.",osvaldo.garcia@usach.cl; p.humphreys@lse.ac.uk; maria.saavedra.u@usach.cl,,"Saavedra Ulloa, Maria Soledad/0000-0003-4080-2609",DICYT-Universidad de Santiago de Chile [061617GDLC],DICYT-Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"The authors acknowledge the support of DICYT-Universidad de Santiago de Chile under project 061617GDLC, Tecnologias y herramientas enactivas de apoyo al gobierno y la gestion organizacional 2016-2018, in the systematization of their experiences.

SOLS approach provides a framework for the creation of self-generated artificial languages and may serve as a starting point for the development of context-dependent or domain-specific languages. It acknowledges that the development of conlangs can happen in artificial societies of simple agents, as the output of social interactions in computational simulations under the agent-based modelling paradigm. In the proposed initial SOLS model, automatic generation of lexicon takes place in the context of a digital environment with objects, actions and agents with embodied cognition through peer to -peer interactions. Specifically, this paper exposes how SOLS can be developed with bi-dimensional games and simulations. An initial work has been done with the xmunch-atomspace and the SciArt simulator, which constitute the first implementations of both our knowledge representation toolbox and our bi-dimensional simulator of P2P Social Dynamics. Non-interactive agent-based SOLS can allow artificial agents to independently evolve emergent languages as part of their self-organizing or adaptation processes.","[Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Diego] SciArt Lab, 605 West Market St, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA; [Rodolfo Hernandez-Carrion, Jose] Univ Valencia, Grp Econ & Complex, Ave Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Gonzalez-Rodriguez, D (通讯作者)，SciArt Lab, 605 West Market St, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA.",xmunch@xmunch.com; rodolfo.hernandez@uv.es,"Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Diego/JXM-9047-2024","Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Diego/0000-0003-3029-1980; Hernandez-Carrion, Jose-Rodolfo/0000-0002-8237-8634",,,,,15,1,1,2,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,OCT,2018,103.0,,,,SI,,27,34,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.03.003,0.0,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GX1MR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000447481900004,0

Understanding the feedback dynamics between participatory forest management institutions and the species composition of forests,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Van panchayats; Community forest management; Oak forests; Pine forests; Deforestation; Central Himalayan forests,DECENTRALIZATION; CONSERVATION,"Human populations and their socio-economic conditions, such as road networks and poverty, are thought to be the main drivers of deforestation. However, a high deforestation rate can also alter the species composition of forests, providing further feedback to the socio-economic drivers of deforestation as well as weakening the community forest management institutions. In this paper, we model the feedback linkages associated with the degradation of forests and the weakening of the local institutions to understand how they impact the long-term sustainability of these linked socio-economic-ecological systems. In particular, we explore the impact of excessive harvesting of forests for fuelwood and fodder on a shift in the species composition from oak to pine trees in the central Himalayan region of India. This shift provides adverse feedback to the communities' livelihoods and erodes the quality of their participatory management institutions. A change in the species composition also increases forest fire risks, which further exacerbates the ecological as well as socio-economic feedback effects. We develop and apply a dynamic optimization model of community forest management where, through optimally controlling harvesting efforts over time, a weighted sum of community and environmental objectives is maximized. Findings indicate that factors such as population size, the extent of dependence of the community on fuelwood, the strength of community institutions, and the degree of feedback effects, affect the long-term sustainability of forests. When faced with forest fire risks, there is a discounting effect present which increases deforestation and institutional entropy.","[Ranjan, Ram] Macquarie Univ Sydney, Environm Sci, Fac Sci & Engn, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Ranjan, R (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ Sydney, Environm Sci, Fac Sci & Engn, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",ram.ranjan@mq.edu.au,,,,,,,35,12,12,1,25,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,OCT,2018,95.0,,,,,,85,101,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.07.010,0.0,,,17,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GT2VC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000444357400010,0

Blocked beds due to isolation measures or increased length of stay may result in opportunity costs if newly arriving patients have to be rejected and the hospital is confronted with revenue foregone. However, the amount of these costs is unclear, since different approaches are used in the literature to determine the respective costs. Our paper develops a concept to assess opportunity costs from the perspective of a hospital. Methods The analysis is two-stage. In a first step, the probability of rejecting a patient due to over-occupancy in a hospital is calculated with a queuing model and a Monte Carlo simulation taking various assumptions into account. In a second step, the amount of the opportunity costs is calculated as an expected value applying a stochastic approach based on a potential patient pool. Results Opportunity costs will occur only with a probability that is influenced, among others, by current bed occupancy rates. They have to be measured by average net revenue foregone, i.e., by the difference between average revenue foregone and average costs avoided. Conclusions Previous studies have a tendency of overestimating the occurrence or the size of opportunity costs with regard to the use of hospital beds. Nonetheless, its influence on the hospital budget is crucial and should be determined exactly.","[Huebner, Claudia; Flessa, Steffen] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Chair Hlth Care Management, F Loeffler Str 70, Greifswald, Germany; [Ried, Walter] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Chair Publ Finance, Greifswald, Germany",Universitat Greifswald; Universitat Greifswald,"Hübner, C (通讯作者)，Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Chair Hlth Care Management, F Loeffler Str 70, Greifswald, Germany.",claudia.huebner@uni-greifswald.de,"Flessa, Steffen/AEO-9609-2022",,,,,,29,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We are still imagining new storylines for the end-of-civilization, with a rich genre of Hollywood films depicting either the struggles of remnant humans in a post-apocalyptic world, or some event that threatens the very survival of our species. Instead of a spiritual reckoning imposed by God, Hollywood's Armageddon is usually the result of technology run amok, or mindless industrialization and population growth causing an environmental collapse. While dramatization of an environmental Armageddon might seem fanciful, existential risk warrants serious consideration even though the probability of an apocalypse is vanishingly small. If we are to avoid the unthinkable and unimaginable, then we need to ask what might be the most plausible pathways to an environmental apocalypse? We review the major environmental concepts pertinent to apocalyptic events, and conclude that positive feedback loops and multiplicative stresses represent the gravest existential risks, and the risks society is least likely to foresee. Zombies created by a misbegotten genetically engineered virus might make for a great movie, but it is the hubris of technical experts who are blind to surprising interaction networks, or who are unaware of positive feedback loops that will be our undoing.","[Kareiva, Peter; Carranza, Valerie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Kareiva, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",pkareiva@ioes.ucla.edu,,,Anthony and Jeanne Pritzker Foundation,Anthony and Jeanne Pritzker Foundation,Funding was provided by the Anthony and Jeanne Pritzker Foundation.,,85,27,27,2,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,39,50,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.001,0.0,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900005,0

I combine outcome data from the NLSY79 with archival records on early Head Start funding levels and for identification exploit differences across counties in the introduction timing and size of local Head Start programs. This allows me to compare the long-term outcomes of children who were too old for Head Start when the program was introduced in their county with the outcomes of children who were sufficiently young to be eligible. I find that individuals from counties that had an average-sized program when they were in Head Start's target age range experienced a $2,199 increase in annual adult earnings, completed 0.125 additional years of education, were 4.6 percentage points less likely to have a health limitation at age 40, and overall experienced a 0.081 standard deviation improvement in a summary index of these and other outcome measures. Funding levels at ages outside of Head Start's target range are not significantly correlated with long-term outcomes.

Between 2002 and 2011 the system exhibited a large turnover: 1282 schools closed -roughly one-tenth of the current stock- and 2350 new schools entered, mostly private-voucher schools. We use a large panel of administrative data, which contains individual students' academic achievement and socio-demographic characteristics, to estimate some of the potential educational costs of this dynamics. We identify a causal effect of school closures on school dropouts and grade retention. School closure increases the probability of high-school dropout between 49 and 68% (1.8 and 2.5 percentage points). Also, school exit implies between 3.9 and 4.4 percentage points increase in the probability of grade retention in fifth grade.","[Grau, Nicolas; Hojman, Daniel] Univ Chile, Dept Econ, Diagonal Paraguay 257, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile; [Mizala, Alejandra] Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile; Universidad de Chile,"Mizala, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Ctr Appl Econ, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.;Mizala, A (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Ctr Adv Res Educ CIAE, Beauchef 851, Santiago, Chile.",amizala@dii.uchile.cl,", CIAE/R-5423-2017; Hojman, Daniel A/N-4178-2015; Mizala, Alejandra/AAC-7716-2019; Mizala, Alejandra/H-8271-2013","Mizala, Alejandra/0000-0002-1141-4677",Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies [CONICYT/FONDAP/15130009]; PIA-CONICYT [FB0003],Centre for Social Conflict and Cohesion Studies; PIA-CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"We thank the Chilean Ministry of Education for providing the data.

Predicted effects on processors centered on the potential for season lengthening to lead to increased ex-vessel prices and efficiency gains in the use of processing inputs, like labor and utilities. Data show longer seasons following rationalization, with processors paying higher ex-vessel prices as the ratio of ex-vessel to export prices fell. Estimated changes in efficiency match predictions directionally, but are not statistically significant, which may be due, in part, to the limited number of facilities and the range of other factors from which the impacts of rationalization must be disentangled.","[Guldin, Marie] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Guldin, Marie] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, 305 Savery Hall,Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98915 USA; [Anderson, Christopher M.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Box 355020, Seattle, WA 98915 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Guldin, M (通讯作者)，NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.;Guldin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Econ, 305 Savery Hall,Box 353330, Seattle, WA 98915 USA.",marie.guldin@noaa.gov; cmand@uw.edu,,,,,,,25,7,8,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

For the estimation of the hedonic price function I develop a spatial research design which simultaneously reduces the risk of omitted variable bias and addresses the risk of measurement error in the noise measure. The preference parameters are locally identified by approximating utility through a simple functional form. The recovered preference parameters reveal a great deal of heterogeneity across households.

Estimates for such impacts are necessary for different populations. This paper aims to test whether smoking status has an independent effect on HRQoL over and above the effect derived from the increased likelihood of suffering a tobacco related disease, and to calculate utility values for the Spanish population. Using data from the Spanish Encuesta Nacional de Salud of 2011-12, we estimate statistical models for HRQoL as measured by the EQ-5D-5L instrument as a function of smoking status. We include a comprehensive set of controls for biological, clinical, lifestyle and socioeconomic characteristics. Smoking status has an independent, statistically significant effect on HRQoL. However, the size of the effect is small. The typical smoking related diseases, such as lung cancer, are associated with a reduction in HRQoL about 5 times larger than the difference between current smokers and never smokers. Attributing substantive HRQoL gains to quitting smoking as well as accounting for the concomitant HRQoL gain derived from a smaller likelihood of contracting tobacco related diseases might lead to an overestimation of the benefits of tobacco control policies. Nonetheless, the relatively large drops in HRQoL associated with being diagnosed with diseases that might be causally linked to tobacco suggest that such diseases should not be omitted from the economic evaluations of tobacco control policies.","[Lopez-Nicolas, Angel] Univ Politecn Cartagena UPCT, Fac Business Sci, Econ Dept, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain; [Trapero-Bertran, Marta] UIC, Fac Econ & Social Sci, C Immaculada 22, Barcelona 08017, Spain; [Trapero-Bertran, Marta; Munoz, Celia] UPF, CRES, Barcelona, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena; Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (UIC); Pompeu Fabra University,"López-Nicolás, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cartagena UPCT, Fac Business Sci, Econ Dept, C Real 3, Cartagena 30201, Murcia, Spain.",angel.lopez@upct.es,"Trapero-Bertran, Marta/AAA-9442-2021; Fernández, Celia Muñoz/Z-6287-2019","Trapero-Bertran, Marta/0000-0002-9233-1776; Fernández, Celia Muñoz/0000-0002-8877-024X; Lopez-Nicolas, Angel/0000-0003-3112-7779",European Union [602270]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [ECO2013-48217-C2-1],European Union(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)(Spanish Government),"The authors are very grateful to Dr. Toni Mora for his invaluable help and support to finish this paper.

The study assessed the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure among households in Nigeria. Secondary data from the Harmonized Nigeria Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) of 2009/10 was utilized to assess factors associated with catastrophic health expenditure in Nigeria. Household and individual characteristics associated with catastrophic health expenditure were determined using bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results showed that irrespective of the threshold for the two concepts of total household expenditure and non-food expenditure, having household members aged between 6 and 14 years, having household members aged between 15 and 24 years, having household members aged between 25 and 54 years, having no education, having primary education, having secondary education, lack of health insurance coverage, visiting a private health facility, households living in north central zone, households living in north east zone and having household members with non-chronic illnesses were factors that increase the risk of incurring catastrophic health expenditure among households.

In Russia, forestry firms have adopted Forest Stewardship Council certification more rapidly and with fewer challenges in Northwestern regions than in the Russian Far East. In 2011-2012, contentious politics broke out in response to a revision of Russia's national FSC standards. This case allows us to build upon and extend arguments about how domestic conditions shape actors' responses to private environmental governance. Regional variation in Russia suggests that collective mobilization to weaken certification is more likely to emerge under conditions of high levels of biodiversity, proximity to markets that are not sensitive to certification, and low penetration by multinational firms. However, the key factor facilitating collective action in this case was the emergence of an industry-government alliance that was rooted in prior industry-government collusion on the illegal logging, mutual investments in wood, and a lack of knowledge about FSC certification. Contentious politics gave way to constructive negotiations between stake-holders in 2013-2017 following the construction of several forms of negotiation.","[Henry, Laura A.] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Govt & Legal Studies, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Tysiachniouk, Maria] Wageningen Univ, Environm Policy Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Tysiachniouk, Maria] Ctr Independent Social Res, St Petersburg, Russia",Bowdoin College; Wageningen University & Research,"Henry, LA (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, Dept Govt & Legal Studies, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",lhenry@bowdoin.edu,"Tysiachniouk, Maria/Y-8418-2019","Tysiachniouk, Maria/0000-0002-0754-6829; Henry, Laura/0000-0001-7112-7568",National Council for Eurasian and East European Research [827-06]; Swedish research council FORMAS [2017-00826]; Formas [2017-00826] Funding Source: Formas,National Council for Eurasian and East European Research; Swedish research council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas); Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),This research was supported by the National Council for Eurasian and East European Research (Contract 827-06) and the Swedish research council FORMAS (Grant number 2017-00826).,,63,16,16,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,MAY,2018,90.0,,,,,,97,105,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.01.014,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GD8MK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430766300012,0

On average, receiving a $ 1,000 payment significantly reduces the proportion of married women who work, by 1.3 percentage points, in the month when the EITC is received. Additionally, this labor supply response is mainly driven by those who are secondary earners or liquidity-constrained.","[Yang, Tzu-Ting] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Yang, TT (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan.",ttyang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,45,6,8,2,13,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

To study the practices, processes and policies of value-assessment for new medicines across eight European countries and the role of HTA beyond economic evaluation and clinical benefit assessment. A systematic (peer review and grey) literature review was conducted using an analytical framework examining: (1) 'Responsibilities and structure of HTA agencies'; (2) 'Evidence and evaluation criteria considered in HTAs'; (3) 'Methods and techniques applied in HTAs'; and (4) 'Outcomes and implementation of HTAs'. Study countries were France, Germany, England, Sweden, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Evidence from the literature was validated and updated through two rounds of feedback involving primary data collection from national experts. All countries assess similar types of evidence; however, the specific criteria/endpoints used, their level of provision and requirement, and the way they are incorporated (e.g. explicitly vs. implicitly) varies across countries, with their relative importance remaining generally unknown. Incorporation of additional 'social value judgements' (beyond clinical benefit assessment) and economic evaluation could help explain heterogeneity in coverage recommendations and decision-making. More comprehensive and systematic assessment procedures characterised by increased transparency, in terms of selection of evaluation criteria, their importance and intensity of use, could lead to more rational evidence-based decision-making, possibly improving efficiency in resource allocation, while also raising public confidence and fairness.","[Angelis, Aris; Lange, Ansgar; Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Angelis, Aris; Lange, Ansgar; Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Med Technol Res Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kanavos, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Kanavos, P (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth, Med Technol Res Grp, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",p.g.kanavos@lse.ac.uk,"Angelis, Aris/AAH-1532-2021","Angelis, Aris/0000-0002-0261-4634","Advance-HTA from the European Commission, DG Research [305983]","Advance-HTA from the European Commission, DG Research","This study has been prepared under the auspices of Advance-HTA, a research project that has received funding from the European Commission, DG Research (Grant Agreement No: 305983).

Therefore, it seems interesting to examine the socio-economic space of Polish households due to the existence of disproportions in ICT development. The article presents the results of the classification of Polish voivodeships in terms of the degree of digital exclusion understood as lack of access or the ability to use ICT in households in 2017. The research used the ELECTRE TRI method, which is an example of a multicriteria decision support method used to classify decision variants based on a relationship of exceedance. The obtained results allowed for the identification of regions that are characterized by the highest degree of exclusion of digital households (the lowest use of ICT). This group includes the following provinces: Podlasie, Lublin and Lubusz. Into the analyses carried out additionally and deliberately introduced the region of Masovia Province without the capital city and separately the region of Warsaw (the capital city), which clearly different from other units.

The Dayton vision for the BiH was based on the neoliberal agenda which put a strong emphasis on the belief that ethnic harmony and sustainable peace would only be achieved through a reconstruction programme of neoliberal policies e.g. liberal democracy and open market economy. However, ethnic collective identities between contending groups are still seen to be the major obstacle to reach an upper level of shared collective identity.

For the labor market, it has become more common to adopt the concept of global citizenship in terms of competences and economic competitiveness when recruiting human resources. The global citizenship is the principal outcome of international education and is also linked to the internationalization of the curriculum. Developing the international curricula means preparing the graduates to live and work in a global world and enabling students to obtain both the social and the professional competences necessary to obtain a job anywhere in the world. In Romania, the employers have increased their demand for global competencies and practical skills in recent years due to the internationalization of companies and markets that are strongly connected to the necessity of hiring adaptable and flexible employees with analytical capacity and a high level of professionalism and integrity. These competences are found more and more often in employers' adverts for entry jobs. This trend has become challenging (seen both as an opportunity and a threat) especially for young graduates since they are facing the rapid changes from the labor market. Nowadays, the development of technology has facilitated the connection between the demand and the supply on the labor market via social networks or e-jobs platforms. The use of dedicated social networks for human resources recruitment has implications for the way the competition for obtaining a job at both national and international level changes and diversifies. The purpose of this article is to analyze the global competences required for the employment of young graduates of Economics in the Romanian labor market. For this purpose, the study aims to identify and and to analyze the global competences required for entry-level jobs related to graduates of Economics (e.g. junior Accountant, junior financial analyst, junior Marketing expert). In this regard, the analysis is based on job requirements from human resources recruitment networks and e-jobs platforms (Linkedln, bestjobs and e-jobs). Afterward, the paper synthesizes the results and builds a matrix of global competences based on the level of relevance; this matrix represents the fundamentals needed for designing the internationalized curricula.","[Butum, Lavinia Cornelia; Nicolescu, Luminita] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Butum, LC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest, Romania.",butum_lavinia@yahoo.com; luminicolescu@yahoo.com,"Nicolescu, Luminita/G-9427-2018; Butum, Lavinia Cornelia/ABB-4130-2020","Nicolescu, Luminita/0000-0001-8029-9054;",,,,,32,0,0,0,9,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-365-8,STRATEGICA,,,2018,,,,,,,63,74,,,,,,12,Development Studies; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BN4KG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000482078200006,0

The entrepreneurial activity is added to the traditional activities of the University (educational and scientific), which is aimed at the commercialization of scientific and technological developments. The University becomes not only a forge of the personnel for the national economy but also should be the site for the development of innovation-oriented entrepreneurship. The objectives of the University should be to create a favorable environment and conditions for the implementation of scientific activities, creating an effective infrastructure for research, involving the student community in the conduct of fundamental and applied research, commercialization of innovations. Moreover, the goal of intellectual scientific activity should be not only the result, embodied in the form of new knowledge, prototype, etc., but also innovations in the market, focused on consumers who provide income. This new role of universities requires the modernization of the educational process as well as of the curricula and training programs for students. The purpose of the research is the analysis of competencies that are formed in students in the process of educational activities and aimed at the development of innovation entrepreneurship in the region. The authors consider the essence and stages of innovation entrepreneurship. On the basis of studying various curricula in the Komsomolsk-on-Amur state University the problems of training bachelors and masters in this field are defined.

Manufacturers very often deal only with their core business and ancillary activities such as transport, storage etc. are outsourced by external entities (LSPs). Supply chain sustainability is the management of environmental, social and economic impacts throughout the lifecycles of goods and services. This concept is currently very popular and companies are trying to achieve it. If companies want to follow sustainable supply chain strategy, they have to choose LSPs in accordance with the concept of sustainable supply chain management. The aim of this article is to define an appropriate procedure for selecting logistics service provider with respect to a sustainable supply chain strategy. The selected multiple-criteria decision-making method (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution) will be used for selecting LSP and the criteria for selecting LSP will be defined using literature search in accordance with the concept of sustainable supply chain management. In this case there will be used standards of Global Reporting Initiative for sustainability reporting. The LSP selection procedure will be presented in a case study.","[Chocholac, Jan; Sommerauerova, Dana; Polak, Michal] Univ Pardubice, Fac Transport Engn, Dept Transport Management Mkt & Logist, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210 2, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Chocholác, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Transport Engn, Dept Transport Management Mkt & Logist, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210 2, Czech Republic.",jan.chocholac@upce.cz; dana.sommerauerova@student.upce.cz; st38746@student.upce.cz,"Chocholáč, Jan/V-6924-2018; Sommerauerova, Dana/W-1481-2018","Sommerauerova, Dana/0000-0002-5197-4775",[SGS_2018_023],,"This article is published within the solution of project no.

The analysis of the legal implications of the diverse and evolving techniques used by FTAs to incorporate renewable energy within their texts is framed within a broader theory of the evolution of the narrative underlying the trade and environment nexus. The article argues that the space devoted to environmental and renewable energy considerations in trade agreements has not only expanded but, more importantly, it has significantly changed, reflecting the evolution of trade agreements which are less and less simply trying to accommodate environmental concerns but rather becoming important instruments to ensure the effective advancement of environmental goals.","[Cima, Elena] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies IHEID, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Cima, E (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies IHEID, Geneva, Switzerland.",elena.cima@graduateinstitute.ch,,"Cima, Elena/0000-0002-0591-101X",,,,,43,11,11,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In an attempt to continue their activities in different conditions, SMEs need financing although they encounter some impediments. When it comes to the problems that firms perceive during their credit access, their feelings may differ because of being in different industries. In this context, the purpose of this research is to reveal if sectoral differences exist in perceptions of bank loan constraints for SMEs in manufacturing and service industries. Higher collateral requirements of banks, high expenses of loans and high number of procedures in credit application are the impediments that the research investigates. The sample of the study consists of 424 Turkish SMEs that are affiliated in Ankara Chamber of Commerce (ATO). Moreover, face to face surveys were performed to gain the responses from these businesses. By using Chi-Square and Z score statistics, and analyzing p values from these statistics, the study confirms that perceptions of SMEs that are in manufacturing and service sectors differ regarding to the selected credit access impediments. But contrary to the assumptions in the hypotheses that presume service firms are more likely to face with these impediments than manufacturing firms, the research finds that more SMEs in manufacturing sector perceive the chosen statements as obstacles in their credit application process than service firms do. Therefore, the research partially accepts the hypotheses. The study elucidates that manufacturing firms usually have high level of financial needs because of being exposed to higher amount of sunk costs and capital requirements to continue their activities and also make more export. These facts can make manufacturing firms risky from the banks' point of view. As a consequence of that, banks can take actions that cause tough loan conditions for SMEs in manufacturing industry and this can be the reason why more manufacturing firms in this study perceive the selected facts as obstacles than service firms do.","[Civelek, Mehmet] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic; [Dursun, Ibrahim] Int Univ Sarajevo, Fac Business & Adm, Hrasnicka Cesta 15, Sarajevo 71210, Bosnia & Herceg",Tomas Bata University Zlin; International University of Sarajevo,"Civelek, M (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",civelek@fame.utb.cz; idursun@iud.edu.ba,"Dursun, İbrahim/E-3295-2016","Dursun, İbrahim/0000-0003-0646-7763; Civelek, Mehmet/0000-0002-1247-5308",Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU [IGA/FaME/2017/010],Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU,The authors are thankful to the Internal Grant Agency of FaME TBU No. IGA/FaME/2017/010: Financial Constraints on Economic Activities for financial support to perform this research.,,45,4,4,0,2,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-730-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,30,43,,10.7441/dokbat.2018.03,0.0,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM6FI,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000466529800003,0

Thus, it represents a suitable framework to study how changes in parameters that are typical for NEG models, such as trade costs and regional market size, not only shape the regional distribution of economic activity, but at the same time determine the emergence of additional trade links between formerly autarkic regions. We survey some related papers and present a three-region framework that potentially nests many possible trade patterns. To focus the analysis, we study in more detail three specific trade patterns frequently found in the EU trade network. We start with three autarkic regions; then we introduce the possibility that two regions trade with each other; and, finally, we allow for one region trading with the other two, but the latter are still not trading with each other. We find a surprising plethora of long-run equilibria each involving a specific regional distribution of economic activity and a specific pattern of trade links. We show how a reduction in trade costs shapes simultaneously industry location and the configuration of the trade network.","[Commendatore, Pasquale] Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy; [Kubin, Ingrid] Vienna Univ Econ & Business Adm, Vienna, Austria; [Sushko, Iryna] NASU, Inst Math, Kiev, Ukraine",University of Naples Federico II; Vienna University of Economics & Business; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute of Mathematics of NASU,"Commendatore, P (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.",commenda@unina.it; Ingrid.Kubin@wu.ac.at; sushko@imath.kiev.ua,"Sushko, Iryna/AAE-8256-2020; Commendatore, Pasquale/AAQ-9669-2021","Sushko, Iryna/0000-0001-5879-0699; Kubin, Ingrid/0000-0002-0974-0174; Commendatore, Pasquale/0000-0003-2938-168X",,,,,14,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",,,978-3-319-65627-4; 978-3-319-65626-7,SPRINGER PR COMPLEX,,,2018,,,,,,,38,80,,10.1007/978-3-319-65627-4_3,0.0,,,43,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL4WU,,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450927000003,0

It allows to become independent of starting vectors and to be more effective in searching for an optimal solution. Clustering was run with preselected continuous variables characterizing all individual clients (deposit, credit and investment). The calculations were run using computer program written in SAS (4GL/SQL). The differential evolution algorithm itself has been enriched with a variable that allows the selection of the optimal number of clusters. Each iteration contained proposed solutions (chromosomes) which were evaluated by the target function built on the CS measure proposed by Chou (Das et. al., 2009).

Recently, recursive estimation methods suitable for this class of stochastic processes have been introduced in the literature. They undoubtedly represent attractive alternatives to the standard non-recursive estimation procedures with many practical applications. It is truly advantageous to adopt numerically effective estimation techniques that can estimate and control such models in real time. However, abnormal observations (outliers) may occur in data. They may be caused by many reasons, e.g. by additive errors, measurement failures or management actions. Exceptional data points will influence the model estimation considerably if no specific action is taken. The aim of this contribution is to propose and examine a robust recursive estimation algorithm suitable for GARCH models. It seems to be useful for various financial time series, in particular for (high-frequency) financial returns contaminated by additive outliers. The introduced algorithm can be effective in the risk control and regulation when the prediction of volatility is the main concern since it distinguishes and corrects outlaid bursts of volatility. Real data examples are presented.","[Hendrych, Radek; Cipra, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hendrych, R (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",hendrych@karlin.mff.cuni.cz; cipra@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Hendrych, Radek/O-8266-2017; Cipra, Tomáš/N-8668-2019; Hendrych, Radek/HJH-3526-2023","Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148; Cipra, Tomáš/0000-0003-0604-324X; Hendrych, Radek/0000-0003-3222-3148",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [17-00676S],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),This research was supported by the grant 17-00676S provided by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic.,,14,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,563,571,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400056,0

Then, it is applied to obtain the forecast of the quarterly populations of unemployed in Spain in 2015 and 2016.

Both migration and education can be found in the Declaration, and goals and targets, specifically. The issues of migration and education are intertwined in many aspects. The three points were chosen from the many mentioned in the development agenda, which are the access of migrant children to education, the quality of that education in context of integration problems faced by children and educational systems and education in the field of migration, and academic migration.

Education on migration is taken at the example of the most settled part of migration sphere in law, which is the refugee law, with the links between theory and clinical experience of law students.

Performance audits were conducted by the State Audit Office, which compiled individual reports. Companies were given recommendations in order to improve their business operations. After a certain period, audits were conducted to determine whether the given recommendations had been implemented. The paper explores the possibilities of improving the efficiency of public procurement procedures in companies and the impact of such improvements on business operations. Based on the research conducted in the companies, it was established that the progress made by the companies included in this paper was satisfactory. The given and implemented recommendations were studied and analysed. Conclusions were reached regarding the impact of the implemented recommendations on the companies' business operations. Legal framework and the significance of public procurement in business operations were also researched. The paper used the data from the audits performed by the State Audit Office, as well as from other reference materials. The research described in the paper pertains to seven companies in which a public procurement performance audit was conducted. Public procurement performance audits were conducted for the period from 2011 to 2013 in three companies, the period from 2013 to 2015 in another three companies and the period from 2012 to 2014 in one company. The paper also mentions other companies in which public procurement performance audits were conducted (six companies), whose public procurement procedures were also assessed in terms of efficiency. However, for them, no follow-up audit was conducted to review the implementation of the given recommendations up until the moment of writing this paper. Each performance audit was followed by a report containing an assessment of the public procurement system. Another report was also made after conducting a follow-up audit to review the implementation of the given recommendations. The paper confirmed the assumption that companies can significantly influence their financial result by implementing the recommendations given in the public procurement audits. Monitoring the implementation of the given recommendations in entities in which an audit was conducted highlights the importance and role of audit in the business process, improves transparency and public influence.","[Mahacek, Dubravka] Reg Off Pozega, State Audit Off, Fac Med Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Vcev, Aleksandar; Sebo, Damir] Fac Dent Med & Hlth Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Mahacek, D (通讯作者)，Reg Off Pozega, State Audit Off, Fac Med Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",dmahacek@vup.hr; aleksandar.vcev@fdmz.hr; damir.sebo@fdmz.hr,"Šebo, Damir/HJZ-4628-2023",,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,79,88,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300008,0

The paper aims at identifying and discussing different approaches to the concept of pension system generosity as seen from the microeconomic and macroeconomic perspective. It also attempts to evaluate and compare the generosity of pension systems in the European countries. The empirical research covers aggregated data for 27 states and employs selected indicators of pension system generosity associated with its identified dimensions. Statistical correlation analysis is also used to compare the convergence of the results of the generosity assessment from different perspectives. Consequently, this paper presents and collates several rankings of the studied countries in terms of the generosity of their pension systems. The main finding of the study is that the concept of pension system generosity is multidimensional and the perspective chosen affects the results of the assessment.","[Marcinkiewicz, Edyta] Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Management, Lodz, Poland",Lodz University of Technology,"Marcinkiewicz, E (通讯作者)，Lodz Univ Technol, Dept Management, Lodz, Poland.",edyta.marcinkiewicz@p.lodz.pl,"Marcinkiewicz, Edyta/N-4203-2018","Marcinkiewicz, Edyta/0000-0002-2229-4084",National Science Centre (Poland) [DEC-2014/15/D/HS4/01238],"National Science Centre (Poland)(National Science Centre, Poland)",This paper forms part of the project funded by the National Science Centre (Poland) under grant number DEC-2014/15/D/HS4/01238.,,16,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2364-5067,,978-3-319-67916-7; 978-3-319-67915-0,EURAS STUD BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,207,220,,10.1007/978-3-319-67916-7_13,0.0,,,14,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL4TI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450786500013,0

Also, world oil price shocks has a strong influence. The constructed model makes it possible to assess the impact of the various shocks that arise in partner countries on macroeconomic performance in a small economy, including socio-economic indicators, such as income inequality.

Yet, such deep and underlying motivation has often been ignored in economic analysis where means of existence are the centre and fruit of research. It is, however, important not to confuse the means and ends. Therefore, one should not focus on the intrinsic importance of income, but rather assess it depending on what it builds, particularly lives that are worthy of living. Having a decent income helps to avoid early death. Such an enterprise depends also on other characteristics, namely the organization of society, including public health, medical care, the nature of education and educational system, the scope of social cohesion and harmony, etc. Considering only means of existence or directly observing the type of life people lead constitutes a real difference.' These observations and findings reveal a contrast between the approaches based on utility and resources and the approach based on capabilities, of which the initiator is Amartya Sen (Nobel Prize of economics in 1998). The capabilities approach, therefore, attempts to put things right by focusing on the possibility of effective ends concrete freedom of attaining reasoned ends, rather than focusing on means. The present paper falls into two parts. The first part will try to highlight the imperfection of traditional monetary indicators as well as the difficulties to measure the different dimensions of poverty, particularly in emerging countries, such as Morocco. We argue that poverty is not merely an idea of inadequacy of economic means of an individual, but rather a fundamental shortage that deprivation entails minimum adequate capability. The second part deals with a reorientation towards capabilities in order to explain the extent to which the latter (the capabilities approach) could serve as a basis for the assessment of the level of deprivation and not that of resources, which focuses on income and wealth. The nature of real existence has always been of interest to social thinkers over the centuries. If the current criteria of economic progress, reflected by a swarm of turnkey statistics, focused on growth of inanimate comfort objects (such as GNP and GDP at the heart of innumerable economic studies on development), this focus can only be justified, if at all, by the impact of the said objects on human lives that they directly or indirectly affect.. The interest of replacing them by direct indicators of the quality of life, wellness and freedom that human lives enjoy is more and more recognized. Even inventors of quantitative estimation of national income which attracted much attention and adherence tried to make it clear that the ultimate interest was the richness of human existence, although it is their indices, rather than their motivations which had a great impact. William Petty, for example, the pioneer of the measure of national income in 17th Century (He suggested means to assess it so much through the 'income' method as through that of expenases, as is said today) formulated his intention as follows: to examine whether the subjects of the kind lived in as bad a condition as that of discontented people. Based on this, he explained the different determinants of people 's conditions, including common safety and the particular happiness of every man(2). This underlying motivation was often ignored in economic analysis where means of existence were the centre and fruit of research. It is, however, important not to confuse the means and ends. Therefore, one should not focus on the intrinsic importance of income, but rather assess it depending on what it builds, particularly lives that are worthy of living. Having a decent income helps to avoid early death. Such an enterprise depends also on other characteristics, namely the organization of society, including public health, medical care, the nature of education and educational system, the scope of social cohesion and harmony, etc. Considering only means of existence or directly observing the type of life people lead constitutes a real difference. These observations and findings reveal a contrast between the approaches based on utility and resources and the approach based on capabilities, of which the initiator is Amartya Sen (Nobel Prize of economics in 1998). In his work entitled A New Economic Model, Sen suggests that focus on means of existence should be abandoned in favor of concrete possibilities to live. This also results in a change with regard to means-oriented assessment methods, namely those laying emphasis on what John Rawls refers to as the primary goods, which are general means, such as income, wealth, powers and prerogatives of functions, social bases for self-respect., etc. The capabilities approach, therefore, attempts to put things right by focusing on the possibility of effective ends and on concrete freedom of attaining reasoned ends, rather than focusing on means. Thus, the present paper is divided into two parts. The first part will try to highlight the imperfection of traditional monetary indicators as well as the difficulties to measure the different dimensions of poverty, particularly in emerging countries, such as Morocco.

We carried out questionnaire survey among training participants. Our research revealed that top personal objectives of training are professional development and career growth as a company employee. However, a certain part of employees takes training in order to find a new job. This is an unfavourable fact for the company. Employees give generally high ratings to different aspects of training and describe the educational program as active, useful, bright. We identified differences in assessments of the program's content satisfaction, depending on the position and educational experience of the respondents. The higher the position and the bigger educational experience, the lower is the satisfaction degree. Monitoring of high-potential employees' assessments will contribute to the improvement of corporate university's activity and working out an effective model of setting up a prospective managerial reserve.

Stress-test scenarios are suited here to the structure of the portfolio. In this way, severity of a scenario may be increased as compared to standard methods. Scenarios are constructed on the basis of the information about portfolio sensitivity. When constructing a scenario, the direction of changes to selected nodes (vertices) of the interest-rate term structure is determined by the signs of partial sensitivity measures with respect to these nodes. Positive shifts are imposed where the sensitivity is negative and negative ones - where the sensitivity is positive. The shifts themselves are not more extreme than the ones that are used in the industry-standard stress scenarios. The approach is analyzed by an example of a portfolio of positions in IRS contracts. Then, profits or losses obtained under the proposed scenarios are compared with the results of 9 standard stress tests. For the test portfolio, it the proposed scenarios are severe indeed, but two standard ones (parallel downward shift of the whole term structure and a combination of historical minima) came out to be even more severe in this particular case.","[Rokita, Pawel; Pietrzyk, Radoslaw] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Rokita, P (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Ul Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",pawel.rokita@ue.wroc.pl; radoslaw.pietrzyk@ue.wroc.pl,"Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/S-2267-2016; Rokita, Pawel A./U-1101-2018","Pietrzyk, Radoslaw/0000-0002-6583-8424;",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1488,1497,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400147,0

Research indicates that there are a number of studies that advocate the impact of SHRM and its influence on an organization that enhances an organization's capability and enables them to improve their organizational competency, i.e. excellence. Yet, on that point are some rare linkage between SHRM and sustainable organizational cultural practices that can provide a unique perspective to develop organizations effectiveness and spread out its excellence through prerequisite academic condition, suitable working condition, and potential motivation. Thus, the main aim of this article is to put emphasis on several approaches of organizational culture and strategic HRM, by integrating knowledge from diverse areas of organizational studies including organizational learning, and the distinctive design of human resource practices. In view of literature, this article confers that the best practices for accomplishing and sustaining organizational excellence could be enriched through the organizational culture and academic work experienced in recent years.

In general, we can say that higher limitations related to the range of privatisation in terms of income and shares sold appear in countries with inefficient legislation, where shareholders are less protected, banks are strong and capital markets less developed. Therefore, in the development typology context within the frame of mapping out institutional cooperation and changes necessary for development, it is necessary to observe the Croatian capital market in relation to the chronological development stage of capital market and shareholding, volume of shareholders, shareholder structure and volume as well as value of shares. This paper provides an analysis of data on share ownership structure in relation to the nominal and market value of shares traded on the Croatian capital market from 2006 to 2018. Analyses conducted through SOM and ANFIS indicate that the essence of the problem of share ownership/value structure is the concentration of legal entities and that the share in the structure of legal entities affects nominal value, while the market value can be connected to the share of natural persons and others. Shareholder democracy in the Croatian capital market has given way to the concentration of ownership with the tendency of over-the-counter and non-transparent increase in ownership, while a strong corporate control of few is replacing corporate democracy and the corporate management code. These circumstances of ownership transformation are encouraging social exclusion and enhancing the impact of connected ownership and interest groups (crony capitalism) instead of developing a modern shareholder democracy, as well as social and market inclusion.","[Samodol, Ante; Valcic, Sonja Brlecic] Libertas Int Univ, Dubrovnik, Croatia",,"Samodol, A (通讯作者)，Libertas Int Univ, Dubrovnik, Croatia.",asamodol@libertas.hr; sbrlecic@libertas.hr,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,347,356,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BO8KK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000527683300039,0

The findings highlight that, as a general trend, defeminization in manufacturing has persisted in the Global North, led by a negative trade impact in low-technology industries. In the Global South, feminization and defeminization trends are not as straightforward. Despite positive changes in women's share of employment in medium-high- and high-technology industries, negative gender bias effects of trade changes are found particularly in high-technology industries, where occupations are notably gendered.","[Saracoglu, Durdane Sirin; Voyvoda, Ebru] Univ Mah, Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Bul 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Memis, Emel; Kizilirmak, Burca] Ankara Univ Cemal Gursel Caddesi, Dept Econ, TR-06590 Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Zorlu Holding,"Saraçoglu, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Mah, Middle East Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Bul 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",ssirin@metu.edu.tr; ememis@politics.ankara.edu.tr; voyvoda@metu.edu.tr; burca@politics.ankara.edu.tr,"Memiş, Emel/AAH-6471-2020; Saraçoğlu, Şirin/AAZ-6952-2020; Memiş, Emel/AAA-2091-2020","Memiş, Emel/0000-0002-9087-4726; Memiş, Emel/0000-0002-9087-4726; KIZILIRMAK YAKISIR, AYSE BURCA/0000-0003-3247-7586",TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) [SOBAG 109K510],TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"The authors would like to thank the participants of the 22nd IAFFE Conference, 16th International Economic Association (IEA) World Congress for useful comments and suggestions.

We included indicators describing the maturity of the economy (HDI and GDP/capita), family situation (no. of marriages and divorces), financial background (unemployment rate, number of completed dwellings) and schooling. Data were taken for period 1993-2016. All other variables with exception of HDI and no. of marriages were statistically significantly correlated with the development of TFR. All determinants were included into several regression models. Linear function fitted the best. Statistically significant determinants were only GDP/capita, number of marriages and dwellings constructions, and years of schooling. If the GDP/capita and no. of marriages and households increases, TFR also increases. The largest and the only negative impact has the number of years of schooling. Findings have positive implications that the increasing number of divorces and unemployment is not significant determinant of fertility and that the development of the country does not necessary mean that the fertility will be affected. On the other hand, prolonging the average number of years of schooling has negative influence on TFR despite that education has many advantages and brings development to the country.","[Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Simpachova Pechrova, Marie] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Simpach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",ondrej.simpach@vse.cz; simpachova.marie@uzei.cz,,,Czech Science Foundation [P402/12/G097]; Institute of Agricultural Economics and information [1113/2018],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Institute of Agricultural Economics and information,The paper was supported from Czech Science Foundation Project No. P402/12/G097 DYME-Dynamic Models in Economics and from Internal Research Grant No. 1113/2018 of the Institute of Agricultural Economics and information.,,15,1,1,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-14-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,1727,1735,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BL7YP,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455809400171,0

Using material produced by design students, zookeepers and the chimps Judy and Gombe, we describe how prototyping iterations establish open processes of dialogue and encounters among humans and nonhumans. The case will demonstrate how prototyping can go further than the generation of models of an original. On the contrary, the cosmopolitical encounter emerging from the prototyping process makes evident a truly ontological vocation, acknowledging humans and other-than-human beings as singular entities. Its provisional and malleable nature turns this device into a privileged locus for the exploration of interspecies entanglement. Although zoos are scientifically organized institutions, in this case we observe how its anthropocentric hierarchy was performatively reshuffled at certain moments of the prototyping process. The cosmopolitical qualities of the prototyping process analyzed derive from its capacity to deploy an ethics of attention and care between the agencies at play, that is, for unfold gestures of mutual vulnerability. Finally, we propose prototyping as a device for moving from cosmopolitics as a way of understanding the world to cosmopolitics as a matter of design.","[Tironi, Martin; Hermansen, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Design, Comendador 1916, Santiago 7520245, RM, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Hermansen, P (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Design, Comendador 1916, Santiago 7520245, RM, Chile.",phermans@uc.cl,,,,,,,72,7,7,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The results identify four LS based on: forest income, crop production, livestock production and wage labour (off-farm income). The results of a multinomial logit model (MLM) showed that ethnicity has strong influence on their choice of LS, and households with higher physical asset holdings are more likely to engage in more remunerative LS in both ethnicities. Tobit regression show that the ethnic group of Kichwa has US$ 223 higher annual income from Crop based LS in comparison to colonists. In contrast, colonists earn, on average, US$ 472 per year more from livestock than indigenous households in livestock-based LS and 182 dollars annually more in wage-based LS. Households with greater human capital are more engaged in Wage labour-based LS. Interestingly, residing within the buffer zone of the SBR reduces forest income by US$ 268 in Forest-based LS. The relative remaining forest land is not significantly related to LS. Potential implications of the different activities and composition of household assets in each LS are discussed in order to draw conclusions for equitable development and forest conservation.","[Torres, Boller; Knoke, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Inst Forest Management, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Martagement, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Torres, Boller] Univ Estatal Amazon, Fac Clencias Vida, Pastaza, Ecuador; [Guenter, Sven] Thiinen Inst Int Forestry & Forest Econ, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; [Acevedo-Cabra, Ricardo] TUM, Dept Math, D-85748 Garching, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich,"Torres, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Inst Forest Management, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Martagement, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",btorres@uea.edu.ec,"Knoke, Thomas Friedrich/H-8965-2019; Knoke, Thomas/B-2617-2009","Knoke, Thomas Friedrich/0000-0003-1380-3438; Torres, Bolier/0000-0002-9182-419X; Knoke, Thomas/0000-0003-0535-5946",network PEN/CIFOR; network RAVA; World Bank Institutional Development Fund [TF090577]; Education for Nature Program of WWF,network PEN/CIFOR; network RAVA; World Bank Institutional Development Fund; Education for Nature Program of WWF,"We thank the families of the 32 villages who shared valuable information about their livelihoods with us during the multiple visits.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) faces an uncertain future following its Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in 2015. International investment law is under attack in countries around the world, while mega-regional agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are beset by world events, from the United States' federal election to the unexpected Brexit outcome. Yet the appetite of numerous States to continue forging plurilateral trade and investment deals provides some cause for hope. Viewed alongside other institutional developments including consensus-building work at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, the potential arguably now exists for credible movement towards multilateral rules in investment law. While the WTO's current negotiating stalemate highlights the difficulties in reaching agreement among 164 Members, international trade law offers lessons for working towards multilateralism in the international investment law field. Alongside informal discussions about a world investment court, mega-regionals provide a vehicle for future multilateral investment rules, particularly through the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership currently under negotiation in Asia.","[Voon, Tania] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Voon, T (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",tania.voon@unimelb.edu.au,,"Voon, Tania/0000-0001-7925-9389",Australian Research Council [DP130100838]; Melbourne Law School,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Melbourne Law School,"The first draft of this article was written during my period as Scholar in Residence with the Arbitration Group of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in London (August 2016).

We exploit a large doctor-patient panel dataset based on insurance-claims data from Switzerland to estimate the effect of physician gender on health care expenditures. We find considerable heterogeneity across specialties. In primary care, female doctors are found to produce similar overall expenditures per visit as their male colleagues, but significantly smaller prescribing costs and significantly higher laboratory costs. In secondary-care specialties, we find that women generate lower overall expenditures, which is mainly driven by consultation costs. These findings provide evidence for the existence of sex-specific practice styles that translate into different overall expenditures as well as different compositions of these expenditures.","[Kaiser, Boris] Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland",University of Bern,"Kaiser, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Dept Econ, Bern, Switzerland.",bo.kaiser@gmx.ch,,"Kaiser, Boris/0000-0003-4936-8618",,,,,39,1,1,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We focus on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), an important pollutant for health according to the medical literature, and show that moderate levels of pollution reduce hours worked for working adults. Our research design takes advantage of rich household panel data in labor outcomes to address omitted variables. This research design allows us to investigate whether the response to air pollution is non-linear. We find that the effect of moderate pollution levels on hours worked is concentrated among households with susceptible dependents, i.e., small children and elderly adults; while the highest concentrations affect all households. This suggests that caregiving is likely a mechanism linking air pollution to labor supply at moderate levels. We provide further evidence of this mechanism using data on children morbidity. Finally, we find no evidence of intra-household attenuation behavior. For instance, there is no re-allocation of labor across household members, and earnings decrease with air pollution.

One explanation is that missing credit markets may suppress WTP for environmental improvements that require large up-front investments. We test the impact of microloans on WTP for hygienic latrines via a randomized controlled trial in 30 villages in rural Cambodia. We find that microcredit dramatically raises WTP for improved latrines, with 60% of households in the Financing arm willing to purchase at an unsubsidized price, relative to 25% in the Non-financing arm. Effects on latrine installation are positive but muted by several factors, including a negative peer effect: randomly induced purchases by neighbors reduce a household's probability of installing its own latrine.

Several authors attribute this empirical result to the development of ecotourism in protected areas. We thus argue that the gap between the theory and existing empirical results is partly explained by the fact that most theoretical models do not account for a productive activity on protected land. Therefore, we develop a theoretical model in which conservation allows developing an alternative sector and show that the relationship between conservation and welfare is U-shaped. We test this theoretical prediction using Nepalese data and find that conservation combined with ecotourism is indeed positively related to local welfare.

How to value money flows expected in the far distant future is therefore a crucial question. Applying time declining discount rates (DDR) may offer an appropriate alternative to conventional discounting, but few studies have applied DDRs in forest economics. We expect that theoretical assumptions behind welfare analyses based on DDR will be important. Using a dataset from the UK (Davies and Kerr (2015) [Forests 6: 2424-2449]) we investigate the effects of 1) more than marginal contributions from forestry to consumption, 2) the role of the assumed scenarios for return on capital, and 3) ignoring optimization (i.e. adopting predefined management scenarios) on the ranking of different silvicultural strategies. These include various clearfelling options (with replanting, natural regeneration or under planting) and the transition to continuous cover forestry. Our analysis reveals that changes in these aspects affect the ranking of forest management options more strongly than a pure change in the coefficients of a benefit cost analysis. Decreasing marginality, cautious assumptions about the worst-case return on capital and optimization of silvicultural operations all increase the relative attractiveness of continuous cover forestry. We conclude that applying DDR makes valuation in forestry more demanding and should be applied with appropriate care. In addition, the precise assumptions behind the particular schedule of DDRs should be explicit. Finally, theoretical considerations support the importance of combining optimization of silvicultural management strategies with their economic evaluation.","[Knoke, Thomas; Paul, Carola; Haertl, Fabian] TUM, Dept Ecol & Ecosyst Management, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Inst Forest Management, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Knoke, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci Weihenstephan, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",knoke@forst.wzw.tum.de,"Knoke, Thomas Friedrich/H-8965-2019; Paul, Carola/I-6711-2019; Härtl, Fabian H/B-1582-2013; Knoke, Thomas/B-2617-2009","Knoke, Thomas Friedrich/0000-0003-1380-3438; Paul, Carola/0000-0002-6257-2026; Knoke, Thomas/0000-0003-0535-5946; Hartl, Fabian/0000-0002-4966-4786",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [KN 586/11-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We would like to thank the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for financial support of the study (KN 586/11-1).

Contrary to studies that explain this discrepancy mainly with deficient budgets and capacity shortfalls, this paper highlights aid as a cause of implementation failure: Analysing the REDD+ process in Tanzania, it reveals how donor experts employ their material and discursive power to convey 'conservation fads' to the country's policy domain, and to shape the latter in terms of substance and organisation. At the same time, it shows how local actors from government, civil society and academia utilise their international 'partners' for pursuing their own interests. The empirical findings presented in this paper are based on expert interviews and document analysis. Drawing on democracy theory and development studies, the paper points out the implications of aid and related expert advice for young democracies. In the Tanzanian forest sector, a far-reaching effect can be observed: Decision makers routinely adjust their agenda to donor priorities without necessarily intending to put new policies into practice. While the uptake of 'conservation fads' promoted by the aid industry provides them direct and indirect access to resources, it prevents the emergence of responsive politics able to transform forest management on the ground.

Despite comparably sized losses, the two states responded differently to these shocks. Florida expanded state subsidized homeowner insurance, breaking from a free-market response, whereas Louisiana actively promoted private market supply. Comparing the two policy processes reveals that the politics and transformation of homeowner insurance evoked by extreme weather events depend on how concentrated the hurricane impact is and whether it effectively mobilizes homeowners into electoral politics. The broader distribution of losses in Florida prompted homeowners to exert sufficient electoral pressure to influence policy responses, fostering political dynamics emphasized by interest group theories of policy, and a break from the market. The more concentrated hurricane impact in Louisiana blocked homeowners from doing the same, leaving Louisiana's policymakers free to draw on the institutionalized free-market logic to guide their response to hurricane damages and producing trajectories expected by structural-class theories. The findings highlight the contingency of different approaches to the politics of markets and policy, suggesting that the dynamics proposed by the two theories depend on the distribution and political impact of the problems and shocks involved.","[Ubert, Emanuel] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Sociol, 8128 William H Sewell Social Sci Bldg, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ubert, E (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Sociol, 8128 William H Sewell Social Sci Bldg, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",eubert@wisc.edu,,,,,,,61,3,3,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

It argues that the problem lies with the lack of retrospective remedies in WTO dispute settlement. Consequently, China is able to breach its WTO obligations temporarily with minimal consequence. Although such restrictions may have negative consequences for upstream extraction firms, China is able to implement the restrictions because several upstream firms are state-owned enterprises. As a result, China is able to utilize export restrictions on minerals and other raw materials effectively to foster the development of strategic emerging industries downstream. Given existing negotiating standoffs and domestic political constraints, this article suggests that it is unlikely that any potential WTO legal reforms will be enacted any time soon to address this problem.","[Wu, Mark] Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Wu, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Law Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mwu@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,34,17,18,1,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2017,16.0,4,,,,,673,691,,10.1017/S147474561700026X,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,FK0ML,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413173800007,0

A major challenge is said to be a lack of available funding, and a low uptake of allocated funds is also reported. However, in in-depth analysis has still not been produced to assess the approaches to funding, the reasons for these approaches and their impact regarding the achievement of the aims of Natura 2000. Thus, with this article, we intend to fill this gap. To accomplish this, a case study analysis was carried out in six selected EU Member States: Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK In our study, we perceived different approaches which we sum up to two main types of approaches that were present in the Member States to different degrees. The first type was to find the funding necessary for the required activities, and the second was to delay the implementation of Natura 2000. The major reasons for the different approaches were related to domestic political power realities. The funding approaches impacted onto the attractiveness of EU co-financing instruments, and the sustainability of the schemes. Alternative approaches were either absent or declining in importance. The economic benefits were not perceived on the ground. We conclude that neither a one size fits all approach to funding Natura 2000 will work nor will a universal claim for more money. Therefore, a successful funding strategy ultimately necessitates effective interventions at institutional levels, the business environment and the local level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

I use data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys covering 1988-1994 and 1999-2012. Higher cigarette excise taxes lead to statistically significant decreases in smoking prevalence as measured by both self-reports and serum cotinine levels. Among self-reported smokers, cigarette excise taxes are associated with statistically significant reductions in serum cotinine levels but not in cigarette consumption. Among likely smokers, as defined by serum cotinine levels, I do not find that cigarette excise taxes reduce serum cotinine levels on the intensive margin, but I do find that tobacco control policies, especially policies directed at minors, may increase the incidence of misreported smoking status.","[Nesson, Erik] Ball State Univ, Miller Coll Business, Dept Econ, Muncie, IN 47306 USA",Ball State University,"Nesson, E (通讯作者)，Ball State Univ, Miller Coll Business, Dept Econ, Muncie, IN 47306 USA.",etnesson@bsu.edu,,"Nesson, Erik/0000-0002-4714-0495",,,,,58,6,8,0,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Comorbidities, the secondary diagnoses, are common across many causes of illness and often correlate with worse health outcomes and more expensive health care. In this study, we propose a method for measuring the average spending for each cause of illness with and without comorbidities. Methods: Our strategy for measuring cause of illness-specific spending and adjusting for the presence of comorbidities uses a regression-based framework to estimate excess spending due to comorbidities. We consider multiple causes simultaneously, allowing causes of illness to appear as either a primary diagnosis or a comorbidity. Our adjustment method distributes excess spending away from primary diagnoses (outflows), exaggerated due to the presence of comorbidities, and allocates that spending towards causes of illness that appear as comorbidities (inflows). We apply this framework for spending adjustment to the National Inpatient Survey data in the United States for years 1996-2012 to generate comorbidity-adjusted health care spending estimates for 154 causes of illness by age and sex. Results: The primary diagnoses with the greatest number of comorbidities in the NIS dataset were acute renal failure, septicemia, and endocarditis. Hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease were the most common comorbidities across all age groups. After adjusting for comorbidities, chronic kidney diseases, atrial fibrillation and flutter, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased by 74.1%, 40.9%, and 21.0%, respectively, while pancreatitis, lower respiratory infections, and septicemia decreased by 21.3%, 17.2%, and 16.0%. For many diseases, comorbidity adjustments had varying effects on spending for different age groups. Conclusions: Our methodology takes a unified approach to account for excess spending caused by the presence of comorbidities. Adjusting for comorbidities provides a substantially altered, more accurate estimate of the spending attributed to specific cause of illness. Making these adjustments supports improved resource tracking, accountability, and planning for future resource allocation.","[Dieleman, Joseph L.; Johnson, Elizabeth; Birger, Maxwell; Campbell, Madeline; Chapin, Abigail; Gabert, Rose; Hamavid, Hannah; Horst, Cody; Joseph, Jonathan; Squires, Ellen] Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, 2301 5th Ave,Suite 600, Seattle, WA 98121 USA; [Baral, Ranju; Bulchis, Anne] Univ Calif San Francisco, Global Hlth Grp, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158 USA; [Bui, Anthony L.] David Geffen Sch Med UCLA, 10833 Le Conte Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Lomsadze, Liya] Northwell Hlth, 95-25 Queens Blvd, New York, NY 11374 USA; [Tobias, Martin] Minist Hlth, 1 3 Terrace Level 2, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Northwell Health,"Dieleman, JL (通讯作者)，Inst Hlth Metr & Evaluat, 2301 5th Ave,Suite 600, Seattle, WA 98121 USA.",dieleman@uw.edu,,"Bui, Anthony/0000-0003-3481-7855",Vitality Institute; National Institute of Aging; Vitality Institute; National Institute of Aging,Vitality Institute; National Institute of Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Vitality Institute; National Institute of Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),This research was supported by the Vitality Institute and the National Institute of Aging.,,20,13,14,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The analysis was done with a comparative statics application of the Global Forest Products Model. The model was first calibrated to replicate observations in the base year 2013, and then solved under autarky conditions. The results showed much variation in the effects of international trade on production, consumption, and prices across countries and sub sectors. Globally international trade did have a positive effect on the economic welfare of the sector. This was due mostly to the positive effect on the surplus of consumers, and to a lesser extent on the increase in value added in forest industries. But value added profited manufacturers in developed countries much more than in developing. Furthermore, while wood producers in developed countries increased their profits with trade, those in developing countries incurred heavy losses that negated any incentive to invest in forest conservation, management and new plantations.","[Buongiorno, Joseph; Johnston, Craig; Zhu, Shushuai] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Buongiorno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jbuongio@wisc.edu,,,"University of Wisconsin [12-JV-11330143-065, 16-JV-11330143-039]; USDA Forest Service Southern Forest Research Station [12-JV-11330143-065, 16-JV-11330143-039]",University of Wisconsin; USDA Forest Service Southern Forest Research Station,"The research leading to this paper was supported in part by joint venture agreements between the University of Wisconsin and the USDA Forest Service Southern Forest Research Station (12-JV-11330143-065 and 16-JV-11330143-039), in cooperation with project leader Jeff Prestemon.",,26,20,21,4,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,JUL,2017,80.0,,,,,,209,217,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.04.004,0.0,,,9,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,EX3FU,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403118800022,0

Using administrative data from North Carolina and leveraging a discontinuity in the determination of school failure, we examine the causal impact of this form of accountability pressure both on student behaviors that are incentivized by NCLB and on those that are not. We find evidence that, as NCLB intends, pressure encourages students to show up at school and to do so on time. Accountability pressure also appears to have the unintended effect, however, of increasing the number of student misbehaviors.

The mineral and peat fire in 2015 burnt 2.6 million hectares, mostly in the provinces of Riau, South Sumatra, Jambi, Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and Papua, and costed USD16.1 billion as estimated by the World Bank in 2015. Although only 30% of the fire was on peatland area, it had a much higher impact than that on mineral land because of its fire density. Fires in Indonesia are caused by human both individually or collectively. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has committed to reducing fire during his term of office. Government actions have focused on fire suppression, biophysical and technological issues such as canal blocking and an early warning system. Significant actions on the underlying causes of fires such as providing economy incentives for land preparation without burning are rare. We conducted a political economy study of fire and haze to provide policy makers with an understanding of the economic, social and political causes of forest and land fires. The study focused on four districts in Riau Province, which experienced fires and forest transition to palm oil plantations. We collected social, policy and economy data from survey in ex post fire sites and carried out focus group discussions with the key stakeholders. We implemented value chain and social network analyses to the collected data. We found a diversity of actors were involved and gaining benefits from fires. We found that farmer group organizers obtained enormous benefits, as much as USD486 per hectare. These actors influence decision-making processes through their patronage network for their own interests. The networks provide power, support, protection and access to various resources. To effectively reduce fire, governments need to dis-empower these farmer group organizers through law and policy.

Secondary data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1993 to 2009 was used. A time-varying coefficient model was constructed using a binary outcome of no enrollment in health insurance plan versus enrolled. The independent variables included age, sex, education, income, work status, race, and number of health conditions. Smooth functions of odds ratios and time were used to produce odds ratio plots. Significant time-varying coefficients were found for all the independent variables with the odds ratio plots showing changing trends except for a constant line for the categories of male, student, and having three health conditions. Some categories showed decreasing disparities, such as the income categories. However, some categories had increasing disparities in health insurance enrollment such as the education and race categories. As the Affordable Care Act is being gradually implemented, studies are needed to provide baseline information about disparities in access to health insurance, in order to gauge any changes in health insurance access. The use of time-varying coefficient models with BRFSS data can be useful in accomplishing this task.","[Assaf, Shireen] ICF Int, Demog & Hlth Surveys Program, Rockville, MD USA; [Campostrini, Stefano] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, LCSR, Moscow, Russia; [Xu, Fang] Northrop Grumman Corp, Atlanta, GA USA; [Crawford, Carol Gotway] Emory Univ, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Bioinformat, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Pavia; University of York - UK; HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Northrop Grumman Corporation; Emory University; Rollins School Public Health,"Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via San Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.;Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Univ York, Hlth Econometr & Data Grp, York, N Yorkshire, England.;Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, LCSR, Moscow, Russia.",shireen.assaf@icfi.com; stefano.campostrini@unive.it; cinzia.dinovi@unipv.it; fang.xu@ngc.com; cagc@comcast.net,"Di Novi, Cinzia/AAK-3184-2021","Di Novi, Cinzia/0000-0002-3536-5507; Campostrini, Stefano/0000-0002-7113-4458; Assaf, Shireen/0000-0002-0024-9717",Intramural CDC HHS [CC999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural CDC HHS,,,39,5,6,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Conversely, academic skills have that effect when excess supply in the overall labour market is higher.

Households also partially compensate using a variety of income sources. Distributions from retirement accounts increase in the short run. Self-employment income and disability insurance payments increase over longer periods. More generous U.I. benefits crowd out wage income and are associated with increased retirement account distributions.

After reviewing existing roadmaps for low-carbon growth by 2050, the article identifies the importance for Australia of an integrated and mutually reinforcing set of measures, based on a bold approach to urban and regional planning. Taking account of national geography, the approach is based on the decentralisation of energy production, use and storage, and on new uses of communication, transport and the location of food, water and mineral resources. Revitalised regional centres could be connected, through new energy and transport solutions, by a national transport arc and electrified highways. The use of infrastructure funding to support low-carbon regional development would avoid the tragedy of the commons', transcending incremental, cumulative approaches based on compensation and incentives for household, business and sectoral abatement efforts.

On the other hand, excessive reliance of households on environmental resources for their sustenance has already lead to high rates of deforestation and forest degradation in Ethiopia. A project was set out to provide alternative livelihood activities in order to improve the welfare of vulnerable families who derive their livelihoods mainly from selling firewood and charcoal. The project provided support to women groups to engage in income generating activities that create alternative means of livelihoods. This paper assesses the impacts of participating in alternative livelihood activities on household welfare and environmental protection in rural Ethiopia. The paper uses data from cross-sectional survey involving 450 sample households to examine the difference in household welfare between project participants and non-participants using propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting estimator with regression adjustment. Empirical results show that participation in alternative livelihood activities has contributed to increment in total grain production, increased household income and adoption of natural resources management technologies. Project households consumed more diverse food across food groups and earned an extra $35 per month from local market sales of tree and fruit seedlings. The result was robust and consistent across models. The findings support the notion that new streams of income generating activities can lead to improvements in household's well-being as well as reduction in environmental degradation.

An unexpected event such as a health crisis increases the demand for labor provided by women, thus making them more time poor. The model and numerical simulations show that a deterioration in a woman's time constraint will have an adverse effect on agricultural output of the household. This occurs because most women respond to an increase in household work by reducing their work hours on the farm and by reducing their leisure time. The latter outcome is expected to have a negative effect on women's physical and mental health, which will then cause a decline in their productivity on the farm.","[Arora, Diksha; Rada, Codrina] Univ Utah, Econ, 260 S Cent Campus Dr OSH,Room 343, Salt Lake City, UT 84103 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Arora, D (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Econ, 260 S Cent Campus Dr OSH,Room 343, Salt Lake City, UT 84103 USA.",diksha.arora@economics.utah.edu; codrina.rada@economics.utah.edu,,,"Association for Social Economics, University of Utah; Department of Economics, University of Utah","Association for Social Economics, University of Utah; Department of Economics, University of Utah","We thank the Association for Social Economics and the Department of Economics, University of Utah, for their generous financial support in undertaking the field research for this paper.

The nutraceuticals industry has added further pressure on fish oils with high Omega-3 fatty acids. GM soybeans could provide substitutes in high Omega-3 soybean oil (STA oil), as well as soy protein concentrate (SPC). This article examines the technological and economic feasibility of substituting STA oil for one-half the fish oil in the diet of Seriola rivoliana, a species often destined for sushi markets. Previous studies have shown that the substitution results in no change in flesh quality or consumer acceptance. We find that the two feed technologies result in essentially identical growth pattern and feed consumption. Economic feasibility depends upon the price of STA oil being lower than the price of fish oil. Based on our market analysis, we estimate that STA oil will enter the market at a price about two-thirds of the fish oil price. The estimated cost savings at these prices are small, a 2.8% reduction in feed costs and 0.9% reduction in total costs. However, the potential global market for STA oil could be as much as 252 thousand metric tons annually, which would require soybean production equivalent to that from 1.63% of current U.S. soybean area.","[Bairagi, Subir] IRRI, Social Sci Div, 218 Drilion Hall, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines; [Perrin, Richard; Fulginiti, Lilyan] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Dept Agr Econ, Lincoln, NE USA; [Clemente, Thomas] Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Ctr Plant Sci Innovat, Lincoln, NE USA; [Hungate, Cory; Key, Gavin] Kampachi Farms LLC, Kona, HI USA",CGIAR; International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Bairagi, S (通讯作者)，IRRI, Social Sci Div, 218 Drilion Hall, Los Banos 4031, Laguna, Philippines.",s.bairagi@irri.org,"Bairagi, Subir/L-6567-2019","Bairagi, Subir/0000-0003-4473-2249",,,,,55,1,1,0,27,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

A subsequent development was the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test of non-causality in the conditional variance by Hafner and Herwartz (2006), who provided simulations results to show that their LM test was more powerful than the portmanteau statistic. While the LM test for causality proposed by Hafner and Herwartz (2006) is an interesting and useful development, it is nonetheless arbitrary. In particular, the specification on which the LM test is based does not rely on an underlying stochastic process, so that the alternative hypothesis is also arbitrary, which can affect the power of the test. The purpose of the paper is to derive a simple test for causality in volatility that provides regularity conditions arising from the underlying stochastic process, namely a random coefficient autoregressive process, and for which the (quasi-) maximum likelihood estimates have valid asymptotic properties under the null hypothesis of non-causality. The simple test is intuitively appealing as it is based on an underlying stochastic process, is sympathetic to Granger's (1969, 1988) notion of time series predictability, is easy to implement, and has a regularity condition that is not available in the LM test.","[Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Taichung, Taiwan; [Chang, Chia-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [McAleer, Michael] Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; National Tsing Hua University,"McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Quantitat Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan.;McAleer, M (通讯作者)，Dhurakij Pundit Univ, Inst Social & Econ Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",michael.mcaleer@gmail.com,"McAleer, Michael/K-8780-2019; McAleer, Michael/A-2407-2008; Chang, Chia-Lin/B-2679-2010","Chang, Chia-Lin/0000-0001-8835-760X","Australian Research Council; National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan","For financial support, the first author wishes to thank the National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan, and the second author acknowledges the Australian Research Council and the National Science Council, Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan.

The challenge is commonly conceptualized as one of 'splitting' existing EU-28 obligations, namely tariff rate quotas (TRQs), between the UK and the remaining EU-27. While an intuitive response to the trading system's goal of maintaining the balance in negotiating concessions, this article questions the consistency of this approach with WTO law and reflects on the potential risks to the EU of renegotiating TRQs. The article further considers the process by which the UK will establish the post-Brexit form of its current obligations, exploring the merits and pitfalls of, on the one hand, negotiating modifications in accordance with GATT Article XXVIII and, on the other, non-negotiated certification of its revised schedules. It concludes that the UK may be prudent to seek Article XXVIII agreement with trading partners on newly articulated concessions and that the EU may be wise to leave current agricultural TRQs undisturbed. In the absence of a bilateral agreement between the UK and EU, the latter may be obliged to increase rather than reduce its quotas to remain in compliance with WTO obligations.","[Downes, Chris] European Consulting Co ECCO, Int Trade & Regulatory Affairs, Brussels, Belgium",,"Downes, C (通讯作者)，European Consulting Co ECCO, Int Trade & Regulatory Affairs, Brussels, Belgium.",chris.downes@ecco-eu.com,,,,,,,52,11,11,0,3,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

J,"Jackson, G",,,,"Jackson, Gregory",,,Socio-economics after Trump,SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"Our culture in its present sensate phase is full of irreconcilable contradictions. It proclaims equality of all human beings; and it practices an enormous number of intellectual, moral, mental, economic, political, and other equalities. It proclaims 'the equality of opportunity' in theory; in practice it provides practically none. It proclaims 'democracy of the people, for the people, and by the people'; in practice it tends to be more and more an oligarchy or a plutocracy or a dictatorship of this or that faction. It stimulates an expansion of wishes and wants, and it inhibits their satisfaction. It proclaims social security and a decent minimum of living conditions for every one, even as it is progressively destroying security for all and showing itself incapable of eliminating unemployment or of giving decent conditions to anyone. It strives to achieve the maximum of happiness for the maximum number of human beings, but it increasingly fails in that purpose. It advertises the elimination of racial, class, religious, and other group hatreds, while in fact it increasingly seethes with group antagonism of every kind: racial, national, state, religious, class and others. The unprecedented explosion of internal disturbances and wars of the twentieth century is an incontrovertible evidence of that failure. It condemns egotists of all kinds and boasts of the socialization and humanization of everything and everybody; in reality, it displays endless, unbridled greed, cruelty, egotism, and avarice of individuals as well as of groups, beginning with innumerable lobbying and pressure groups and ending throughout economic, political, occupational, religious, state, family, and other groups.

Taking into account the rapid social economic development of satellite towns, which leads to the population growth in these municipalities, it is important to ensure the well-being for their citizens. The studies have proved that society well-being is directly related to the involvement of citizens in decision-making processes. In this context, it is important to ensure the management of the municipality where citizens are playing important role. Especially, it is important in satellite towns where society participation level and local patriotism is relatively low. However, the theoretical management issues of satellite towns are not analysed properly in scientific literature. Mostly researchers focus on spatial planning of these territories. The aim of the paper is to propose possible management guidance for accompanying administrative territories of Riga based on case study approach. Within this research, the analysis of scientific publications and scientific research are carried out; qualitative and quantitative research methods, including grouping, graphic analysis, expert survey, semi-structured interviews, focus group method, and case study are applied. The main results and conclusions of the paper: based on the designed methodology on identification of accompanying administrative territories, 25 accompanying administrative territories around Riga were determined.

Lithuanian mobile market can be described as being in a maturity stage of its life-cycle: the prices and services of different mobile operators are quite similar. However, the network coverage and signal strength differs - main differences can be observed in rural areas of the country. Therefore, the scientific problem solved in the article is: what factors affect customer satisfaction with mobile operators' services in Lithuanian rural areas? The aim of this paper is to assess customer satisfaction with mobile operators' services in Lithuanian rural areas determining its antecedents and consequences. Questionnaire survey is provided to reach the aim. The research results show that the level of customer satisfaction with mobile operators' services in Lithuanian rural areas is moderate. Customer perceived quality and perceived value are found to be two most important factors affecting customer satisfaction with mobile operators' services in Lithuanian rural areas. Despite the moderate customer satisfaction, the level of customer loyalty with mobile operators' services in Lithuanian rural areas is high. Research results indicate that customer expectations and companies' image are managed properly and do not need improvement in order to enhance customer satisfaction and / or loyalty with mobile operators' services in Lithuanian rural areas.

This paper examines the growing research on gender at the World Bank as a site for the construction of a new hegemonic consensus around neoliberalism. Drawing on a computer-assisted inductive analysis of thirty-four Bank publications on gender since 2001, the paper documents Bank efforts to establish a positive relationship between gender equality and growth; shows the expansion of the Bank's definition of equality as equal opportunity; illustrates how the focus on institutions has enabled engagement with core feminist concerns, such as equality in the family; and traces how incorporating notions of women's empowerment and agency has made possible a focus on domestic violence. The paper concludes by emphasizing the ambiguous effects of the Bank's new neoliberalism, which continues to use the market as the arbiter of social values while providing openings for feminist agendas.","[Prugl, Elisabeth] Grad Inst Polit Sci, Chemin Eugene Rigot 2,CP 136, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland",,"Prugl, E (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Polit Sci, Chemin Eugene Rigot 2,CP 136, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland.",elisabeth.pruegl@graduateinstitute.ch,"Prügl, Elisabeth/I-5284-2019","Prügl, Elisabeth/0000-0002-4363-3540",Swiss National Science Foundation,Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"Research for this article was carried out in the context of a collaborative research project on gender experts and gender expertise funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

We combine detailed meso-level information on the regional socioeconomic structure with official elections results.

It is now open for the signature of the ESCAP Member States till September 2017. As the most recent UN treaty on trade and development, the Framework Agreement will be an important development as well as a complement to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation (WTO TFA), which is effective since February 2017. The Framework Agreement creates unprecedentedly the new multilateral legal framework for facilitation of cross-border paperless trade. While maintaining the balance between international trade efficiency, transparency, regulatory compliance and development stimulation, the Framework Agreement crafts the legal mechanisms to harmonize the Member States' national paperless trade facilities through implementing a common set of the general principles and the relevant international standards and legal instruments. Most significantly, the Framework Agreement creatively enables cross-border mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents in electronic form through its institutional arrangement and supporting operational mechanisms. The Framework Agreement also provides a dedicated intergovernmental platform for capacity building and technical assistance to enable developing countries (including the least-developed countries and landlocked developing countries) to benefit from paperless trade facilitation. The Framework Agreement will open up the new possibilities for trade facilitation and is particularly important for the development of cross-border e-commerce and global digital economy. Its impact and influence will not only be felt in Asia-Pacific region but in the whole world. There has been very few substantive research on this newest treaty law. The Author who has been the primary legal advisor of UNESCAP for the initial research, drafting, negotiation and implementation of the Framework Agreement since 2011 is able to provide the insights on both the legal texts and the in-depth designs of the Agreement.","[Xue, Hong] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Internet Policy & Law, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Hong] United Nations Commiss Int Trade Law UNCITRAL & B, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Hong] Chinese Natl Peoples Congress Draft E Commerce La, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Hong] United Nations Network Experts Paperless Trade &, Advisory Comm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Hong] Legal Panel UNNExT, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Xue, H (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Internet Policy & Law, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Xue, H (通讯作者)，United Nations Commiss Int Trade Law UNCITRAL & B, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Xue, H (通讯作者)，Chinese Natl Peoples Congress Draft E Commerce La, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Xue, H (通讯作者)，Legal Panel UNNExT, Beijing, Peoples R China.",hong_xue@hotmail.com,,,,,,,0,0,0,2,25,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Strategic leadership, the embodiment of the strategic control ability of the enterprise, is closely related to the steady and rapid development of enterprises. Lacking of strategic leadership at the top of the enterprise has become a common phenomenon all over the word. And China is one of them. Based on the analogy of Lorentz force and strategic leadership in physics, this paper establishes the analogy logic of strategic leadership-the physical force-Lorentz force. The influencing factors of strategic leadership are divided from a three-dimensional perspective resource base, dynamic capability and competitive environment. And then, based on the physics formula of Lorentz force, the model of influence factor of strategic leadership is constructed, and the model is verified by regression analysis of data. By the analyzing the results, the conclusion is that resource base, dynamic capability and strategic leadership are positively correlated, and the competitive environment is negatively correlated with strategic leadership. According to the conclusion, the strategy of cultivating and improving strategic leadership can be used for enterprises as a reference.","[Yang, Linwei] Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Yang, LW (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",walcjngu@163.com,,,"National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDC022, 17BGL209]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373199]",National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 15ZDC022, Grant No. 17BGL209) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71373199).",,7,0,0,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-442-2,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2017,156.0,,,,,,411,414,,,,,,4,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BJ6GD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426646800102,0

These problems are rooted in current economic and ecological crises, such as poverty, unemployment, forced migration, brain drain, social inequality or environmental destruction. This article focuses on the EU and national policies that have the potential to support Social Innovation in rural areas and maps possible future policy efforts in this regard. However, many of the policies that we find to have potential for possible effective social innovation support do not have much in common concerning their targets. In consequence, the article outlines a threefold typology for categorizing the different policy targets that have impacts on social innovation in rural areas: (i) policies targeting vulnerable social groups, (ii) policies targeting societal challenges at large and (iii) policies targeting the participatory inclusion of civil society. In addition we outline enabling and hindering policy factors for social innovation and we apply the threefold typology to the example of forest policy. The conceptual framework in combination with the forest policy objectives we identify provides a useful basis for further research in this area.","[Ludvig, Alice; Weiss, Gerhard; Zivojinovic, Ivana] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, BOKU, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Ludvig, Alice; Weiss, Gerhard; Zivojinovic, Ivana] Reg Off Cent & Eastern European Countries, European Forest Inst, EFICEEC, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Sarkki, Simo] Univ Oulu, Cultural Anthropol, POB 1000, Oulu 90014, Finland; [Nijnik, Maria] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; University of Oulu; James Hutton Institute","Ludvig, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, BOKU, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.;Ludvig, A (通讯作者)，Reg Off Cent & Eastern European Countries, European Forest Inst, EFICEEC, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",alice.ludvig@boku.ac.at,"Zivojinovic, Ivana/C-6830-2019; Nijnik, Maria/AAW-4987-2020; Ludvig, Alice/ABF-3048-2020","Zivojinovic, Ivana/0000-0001-9900-7066; Nijnik, Maria/0000-0003-0280-9543; Ludvig, Alice/0000-0003-1323-2276; Sarkki, Simo/0000-0002-7790-0600",European Commission from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [677622]; Scottish Government,European Commission from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Scottish Government,"The research was conducted within the project on Social Innovation in Marginalised Rural Areas (SIMRA).

These schools (and their parents) have been willing and able to respond to the dire state of air quality, by implementing defensive procedures (thresholds for outdoor play) and capital (air-tight windows and central air-conditioned filtration systems). Even in this setting, we find substantial heterogeneity in the response to ambient PM2.5. Pollution sensitivity is stronger among US/Canadian/European than Chinese, children who miss school the most, and a minority of children who depart within one year of arrival, but overall is modest compared to estimates for the US. This suggests that to some extent the school response can substitute, through defensive behavior, for the absence response. We offer a benchmark for school administrators in polluted middle-income countries, yet caution that more research is needed on the long-term implications of PM2.5 exposure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the reform raised the minimum working age from 14 to 16, while the age for compulsory education remained at 14 until 1990. To study the effects of this change on the incentives to work or study, we consider the different alternatives available at age 14 to individuals born at various times of the year before and after the reform. Before the reform, individuals born at the beginning of the year were legally able to work before finishing compulsory education. We show that individuals born at the beginning of the year were more likely to complete both compulsory and post-compulsory education if they turned 14 after the reform. The increase in educational attainment translates into better labor market outcomes in adulthood only partially. Depending on the level of socioeconomic development of the region, we provide evidence of differential impacts of the reform on men and women and offer plausible explanations for these differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that, apart from increases in educational attainment, also finds relevant effects on long-term labor market outcomes from child labor regulations that forbid teenager work. We show that this type of regulation can be a generator of economic development and point to the conditions required for this to be the case.","[Del Rey, Elena] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Jimenez-Martin, Sergi] Barcelona Gse, Barcelona, Spain; [Vall Castello, Judit] Univ Pompeii Fabra, Univ Barcelona & Cres, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Vall Castello, Judit] Univ Pompeii Fabra, Univ Barcelona & Cres, Inst Econ Barcelona Ieb, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics,"Castello, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeii Fabra, Univ Barcelona & Cres, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain.;Castello, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeii Fabra, Univ Barcelona & Cres, Inst Econ Barcelona Ieb, Barcelona, Spain.",judit.vall@upf.edu,"Del Rey, Elena/F-2563-2016; Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/D-6744-2013","Del Rey, Elena/0000-0001-7644-4490; Jimenez-Martin, Sergi/0000-0002-7393-9612; Vall castello, Judit/0000-0002-1925-1657",,,,,30,4,4,1,17,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0272-7757,1873-7382,,ECON EDUC REV,Econ.

The success of REDD + in preventing deforestation and degradation in dry forests will depend partly on whether financial incentives for forest conservation can cover smallholders' opportunity costs of forgone uses of the forest. We therefore compared the opportunity costs of the main forest use activities (slash-and-burn agriculture or charcoal production) with potential benefits from the sale of carbon credits under REDD + from a smallholder perspective for a case study in southwestern Madagascar. Calculations are based on an assessment of carbon stocks in the dry spiny forests as well as benefit and cost data from interviews with smallholders. To assess the risks and uncertainties associated with opportunity costs and the REDD + benefits, we used a Monte Carlo modeling approach. We compare net present values for opportunity costs and potential community profits from REDD + at discount rates of 5% and 20% over a project period of 25 years. Our results show that REDD + community profits can outweigh the profits from charcoal production and the profits from slash-and-burn agriculture in 54-57% of the cases, despite opportunity costs being highly variable for both land uses. Charcoal production in particular has low opportunity costs as smallholders only engage in this activity when no other sources of income are available. The case study shows that potential REDD + payments can provide sufficient financial incentives to preserve dry forests with low carbon stocks but relatively low opportunity costs of preservation.","[Neudert, Regina; Waetzold, Frank] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Chair Environm Econ, Postbox 101344, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany; [Olschofsky, Konstantin; Kuebler, Daniel; Prill, Laura; Koehl, Michael] Univ Hamburg, Inst World Forestry, Leuschnerstr 91, D-21031 Hamburg, Germany; [Neudert, Regina] Greifswald Univ, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, Soldmannstr 15, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus; University of Hamburg,"Neudert, R (通讯作者)，Greifswald Univ, Inst Bot & Landscape Ecol, Soldmannstr 15, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",regina.neudert@uni-greifswald.de,"Watzold, Frank/F-3122-2015; Olschofsky, Konstantin/C-8585-2018","Watzold, Frank/0000-0002-4664-0113; Kubler, Daniel/0000-0001-6660-0592; Olschofsky, Konstantin/0000-0002-7289-984X","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of a project on sustainable land management of the Mahafaly Plateau [SuLaMa] [01LL0914G, 01LL0914A]",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of a project on sustainable land management of the Mahafaly Plateau [SuLaMa],"The study was carried out under the 'Accord de Collaboration' between the Universities of Antananarivo, Hamburg and Cottbus.

This paper discusses whether Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) should be researched, on the controversial ethical assumption that reducing existential risk is overwhelmingly morally important. On the one hand, SAI could eliminate the environmental existential risks of climate change (arguably around a 1% chance of catastrophe), and reduce the risks of interstate conflict associated with extreme warming. Moreover, the risks of termination shock and unilateral deployment are overstated. On the other hand, SAI introduces risks of interstate conflict which are very difficult to quantify. Research into these security risks would be valuable, but also risks reducing willingness to mitigate. I conclude that the decision about whether to research SAI is one of 'deep uncertainty' or 'complex cluelessness', but that there is a tentative case for research initially primarily focused on the governance and security aspects of SAI.","[Halstead, John] 58 Geldeston Rd, London E5 8SB, England",,"Halstead, J (通讯作者)，58 Geldeston Rd, London E5 8SB, England.",john@founderspledge.com,,,,,,,73,17,17,2,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-3287,1873-6378,,FUTURES,Futures,SEP,2018,102.0,,,,SI,,63,77,,10.1016/j.futures.2018.03.004,0.0,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Public Administration,GS4ZR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443666900007,0

Using the Global Forest Products Model, multiple replications of projections were carried out with parameters or initial condition data sampled randomly from their assumed distribution. The results showed that parameter uncertainty led to uncertainty of the projections increasing steadily with the time horizon, and more rapidly than the uncertainty stemming from initial conditions. Among the parameter uncertainties, those in the supply and demand elasticities tended to dominate the uncertainty in the other parameters describing forest growth, manufacturing activities, and trade inertia. In an application to impact analysis it was found that, due only to the uncertainty of the model parameters, and conditional on other assumptions, an assumed rise in global temperature of 2.8 degrees C over a century caused the forest stock in 2065 to be 2.4% to 4.0% higher in developed countries, and 2.5% to 3.9% lower in developing countries, with 68% probability, a conservative estimate of the true uncertainty given all the other factors involved in such a prediction.","[Buongiorno, Joseph; Johnston, Craig] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Buongiorno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jbuongio@wisc.edu,,,USDA Forest Service [17-JV-11330143-087],USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service),"The research leading to this paper was supported in part by USDA Forest Service Joint Venture Agreement17-JV-11330143-087, in cooperation with project leader Jeff Prestemon.",,29,11,12,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,AUG,2018,93.0,,,,,,10,17,,10.1016/j.forpol.2018.05.006,0.0,,,8,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,GM5LY,,hybrid,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438180100002,0

If demonstrated to be effective, financial incentives could be proposed as part of health care interventions to help pregnant smokers quit. Public acceptability is important; as such interventions could be publicly funded. Concerns remain about the acceptability of these interventions in the general population. We aimed to assess the acceptability of financial incentives to reward pregnant smokers who stop smoking using a survey conducted in the UK and then subsequently in France, two developed countries with different cultural and social backgrounds. More French than British respondents agreed with financial incentives for rewarding quitting smoking during pregnancy, not smoking after delivery, keeping a smoke-free household, health service payment for meeting target and the maximum amount of the reward.

It mainly focuses on the Nobel Prize winning economist James McGill Buchanan and the industrialist Charles Koch. Business groups provided funds to Buchanan and others to train right-minded people in the precepts of Neoliberalism, established think tanks and institutes to disseminate their views, and directed' and/or provided advice and draft legislation for Republican politicians at both the state and federal level. Inspiration for how to achieve this Neoliberal revolution' can be found in Lenin's 1902 What is to be Done?. The Neoliberal attack on government and statism is consistent with Orwell's notion of doublethink. It constitutes a weakening of those parts of the state which are inimical to the interests of a wealthy oligarchy, the federal government and agencies/government departments who are viewed as imposing costs (taxes) on and interfering with (regulating) the actions of the oligarchy, and strengthening other parts such as state governments, the judiciary, at both the state (especially) and federal level and police forces to protect and advance their interests.","[Dabscheck, Braham] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Dabscheck, B (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",bdabsche@bigpond.net.au,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

We also aim to find out whether the GMS drug costs of high and low income cohorts respond similarly to changes in their health status. The paper projects GMS drug costs in 2026 and examines the separate cost of population ageing and population growth over the period. We also aim to simulate the estimated model to show how much giving free prescription drugs to all persons aged 'under 5' would add to 2026 GMS drug costs, and also how much giving universal GMS coverage to all persons in 2026 would add to 2026 GMS drug costs. We construct a multivariate logistic regression model of GMS community drug costs in Ireland. We progress the methodology used in earlier studies by explicitly modelling how regional incomes and regional health status interact in determining GMS drug costs in Ireland. An age cohort and region breakdown of the simulated GMS drug costs, of both projected demographic trends and public policy measures that have been adopted or are under consideration, are also investigated. We find that GMS drug costs depend on age-but not gender-on income, health status, community drug scheme coverage rates, and they are significantly lower for all age cohorts in Donegal and the North West region. The GMS drug costs of high income cohorts tend to increase as their health status improves, whereas they tend to decrease as the health status of low income cohorts improves. A uniform 1% gain in health status has little impact on total GMS prescribing costs. Similarly, if the health status of all Irish regions improved to match that of the East region in 2010 it would only have reduced public prescription costs by around 32 a,notsign million of the 1.8 a,notsign billion GMS drugs bill. We find that giving free prescription drugs to all persons aged 'under 5' in 2010 would have only a minor impact on 2010 GMS drug costs, whereas giving universal GMS coverage to all persons would have doubled public prescription costs from 1.8 a,notsign billion to circa 3.6 a,notsign billion.","[Kenneally, Martin] Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Policy Studies, Cork, Ireland; [Lynch, Brenda] Univ Coll Cork, Dept Publ Hlth & Epidemiol, Cork, Ireland",University College Cork; University College Cork,"Lynch, B (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Cork, Dept Publ Hlth & Epidemiol, Cork, Ireland.",m.kenneally@ucc.ie; brendalynch@ucc.ie,,"Lynch, Brenda/0000-0002-6620-5688",,,,,24,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Piloting is a way to raise awareness of REDD+ and its likely practice in the future. The impacts of piloting schemes on likely adoption of REDD+ among participating households and whether those households are fully aware of REDD+ goal are not fully understood in a range of contexts. This paper examines the likely adoption of REDD+ in community forests and factors affecting respondent's knowledge of REDD+ goal using post-piloting survey of 600 households from two watersheds in Nepal. Controlling for respondent, household, and community forest-related characteristics, the logistic regression results indicate that the factors affecting respondent's knowledge of REDD + goal include respondent's age, economic status of the household, and the proportion of firewood and fodder needs contributed by private land. Moreover, over 95% of the surveyed households were willing to adopt REDD+ in their community forests. These results have implications on design and implementation of future REDD+ policy and projects to generate global climate change benefits from the management of forests at a local level.","[Pandit, Ram] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Pandit, R (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",ram.pandit@uwa.edu.au,,"Pandit, Ram/0000-0003-4053-5694","Institute for World Forestry, Hamburg, Germany","Institute for World Forestry, Hamburg, Germany","I would like to thank all survey respondents for their information and time.

Despite a large number of studies investigating the Teach For America (TFA) effect on math and English achievement, little is known about non-tested academic outcomes. Using administrative data from Miami-Dade County Public Schools, we investigate the relationship between being in a TFA classroom and five non-test student outcomes commonly found in administrative datasets: days absent, days suspended, GPA, classes failed, and grade repetition. We validate our use of non-test student academic outcomes to assess differences in teacher productivity using the quasi-experimental teacher switching methods of Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2014) and fail to reject the null hypothesis of unbiasedness in most cases in elementary and middle school, although in some cases standard errors are large. We find suggestive evidence that students taught by TFA teachers in elementary and middle schools were less likely to miss school due to unexcused absences and suspensions compared with students taught by non-TFA teachers in the same school, although point estimates are very small. Other outcomes were found to be forecast-unbiased but showed no evidence of a TFA effect.","[Backes, Ben] Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC 20007 USA; [Hansen, Michael] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",American Institutes for Research; Brookings Institution,"Backes, B (通讯作者)，Amer Inst Res, Washington, DC 20007 USA.",bbackes@air.org; mhansen@brookings.edu,,"Hansen, Michael/0009-0006-8752-2750",John S. and James L.

However, a price on carbon also collects rents from underlying fossil resource stocks, giving rise to unexamined macroeconomic effects. This article shows that if these stocks are tradable, carbon pricing shifts aggregate investment towards alternative assets. If capital is underaccumulated, this implies lower costs of dimate policy and a welfare improvement. We prove this beneficial investment shift from fossil stocks towards capital for the case of an emission trading scheme: specifically, we show that the higher the share of auctioned permits, the larger the beneficial investment effect. The same holds for a 'stock instrument', under which the right to recurrently receive emission permits is a tradable asset, making the effect robust to trade restrictions on fossil stocks. Our main result contradicts the common perception of a trade-off between climate change mitigation policy and growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This work presents innovative educational tool developed to engaging community voices to understand food insecurity and to create local solutions. The 16 workshops inspired on the theory of the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, involved a total of 270 participants across the four case studies in remote Tanzanian villages. The results show that community voices and local problem perceptions significantly differed between the case study regions, which had a strong impact on coping strategies and nutritional status. In Morogoro, e.g., food insecurity was mainly related to conflicts. Smallholders with anemia prefer to avoid meat and milk as these products come from livestock keepers who have destroyed their crop farm production. More than 70 local diverse solutions were identified. The acceptance of the educational tools used was highly appreciated at local level compared to more conventional procedures (e.g. questionnaires). The pedagogical methods applied in this work served to raise the communities' voices, to promote consciences about communities' problems, and reframing their images of the future. The understanding of community perceptions might help with the implementation of sustainable nutrition-sensitive innovations.","[Bonatti, Michelle; Schlindwein, Izabela; Sieber, Stefan; Rybak, Constance] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Inst Socioecon, Muncheberg, Germany; [Lana, Marcos] Germany Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF eV, Inst Land Use Syst, Muncheberg, Germany; [Lana, Marcos] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bundala, Nyamizi] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Morogoro, Tanzania",Leibniz Zentrum fur Agrarlandschaftsforschung (ZALF); Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Sokoine University of Agriculture,"Bonatti, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Eberswalder Str, D-8415374 Muncheberg, Germany.",michebonatti@gmail.com,"Lana, Marcos/R-2463-2018","Lana, Marcos/0000-0002-1733-1100; Sieber, Stefan/0000-0002-4849-7277","German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), Federal Republic of Germany; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); Leibniz-Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research ZALF","German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), Federal Republic of Germany; German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Leibniz-Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research ZALF","This work - embedded in the Scale-N project (http://www.scale-n.org)-was financially supported by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), based on the decision of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Small-scale timber producers have been marginalized in the sector in the past, and the new regulations claim to provide pathways to formalization for these actors. We draw on policy analysis and field research in the central Amazon region of Peru using mixed methods to characterize smallholder on-farm timber production and evaluate the feasibility of the new regulatory mechanisms for formalizing small-scale timber producers. Through examining a case study on the production and sale of the fast-growing pioneer timber species Guazuma crinita, locally known as bolaina, we found a diversity of management practices, with the strongest reliance on natural regeneration in agricultural fallows, an informal supply chain, and no case of formal documentation at time of sale. We assessed that none of the new regulatory mechanisms will accommodate the sale of timber produced in agricultural fallow stands. We recommend the inclusion of fallow timber in the new forest plantation registry, which could result in the formalization of the supply chain and create an incentive to increase production by small-scale producers.","[Sears, Robin R.; Cronkleton, Peter; Polo Villanueva, Fredy; Miranda Ruiz, Medardo; Perez-Ojeda del Arco, Matfas] CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Av La Molina 1895, Lima, Peru; [Polo Villanueva, Fredy] Ctr Innovac Cient Amazon CINCIA, Jr Cajamarca Cuadra 1, Puerto Maldonado, Madre De Dios, Peru; [Perez-Ojeda del Arco, Matfas] Wagenigen Univ, Sociol Dev & Change Grp, UR, Droevendaalsesteeg 4, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands",CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR),"Sears, RR (通讯作者)，CIP, Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Av La Molina 1895, Lima, Peru.;Sears, RR (通讯作者)，Hampshire Coll, 893 West St, Amherst, MA 01002 USA.",robin.sears@aya.yale.edu,,"Perez-Ojeda del Arco, Matias/0000-0003-2616-4161; Sears, Robin/0000-0002-8925-1441; Cronkleton, Peter/0000-0002-3638-7417; Polo Villanueva, Fredy/0000-0002-9047-5223","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; Center for International Forestry Research as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Forest, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)","Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany; Center for International Forestry Research as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Forest, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA)(CGIAR)","This study was carried out in 2015 with the financial support of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany, and the Center for International Forestry Research as part of the CGIAR Research Program on Forest, Trees and Agroforestry (CRP-FTA).",,40,16,17,1,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1389-9341,1872-7050,,FOREST POLICY ECON,Forest Policy Econ.,FEB,2018,87.0,,,,,,49,58,,10.1016/j.forpol.2017.11.004,0.0,,,10,Economics; Environmental Studies; Forestry,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry,FU1WK,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000423640000005,0

Tree based methods, due to their non-parametric nature and flexibility, have become very popular in the last decades as an alternative to the traditional proportional hazard model. In the presented research, the conditional inference trees were used. It is the non-parametric class of regression trees that can be applied for all regression types. The goal of the analysis was the assessment of the influence of gender, age and education on the probability of exit from the registered unemployment. Due to the existence of censored observations, survival analysis methods were applied. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used for estimation of the survival function of homogeneous groups in each terminal node. The splitting criterion was the statistic of the log-rank test, which is used for comparison of survival distribution for various groups. The two most numerous forms of de-registration were considered finding a job and removal from the register for reasons attributable to the unemployed person. These forms helped to distinguish the subgroups of persons with the highest and lowest probability of de-registration to work, and resignation from the mediation of the labour office.","[Bieszk-Stolorz, Beata; Dmytrow, Krzysztof] Univ Szczecin, Inst Econometr & Stat, Dept Operat Res & Appl Math Econ, Ul Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Bieszk-Stolorz, B (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Inst Econometr & Stat, Dept Operat Res & Appl Math Econ, Ul Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",beatus@wneiz.pl; krzysztof.dmytrow@usz.edu.pl,"Dmytrów, Krzysztof/H-4659-2017; Bieszk-Stolorz, Beata/AAO-3226-2020","Dmytrów, Krzysztof/0000-0001-7657-6063; Bieszk-Stolorz, Beata/0000-0001-8086-9037",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",2545-1227,,978-83-65907-20-2,SOC ECON MODEL FOREC,,,2018,1.0,,,,,,30,39,,10.14659/SEMF.2018.01.03,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BQ1LQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000576774700003,0

Unfortunately, in the face of unstable, often diminishing spending for the analyzed goal, the hypothesis was disproved.","[Czyzewski, Bazyli] Univ Appl Sci Pila, Pila, Poland; [Matuszczak, Anna] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Czyzewski, B (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Pila, Pila, Poland.",bazylicz@interia.pl; anna.matuszczak@ue.poznan.pl,,"Matuszczak, Anna/0000-0002-5045-5447",National Science Centre in Poland [2017/25/B/HS4/00011],"National Science Centre in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)",The article was written under a project funded by the National Science Centre in Poland (Grant No 2017/25/B/HS4/00011),,10,0,0,0,2,UNIV WISMAR,WISMAR,"PHILIPP-MULLER-STRASSE 14, WISMAR, 23966, GERMANY",,,978-3-942100-56-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,295,302,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BN0CA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000472641400036,0

Bank risk is measured by both the traditional Z-score and a composite bank risk index proposed by the authors. The findings suggest that even though the riskiness of all banks from different country groups increased following the financial crisis, the magnitude of the change is not the same across groups. During the post-crisis period, banks in developed, emerging, and frontier countries experienced a smaller increase in their risk compared to their counterparts in the United States. This article provides support for the claim that banks in emerging and frontier countries have experienced the effects of the financial crisis to a lesser extent compared to those in the United States.","[Danisoglu, Seza; Guner, Z.

The reference building was designed according to the realized questionnaire survey and represents the ideas of potential customers of the construction of a family house. The goal was to evaluate the lifecycle of the house according to the design of two types of perimeter walls. Other parameters of the building were considered constant for both house solutions. We used the Envimat, software tool to evaluate the life cycle impact assessment with using available methods and input materials databases like an Ecoinvent. Both versions were also evaluated in terms of life cycle cost.","[Debnar, Marek; Jochim, Stanislav] Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Wooden Construct, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Stefko, Jozef; Potkany, Marek] Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Business Econ, Zvolen, Slovakia",,"Debnár, M (通讯作者)，Fac Wood Sci & Technol, Dept Wooden Construct, Zvolen, Slovakia.",maresmo1990@gmail.com; jochim@tuzvo.sk; stefko@tuzvo.sk; potkany@tuzvo.sk,"Potkány, Marek/E-2115-2017","Potkány, Marek/0000-0002-7477-6157",Slovak Academy of Sciences [1/0320/17],Slovak Academy of Sciences(Slovak Academy of Sciences),"We wish to thank project VEGA - Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and Slovak Academy of Sciences; (Project No.1/0320/17 Economic and Social Context of European 20/20/20 Targets from the Viewpoint of Economy Low-energy Houses).",,10,1,1,0,0,FAC FORESTRY BELGRADE UNIV,BELGRADE,"KNEZA VISESLAVA 1, BELGRADE, 11070, SERBIA",,,978-86-7299-277-9,,,,2018,,,,,,,192,199,,,,,,8,"Economics; Engineering, Manufacturing; Forestry",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Forestry,BM4XC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464293200023,0

By analyzing the existing shared express mode, the paper concludes the common business mode of shared express, and exposes some problems such as information island, imperfect identity authentication, user privacy security can not be guaranteed, and low efficiency of payment and settlement in the shared express mode. Through the research of block chain technology, a new mode of sharing express delivery based on block chain technology is constructed. It is found that the optimized block chain technology + shared express mode based on the technical characteristics of block chain can effectively solve the pain points of some industries and guarantee the efficient operation of the shared express platform.","[Ding Yuanyuan; He Xu] Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Guizhou University of Finance & Economics,"Ding, YY (通讯作者)，Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",,"Ding, Yuyan/HWQ-3664-2023; ding, Yunya/HHS-9589-2022",,,,,,7,0,0,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-642-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,290.0,,,,,,412,414,,,,,,3,Economics; Education & Educational Research,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5QX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465421000103,0
