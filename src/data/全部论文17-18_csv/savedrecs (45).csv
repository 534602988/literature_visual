One of the ways to prevent the destruction of living spaces of all living creatures; reduce consumption, production, growth, rent-stating society, industrialization, urbanization by means of neoliberal policy is to build a demand on Ecological Society and allow a creation of eco-citizenship by enabling citizens' participation.

Using a self-constructed database that includes information on foreign acquisitions in China and the accounting information of Chinese manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2007, we find that foreign acquisitions significantly improve the productivity, sales and fixed asset investment of the target firms. We address the potential endogeneity issue in the OLS estimation using the difference-in-differences technique, with two control groups, namely the would-be targets and the propensity-score-matched targets. We also find that the performance-enhancing effect of foreign acquisitions becomes stronger when larger technology gaps are observed between the acquirers and the targets. An inverted-U relationship is observed between the post-acquisition performance of the target firms and the target firm equity that is held by the foreign acquirers. The performance effects are qualitatively different among vertical, horizontal and conglomerate acquisitions.","[Liu, Qing] UIBE, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ruosi] UIBE, Sch Publ Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Larry D.] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics; University of International Business & Economics; University of Hong Kong,"Liu, Q (通讯作者)，UIBE, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,36,7,8,5,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2017,40.0,1,,,,,2,20,,10.1111/twec.12428,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EK5CJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000393944200001,0

Using extensive firm-level data we center on the key indicator of firm leverage, and reveal that substantial cross-national and cross-firm variation still persists. We first compare distributions across OECD countries and find no significant evidence of convergence over time. We then assess whether firms classified as prudent by a simple leverage threshold comprise a declining share of total financial assets over time. We find they do not, and that trajectories remain largely distinct. We do find empirical evidence of financialization convergence in two specific areas. First, there was convergence within the US and the UK in the years immediately proceeding the crisis - but not in other countries representative of stereotypical non-Anglo-American types financial systems, such as Germany and France. Second, we find convergence within the category of large, transnationally-active financial firms. Overall our results suggest that while the behavior of the world's largest globally active financial institutions is converging irrespective of home domicile, their activities are not necessarily leading to the general global homogenization of financial forms and activities implied by the financialization convergence hypothesis.","[Maxfield, Sylvia] Providence Coll, Sch Business, Providence, RI 02918 USA; [Winecoff, W.

Legislative requirements are met and extensive planning and arrangements are being made in order to engage the private sector in Iran's electricity market. As a result, an efficient and effective regulatory body for close monitoring and regulating of the market through the industry's transition is now needed more than ever. Thus the role of a well-organized and effective regulatory framework to attract and sustain private investment as well as promoting competition is inevitably central to successful implementation of privatization policies. This necessitates a comprehensive scrutiny of the existing regulatory framework of Iran's electricity market and assessing its governance in order to evaluate the performance of the regulatory body and identifying its competence or incompetence in maintaining a vibrant environment for private investment along with a healthy competitive atmosphere for participation of various firms in the industry. The electricity industry is in constant transition. From the former wave of market deregulation and liberalization to the current transition towards de-carbonization of the industry, regulatory bodies have been at the core of the efforts for organizing the energy markets and devising policies for achieving the targeted goals. The capability of electricity sector regulators in dealing with challenges of transition largely depends on the underlying regulatory governance mechanisms and this study aims to assess this crucial aspect of electricity sector regulators. Using a regulatory framework index, the governance mechanism of 20 regulatory bodies across the world is evaluated against the determined criteria. These criteria include the legal scope the regulatory body, separation of operational activities from regulatory activities and four distinct characteristics including autonomy and independence, accountability, clarity of role and objectives, and transparency and participation. The results can help governments and agencies in selection of regulatory frameworks for benchmarking.","[Mohammadi, Maryam] NRI, Tehran, Iran; [Soorani, Majid] Behsazan Mellat Co, Tehran, Iran",,"Mohammadi, M (通讯作者)，NRI, Tehran, Iran.",mmohammadi@nri.ac.ir; soorani@behsazan.com,"Soorani, Majid/R-6219-2019",,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,343,353,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300034,0

The expansion of electoral manipulation in Russia,POST-SOVIET AFFAIRS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Russia; electoral fraud; diffusion; neighborhood effect,DIFFUSION,"In this paper, we argue that the occurrence of electoral manipulation in Russia has been driven, in part, by diffusion across neighboring raions through emulation, incentives, and networks. Presumably, in Putin's Russia all local authorities have some incentives to deliver a high number of votes to United Russia, the party of power. However, the perceived pressure to deliver ever higher levels of support for Putin's party arguably increases considerably if one's raion is located in a region marked by extraordinarily high turnout and high vote share for United Russia. Conversely, the absence of perceived competition to curry executive favor through delivering votes and networks of uncorrupted local authorities, as well as local opposition organizations working to combat electoral fraud, may help explain the absence of fraud among raions located in regions marked by clean elections. Our quantitative analyses suggest that a  neighborhood effect -the existence of manipulated raions within a region -strongly influences the likelihood that raions are manipulated. Moreover, although results are more mixed, spatial autocorrelation analysis suggests that turnout levels in raions are influenced by the turnout in proximate raions.","[Moser, Robert G.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [White, Allison C.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Colorado State University,"Moser, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Govt, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",rmoser@austin.utexas.edu,,"White, Allison/0000-0001-8364-3164",American Fellowship from AAUW,American Fellowship from AAUW,Allison C.

Yet, such deep and underlying motivation has often been ignored in economic analysis where means of existence are the centre and fruit of research. It is, however, important not to confuse the means and ends. Therefore, one should not focus on the intrinsic importance of income, but rather assess it depending on what it builds, particularly lives that are worthy of living. Having a decent income helps avoid early death. Such an enterprise depends also on other characteristics, especially the organization of society, including public health, medical care, the nature of education and educational system and the scope of social cohesion and harmony, etc. The aim of the present paper is twofold: first it tries to highlight the imperfection of traditional monetary indicators as well as the difficulties to measure the different dimensions of poverty, particularly in emerging countries like Morocco. It shows that poverty is not merely an idea of inadequacy of an individual's economic means, but rather a fundamental shortage that deprivation entails: minimum adequate capability. Second, it relies on capabilities approach to explain the extent to which this approach, rather than that based on resources and focusing on income and wealth, could serve as a basis for the assessment of the level of deprivation.","[Nechad, Abdelhamid] ESCA Sch Management, Casablanca, Morocco; [Maliki, Sadik] Hassan II Univ Casablanca, Sch Humanities, Casablanca, Morocco",Hassan II University of Casablanca,"Nechad, A (通讯作者)，ESCA Sch Management, Casablanca, Morocco.",nechad22@yahoo.fr; Sadikmaliki@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,319,329,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300032,0

Within a decade, the other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) - the Asian, African, Inter-American Development Banks, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the rest of the World Bank Group would too. The creation of these accountability mechanisms embodies a norm of 'accountability as justice' that provides recourse for damaging behaviour through a formal sanctioning process. This article makes two arguments: first, the United States built on its history of using 'accountability as control' to advocate using accountability for justice for the MDBs during debates over maintaining their efficiency and effectiveness. As the predominant MDB shareholder, the United States used its power (of the purse) and influence (through its voice and vote) to garner support for the norm despite opposition from borrowers and the Banks. Second, the United States had to resort to these same levers to demand the MDBs reformulate the mechanisms when borrower resistance and Bank avoidance hindered their effectiveness. The United States successfully created the norm but Bank recalcitrance meant the United States had to use the same levers to ensure its effectiveness. The article concludes that change within the Banks is evident but incremental: the spread of the norm amongst the MDBs has changed their governance to include recourse for project affected people with structures in place to strengthen them over time.","[Park, Susan] Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney,"Park, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Govt & Int Relat, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",susan.park@sydney.edu.au,"Park, Susan/C-8715-2013","Park, Susan/0000-0001-7932-1525",Australian Research Council [DP140100868],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Australian Research Council [grant number DP140100868].,,78,16,18,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

IT companies will reach that by designing a message that resonates with customer needs, leading to a lower cost of acquisition through online channels and to increased revenue. As a result of this research, it is proposed a platform that can be used by IT companies with the aim to maintain a strong relationship with existing and potential customers. This platform will ensure their safety and availability by maintaining a focus on costumer's satisfaction. The IT companies will gain their customer's loyalty and an excellent recommendation on the future. IT companies have usually their focus on developing products and software and often they pass over the marketing strategies suitable for promoting their work. Considering the technical profile and interests often found among IT people, more and more IT companies require leaders to build social strategies of business. The ideal employee today should be able to cope with fast changes and meet the challenges required by the company's clients. Therefore, they should have a perspective on people beyond the business objectives of communication, marketing and accountability. For implementing an online marketing strategy it is important to invest heavily in the validation of product market. Most developers of IT products and services are tempted to substitute their own experience and needs with the end customer's. Thus, the emphasis will be on quality, relevance, and design of the posts, the added value they bring to the work and company's productivity. The structure and content of the social platform will account for performance management, as it can help to streamline processes and procedures within the company. It can also improve customer service and the products according to their requirements, even if there will be changes along the way.","[Purcarea, Anca; Popescu, Mirona; Gheorghe, Simona] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Entrepreneurship Business Engn & Management, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest,"Purcarea, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Entrepreneurship Business Engn & Management, Bucharest, Romania.",apurcarea@gmail.com,"Popescu, Mirona Ana-Maria/AAT-5857-2020",,,,,,6,1,1,0,10,TRAUNER VERLAG,LINZ,"KOGLSTR 14, 4020 LINZ, AUSTRIA",,,978-3-99062-119-6,SCHRIFTEN INFORMATIK,,,2017,46.0,,,,,,201,208,,,,,,8,Economics; Information Science & Library Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BJ2HL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000419365600023,0

The use of ICT solutions is visible in each area of the functioning of enterprises, in particular in activities aimed at promotion of products and services. The aim of all promotional activities is to exercise influence on the current and future customers of a company. They involve providing customers with information to increase their knowledge about the products and services and the company itself. In today's digital economic life, in order to reach potential customers and retain the existing ones, companies have to observe and quickly adapt ICT solutions. Key ICT solutions include social media, which have had a significant impact on both the social and economic life. The growing number of social media users contributed to changes in the form and way of communicating and building mutual relations. Moreover, the final say on many issues belongs more and more often to people for whom Internet communication is an integral part of life, which undoubtedly is a clear signal that preferences of today's and future consumers are undergoing a diametrical change. This change in consumers' preferences, expectations and needs forces enterprises to use effective ways of communication and new forms of providing information to a specific target group. Social media users constitute an increasing group that often actively joins promotional activities undertaken by a company. In addition, the social media environment enables presentation of information that is characterised by high quality, elaborate content and interesting form (text, photos, animation or films). These are only some of the factors in favour of the use of social media in the promotional activity of enterprises. However, the modern reality as well as extended functionality and variety of social media are on the one hand conducive to building and maintaining relations with customers, while on the other hand, they requires appropriate preparation of a strategy of action in a new, virtual economic world. The aim of the paper is to analyse, based on literature studies, the assumptions of enterprises' strategies of action in the social media environment, with particular reference to fanpage. Based on the results of own studies of a group of 172 Polish users of social media conducted at the end of 2015, key actions taken by users on fanpages were indicated, and significant elements influencing the proper structure of fanpage from the user's perspective were presented.","[Smolag, Klaudia] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Al Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland; [Lemanska-Majdzik, Anna] Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Dabrowskiego 69, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland",Technical University Czestochowa; Technical University Czestochowa,"Smolag, K (通讯作者)，Czestochowa Tech Univ, Fac Management, Al Armii Krajowej 19B, PL-42201 Czestochowa, Poland.",klaudia.smolag@op.pl,"Lemańska-Majdzik, Anna/T-3280-2018","Lemańska-Majdzik, Anna/0000-0003-3484-3498; Smolag, Klaudia/0000-0001-8875-9836",,,,,20,0,0,1,4,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,211,224,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.658,0.0,,,14,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200016,0

In contrast to studies that have analyzed the role of state policies and informal relations in promoting industrialization, we focus on how myriad shop owners gain access to elite-controlled, privatized urban infrastructure through owner-tenant relations in a new market economy. Drawing upon original interviews with Bishkek-based shop owners, we find that despite the challenges associated working in these spaces, including poor infrastructure and exploitative relationships with owners, they remain due to the constant provision of electricity and convenient location. We contribute to understanding how everyday shop owners make sense of and grapple with production challenges in a new market context, against the backdrop of Soviet infrastructural legacies and post-Soviet privatization processes.","[Spector, Regine A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Botoeva, Aisalkyn] Brown Univ, Dept Sociol, Providence, RI 02912 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Brown University,"Spector, RA (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rspector@polsci.umass.edu,,,"University of Massachusetts, Amherst","University of Massachusetts, Amherst","This work was supported by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",,61,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

However, foreign aid suspensions often occur in strategically important countries, and donors respond differently to different types of political transgressions within the same county. To shed light on this puzzle, in this article, I present evidence from an original survey of top-level donor representatives in 20 African countries, including a list experiment designed to elicit truthful responses about the conditions under which donors are willing to suspend foreign aid. I argue that the likelihood of a foreign aid suspension depends not only on the strategic considerations of the donor government, but also on the institutional incentives of the donor agency. A donor agency's institutional incentives are shaped by the agency's organizational design, as well as by its foreign aid portfolio in the recipient country.","[Swedlund, Haley J.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Ctr Conflict Anal & Management, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Swedlund, HJ (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Ctr Conflict Anal & Management, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",,,,"Research Executive Agency, European Commission (CIG) [322228]","Research Executive Agency, European Commission (CIG)","Research Executive Agency, European Commission (CIG #322228).",,100,30,35,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The very existence of business cycles is quite controversial. When we add the problem of economic performance to the issue of synchronization between different sets of countries, we come to the subject of our study. In this paper, we deal with the existence as well as the synchronization of business cycles. The synchronization is studied using the spectral analysis. The spectral analysis explores the cyclical patterns of data, and its main purpose is to decompose original series into an infinite sum of periodic functions, each of which has a different frequency. The advantage and uniqueness of spectral analysis are that it enables the identification and characterization of nonlinear trends and the dominant cycle, including perennial and seasonal components which characterize each time series. The aim of this paper is to determine the existence of the business cycle and evaluate the synchronization process within the EU member states. By studying the data on the gross domestic product and related macroeconomic variables for the EU countries, we offer some conclusions on the nature of business cycle synchronization, cyclical regularities, and macroeconomic interdependence.","[Tomic, Daniel; Stjepanovic, Sasa] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradovica 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Tomic, D (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Preradovica 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",dtomic@unipu.hr; sstjepan@unipu.hr,"Tomić, Daniel/N-7647-2019; Stjepanović, Saša/AAL-4337-2020; Tomić, Daniel/AAD-8845-2020","Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096; Stjepanović, Saša/0000-0003-1938-3681; Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096",Croatian Science Foundation [9481],Croatian Science Foundation,"This work has been fully supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project number 9481 Modelling Economic Growth - Advanced Sequencing and Forecasting Algorithm.

We can observe this phenomenon in the field of the business decisions where the bounded rationality was recognized by Herbert Simon (1982). Nowadays Simon's thesis has just been turning into smart decisions. What makes a business decision smart and whether we can support this kind of decisions efficiently at SMEs or not? The actuality of these questions comes from the fact that we can recognize a paradigm shift much less in the field of business making than in the info-communication in the last few decades. Experts are convinced that in the field of decision supporting there is an upcoming paradigm shift whose main point is that the models, based on the allocation of scarcity resources, have lost their relevance in the time of abundance, more precisely they have over-swelled their domain (Velencei, Baracskai, 2016). So studies and researches show that in the time of abundance the keys to a smarter complex decision making are the behavioural patterns which can be recognized by for example knowledge-based expert systems. According to Daniel Kahneman, as one of the most respected behavioural economists, the model of intuitive decision-making, as pattern recognition, is a further developed form of Herbert Simon's thesis (Kahneman, 2011). C.K. Prahalad and Gary Hamel ask the question in the prestigious Strategic Management Journal (Prahalad, Hamel, 1994) Why search for a new paradigm? Actually why is a new management paradigm necessary? Probably we will see the innovations in another way through new eyes and perhaps we can support the intuitive decisions not only at large enterprises but also at small and medium ones by these knowledge-bases and patterns in them.","[Toth-Haasz, Gabriella] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, SZEEDs Doctoral Program, Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Toth-Haasz, G (通讯作者)，Szechenyi Istvan Univ, SZEEDs Doctoral Program, Gyor, Hungary.",gabi.haasz@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,641,648,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000067,0

However, excessive irrigation extractions where groundwater is slowly renewed are causing a widespread depletion of the aquifer systems, with the impacts of climate change expected to further exacerbate this problem. These circumstances call for the development of methodologies and analyses that can support the design of sustainable groundwater management policies. This paper presents a hydro-economic mathematical programming model that is used to evaluate the effects of different policy measures for reducing aquifer depletion in the Cap-Bon region of Tunisia. Three policies have been evaluated: a quota defining the maximum quantity of groundwater extractions, environmental taxation, and supply expansion with subsidized desalinated seawater. Overall, results highlight the economic and social tradeoffs among these different policy choices and the challenges facing the implementation of sustainable groundwater management in Tunisia. More speccally, results show the advantages of using subsidized desalinated seawater compared to the other two policy alternatives in terms of the value of agricultural production, farmers' profits, and employment, despite of its sizeable budgetary burden.","[Chebil, Ali] INRGREF, Ariana, Tunisia; [Kahil, Taher] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Oueslati, Bilel] Fac Econ & Management Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Chebil, A (通讯作者)，INRGREF, Ariana, Tunisia.",chebila@yahoo.es,,"Kahil, Taher/0000-0002-7812-5271; Chebil, Ali/0000-0002-2931-4762",,,,,45,2,2,1,6,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2018,17.0,4,,,,,33,44,,10.30682/nm1804c,0.0,,,12,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HJ8ZC,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457487600004,0

To investigate the effect of economic status on transport mobility, we examined the travel behaviour of Hong Kong's older population from a socio-spatial-temporal perspective. We paid special attention to older people's economic activity status and examined whether this variable would significantly affect an older adult's transport mobility. Using the 2011 Hong Kong Travel Characteristics Survey (TCS), we categorised out-of-home trips into three types: mandatory, maintenance and discretionary. The Poisson and linear regression models were used to estimate the number of trips and travel duration, respectively. Separate models were estimated for different departure times over the course of a day. We found that the travel mobility of older people in Hong Kong was not significantly lower compared with younger people. The steep decline in mobility with ageing as shown in the Western experience was not found in our study. On the other hand, some older people associated with certain socio-economic and geographic characteristics were found to face potential spatial barriers in fulfilling their mobility needs during certain periods of the day. From these findings, a series of implications has been determined to inform policy-makers about the potential need to provide special transit services to cater for the out-of-home needs of employed and unemployed older people. As ageing is becoming a global challenge for many world cities, this research may serve as a reference from an Asian perspective.","[He, Sylvia Y.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geog & Resource Management, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cheung, Yannie H.

It also estimates short-run and long-run elasticity of gasoline demand with respect to its price and GDP. Johansen-Juselius and ARDL bounds test methods establish that gasoline demand, gasoline price and GDP are cointegrated. Regime shift cointegration tests with endogenous structural breaks, on the other hand, ascertain cointegration between gasoline demand and GDP. Gasoline demand is found to be highly elastic with respect to real income and real price in the long-run. However, in the short-run, price is inelastic. The study deviates from previous studies in two important aspects. First, price is found to be elastic in the long-run as opposed to being inelastic in both short term and long term as established in the previous studies. Second, income elasticity has declined in magnitude. These findings are quite intriguing and are consistent with policy changes in the Indian economy. The Toda-Yamamoto version of Granger causality tests establishes long-term unidirectional causality from real income to gasoline consumption. The study discusses possible reasons behind the empirical findings, and finally, a set of policy prescriptions are suggested to reduce the consumption of gasoline, which should have no adverse impact on economy in the long-run.","[Kanjilal, Kakali] IMI, Qualitat Tech & Operat, Qutab Inst Area, Room 501,B-0, New Delhi 110016, India; [Ghosh, Sajal] MDI, Econ, Room C-10,Scholar Bldg,Mehrauli Rd, Sukhrali 122001, Gurgaon, India",International Management Institute (IMI) New Delhi; Management Development Institute (MDI),"Ghosh, S (通讯作者)，MDI, Econ, Room C-10,Scholar Bldg,Mehrauli Rd, Sukhrali 122001, Gurgaon, India.",kakali@imi.edu; sghosh@mdi.ac.in,"Kanjilal, Kakali/JYP-2690-2024","Kanjilal, Kakali/0000-0002-1467-0000",,,,,56,13,13,1,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This article argues that occupational change is also shaped by labour supply - particularly education and immigration - and institutions. Polarisation therefore represents just one scenario of occupational change. Our study of Ireland and Switzerland examines long-term change in the employment structure (1970-2010), using census data and an encompassing definition of the labour force. Results show no simple trend of occupational upgrading morphing into polarisation. Occupational upgrading occurred in both countries, with the largest employment gains in high-paid occupations and the largest losses in low-paid ones. Patterns of occupational change largely aligned with the evolution of labour supply, upgrading in the 1990s and 2000s being driven in both countries by higher educated women. Immigration supplied labour for low-end and mid-level jobs in Ireland during the Celtic Tiger era, and for low-paid occupations in Switzerland during the 1980s.","[Murphy, Emily C.] Univ Oxford, Dept Educ, Ctr Skills Knowledge & Org Performance SKOPE, Oxford, England; [Oesch, Daniel] Univ Lausanne, Life Course & Inequal Res Ctr LINES, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Oxford; University of Lausanne,"Oesch, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, LIVES Swiss Natl Ctr Competence Res, Life Course & Inequal Res Ctr LINES, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",daniel.oesch@unil.ch,"Daniel, Oesch/C-2243-2016","Daniel, Oesch/0000-0003-1704-853X; Murphy, Emily C./0000-0003-3063-455X",Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research 'LIVES - Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives' - Swiss National Science Foundation [51NF40-160590],Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research 'LIVES - Overcoming vulnerability: Life course perspectives' - Swiss National Science Foundation,"Data used in this article were made available by the Swiss Federal Statistics Office, the Central Statistics Office Ireland, the Irish Social Science Data Archive, and the Minnesota Population Center, none of whom bear any responsibility for the analysis or interpretation of the data reported here.

In this context, face-to-face surveys were conducted with small-scale fishermen during the 2016-2017 fishing season and so these fisherman's input usage, total revenue structures and socio-economic and demographic characteristics were determined. Data Envelopment Analysis method was applied to determine the economic efficiency levels of small-scale fisheries and extreme levels of input use was demonstrated. In addition, a Tobit Regression Model was applied to detect the factors causing the inefficiency of these small-scale fishers. The results of the analysis reveal that the average economic efficiency levels of the small-scale fishermen operating in the research area under the variable return to scale are 0.64. According to the results, it is possible to realize the same output performance when the fishers' use of inputs is reduced by 36.1%. The main inputs leading to inefficiency in the output performance of small-scale fishers are determined as vessel maintenance expenditures (15.4%), fishing gear repair or purchase expenditures (12.3%) and labour costs (12%). In addition, Tobit Analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between the economic efficiency results and the socio-economic and demographic situation of small-scale fishermen. According to this, household size, working hours and vessel ownership factors causes economic inefficiency on the focused fishermen.","[Sangun, Levent; Guney, Osman Inanc] Univ Cukurova, Vocat Sch Adana, Adana, Turkey; [Berk, Ali] Minist Food Agr & Livestock, GTHB, Gen Directorate Agr Reform, Ankara, Turkey","Cukurova University; Ministry of Food, Agriculture & Livestock - Turkey; Gida Tarim Ve Hayvancilik Bakanligi","Güney, OI (通讯作者)，Univ Cukurova, Vocat Sch Adana, Adana, Turkey.",inancguney@gmail.com,"BERK, Ali/N-9752-2018","BERK, Ali/0000-0003-3912-9656","Scientific Research Projects Unit of the University of Cukurova, Turkey [FBA-2016-2649]","Scientific Research Projects Unit of the University of Cukurova, Turkey","This research was derived from the FBA-2016-2649 project, which was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Unit of the University of Cukurova, Turkey.",,20,8,9,2,12,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2018,17.0,4,,,,,71,80,,10.30682/nm1804f,0.0,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HJ8ZC,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000457487600007,0

The substitution effects of HSR are the most significant on short- and medium-haul (below 1000 km) air routes while introducing HSR services has encouraged long distance (over 1000 km) air travels in Mainland China. The complementary effect is investigated in the context of air-HSR integration, which has significantly positive impacts on airport enplanement at primary hub airports when fitted with on-site HSR links. The benefit is limited at secondary hubs and regional airports possibly by locations and HSR service frequencies.","[Zhang, Fangni] Univ New South Wales, Fac Sci, Sch Aviat, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Graham, Daniel J.; Wong, Mark Siu Chun] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of New South Wales Sydney; Imperial College London,"Graham, DJ (通讯作者)，Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",d.j.graham@imperial.ac.uk,"Graham, Daniel/AAA-6157-2021; Zhang, Fangni/M-5883-2019; Zhang, Fangni/AAU-4309-2021","Graham, Daniel/0000-0002-6971-8737; Zhang, Fangni/0000-0003-3584-4679;",EPSRC; EPSRC [EP/M027988/1] Funding Source: UKRI,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

The objective of the model is to maximise the total social welfare, which includes consumer surplus and operator's net profit. The model is solved by a heuristic solution procedure and tested on an idealized linear travel corridor. The case study considers the effects from population density, density distribution, size of residential area, P&R station location, distance from the residential area to centre business area (CBD), as well as the changes of residential area layout and population growth. Results show that P&R fits for low population density area while ODPB is more suitable for high population density area. Population distribution type has little influence on the services' social welfare. ODPB is a preferable service for the city which does not have advanced metro network. Besides, the investment time for building ODPB service in the planning horizon is discussed with consideration of the development of residential area.","[Zhang, Jie; Wang, David Z.

This article focuses on the ideational dimension behind the current illiberal backlash in Central and Eastern Europe. We ask how political conceptions critical of the Western liberal paradigm came about and what their main components are in Hungary, a country which is often seen as the avant-garde of the 'illiberal backsliding' in the region. The article shows that political illiberalism in Eastern Europe has intellectual underpinnings forged in conservative intellectual networks that have grown disillusioned with liberal democracy and neoliberalism long before the current illiberal political wave. Combining the reception of Western critiques of liberalism with a critique of post-communist liberals' perceived lack of willingness to break with the communist past, these intellectuals have slowly but continuously extended their networks and influence since the 1990s. Our analysis suggests that the contestation of liberalism is not reducible to political parties and instead should be approached as a broader phenomenon.","[Buzogany, Aron] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Varga, Mihai] Free Univ Berlin, Inst East European Studies, Berlin, Germany","University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna; Free University of Berlin","Buzogány, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Feistmantelstr 4, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",aron.buzogany@boku.ac.at,"Buzogány, Aron/AAJ-8445-2020","Buzogány, Aron/0000-0002-9867-3742; Varga, Mihai/0000-0003-0278-7145",,,,,110,60,63,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Using a large sample of 71 commodity exporters among emerging and developing economies, it shows that negative shocks to commodity prices tend to weaken the financial sector, with larger shocks having more pronounced impacts. More specifically, negative commodity price shocks are associated with higher non-performing loans, bank costs and banking crises, while they reduce bank profits, liquidity and provisions to non-performing loans. These adverse effects tend to occur in countries with poor quality of governance, weak fiscal space, as well as those that do not have a sovereign wealth fund, do not implement macroprudential policies and do not have a diversified export base. These findings are robust to a battery of robustness checks.","[Kinda, Tidiane; Mlachila, Montfort; Ouedraogo, Rasmane] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Kinda, Tidiane] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Mlachila, Montfort] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Durban, South Africa",International Monetary Fund; Columbia University; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Kinda, T (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Kinda, T (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,"MLACHILA, MONTFORT/0000-0003-2533-3728",,,,,31,20,20,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,3001,3044,,10.1111/twec.12667,0.0,,,44,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200008,0

With the rapid increase of railway length and passengers over the past 20 years, a better understanding of susceptibility of railway infrastructures to rainfall-induced hazards is urgently needed, in particular because extreme precipitation has increased in many parts of China. This paper provides a quantitative approach for susceptibility assessment of transportation system subjected to natural hazards at a relatively large scale. The susceptibility of both existing and planned Chinese railway system subjected to rainfall-induced multi-hazards is quantitatively analyzed using a machine learning method (Random Forest) and historical disaster events triggered between 1980 and 1998. The main environmental and climatic factors that influence the safety of the railway system are identified and ranked.

Evidence from the 1980 Crude Oil Windfall Act,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Federalism; Vertical fiscal reactions; Common-pool problem; Complementarities; Natural resources,TAX EXTERNALITIES; TAXATION; INCOME; FEDERALISM; GOVERNMENT; SYSTEM,"In economies with multi-level governments, why would a change in the fiscal rule of a government in one level lead to a fiscal response by a government in a different level? The literature focused primarily on the standard common-pool problem, while giving little attention to the potential role of complementarity or substitutability (CS) between the public goods supplied by the two governments. This paper fills this gap by focusing on the latter channel. First, we illustrate its potential key role in determining the sign of the vertical reaction through a generic model of vertical fiscal interactions. Second, we propose a novel strategy for identifying it, by considering an empirical design that confines the common-pool channel to specific locations. We implement this design through a quasi-natural experiment: the 1980 U.S. Crude Oil Windfall Act, which increased federal tax collections from sale of crude oil, thereby affecting the tax base of oil rich states specifically. This latter feature enables attributing the vertical fiscal reactions of the remaining states to the CS channel. Following this strategy, via a difference in-differences approach, we decompose the sources of the vertical fiscal reactions arising from this federal tax change and find that those attributed to the CS channel: (i) account for approximately 38% of the overall vertical fiscal response; (ii) point at complementarity between state and federal public goods, most notably in transportation and welfare expenditures; (iii) are manifested primarily via changes in states' sales and income taxation.","[Perez-Sebastian, Fidel] Univ Alicante, FAE, Alicante, Spain; [Perez-Sebastian, Fidel] Hull Univ, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Raveh, Ohad] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, Jerusalem, Israel; [Raveh, Ohad] Ctr Agr Econ Res, Jerusalem, Israel; [Raveh, Ohad] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ Finance & Property, Perth, WA, Australia",Universitat d'Alacant; University of Hull; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Curtin University,"Raveh, O (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Environm Econ & Management, Jerusalem, Israel.",fidel.perez@ua.es; ohad.raveh@mail.huji.ac.il,"Perez-Sebastian, Fidel/AAA-5832-2019",,Center for Agricultural Economic Research; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional [ECO2015-70540-P MINECO/FEDER],Center for Agricultural Economic Research; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional(European Union (EU)),"We thank David Agrawal, Ziv Bar-Shira, Thushyanthan Baskaran, Julie Cullen, Israel Finkelshtain, Yaniv Reingewertz, Gerhard Toews, Tony Venables, and seminar participants at the Bank of Israel, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and University of Oxford for helpful comments and suggestions.

The main purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of consumer's knowledge about EVs, perceived risk, perceived usefulness and current financial incentive policies on consumer's intention to adopt EVs using an extended technology acceptance model. The model is empirically tested using questionnaire survey data collected from 320 consumers in China. The results shown that consumer's knowledge about EVs is positively and significantly related to perceived usefulness, attitude and intention to adopt EVs, but negatively and significantly related to perceived risk. Perceived risk negatively affects perceived usefulness, attitude and intention to adopt EVs. Meanwhile, perceived usefulness has a positive effect on adoption intention and attitude, and attitude is also positively related to the intention to adopt EVs. However, the results also indicate that the financial incentive policy has no significant effect on intention to adopt EVs. In addition, the results also find that consumers lacking of knowledge about EVs and perceiving high risk of EVs could be the psychological barriers to their acceptance of EVs. Based on the results, policy implications for increasing the adoption of EVs and suggestions for future research are discussed.","[Wang, Shanyong; Wang, Jing; Li, Jun; Wang, Jinpeng; Liang, Liang] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, 96 Jinzhai Rd, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Li, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, 96 Jinzhai Rd, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",laj2336@mail.ustc.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71601174, 71804174, 71571172]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M632555]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [WK2040150015]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The authors are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71601174, 71804174 and 71571172), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant number 2018M632555) and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (WK2040150015) for their generous financial support.",,61,190,197,23,208,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Additionally, we introduce uncertainty to explore the role of information and find that individual behavior aligns most closely with the more intuitive Nash equilibrium strategies under full information and to a lesser extent with incomplete information. Although uncertainty about fellow group members' costs incentivizes greater volunteering and thus has the potential to improve efficiency, we find that the inability to coordinate prevents groups from experiencing welfare gains as a result.","[Healy, Andrew J.; Pate, Jennifer G.] Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, 1 LMU Dr,Suite 4200, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA",Loyola Marymount University,"Pate, JG (通讯作者)，Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Econ, 1 LMU Dr,Suite 4200, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",jennifer.pate@lmu.edu,,,,,,,23,8,9,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2018,51.0,3,,,,,465,491,,10.1007/s00355-018-1124-6,0.0,,,27,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GU4PG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000445265300004,0

In order to support the road safety strategies of the EU countries, it is essential to investigate the association of road safety levels with economic, social and demographic factors and finally comparatively evaluate the performance of each country. This paper aims at analyzing the road safety performance of EU-23 countries over a decade (2005-2014) considering their socio-economic and demographic background. For doing so, two distinctive models were applied, in particular, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and DEA-Cross Efficiency Model (DEA-CEM), both suitably adapted to the road safety particularities. Moreover, the concept of road safety evaluation is performed by using comparable road safety indicators, namely, mortality rate and fatality risk. The results of this study contribute to the decision/policy making agenda from the perspective of evaluating road safety performance levels by using short-term and long-term road safety targets. Additionally, an unbiased 'picture' of the countries' road safety performance over a period of 10 years is provided, accompanied with information on the intra-period countries' efficiency of their road safety targets. The proposed intra-period analysis has useful practical and methodological implications since it is able to expose the evolution of road safety levels among the countries, besides a static overall picture. Finally, this study offers valuable insights on the cross-evaluation of road safety levels among the EU countries by considering a target-setting approach for each of them before and during a turbulent financial period for Europe.","[Nikolaou, Paraskevas; Dimitriou, Loukas] Univ Cyprus, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lab Transport Engn, 75 Kallipoleos Str,POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus",University of Cyprus,"Dimitriou, L (通讯作者)，Univ Cyprus, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Lab Transport Engn, 75 Kallipoleos Str,POB 20537, CY-1678 Nicosia, Cyprus.",nikolaou.paraskevas@ucy.ac.cy; lucdimit@ucy.ac.cy,,,,,,,21,30,30,2,21,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This article is a philological contribution to this debate, i.e. an immanent reading of alienation in the Grundrisse with a systematic textual basis. By providing a general overview of how Marx uses terms like alienation (Entfremdung), to alienate (entfremden), alien (fremd), alien character (Fremdartigkeit) and the close yet distinct externalisation (Entauerung) in the Grundrisse, we set out to show precisely how the meanings and functions of this terminology can be distinguished from alienation in the so-called Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (EPM). Indeed, in the EPM, the concept of alienation refers to the inhibition of Man's generic forces by private property. There, it is thus a philosophical standpoint external to economic phenomena. In the Grundrisse, by contrast, the concept delineates three dimensions of the social and historical determination of these phenomena. First, the subordination of workers or independent producers to capital or money; second, the constitution of capital or money into independent social relations; third, the transcending character of the social reality hence produced. Nevertheless, a certain aspect of the system of alienation outlined in the EPM is taken up again in the Grundrisse: the idea that alienation calls for the integration of that which has been alienated (the productive forces) into the alienated subject (the producers).","[Zoubir, Zacharias] Univ Paris Nanterre, Sophiapol, 200 Ave Republ, F-92000 Nanterre, France",,"Zoubir, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Nanterre, Sophiapol, 200 Ave Republ, F-92000 Nanterre, France.",zzoubir@protonmail.com,,,,,,,34,4,4,7,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that areas with unconventional gas development experience a disproportionate increase in the young male population who are more likely to be involved in risk taking behavior. Moreover, the sudden income gains or demographic shifts might increase the demand for various goods and services, including entertainment and illegal activities provided by the adult entertainment industry. We investigate the relationship between unconventional gas development and a variety of risk-taking outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections, and prostitution-related arrests. Our identification strategy exploits the variation in shale gas or unconventional well drilling across time and counties in conjecture with a number of datasets that allow us to investigate the potential mechanisms. Our findings indicate that Pennsylvania counties with fracking activities have higher rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia infections (7.8% and 2.6%, respectively), as well as higher prostitution related arrests (19.7%). We posit that changes in the labor market and associated impacts to income or composition of workers may play a role in the estimated effects, but we do not find evidence in support of these hypotheses.

We use data from multiple waves of nationally-representative Health and Tobacco Surveys in Turkey, and exploit an education reform that increased the mandatory years of schooling from 5 to 8 years in 1997. Using exposure to the reform as an instrument for completing at least eight years of schooling, we examine the impact of education on health indicators and smoking among young adults. We find that extending schooling on this margin impacts men and women differently. Our results indicate that while a one-year of extra schooling increases the likelihood of being obese among males by 9.9 percentage points, the same increase in schooling improves the probability of women being in the healthy weight range by 15.5 percentage points. Consistent with this result, an extra year of education increases women's propensity to self-evaluate their health as excellent by 4.3 percentage points. Additional analyses reveal that education makes men (but not women) more likely to spend time on computers, using the internet, and to spend time on social media, suggesting that differential time allocation between men and women, triggered by enhanced education, may be a mechanism behind the differential results between the sexes. Education has no impact on smoking for men or women regardless of the measure of smoking. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The approach is based on the matrix logarithm and combines common latent factors driven by HAR processes and idiosyncratic autoregressive dynamics. The model accounts for positive definiteness of covariance matrices without imposing parametric restrictions. Simulated Bayesian parameter estimates are obtained using basic Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. An empirical application to 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional realized covariance matrices shows remarkably good forecasting results, in-sample and out-of-sample.","[Gribisch, Bastian] Univ Cologne, Inst Econometr & Stat, Univ Str 22a, D-50937 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Gribisch, B (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Econometr & Stat, Univ Str 22a, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",bastian.gribisch@statistik.uni-koeln.de,"Gribisch, Bastian/JZT-8117-2024","Gribisch, Bastian/0000-0002-6289-1799",,,,,43,5,5,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

However, for certain tests, asymptotic distributions of test statistics might depend on the constrained maximum likelihood or quasi maximum likelihood (QML) estimators, so their OPG variants would not be valid. To overcome such a hurdle, we propose to use C(alpha)-type score vectors to obtain valid OPG variants. Such OPG tests can be systematically constructed for SARAR models with homoskedastic and heteroskedastic disturbances, which might not be normally distributed. They also have the advantage that any root n - consistent estimator can be used in place of a restricted QML estimate. In particular, OPG tests based on generalized method of moments (GMM) estimates are computationally simple and powerful compared to LM tests. Corresponding OPG tests based on C(alpha)-type gradient vectors in the GMM framework are also investigated.","[Jin, Fei] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Jin, Fei] Minist Educ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Lee, Lung-fei] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Jin, F (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",jin.fei@sufe.edu.cn; lee.1777@osu.edu,,"Jin, Fei/0000-0003-2873-0892",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71501119]; Shanghai Pujiang Program [15PJC043]; Shanghai Chenguang Program,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Pujiang Program(Shanghai Pujiang Program); Shanghai Chenguang Program,"We thank the editor and two anonymous referees for their insightful comments that lead to improvements of this paper.

As an alternative we propose a method of moments based procedure using the rank test of Kleibergen and Paap (J Econom 133:97-126, 2006) for a fixed number of time series observations. The test is shown to be applicable in situations with time-series heteroscedasticity and unbalanced data. The novelty of our approach is that in the construction of the test we exploit the weakness of the Anderson and Hsiao (J Econom 18:47-82, 1982) moment conditions. The finite-sample performance of the proposed test statistic is investigated using simulated data. The results indicate that for most scenarios the method has good statistical properties.

However, no attempts have been made to investigate whether groups are affected similarly by behavioral biases that are pervasive for individuals. If groups were also able to more effectively avoid these biases, the relevance of biases in actual economic contexts dominated by group decision-making might be questioned. We consider the case of anchoring as a prime example of a well-established, robust bias. Individual and group biasedness in three economically relevant domains are compared: factual knowledge, probability estimates and price valuations. In contrast to previous anchoring studies, we find groups to successfully reduce, albeit not eliminate, anchoring in the factual knowledge domain. For the other two domains, groups and individuals are equally biased by external anchors. Group cooperation thus reduces biases for predominantly intellective tasks only, while no such reduction is achieved when judgmental aspects are involved.","[Meub, Lukas; Proeger, Till] Univ Goettingen, Fac Econ Sci, Chair Econ Policy & SME Res, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Proeger, T (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Fac Econ Sci, Chair Econ Policy & SME Res, Pl Goettinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",Till.Proeger@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,63,6,9,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2018,85.0,2,,,,,117,150,,10.1007/s11238-017-9608-x,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GO1ZL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439761200001,0

We study two sharing schemes that are rooted in ancient sources: the Aristotelian proportional rule and the Talmud rule.

The Great Recession and road traffic accidents,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"We provide new evidence on the impact of recessions on traffic accidents by exploiting the case of Spain, where the effects of the 2008 economic crisis have been among the strongest in the developed world. We exploit differences in the incidence of the recession across Spanish provinces due to the unequal evolution of the real estate bubble across the country. We use a unique dataset on the universe of traffic accidents in Spain between 2004 and 2011. We first follow the literature on the topic and examine the impact of the economic crisis on the probability of having a traffic accident. However, we also go one step further, as we are able to identify any changes in the composition of both victims and driving behaviors as a result of the crisis. First, our results show that the Great Recession reduced traffic accidents in Spain. Second, regarding the compositional effects, we observe decreased probabilities of dying or reporting a serious injury. More important, we also detect an increase in the probability that people involved in an accident abused alcohol and drugs. Our results are robust to different measures of the crisis and the use of a spatial fixed effects model and are not biased by anticipatory effects. Finally, we show that our findings are driven by less-populated areas. Thus, we suggest that alcohol and drug control measures be reinforced during recessions and that more attention should be devoted to rural areas to strengthen the reduction in road traffic accidents.","[Bertoli, Paola; Grembi, Veronica] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Grembi, Veronica] Univ Milan, Via Conservatorio 7, Milan, Italy; [Castello, Judit Vall] Univ Barcelona, IEB, Barcelona, Spain; [Castello, Judit Vall] UPF, CRES, Barcelona, Spain",Prague University of Economics & Business; University of Milan; University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University,"Grembi, V (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Via Conservatorio 7, Milan, Italy.",veronica.grembi@unimi.it,"Bertoli, Paola/AAG-1751-2019","Bertoli, Paola/0000-0001-8818-4243; Vall castello, Judit/0000-0002-1925-1657",,,,,14,5,5,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

A total of 52 km CS routes and 762 cycle hire docking stations are included for a period of 5 years. Covariates such as land use, road network characteristics and socioeconomic information are included in the data set. Transaction records of each docking station are obtained from Transport for London. We first estimate the effect area of the CS routes using a buffer-area based regression. Our results suggest that the effect area of the London Cycle Superhighways is 300 m from either side of the center of the CS routes. Then the propensity score matching methods are applied to select control docking stations and estimate the effects of the CS routes on the cycle hire usage. The results suggest a significant increase of 27.1% in the average ridership for docking stations within the effect area. For trips with both the origin and destination in the effect area, the increase is 73.2%. We also investigate the effects of the cycle superhighways on average travel speed and travel time of cycle hire trips. The travel speed using cycle hires is increased by 1.16 km/h (13.3%), although the effect is insignificant for trips with destinations out of the effect area. The cycle superhighways also significantly reduced the travel time by 11%. The results show no significant effects on the travel distance due to data restriction.","Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; Jiangsu Key Lab Urban ITS, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Modern Urban, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Li, HJ (通讯作者)，Southeast Univ, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",h.li@seu.edu.cn,,"Xu, Chengcheng/0000-0003-3028-0034","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71701042, 51578149]; Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51561135003]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20150615]; Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China [51638004]; EPSRC [EP/N010612/1] Funding Source: UKRI",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71701042), the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchange of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51561135003), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Project No. BK20150615), the Key Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51638004), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51578149).",,31,32,35,1,31,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Audited costs are also substituted for bids in U.S. markets when local market power is demonstrated to be present. Regulators that favor a cost-based design argue that this is more appropriate for systems with a small number of generation firms because it eliminates the possibilities for generators to behave strategically in the spot market, which is a main concern in bid-based markets. We discuss existing results on market power issues in cost- and bid-based designs and present a counterintuitive example, in which forcing spot prices to be equal to marginal costs in a concentrated market can actually yield lower social welfare than under a bid-based market design due to perverse investment incentives. Additionally, we discuss the difficulty of auditing the true opportunity costs of generators in cost- based markets and how this can lead to distorted dispatch schedules and prices, ultimately affecting the long-term economic efficiency of a system. An important example is opportunity costs that diverge from direct fuel costs due to energy or start limits, or other generator constraints. Most of these arise because of physical and financial inflexibilities that become more relevant with increasing shares of variable and unpredictable generation from renewables.","[Munoz, Francisco D.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Santiago, Chile; [Wogrin, Sonja] Univ Pontificia Comillas, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn, Inst Invest Tecnol, Madrid, Spain; [Oren, Shmuel S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hobbs, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Environm Hlth & Engn, Baltimore, MD USA",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Comillas Pontifical University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Johns Hopkins University,"Munoz, FD (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Santiago, Chile.",fdmunoz@uai.cl,"Muñoz, Francisco/AHD-1365-2022; Wogrin, Sonja/E-5022-2017","Wogrin, Sonja/0000-0002-3889-7197",FONDECYT [11150029]; CONICYT/FONDAP [15110019]; CONICYT-Basal [FB0008],FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); CONICYT/FONDAP(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP); CONICYT-Basal,"This research was supported by FONDECYT #11150029, CONICYT/FONDAP/15110019 (SERC-CHILE), and CONICYT-Basal Project FB0008.

Additionally, we find support for the dual-hormone hypothesis in a financial context. Specifically, the testosterone-to-cortisol ratio is significantly related to loss aversion. Individuals with a higher ratio are 3.4 times more likely to sell losing stocks (standard error [SE]: 1.63). Furthermore, we find a positive feedback loop between financial success, testosterone, and cortisol. Specifically, financial success is significantly related to higher post-trial testosterone and cortisol by a factor of 0.53 (SE: 0.14). Finally, we find that in a competitive environment, testosterone level increases significantly, leading to greater risk-taking than in noncompetitive environment. Overall, this study underscores the importance of the endocrine system on financial decision-making. The results of this study are relevant to a broad audience, including investors looking to optimize financial performance, industry human resources, market regulators, and researchers.

The paper focuses its attention on the main procedural differences between the WLTP and the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), which is the test-procedure currently used in Europe. In general terms the WLTP appears to be a significant improvement compared to the NEDC. The main differences between two test procedures are identified and their impact on CO2 emissions quantified using the in-house built simulation software CO(2)MPAS. On the basis of each of these differences, the paper assesses the potential total impact on the final reported type-approval CO2 emissions. The biggest impact on CO2 emissions is coming from the changes in the road load determination procedure (similar to 10% increase). Procedural changes concerning the test in the laboratory will bring another 8% and post-processing and declaration of results will result in difference of approximately 5% (each). Overall, the WLTP is likely to increase the type-approval CO2 emissions by approximately 25%. Therefore, the WLTP will be able to reduce more than half of the gap identified between the type-approval and real-life figures in Europe. This should be seen as a considerable improvement given the ontological limitations of a laboratory-based test procedure.","[Pavlovic, J.; Ciuffo, B.; Fontaras, G.; Valverde, V.] European Commiss, Directorate C Energy Transport & Climate, Sustainable Transport Unit, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Marotta, A.] European Commiss, Directorate Gen Internal Market Ind Entrepreneurs, Automot & Mobil Ind, Brussels, Belgium",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Pavlovic, J; Ciuffo, B (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Directorate C Energy Transport & Climate, Sustainable Transport Unit, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",jelica.pavlovic@ec.europa.eu; blagio.ciuffo@ec.europa.eu,"Valverde, Víctor/HSF-6835-2023","Ciuffo, Biagio/0000-0003-3734-4264; Valverde, Victor/0000-0002-4087-7697",,,,,26,95,97,0,23,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Under the National Policy, the Canadian average weighted tariff increased from 14% to 21%. The conventional view is that this was a distortionary policy that negatively affected Canadian welfare. We argue that this view is incomplete because it ignores general equilibrium effects. Using a multi-industry general equilibrium model with differentiated goods, we show that tariffs' impact on welfare can potentially be positive, even for small open economies, due to their impact on domestic terms of trade and government revenues. We apply these theoretical insights in a reassessment of the static impact that the National Policy had on Canadian welfare in 1879, using newly compiled granular trade and production data, and newly estimated historically contemporaneous import demand elasticities. Our results suggest that, although a multilateral move to free trade would have resulted in the best welfare outcome for Canadians, the National Policy's tariff increases actually improved Canadian welfare by approximately 0.15% of GDP in 1879 - an amount equivalent to approximately $2.3 billion 2016 USD.

There are two contributions to the existing public/private wage gap literature. One is a better understanding of the identified parameters: standard estimators identify a local effect (LATE), which in general cannot be generalized to the entire population, as instead is almost always done. The other is the partial identification of the population average treatment effect, with an instrumental variable. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first paper in this literature that employs bounds. The technique is applied to male workers in Italy. For compliers, LATE estimates a wage advantage from working in the public sector greater than 30%. This return is within the narrowest bounds on the population average treatment effect that are consistent even with a much smaller gap (about 15% or more).","[Depalo, Domenico] Banca Italia, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Depalo, D (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",domenico.depalo@bancaditalia.it,,"Depalo, Domenico/0000-0001-7395-1286",,,,,75,4,4,3,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

The poverty alleviation literature, however, has not yet addressed the important issue of policy design for efficient multidimensional poverty reduction. From a positive perspective, it is regularly observed that different poverty dimensions are often correlated and mutually reinforced, especially over time. From a normative perspective, it can be argued that in addition to being concerned with impacts on multiple dimensions of poverty, policy should also consider impacts on their joint distribution. This paper integrates these two perspectives into a consistent policy evaluation framework. Targeting dominance techniques are also proposed to assess the normative robustness of targeting strategies. The analytical results are applied to data from Vietnam and South Africa and illustrate the role of both normative and positive perspectives in designing efficient multidimensional poverty targeting policies.","[Duclos, Jean-Yves; Tiberti, Luca; Araar, Abdelkrim] Univ Laval, PEP, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University,"Duclos, JY (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, PEP, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",jyves@ecn.ulaval.ca,,"Tiberti, Luca/0000-0003-2305-6704",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture; International Development Research Centre of Canada; Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (UK Aid),Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture; International Development Research Centre of Canada(International Development Research Centre - IDRC); Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (UK Aid)(CGIAR),"This work has been carried out with support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture, and the Partnership for Economic Policy, which is financed by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (UK Aid) and the International Development Research Centre of Canada.

While the inconsistency of the EU's conditionality policy partially explains Serbia's under-performance, Serbian authorities also lacked the incentives for compliance. As Serbia was willing to compromise on its perceived national interests concerning international war crimes prosecution and Kosovo, both highly significant issues for its national identity, the real threat now as perceived by the authorities is well functioning independent institutions and free media that can put constraints on their power.

Over time, contracts with the same supplier include additional provisions that address moral hazard through monitoring. This dynamic effect is strongest for service contracts, where observability and verifiability are initially lower.

It argues that the combination of poor employment opportunities, requirements, compulsions and sanctions has not merely reduced available choice for individuals with multiple barriers to re-/join the labour market but has also resulted in curtailed decision-making abilities when it comes to their pathways into employment. The outcomes can include protective resistance as a response to the extent of regulation, which may undermine engagement in job search and related activities. Despite attempts by benevolent staff in a charity to provide support and enhance capabilities that result in the overcoming of protective resistance, they operate within a broader institutional framework of choice as set by government policy.

We find some evidence of overall productivity decline when considering both emissions and output objectives, due primarily to technological decline, and that cumulative dynamic inefficiency outweighs static inefficiency.

However, scant evidence exists pertaining to whether parents' impatience and self-control problems impact the obesity status of their children, too. Accordingly, we explore this study question among a large national sample of US adults and their children. Study results confirm previous findings indicating that intertemporal preferences are related to adults' obesity status. Moreover, these results extend the literature by finding that children of impatient or present-biased parents have a significantly higher likelihood of being obese, too. Specifically, parents' low levels of patience and present bias were each independently related to a five-percentage point increase in the likelihood of obesity of their children. These findings were more pronounced when all children were combined in analyses and for the first child; however, they varied for the second and third child. Thus, findings suggest that parents' time preferences and self-control problems likely affect not only their own weight status but that of their children. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluate the extent to which a cognitive bias, confirmatory bias, affects the opinions of experts in a real-world environment. In the Associated Press Top 25 College Football Poll, expert pollsters are tasked with assessing team quality, and their beliefs are treated week to week with game results that serve as signals about an individual team's quality. We exploit the variation provided by actual game results relative to market expectations to develop a novel regression-discontinuity approach to identify confirmatory bias. We construct a data set that matches more than 20 years of individual game characteristics to poll results and betting market information and show that teams that slightly exceed and barely miss market expectations are exchangeable. The likelihood of winning the game, the average number of points scored by teams and their opponents, and even the average week of the season are no different between teams that slightly exceed and barely miss market expectations. Pollsters, however, significantly upgrade their beliefs about a team's quality when a team slightly exceeds market expectations. The effects are sizableone fifth of the standard deviation in poll points in a given week can be attributed to confirmatory bias, which is equivalent to nearly half of the voters in the poll ranking a team one slot higher when they slightly exceed market expectations. This type of updating suggests that even when informed agents make repeated decisions, they may act in a manner consistent with confirmatory bias.","[Andrews, Rodney J.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Econ Polit & Policy Studies, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Andrews, Rodney J.] NBER, Richardson, TX USA; [Logan, Trevon D.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Logan, Trevon D.] NBER, Columbus, OH USA; [Sinkey, Michael J.] Univ West Georgia, Richards Coll Business, Dept Econ, 1601 Maple St, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Georgia; University of West Georgia,"Sinkey, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ West Georgia, Richards Coll Business, Dept Econ, 1601 Maple St, Carrollton, GA 30118 USA.",msinkey@westga.edu,"Sinkey, Michael/GWM-5939-2022",,,,,,35,3,4,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Also, according to specific criteria, the paper analyses and compares characteristics of the public institutions and non-prolit and private profit organizations projects. It was found that the Croatian partners are mainly involved in Small scale projects, rarely in the function of coordinator, but mainly in the function of one of the project partners. At the same time, there are only rare examples of funded projects with Croatian cultural institutions included as a partner or coordinator in their consortium.

Against the backdrop of his argument, it was investigated to what extent veterinarians base the justification of their actions on CBRs, RBRs or hybrids of CBRs and RBRs. The guiding hypothesis is: CBRs are the dominant normative source in veterinary practice. Semi-structured interviews were held with six veterinarians from Lower Austria. After a quantitative analysis of the results as well as a qualitative content analysis according to Philipp Mayring (2008), the guiding hypothesis can be supported that CBRs are the main normative source for justifying veterinary treatment. When working with the transcripts, it became clear that a significant number of coded statements could not be grouped under CBRs or RBRs. It was therefore necessary to implement a third 'Hybrid' category to mirror the complexity of data in the analysis. Out of 117 coded justifications for veterinary treatment, 66% could be assigned to CBRs, while 19% corresponded to the `Hybrid' category and 15% to RBRs.","[Boehm, S.] Univ Vet Med, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Messerli Res Inst, Vienna, Austria; Med Univ Vienna, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; Univ Vienna, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Medical University of Vienna; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Vienna; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Böhm, S (通讯作者)，Univ Vet Med, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Messerli Res Inst, Vienna, Austria.",sophia_boehm2003@yahoo.de,,,,,,,5,0,0,1,1,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,499,504,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_79,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000079,0

Managers are a human resource link between people and organizations, and their function is to achieve an effective system of mutual satisfaction and fulfill the company's established plans and goals. Communication between managers and employees is the key to understanding the wishes and plans of managers and the possibilities for achievement by the workers themselves.

Whilst the majority of scholarly work has focused on public transport needs, less research has examined the barriers or benefits of access to private modified vehicles for PWD. In this exploratory study, a Delphi technique with health experts, researchers, drivers and funding agencies developed an instrument to examine the barriers and benefits of access to private modified vehicles for PWD. An online survey was completed by 287 drivers and carers to report on barriers to private modified vehicles, whilst a sub-set of 190 drivers with access to a private modified vehicle reported on experientially derived benefits. A factor analytic approach identified how financial and informational barriers vary with respect to several characteristics including disability type and level of support needs. Factors relating to independence, social and recreational benefits are perceived as more valued experientially derived benefits relative to benefits relating to employability and ability to enjoy downtime. Benefits in the form of independence are greater among drivers and owners, those with an acquired condition, less complex mobility and everyday support needs, whilst little difference emerged in terms of the social and downtime benefits. The findings inform policy development and funding opportunities to provide insight and evidence into the barriers, but also benefits and variation in private transport needs among PWD.","[Darcy, Simon; Burke, Paul Francis] Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, 1-15 Broadway, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Darcy, S (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, 1-15 Broadway, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.",Simon.Darcy@uts.edu.au; Paul.Burke@uts.edu.au,"Darcy, Simon/G-1407-2010; Burke, Paul/I-3106-2013","Darcy, Simon/0000-0002-5394-2566; Burke, Paul/0000-0003-0978-0237",New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services; Australian Research Council [DE130101463]; Australian Research Council [DE130101463] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors would like to acknowledge funding assistance of the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services and the Australian Research Council (DE130101463) that supported elements of the research.,,98,33,37,3,19,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Our study sheds additional light to previous findings and extends the perspective, going beyond analysis of behaviour of S&P green bond index.

Using multivariate GARCH framework we were able to verify and test volatility patterns and assess how the volatility of in the green bond market transmits to broader conventional bond market. Results of our study confirm that all green bond indices, experience large volatility clustering. We also found out that shocks in the overall conventional bond markets tend not to be echoed in the green bond market.

Two other future Nobel laureates devoted their AEA presidential addresses to presenting the Keynesian alternative to Friedman's vision of the possibilities for macroeconomic stabilization and reduction of unemployment: James Tobin's Inflation and Unemployment (AER, March 1972), and Franco Modigliani, The Monetarist Controversy, or Should We Forsake Stabilization Policies? (AER, March 1977). This paper examines the Keynesian analysis and policy prescriptions put forward in those addresses, in the context of the long series of critical exchanges that Tobin and Modigliani had with Friedman. The addresses by Tobin and Modigliani, once widely-reprinted and influential, lost influence in part because of focusing on specifically monetarist policy proposals tangential to the natural rate hypothesis and subsequent Keynesian /New Classical debates: the last section (before the conclusion) of Modigliani (1977) was entitled Why Constant Money Growth Cannot Be the Answer. This loss of influence has diverted attention from the still important and timely message of these addresses that, as expressed by Tobin (1972), irrationality ... is not logically necessary for the existence of a long-run Phillips tradeoff. In full long-run equilibrium in all markets, employment and unemployment would be independent of the levels and rates of change of money wage rates and prices. But this is not an equilibrium that the system ever approaches. The economy is in perpetual sectoral disequilibrium even when it has settled into a stochastic macro-equilibrium.","[Dimand, Robert W.] Brock Univ, St Catharines, ON, Canada",Brock University,"Dimand, RW (通讯作者)，Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 1812 Sir Isaac Brock Way, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada.",rdimand@brocku.ca,,,,,,,99,3,3,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

The aim of this paper is (1) to summarize recent criticism on the epistemic and practical limitations of the prospective benefit assessment in the HBA in its current form and on the focus on tangible societal benefits in project evaluation and (2) as a proof of principle, demonstrate the argumentation of these papers on two concrete examples, namely the insulin inhalator Exubera and the cancer drug Ipilimumab. First, we show that the HBA suffers from a logical and methodological flaw. The outcome of an experiment is per definition uncertain. If it wasn't, the experiment would not generate new knowledge and would therefore be illegal. Moreover, as long as animals are used as models for humans there will always be uncertainty regarding the translatability of knowledge from model to target species. Second, we show that practical flaws further complicate prospective benefit assessment. There are non-scientific factors, such as market potential, lobbying, patient compliance, etc., that are impossible to predict and yet, are important parameters in prospective benefit assessment. Together, these uncertainties make a prospective benefit assessment implausible. Also, the requirement to demonstrate societal benefits might incentivize researchers to overstate the tangible benefits of their research in project proposals, thereby making prospective benefit assessment in project evaluation more difficult for committees. Overstating potential societal benefits that are eventually not realized might also be detrimental to the credibility of science. In light of these flaws we think it necessary to develop an alternative model for project evaluation that focuses on potential knowledge gains as outcome of a project rather than prospective assessment of potential societal benefits.","[Eggel, M.; Grimm, H.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Eggel, M.] Univ Zurich, Inst Biomed Eth & Hist Med, Winterthurerstr 30, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; University of Zurich,"Eggel, M (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.;Eggel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Inst Biomed Eth & Hist Med, Winterthurerstr 30, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",matthias.eggel@ibme.uzh.ch,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,407,411,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_64,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000064,0

Secondly, we empirically assess error correction after price shocks and reach the conclusion that markets' strength of the error correction mechanism is rather modest.

The neoclassical economic concept, whose influence is still significant in B&H, has not delivered expected results in the period since the end of the war (1992-1995), at least when it comes to this economic problem. Privatisation together with deregulation of the economy, which were conceived as an instrument for stimulating economic activity, only provided the benefit for a narrow circle of people, leaving behind a large number of failed companies whose workers are now mainly unemployed. Deregulation of the market from the influence of the state, under the free trade and non-market interference, given enough power to certain interest groups, which were driven by personal interests, again regulated the market as it suited themself. The result of these activities is that even after 20 years, B&H has over 40% registered unemployment rate, low average wage, a GDP pc, which is among the lowest in Europe, an unattractive real sector burdened with high tax fees, and low level of investment activity. The situation in B&H has its similarities with the economic situation in the United States after the coming of the Great Depression in 1929, which was heavily influenced by classical economic thought at that time, where unemployment was at a record level for the US, over 25% of the working population.

Yet, while transnational tax policy processes are increasingly analyzed through the politics of expertise, national preferences have usually been derived from domestic interest group preferences. We know little about how technical expertise interacts with interest group politics at national level, an important deficit given the sovereignty-preserving, decentralized way in which transnational tax norms become hard law. This article examines the drivers of expansion of the UK's bilateral tax treaty network in the 1970s, which cannot be explained solely through monolithic interest group politics. Evidence from the British national archives demonstrates how tax experts in the civil service and the private sector, members of a transnational policy community, used tax treaties to impose OECD standards for taxing British firms on host countries, at times overruling the preferences of other political, bureaucratic and business actors. Expertise politics and business power may shape the development of norms and focal points within a transnational policy community, but it is often their interaction at domestic level that determines the implementation of transnational norms as hard law.","[Hearson, Martin] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Int Relat, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hearson, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Int Relat, London, England.",m.hearson@lse.ac.uk,"Hearson, Martin/N-6854-2017","Hearson, Martin/0000-0002-7108-7372",,,,,104,24,25,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

For example, when an alternative to which a consumer pays attention becomes more salient in terms of the extent of product advertisement, she will still pay attention to it in a market. We manipulate the salience of alternatives to find choice reversals from observable choice data, which play an important role in our analysis. The advantages of our model over the Masatlioglu et al.

Even those philosophers who do not advocate vegetarianism/veganism are in almost unanimous agreement when it comes to the condemnation of factory farming: its practices cause massive, unnecessary suffering to animals, therefore they are cruel. Prohibition of cruelty to animals has been central to animal protection acts, and is still playing a pivotal role in the debate over determining moral status: If x can be wronged by cruelty, then x has at least some moral status. I will discuss Timothy Hsiao's (2017) recent attempt to defend factory farming by arguing that it is not cruel to animals since animals have no moral status. By focusing on his misconception of cruelty it will be shown that Hsiao's anthropocentric definition 'that an act is cruel if it reveals a corrupt character or if it corrupts one's character so as to make one more disposed to mistreating humans' is neither necessary nor sufficient. After a reconsideration of David DeGrazia's (2009) fundamental objections to indirect duty views I will consider four significant shortcommings of Hsiao's account: first, the dubious spillover aspect; second, his underdetermined conception of sadism. Third, it will be demonstrated that Hsiao's definition is too inclusive. Finally, it will be shown that Hsiao disregards different kinds of cruelty. With reference to Julia Tanner's (2015) distinction of four kinds of cruelty the many practices involved in factory farming ought to be analyzed as prime examples of indifferent cruelty.","[Kaiser, P.] Univ Vienna, Dept Philosophy, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Kaiser, P (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Philosophy, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",peterkaiser@aon.at,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,3,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,157,162,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_23,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000023,0

However, veterinary medicine is undergoing a radical gender change as the percentage of female graduates has risen from 15 to 80% in the last thirty years. Since the ethics of care originates from a largely feminist approach, the radical increase of female veterinarians may require a reevaluation. A broader perspective and an alternative view on care is urgently needed to drive the discussion about ethics into new territory. The question of this paper is: Is it possible to transfer this feminist criticism into the field of (traditional) veterinary ethics ? We will discuss the response to a practical case in livestock practice, which originates from a classic work of veterinary ethics, written by a luminary in this field, Bernard Rollin. It deals with a pregnant cow with a squamous cell carcinoma that the owner doesn't want to be treated. We will identify criteria that differentiate feminist from traditional ethical theories, to challenge the response to this dilemma from an ethics of care position. We will highlight missing aspects in traditional positions, for instance the dimension of relationships and the role of feelings in moral decision making, which are of significance to care accounts in ethics.","[Karg, J.; Grimm, H.] Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Karg, J (通讯作者)，Messerli Res Inst, Unit Eth & Human Anim Studies, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.",johanna.karg@vetmeduni.ac.at,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,255,259,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_39,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000039,0

Despite its relevance to these broader debates on authoritarianism, this question remains inadequately explained in conventional approaches to repression. This article proposes that autocrats' discipline over the use of state repression is a consequence of their differential control over illicit commercial networks. Autocratic regimes that consolidate their control over rents become dependent on security apparatuses to deepen and maintain that control. These regimes invest in and support the development of coercive capabilities, which leads to more disciplined state repression. Where autocratic regimes do not control illicit networks and rents, their dependence on security offices is low. Consequently, their investment in coercive capacity suffers, giving rise to patterns of undisciplined repression. This article explores the empirical implications of these regime trajectories through a controlled comparison of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, two drug transit states in post-Soviet Eurasia whose coercive institutions and patterns of state violence have developed in markedly different ways.","[Markowitz, Lawrence P.] Rowan Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Econ, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA; [Omelicheva, Mariya Y.] Univ Kansas, Dept Polit Sci, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",Rowan University; University of Kansas,"Markowitz, LP (通讯作者)，Rowan Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Econ, Glassboro, NJ 08028 USA.",markowitzl@rowan.edu,"Omelicheva, Mariya Y/B-7100-2015","Omelicheva, Mariya Y/0000-0001-9190-3544",Office of Naval Research Global [ONR N00014-15-1-2788],Office of Naval Research Global(Office of Naval Research),This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research Global [Grant number ONR N00014-15-1-2788].,,75,0,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The conundrum this paper addresses is the rather limited impact of oil exploitation in Ghana despite the country's strong democratic record and internationally acclaimed oil governance legislation. The reasons for this lie in the nature of elite-based political coalitions and we root our analysis of Ghana's hydrocarbons in the political settlements literature, which moves us beyond the good governance' approaches so often linked to resource curse' thinking. We also move beyond the instrumentalism of political settlements theory to examine the role political ideas play in shaping resource governance.

Consequently, I recommend regulatory strategies to ensure that growth in scope of services does not lead to predatory behaviour.","[Nchadze, Lontum E.] Univ Buea, Dept Econ & Management, POB 63, Buea, Cameroon",,"Nchadze, LE (通讯作者)，Univ Buea, Dept Econ & Management, POB 63, Buea, Cameroon.",sheylontum@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,49,61,,,,,,13,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540718700005,0

Considering the diverse dividend policy of companies, I am particularly interested in the role of constant dividend per share policy, constant payout ratio policy, extreme dividend policy, residual dividend policy and hybrid dividend policy in shaping the market share price of companies listed on the main market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange in the years 2001-2016. I conduct the research employing the buy-and-hold abnormal return, Fisher's LSD test and OLS regression model. The main results of my empirical study indicate that the buy-and-hold returns for the companies implementing a specified dividend policy are higher than the buy-and-hold returns for the WIG index. Moreover, regardless of the type of dividend policy, abnormal stock returns increase along with an increase in the number of years of the regular dividend payouts. The main conclusion from my analysis is that conducting the specified dividend policy has a significant impact on the long-term market share price behavior. I observe that the diversity of dividend policy is accompanied by the diverse stock returns achieved by the stock market investor. The scientific research presented in this paper seems to be valuable due to the lack of academic studies on the impact of implementing the different types of dividend policy on achieving the long-term abnormal stock returns.","[Pieloch-Babiarz, Aleksandra] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Business Anal & Strategy, 41 Rewolucji 1905 St, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Pieloch-Babiarz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Dept Business Anal & Strategy, 41 Rewolucji 1905 St, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",apieloch@uni.lodz.pl,"Pieloch-Babiarz, Aleksandra/AAM-6658-2021","Pieloch-Babiarz, Aleksandra/0000-0001-7885-1284",,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,509,517,,,,,,9,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800065,0

Family social capital comes from the family, its culture, traditions and results from the frequent, deep and long-lasting personal interactions among family members. Emotional trust and strong moral infrastructure seem to be the most invaluable components of it. In turn, they result in creating such strategic resources like: strong internal and external social architectures of the business, reputation and mechanism of protecting tacit knowledge, which all are the sources of family business competitive advantage over their non-family counterparts.

In addition, gender analysis wasalso applied, covering 5 aspects: participation, access, control, benefits, and impacts. The result of this study showed that on cassava farming in Gunungkidul there iss good cooperation and role-sharing between women and men. The gender profile of cassava farming in Gunungkidul showed that in plant cultivation, male participation is greater than female participation, whereas in post-harvest activities female participation is relatively greater than male participation. Women's access and control are lower than those of men, except in marketing. Women and men feel the benefits of cassava farming.

Some traditionally influential Member States in EU asylum politics, such as Germany, Austria and Sweden, received large numbers of refugees and faced strong domestic pressures to engage other Member States in responsibility-sharing. Yet, governments of Member States with small application numbers (among whom several Eastern European governments were particularly vocal) had incentives to undercut responsibility-sharing to avoid similar pressures. Having a better alternative to the potentially negotiated agreement, these governments successfully blocked the introduction of permanent refugee quotas. Besides explaining the absence of an effective response to one of the root causes of the asylum crisis (unequal strains) through asymmetrical interdependence, the article further develops Liberal Intergovernmentalist arguments and shows how national electorates influence positions taken by governments at the EU level when they are mobilized by right-wing populist parties.","[Zaun, Natascha] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Zaun, N (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, European Inst, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.v.zaun@lse.ac.uk,,"Zaun, Natascha/0000-0002-0436-6275",,,,,70,103,113,0,50,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The study reports the rising trends of both FDI and GDP and documents that the greater-than-expected FDI due to innovative shocks or policy innovations positively influences conditional volatility of FDI which, in turn, positively contributes to the economic growth/development. The conditional volatility used in the study is the variance derived from the diagnostically selected exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model. The study also reports the causality of both the FDI and its volatility across borders. More specifically, it reports bidirectional causality of FDI between India and Pakistan but unidirectional causality from Bangladesh to both India and Pakistan. It further documents that this volatility is persistent in all the economies and that it spillovers from both India and Pakistan to Bangladesh. The evidence attributes the economic development in the Indian subcontinent to the economic or policy innovations in attracting FDI. The findings of this study thus contribute to the literature by documenting the contrasting evidence that the volatility along with the trend of FDI contributes to the economic development and by reconciling the contrasting evidence.","[Bairagi, Ranajit] Khulna Univ, Sch Management & Business Adm, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh",Khulna University,"Bairagi, R (通讯作者)，Khulna Univ, Sch Management & Business Adm, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh.",,"Bairagi, Ranajit/HMP-4611-2023",,,,,,33,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2017,40.0,12,,,,,2832,2853,,10.1111/twec.12496,0.0,,,22,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FO8JB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417130900011,0

We use stated-preference (SP) data and present crowding as a mode-neutral crowding level among the standing travelers depicted in images presented to the respondents. We analyze whether there are differences in the willingness to pay (WTP) for comfort and crowding reduction among the three largest urban areas in Sweden. In general, we find no significantly different preferences for sitting and crowding reduction among the three urban areas. Still, the point estimates differ in some cases, indicating that there may be differences across the three urban areas, but the estimates have large confidence intervals that overlap each other. Also, these differences are likely to have resulted from mode-share differences and not from differences in preferences across the urban areas. Some significant differences are found among the modes, for example, a higher disutility of standing on a bus versus on a tram. These mode-specific estimates can be used as policy values for a given tram line or metro line. Nevertheless, we also pooled the data suggesting average WTP estimates for sitting and crowding reductions that can be used for national cost benefit analysis policy in all large urban areas in Sweden where crowding on local public transport occurs. Importantly, analysis of heterogeneity and SP-design differences shows that the results are in line with empirical knowledge of the value of travel time savings.","[Bjorklund, Gunilla; Swardh, Jan-Erik] Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst VTI, Box 55685, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",VTI,"Swärdh, JE (通讯作者)，Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst VTI, Box 55685, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",gunilla.bjorklund@vti.se; jan-erik.swardh@vti.se,"Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023","Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829; Swardh, Jan-Erik/0000-0003-0921-9466",Swedish Transport Administration,Swedish Transport Administration,"The authors are grateful to Staffan Algers for important help and advice regarding the SP method and design of the study, to Henrik Andersson and two anonymous reviewers for valuable suggestions on improving the paper, and to Niclas Kruger for successfully applying for financial support.

The first one is to clarify and put in evidence the isomorphic character of two theories developed in quite different fields: on one side, threshold logic, on the other side, simple games. One of the main purposes in both theories is to determine when a simple game is representable as a weighted game, which allows a very compact and easily comprehensible representation. Deep results were found in threshold logic in the sixties and seventies for this problem. However, game theory has taken the lead and some new results have been obtained for the problem in the past two decades. The second and main goal of this paper is to provide some new results on this problem and propose several open questions and conjectures for future research. The results we obtain depend on two significant parameters of the game: the number of types of equivalent players and the number of types of shift-minimal winning coalitions.","[Freixas, Josep] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Math, Campus Manresa, Manresa 08242, Spain; [Freixas, Marc] Cirprotec, Terrassa 08233, Spain; [Kurz, Sascha] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Math, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya; University of Bayreuth,"Freixas, J (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Math, Campus Manresa, Manresa 08242, Spain.",josep.freixas@upc.edu,,"Freixas, Josep/0000-0002-9033-9432",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO); European Union [MTM2015-66818-P],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO)(Spanish Government); European Union(European Union (EU)),This researchwas partially supported by funds from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) and from the European Union (FEDER Funds) under Grant MTM2015-66818-P (MINECO/FEDER).,,63,12,12,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,DEC,2017,83.0,4,,,,,469,498,,10.1007/s11238-017-9606-z,0.0,,,30,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FN1BM,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000415718300002,0

Hedonic analyses that try to measure the value of this amenity are potentially biased by omitted variables because locations close to water may be selected by households with higher incomes who construct more luxury houses. Because it is difficult to observe all the relevant characteristics, the coefficient for proximity to water may be biased upwards. We circumvent this problem by exploiting a specific characteristic of the Dutch system of planned residential development: often a number of exactly similar houses are constructed close to each other. By comparing the values of such identical houses, we can measure the effect of proximity to water under almost ideal circumstances. Introduction of these fixed effects lowers the estimated impact of this amenity, thereby confirming the conjectured presence of an omitted variable bias.","[Rouwendal, Jan] Vrije Univ, Amsterdam & Tinbergen Inst, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Levkovich, Or] Vrije Univ, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Marwijk, Ramona] Kadaster Netherlands Cadastre, Land Registry & Mapping Agcy, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Rouwendal, J (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ, Amsterdam & Tinbergen Inst, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.rouwendal@vu.nl; o.d.Levkovich@vu.nl; ra-mona.vanmarwijk@kadaster.nl,"; Rouwendal, Jan/G-2478-2011","Levkovich, Or/0000-0002-9962-1354; Rouwendal, Jan/0000-0003-0070-086X",,,,,22,8,8,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1080-8620,1540-6229,,REAL ESTATE ECON,Real Estate Econ.,WIN,2017,45.0,4,,,,,829,860,,10.1111/1540-6229.12143,0.0,,,32,"Business, Finance; Economics; Urban Studies",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Urban Studies,FN6SL,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416146200002,0

As the ethnically diverse workplace is an important social space for the construction of social relations bridging different social groups, the sociology of work needs to develop a better understanding of the way in which linguistic diversity influences the formation of social capital (i.e. resources such as the trust and reciprocity inherent in social relations in such workplaces). Drawing on theories about intergroup contact and intercultural communication, this article analyses interviews with 31 employees from two highly ethnically diverse Danish workplaces. The article shows how linguistic barriers such as different levels of majority language competence and their consequent misunderstandings breed mistrust and hostility, while communication related to collaboration and small talk' may provide linguistic bridges to social capital formation.","[Thuesen, Frederik] SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Dept Employment & Social Inclus, Herluf Trolles Gade 5, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark",,"Thuesen, F (通讯作者)，SFI Danish Natl Ctr Social Res, Dept Employment & Social Inclus, Herluf Trolles Gade 5, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",frt@sfi.dk,,"Thuesen, Frederik/0000-0001-8148-6142",Danish Council for Independent Research,Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)),This research was made possible due to a grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research.,,67,17,19,0,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper therefore focuses on determining and analyzing terminal characteristics that influence efficiency. Our analysis led to a number of conclusions. First, there exist important differences between IWTs and maritime terminals in terms of design capacity and thus also in operations. Different combinations of inputs and output have been tested with the SFA and DEA methodologies. Important terminal inputs turned out to be yard and crane, but also terminal operating hours and terminal area are important. When capacity is excluded as an input it turns out that the importance of inputs becomes more diverse under SFA. Furthermore, when the inputs and output are varied it shows that this leads to a variation in best and worst performers (the efficiency depends on defined inputs and output). Finally, terminal operating hours are an important input for IWTs which is an important difference with maritime terminals which are open 24/7. In terms of how efficiency is defined, there arises a considerable difference between design efficiency (capacity) and the operational efficiency (terminal throughput).","[Wiegmans, Bart] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Transport & Planning, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Witte, Patrick] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Dept Human Geog & Planning, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology; Utrecht University,"Wiegmans, B (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Transport & Planning, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",b.wiegmans@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,29,40,42,1,45,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

In this study, we mitigated this problem by reorganizing left-turning traffic flows within intersections through the use of a left-turn waiting area (LTWA). We proposed a series of design pattern left-turn waiting areas for different combinations of spatial and temporal treatments of left-turn movements: exclusive left-turn lanes with protected left-turn phasing, exclusive left-turn lanes with permitted left-turn phasing, and shared left-turn lanes with permitted left-turn phasing. Based on probability theory, an analytical procedure is developed for estimating the capacity of shared and short lanes. Explicit VISSIM simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the proposed capacity models, and the impact of design parameters for the proposed system on the left-turn capacity are studied. On the basis of the analyses, benefits of the proposed system are identified, and the domain of application where these benefits are most significant is identified. In addition, optimal LTWA design scheme and critical LT volumes of exclusive LT lane and protected LT phase with different LTWA schemes are presented from the operation efficiency perspective.","[Ma, Wanjing; Liu, Ye] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jing] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, 516 Jungong Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ning] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Traff Engn, Bochum, Germany",Tongji University; University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; Ruhr University Bochum,"Ma, WJ (通讯作者)，Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",mawanjing@tongji.edu.cn; 20141iuye@tongji.edu.cn; jing_zhao_traffic@163.com; ning.wu@rub.de,"Ma, Wanjing/F-5400-2014; Zhao, Jing/AAW-9779-2020","Zhao, Jing/0000-0003-0741-4911; Wu, Ning/0000-0002-6901-5521; Ma, Wanjing/0000-0002-9403-3174","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51238008, 51722809]; Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation [151076]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality [15DZ1100800]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(Science & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM)),"The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51238008 and 51722809), the Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation (No. 151076), and the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (No. 15DZ1100800)",,27,34,39,8,90,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The recent 'Great Recession' has brought attention to the vulnerability of many economies around the world to changes in non domestic macroeconomic fluctuations. However, empirical evidence on the responses of adolescents' substance consumption behaviour when the economy deteriorates is very scarce. Thus, the focus of this paper is to analyse the substance consumption patterns displayed by adolescents in response to changes in macroeconomic conditions in a large number of countries. Our results show that beer and wine consumption vary counter-cyclically (a 1pp increase in the unemployment rate increases the probability of drinking beer (wine) by 3% (5.5%)) while adolescent smoking prevalence varies pro-cyclically (a 1pp increase in the unemployment rate decreases the probability of being a current smoker by 3.8%). More importantly, we find that the probability of ever being drunk increases by 1.3% for a 1pp increase in the unemployment rate. Further to this, substantial heterogeneous effects from the aggregate-level results were found when analysing a variety of demographic and geographic dimensions. In light of the existing empirical evidence which outlines that early substance initiators demonstrate worse neurological deficits and suffer stronger labour market penalties (compared to later initiators or abstainers) these findings can aid policy makers in reducing these lasting adverse outcomes.

Among diseases in adulthood, hypertension is particularly important for the developing world because considerably more people there are and will be afflicted with the disease than in the developed world and hypertensives there are often unaware of their disease status. We employed height as a proxy for the influence of early-life conditions and estimated the relation between height and hypertension status in Indonesia. We analysed 9,597 men and 10,143 women, aged 25-70. We employed a linear probability model to relate height to hypertension status by sex and age. When we controlled for an array of covariates, a 10 cm increase in height was related to an approximately 7% point reduction in the likelihood of being hypertensive for both men and women. This is about a quarter of the prevalence of hypertension in Indonesia. This relation was linear and stronger among older individuals. In addition, the pre- and post-pubertal environments (measured by leg and trunk lengths, respectively) contributed similarly to hypertension. Further evidence suggests that women are more likely to be hypertensive at older ages because they are on average shorter than men.

By deepening the analysis of interdependences between daily mobility and life event (relocation) and their relationships with QOL, this article focuses on two challenges. It aims at analyzing how these life events first, encourage travel behavior changes, especially mode choice, and second, improve or decrease people's QOL. By radically changing living context and built environment, relocation also affects routine and satisfaction. These relationships are investigated in the Luxembourg cross-border area, where great differences related to real estate price encourage residential moves from Luxembourg to neighboring countries, while the general decline in public transport efficiency at the border may support car use. We use both mixed and ordered logit models. The first one investigates whether individuals' life-stage changes and residential relocation are significant regarding their mode choice decision. The second estimates individuals' global QOL and the roles of complementary factors (changing housing conditions, built environment, subjective satisfaction, travel time and socio-economic characteristics). The analysis reveals several results. The effect of the different factors is consistent with travel mode choice literature despite the specific cross-border context. Nevertheless, relocation, mainly oriented towards a cross-border suburbanization, significantly increases the probability of using the car for daily activities. These trips and especially the journeys to work are the least satisfactory aspects of daily life after relocation but does not affect the general level of QOL. At the opposite, the better housing conditions after relocation have positive effect on the QOL. From a policy perspective, this life oriented approach in cross-border context confirms the influence of life events on QOL while it demonstrates a higher importance of housing conditions than spatial constraints on relocation and satisfaction.

We start by considering different long-run fundamental target values based on a monetary exchange rate model and compare them with more ad hoc targets. Based on these findings, we explain the intervention probability for the BoJ after 1991 based on an ordered probit model by accounting for subperiods and asymmetric effects. It turns out that estimated fundamentally based values for the exchange rate provide additional information for the decision to intervene, in particular after 1995. However, short-run ad hoc targets seem to be very important, in particular from 1991 until 1995, while medium-run ad hoc targets gain importance at the end of the 1990s. Overall, we find a leaning against the wind' strategy in the event of overvaluation relies on ad hoc targets while intervention in cases of undervaluation seems to be guided more strongly by deviations from fundamental values.","[Beckmann, Joscha] Univ Duisburg Essen, Univ Bochum, Kiel Inst World Econ, Essen, Germany; [Kuehl, Michael] Deutsch Bundesbank, Econ, Frankfurt, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum; University of Duisburg Essen; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Deutsche Bank,"Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Univ Bochum, Kiel Inst World Econ, Essen, Germany.",,"Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019",,,,,,44,1,1,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,1836,1865,,10.1111/twec.12448,0.0,,,30,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900006,0

Hence, no differentiated locational price signals are provided within these zones. If intra-zonal congestion occurs due to missing grid expansion, this market design reveals its inherent incompleteness, and might lead to severe short and long-term distortions. In this paper, we study these distortions with a focus on the impact of restricted grid expansion under zonal markets. Therefore, we use a long-term model of the European electricity system and restrict the allowed expansion of the transmission grid per decade. We find that the combination of an incomplete market design and restricted grid expansion leads to a misallocation of generation capacities and the inability to transport electricity to where it is needed. This results in an energy imbalance in some regions of up to 2-3% and difficulty when reaching envisaged political targets in the power sector.","[Bertsch, Joachim; Hagspiel, Simeon; Just, Lisa] Ewi Energy Res & Scenarios gGmbH, Vogelsanger Str 321a, D-50827 Cologne, Germany; [Bertsch, Joachim; Hagspiel, Simeon; Just, Lisa] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Cologne, Germany; [Brown, Tom] Energynaut GmbH, Robert Bosch Str 7, D-64293 Darmstadt, Germany; [Brown, Tom] Inst Adv Studies, Ruth Moufang Str 1, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany",University of Cologne; Bosch,"Just, L (通讯作者)，Ewi Energy Res & Scenarios gGmbH, Vogelsanger Str 321a, D-50827 Cologne, Germany.",lisa.just@ewi.research-scenarios.de,,"Brown, Thomas/0000-0001-5898-1911",German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; German research society DFG [HO 5108/2-1]; [03ESP239],German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy; German research society DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG));,Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy based on ruling of the Deutsche Bundestag.

We illustrate the relevance of these dynamics for the case of EU-Israeli relations. Since the late 1990s, legal inconsistencies in EU-Israeli co-operation have been addressed by the Commission via soft law, by various MEPs via parliamentary questions, and by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Simultaneously, external actors like NGOs and corporations have used the EU's legal infrastructure to confront the EU with the fact that its de facto relations have not lived up its de jure position.

In this article, on the basis of a study of the implementation of the non-legally binding European Telework and Work-related Stress Agreements in four countries, we attempt to address this gap. Four hypotheses are developed, based on key tenets of VoC theory, which aim to explain divergent national implementation outcomes of the agreements. The predictive power of VoC emerges as mixed. Though a hypothesis concerning the propensity of Coordinated Market Economies (CMEs) to implement the agreements via collective agreements is confirmed, evidence for remaining hypotheses is more ambiguous. Implications for theories of soft law implementation and VoC theory are reflected upon in conclusion.","[Prosser, Thomas] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University,"Prosser, T (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",prossertj@cf.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,3,3,1,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

MDBs raise most of the resources needed for operations from international capital markets rather than government budgets, which greatly increases their financial capacity and attractiveness to member governments. However, this model has a trade-off: MDBs must pay close attention to the perceptions of bond investors, who have little interest in development goals. This paper explores the influence of credit rating agencies (CRAs) on MDB operations, based on an analysis of the methodologies used by CRAs to evaluate MDBs and interviews with MDB financial staff and CRA analysts. The study demonstrates that the methodology used by Standard and Poor's seriously undervalues the financial strength of MDBs, limiting their ability to pursue their development mandate. These findings suggest that MDB dependence on capital market financing may weaken the ability of major shareholder governments to fully control MDB activities.","[Humphrey, Chris] Univ Zurich, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Humphrey, C (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Affolternstr 56, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",christopher.humphrey@pw.uzh.ch,,,,,,,52,21,22,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

In tackling such increases, emphasis is placed on mitigating strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias, which has hindered the public sectors ability to embrace innovation, particularly with regard to the justification and adoption of LRT. More often than not, operational expenditure (OPEX) is neglected, and is not considered a part of the transportation cost performance literature. The aim of this paper is to examine the equivocality that surrounds the determination of cost performance of LRT projects. It is suggested that the public sector should move beyond focusing on strategic misrepresentation and optimism bias, as many governments worldwide now have in place mechanisms to address such issues, and instead focus on future-proofing their assets. It is suggested that the key enablers of future-proofing LRT are (1) private finance; (2) delivery strategy (e.g. design-build-finance-operate); (3) digitization (e.g. building information modelling); and (4) asset management (e.g. smart technologies). If the public sector is to provide an LRT system that is cost effective and able to respond to the demands imposed by climate change, then it needs to be considered from a life cycle perspective and funding sought from the private sector to ensure its viability.

A standard gravity model is enhanced by the STRI indices in a cross-section regression analysis. Services trade restrictions are negatively associated with both imports and exports of services. The surprisingly strong effect on services exports is probably explained by a negative relationship between the STRIs and sector performance indicators. Consequently, services suppliers from less open countries are less competitive abroad. Bilateral differences in regulation are also found to curtail services trade over and above the impact of the trade liberalisation level. At the margin, regulatory differences have a larger effect on trade flows the lower the level of the STRI.","[Nordas, Hildegunn K.; Rouzet, Dorothee] OECD, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Nordås, HK (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,36,39,39,3,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2017,40.0,6,,,,,1155,1183,,10.1111/twec.12424,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,EX3DS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403112800007,0

This article considers a social category that has been overlooked in these debates: disability. It argues that workers with impairments are 'doubly disabled' - in both the labour markets and labour processes of UKF&TV. It concludes that disability cannot simply be incorporated in an additive way in order to understand the exclusion of these workers, but that they face qualitatively different sources of disadvantage compared with other minorities in UKF&TV workplaces. This has negative implications for workers with impairments in other labour markets, as project and network-based freelance work, a contributor to disadvantage, is seen as both increasingly normative and paradigmatic.","[Randle, Keith] Univ Hertfordshire, Hatfield, Herts, England; [Hardy, Kate] Univ Leeds, Work & Employment Relat, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Hertfordshire; University of Leeds,"Randle, K (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, De Havilland Campus,Coll Lane, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",K.R.Randle@herts.ac.uk,,,"European Social Fund as part of the Diversity in Practice project, an EQUAL initiative","European Social Fund as part of the Diversity in Practice project, an EQUAL initiative","This research was funded by the European Social Fund as part of the Diversity in Practice project, an EQUAL initiative.",,54,31,34,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The model predicts the post-disaster population composition of a city, changes in its income distribution and citizen welfare, and changes in the level of public goods. Plausible ex-ante assumptions about urban characteristics lead to a post-disaster city that is smaller, more skill-intensive, and with higher mean educational attainment. The evolution of income inequality is more complex, even though unskilled wages rise, middle-class flight may cause income distribution to worsen. The analysis of disasters' long term impact on fiscal structure and on demographic, income, and human capital distribution, illustrates the interplay of major determinants of resilience after a natural disaster. A stylized New Orleans around the time of its 2005 Katrina disaster is incorporated for realism and used as an example throughout.

The main idea is to expand a solution in a series of powers of a small parameter scaling the uncertainty in the economy around a solution to the deterministic model, i.e. the model where the volatility of the shocks vanishes. If a deterministic path is global in state variables, then so are the constructed solutions to the stochastic model, whereas these solutions are local in the scaling parameter. Under the assumption that a deterministic path is already known the higher order terms in the expansion are obtained recursively by solving linear rational expectations models with time-varying parameters. The present work also proposes a method rested on backward recursion for solving general systems of linear rational expectations models with time-varying parameters and determines the conditions under which the solutions of the method exist.","[Ajevskis, Viktors] Bank Latvia, Monetary Policy Dept, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",,"Ajevskis, V (通讯作者)，Bank Latvia, Monetary Policy Dept, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",ajevsky@latnet.lv,,"Ajevskis, Viktors/0000-0003-2128-7779",,,,,28,1,1,0,0,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We show that these results rely crucially on two assumptions. First, schools need to be restricted to reporting all students as acceptable. Second, students cannot observe the preferences reported by the schools before submitting their own preferences. We show that relaxing either assumption gives schools an incentive to manipulate their reported preferences. We provide a full characterization of undominated strategies for schools and students for the simultaneous move game induced by the Boston mechanism. Nash equilibrium outcomes in undominated strategies of that game may contain unstable matchings. Furthermore, when students observe schools' preferences before submitting theirs, the subgame perfect Nash equilibria of the sequential game induced by the Boston mechanism may also contain unstable matchings. Finally, we show that schools may have an incentive to manipulate capacities only if students observe the schools' strategies before submitting their own preferences.","[Bo, Inacio; Heller, C.

Congressional legislation passed in 1953 assigned state courts the authority to resolve civil disputes on a subset of reservations, while tribal courts retained authority on unaffected reservations. Although affected and unaffected reservations had similar economic conditions when the law passed, reservations under state courts experienced significantly greater long-run growth. When we examine the distribution of incomes across reservations, the average difference in development is due to the lower incomes of the most impoverished reservations with tribal courts. We show that the relative underdevelopment of reservations with tribal courts is driven by reservations with the most uncertainty in court enforcement.","[Brown, James R.] Iowa State Univ, Coll Business, Finance, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Cookson, J.

The action is costly and members tend to free-ride on it. An optimal risk-sharing agreement maximizes the expected utility of a representative member with respect to both the coverage and the (collective) action such that efficiency is restored. We study the sustainability of the optimal agreement as equilibrium in a repeated game with indefinite number of repetitions. When the optimal agreement is not enforceable, the equilibrium with free-riding emerges. We identify an interesting trade-off: welfare generated by the optimal risk-sharing agreement increases with the size of the pool, but at the same time the pool size must not be too large for collective choices to be self-enforcing. This generates a discontinuous effect of pool size on welfare.","[Barigozzi, Francesca; Pignataro, Giuseppe] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Pzza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bourles, Renaud; Henriet, Dominique] CNRS, Cent Marseille Aix Marseille Sch Econ, 38 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie, F-13451 Marseille 20, France; [Bourles, Renaud; Henriet, Dominique] EHESS, 38 Rue Frederic Joliot Curie, F-13451 Marseille 20, France",University of Bologna; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Pignataro, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Pzza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",francesca.barigozzi@unibo.it; renaud.bourles@centrale-marseille.fr; dominique.henriet@centrale-marseille.fr; giuseppe.pignataro@unibo.it,"Bourlès, Renaud/AAJ-3766-2020; Pignataro, Giuseppe/AAI-5145-2020; PIGNATARO, GIUSEPPE/H-8876-2012","Bourlès, Renaud/0000-0001-9537-1258; PIGNATARO, GIUSEPPE/0000-0002-7290-4397",,,,,29,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2017,82.0,2,,,,,273,303,,10.1007/s11238-016-9573-9,0.0,,,31,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EL2BL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394425000006,0

Although not very common, to date several multi-day travel surveys have been conducted and panel data is available to model different transport choices. However, determining the length of a panel that allows revealing variability in travel behaviour remains an open question. Also, no final agreement has been reached about modelling the various dimensions of correlation over the repeated observations. In this paper, we use the six-week panel data from the Mobidrive survey to estimate a mode choice model that accounts for correlation across individual observations over two time periods: all days of a single week and different days of the week (e.g. all Mondays) in the wave. We first analyse these effects separately, estimating different models for each type of correlation; then we try to disentangle the relative effects of each type of correlation, estimating both types jointly. We found that both types of correlation appeared highly significant when estimated alone, while only the correlation across a given day over the six-week period remained significant, when both types were estimated jointly. This implies that for the Mobidrive panel there is much less variability in mode choice across weeks than across the days of each week. It also suggests that one week could be an appropriate length for a panel to estimate modal choice and to correctly reveal day-to-day variability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, there is a ranking in transaction prices among initial purchases by third-party bidders at foreclosure auction, REO sales, non-distressed property sales and the subsequent sales of third-party bidder acquired properties. Third-party bidder auction prices are below REO sale prices, which are below non-distressed property sale prices, which are below the subsequent sale prices of third-party bidder acquired properties.

Unprivileged mulatos are only 0.5 cm shorter than, assumedly privileged, espanoles in the first world (El Bajio) and 1.3 cm taller in the second world (Eastern Central Highlands). In turn, living in the first world implies being between nearly 1.5 cm and 5 cm taller than the inhabitants of the second world. Our estimates of physical statures are placed within an international comparative context and offer a relatively optimistic picture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that any disequilibrium in the long-run cointegrating relationship among these variables is corrected by the subsequent movement in house prices in most of these countries. This error-correction property of house prices implies that most of the variations in house prices are transitory, as compared to the movements in income and interest rates that are permanent, suggesting that the short-run movements in house prices are independent of the movements in income and interest rates. The results suggest that only the permanent movement in house prices, income and interest rates are associated with each other. We also find that the correlation in house price cycles across different OECD countries has changed over time with the highest correlation during the boom period of 1998-2005.","[Kishor, N.

Modern price theory follows Irving Fisher's original claim that discounted streams has universal application and is consequently divorced from any explicit reference to industrial structure.

This model is consistent with the existence of a lower bound for nominal interest rates, which makes it particularly relevant in the current context of extremely low interest rates. Changes in the policy rates depend on the monetary-policy phase, that can be either in an easing, status quo or tightening mode. The estimation of the model, based on daily euro-area yield data, reveals the strong influence of the monetary- policy phases on the shape of the yield curve. This relationship can, in turn, be exploited to estimate the probabilities of being in the different monetary- policy phases. The model is also used to compute term premiums, that are the parts of the yields reflecting the aversion of investors to interest rate risk. The results point to the existence of statistically significant premiums for many dates, even for short horizons.","[Renne, Jean-Paul] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Lausanne,"Renne, JP (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",jean-paul.renne@m4x.org,,"Renne, Jean-Paul/0000-0002-0797-2457",,,,,48,5,5,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

The literature on financialisation and changes in Japanese capitalism assumes convergence on Anglo-American capitalism with a diminishing of state power. The main argument of this paper is that financialisation is instead a more contingent process. This is put forth through an examination of how this process has been mediated by the Japanese state through the workings of the Japanese Post Office. The state has frequently shaped the direction of financialisation by intervening in the routing of household funds via the postal savings system in order to achieve its objectives in different circumstances, particularly evident in the protracted and contested nature of the post bank's privatisation. Financialisation is thus not preordained; instead its path is hewn by crisis, catastrophe, demographics and the agency of domestic social actors.","[Robinson, Gary] Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Robinson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Dept Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",garyrob@gmail.com,"Robinson, Gary/AAX-9411-2020","Robinson, Gary/0000-0002-7582-2557",,,,,107,3,4,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

It is essential to make the companies prevent from bankruptcy through building effective corporate bankruptcy prediction model in time. This study proposes an effective bankruptcy prediction model based on the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). A two-step grid search strategy which integrates the coarse search with the fine search is adopted to train KELM. The resultant bankruptcy prediction model is compared with other five competitive methods including support vector machines, extreme learning machine, random forest, particle swarm optimization enhanced fuzzy k-nearest neighbor and Logit model on the real life dataset via 10-fold cross validation analysis. The obtained results clearly confirm the superiority of the developed model in terms of classification accuracy, Type I error, Type II error and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) criterion. Promisingly, the proposed KELM can serve as a new candidate of powerful early warning systems for bankruptcy prediction with excellent performance.","[Zhao, Dong; Yu, Fanhua] Changchun Normal Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changchun 130032, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chunyu] Changchun Univ Sci Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changchun 130032, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yan] Wenzhou Vocat Coll Sci & Technol, Wenzhou 325006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Mingjing; Chen, Huiling] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Informat, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Changchun Normal University; Changchun University of Science & Technology; Wenzhou University,"Chen, HL (通讯作者)，Wenzhou Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Informat, Wenzhou 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",chenhuiling.jlu@gmail.com,"Chen, Huiling/N-8510-2019; Wang, Mingjing/HCH-5581-2022; chen, huiling/J-2477-2013","Chen, Huiling/0000-0002-7714-9693;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61303113]; Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China [G20140048]; Scientific Research fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department [Y201533884]; Science and Technology Plan Project of Changchun [2012091]; Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission High-tech [[2014]817]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China; Scientific Research fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department; Science and Technology Plan Project of Changchun; Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission High-tech","This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61303113), the Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou, China (G20140048), Scientific Research fund of Zhejiang Provincial Education Department (Y201533884) and the Science and Technology Plan Project of Changchun (2012091), Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission High-tech ([2014]817).",,44,57,57,7,87,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paper uses data from a randomized experiment in the Democratic Republic of Congo to assess the relative impacts and costs of equivalently valued cash and voucher transfers. The voucher program distorted households' purchases along both the extensive and intensive margin as compared with unconstrained cash households. Yet there were no differences in food consumption or other measures of well-being, in part due to the fact that voucher households were able to resell part of what they purchased. As there were no significant benefits to vouchers, cash transfers were the more cost effective modality for both the implementing agency and program recipients in this context.","[Aker, Jenny C.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch & Dept Econ, Dev Econ, 160 Packard Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Aker, JC (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch & Dept Econ, Dev Econ, 160 Packard Ave, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",Jenny.Aker@tufts.edu,,,Concern Worldwide in DRC; UNICEF; Tufts University,Concern Worldwide in DRC; UNICEF; Tufts University,"I thank Concern Worldwide in DRC for their support in all stages of this project and would especially like to thank Feargal O'Connell, Gabrielle Smith, Julia Lewis, Kai Matturi, Saul Butters, Joel Tschite, and the data collection team in DRC.

What used to be a residual asset category known as 'goodwill' has now overtaken so-called fixed or tangible assets in the profitability and valuation of many leading corporations. Yet these intangible assets lead a double life as both spatial and temporal in some dimensions, yet fluid and spatio-temporally elusive in others. Using a framework focused on measuring (by accountants), managing (by corporations) and monitoring (by International Political Economy scholars and regulators), this article explores the longer term implications of accumulation of internationalised capital in intangible and abstract forms, and the prominent role of finance and offshore in giving mobility and fluidity to these forms of capital. The article suggests that while global value chain and global production network analyses have helped researchers and policy-makers to track increasingly fragmented and fluid networks of commodity production, there also is a need to follow the global double life of internationalised and financialised intangible assets and wealth flows, and parallel reorganisations of state forms in response to those transformations.","[Bryan, Dick] Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, H04 Meriwether Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Rafferty, Michael] RMIT Univ, Dept Management, Bldg 080,Level 08,124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Wigan, Duncan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenshavn 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",University of Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Copenhagen Business School,"Wigan, D (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenshavn 24, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",dw.dbp@cbs.dk,,,Jan Wallander Foundation; Norwegian Research Council [212210/H30],Jan Wallander Foundation; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),Jan Wallander Foundation; Norwegian Research Council [grant number 212210/H30],,98,62,68,8,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The results showed that the trainees praised such curriculum highly and benefited from the approach greatly due to its practicability, asynchronous online learning, situated teaching approach, interactive forum and internship programs.","[Chiang, Po-ying; Sui, Feng-ming; Chen, Mei-yun; Chang, Jen-chia] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Grad Inst Technol & Vocat Educ, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology,"Chiang, PY (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Grad Inst Technol & Vocat Educ, Taipei, Taiwan.",,"Chang, Jen-Chia/AAE-9105-2020; Chang, Jen Chia/G-2103-2018","Chang, Jen Chia/0000-0002-7082-6022",,,,,15,0,0,1,10,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-0042,,978-1-60595-495-0,DESTECH TRANS SOC,,,2017,,,,,,,64,68,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BJ8SO,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428761200014,0

In the retail market, consumers do not often observe real-time price changes and pay a pre-determined flat rate, but are able to respond to price over longer time periods. In the wholesale electricity market, buyers are able to adjust their electricity purchases based on real-time price changes. Our findings show that retail industrial customers respond differently in different across states in the Midwest. We also find differences in real-time wholesale price elasticities between sub-regional pricing hubs in the MISO footprint. Results suggest that the observed differences in price responsiveness of demand across market levels and sub-regions are associated with demand response program adoption.","[Eryilmaz, Derya] Navigant Consulting, 1375 Walnut St,Suite 200, Boulder, CO 80302 USA; [Smith, Timothy M.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Bioprod & Biosyst Engn, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Homans, Frances R.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Appl Econ, 1994 Buford Ave N 231E Ruttan Hall, St Paul, MN 55108 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Eryilmaz, D (通讯作者)，Navigant Consulting, 1375 Walnut St,Suite 200, Boulder, CO 80302 USA.",Derya.Eryilmaz@navigant.com; smith463@umn.edu; fhomans@umn.edu,,"Smith, Timothy/0000-0002-0479-4261",Initiative for Renewable Energy and Environment (TREE) grant at the University of Minnesota,Initiative for Renewable Energy and Environment (TREE) grant at the University of Minnesota,"This research is supported by the Initiative for Renewable Energy and Environment (TREE) grant at the University of Minnesota.

These great historical voices, as a result of a society questing for justice and equality, were central to encouragement of racial pride, attachment to black identity, and integration of races. However, the modern black literary voice has shifted to become less provocative and more mainstream. A major reason for this trend may be a false sense of security brought about by the perceived success of the civil rights movement. An analysis of census and other statistical reports reflect significant gaps in educational and economic status compared with the majority general public. The need for strong and vibrant black literary voices stands out to address the misconception of the present day state of blacks.","[Fu, Yao] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Foreign Language Teaching, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Fu, Y (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Dept Foreign Language Teaching, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China.",,,,Educational Reform Project of Shandong University of Finance and Economics [jy201422],Educational Reform Project of Shandong University of Finance and Economics,This research was financially supported by the Educational Reform Project of Shandong University of Finance and Economics.

This essay situates this alleged rise and 'South-South relations' within world market capitalism and discusses their liberating potential with a case study of Chinese mining investment in Ecuador. Despite the ostensibly differing approaches to development embodied in the Chinese and Ecuadorian alternatives to neoliberalism, the Mirador project reveals eerily familiar outcomes, dominated by visions of national modernization and business-state alliances that reproduce market inequalities and postcolonial exclusions. While the Mirador project grants significant economic clout to pursue development through redistributive means, it also attests to the role of the state in opening new market frontiers and securing conditions for transnational capital accumulation. I argue that in this context and similar ones, it is problematic to project the attributes of the South as a symbol of struggle for emancipation on to the nation-state. Although the South remains a useful concept, it should be understood as a space made up by those who are subject to diverse forms of oppression in the name of globalization and national development - a space that is reshaped by the works of the state in multiple and often contradictory ways.","[Gonzalez-Vicente, Ruben] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Gonzalez-Vicente, R (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Leiden, Netherlands.",r.gonzalez.vicente@hum.leidenuniv.nl,,"Gonzalez-Vicente, Ruben/0000-0001-7099-3085","City University of Hong Kong [7200346, 7004359]",City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),This work was supported by City University of Hong Kong under a Start-Up Grant [grant number 7200346]; a Strategic Research Grant [grant number 7004359].,,102,27,29,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

I identify three distinct measures of competition calibrated to authoritarian elections and assess whether voter preferences or regime manipulation best explain the degree of electoral competition. Relying on new data on protests across Russia's regions, I find that regions with high protest activity have more contested elections with narrower margins of victory.

Some scholars suggest that this chronic mismatch will undermine existing multilateral bodies, while others expect the present architecture to persist. This article contends that the outcomes of this challenge are institution-specific. In settings where significant operational realignments are possible within existing mandates and governance structures, the multipolarity-multilateralism conundrum could be partly mitigated. The argument is based on a thematic analysis of all IBRD-IDA loan commitments between 2002 and 2015 in the World Bank's seven all-time top borrowers: Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey (collectively, the Big Seven). The key finding is that while these emerging countries remain the Bank's biggest clients, the terms of their engagement have shifted precisely along the lines where they had already differed from the rest of the Bank's clientele: away from politically onerous governance and institutional reforms, and towards developing physical and market infrastructure while attaining social sustainability. This implicit realignment is facilitated by the Bank's diverse policy repertoire, which allows considerable inter-regional and intra-regional variation in lending patterns to accommodate member preferences.","[Guven, Ali Burak] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Int Relat & Int Polit Econ, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Güven, AB (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Polit, Int Relat & Int Polit Econ, London, England.",a.guven@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,68,15,15,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The buyer has two opportunities to buy: now or later. The buyer can spread the quantity over the two timeslots in any way, as long as the total quantity remains the same. The current price is known, but the future price is not. It is well known that risk neutral buyers purchase in whichever timeslot they expect to be the cheapest, regardless of the uncertainty of the future price. Research suggests, however, that most people may in fact be risk-averse. If the future price is expected to be lower than the current price, but very uncertain, then they may prefer to purchase in the present, or spread the quantity over both timeslots.

Therefore, to be successful and able to compete in this environment, companies must identify and analyze their existing position, define mission, vision, strategic goals and operate more effectively. The key to success is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of all business processes based on measurement and management of their performance. Using performance management system companies can plan, measure and manage the performance of all company activities. Properly designed, created and implemented performance management system can then help the company achieve the desired outputs. The literature, however, states that this is not a simple task, and many companies have problems especially with implementation of these systems. Unfortunately, it is still not quite clear what factors influence successful development, implementation, usage and continuous improvement of the performance management system in companies. There is a gap in the identification of factors influencing the development, implementation, usage and continuous improvement of the performance management system, their detailed study and analysis in practice. For this reason, it is important to deal with the identification, analysis and study of internal and external factors influencing the implementation and continuous improvement of performance management system. The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze internal and external factors influencing the implementation and continuous improvement of the performance management system, which these companies use. In the questionnaire survey is particularly investigated whether managers of surveyed companies are able to identify factors influencing the implementation and continuous improvement of the performance management system. Afterwards is carried out a detailed description of selected key internal factors, and their detailed analysis including identification of the relationship of these factors to the performance management system. Data were obtained by mail questionnaire survey on a sample of large manufacturing and non-manufacturing companies operating in the Czech Republic. The research findings are evaluated within the context of the theoretical background and the conclusions of similar studies.","[Jelinkova, Lucie] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Jelínková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",lucie.jelinkova@upce.cz,"Lendelova, Lucie/IAQ-9945-2023",,project - Economic and social development in private and public sector [SGS_2016_023],project - Economic and social development in private and public sector,This article was created with the support of SGS_2016_023 project - Economic and social development in private and public sector.,,41,1,2,2,10,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,242,256,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.660,0.0,,,15,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200018,0

The authors performed classification and comparative analysis of existing quantitative and qualitative approach to segmentation of market by entrepreneurial structures, performed evaluation of their applicability to management of global entrepreneurship, and developed a new approach and offered a framework strategy of successful market segmentation within crisis management of global entrepreneurship. The most important conclusion of this research is confirmation of the fact that traditional quantitative and qualitative approaches to market segmentation are not applicable within crisis management of global entrepreneurship due to insufficient flexibility of selection of targeted segments. The sense of the process of transformation of approach to market segmentation within crisis management of global entrepreneurship consists in application of more complex logic of market segmentation and selection of its targeted segments depending on the phase of economic cycle.","[Kataeva, Natalia N.; Sanovich, Marina A.; Sozinova, Anastasia A.] Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia; [Marakulina, Irina V.] Vyatka State Agr Acad, Kirov, Russia; [Vasilyuk, Natalia] Platov South Russian State Polytech Univ NPI, 132 Prosvescheniya St, Novocherkassk, Russia",Vyatka State University; Vyatka State Agricultural Academy; Platov South Russian State Polytechnic University,"Kataeva, NN (通讯作者)，Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia.",Natalya-kataeva@yandex.ru; Mdl1972@rambler.ru; sanovich74@mail.ru; 1982nastya1982@mail.ru,"Vasilyuk, Natalia/ABG-5697-2020; Sozinova, Anastasia/F-6298-2015; Marakulina, Irina/AAD-7957-2020; Катаева, Наталья Николаевна/AAB-5555-2022; Sanovich, Marina/JQI-8546-2023","Sozinova, Anastasia/0000-0001-5876-2823; Катаева, Наталья Николаевна/0000-0002-4695-1536; Sanovich, Marina/0000-0002-5557-498X; Marakulina, Irina/0000-0001-7054-6373",,,,,17,2,2,0,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-60696-5; 978-3-319-60695-8,CONTRIB ECON,,,2017,,,,,,,491,496,,10.1007/978-3-319-60696-5_62,0.0,,,6,Economics; Management; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ5OF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426114200062,0

The result shows that Taiwanese direct investment has not been able to bring direct technology spillover effect to agricultural products processing industry in mainland China. However, it can improve the overseas openness of agricultural products processing industry in mainland China and reduce the technical gap between the two sides of the mainland. And then it will have indirect technology spillover effect on the agricultural products processing industry in mainland China.

Whilst not coherent citizenship-centred projects of regionalism, SADC and UNASUR have developed institutional competences to address the health-poverty nexus, though their policy development practices and methods take quite different forms. Theoretically, the paper develops a framework addressing three key claims: (i) poverty and welfare need to be brought in to the study of regional governance; (ii) the agency of Southern regional organisations in the generation and diffusion of norms needs to be taken more seriously in the literature and in practice; and (iii) context matters for whether and how regional organisations provide normative leadership; act as brokers in a (re)distributive way; or as advocacy actors in a political way, enabling claims at different levels of governance.","[Riggirozzi, Pia] Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Riggirozzi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Southampton, Hants, England.",p.riggirozzi@soton.ac.uk,,"Riggirozzi, Pia/0000-0001-5809-890X",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/L005336/1]; ESRC [ES/L005336/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L005336/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was carried out with support from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Grant Ref.

Waqf assets were utilized for religious, social and economic purposes. Other than for funding religious activities, one of the popular usage of waqf is to fund education. Historically, waqf had a vital role in providing assistance to all levels of education, particularly institutes of higher learning (IHL). Waqf funds were used for development of IHL's physical infrastructure, academic activities as well as providing allowance for needy students. Despite the important role of waqf in ensuring accessibility to education, one of the area that the potential of waqf is not fully explored is the usage of waqf to develop entrepreneurs among students in IHLs. Promoting entrepreneurship among students is one of the focus of many education providers especially in developing countries such as Malaysia. However, studies shown that only a minority of the students were interested to become entrepreneurs or only chose entrepreneurship as their last career choice. Among the reasons cited was the influence of behavioral factors and the lack of capital to undertake entrepreneurial activities in IHLs. As for the latter, the availability of waqf fund in assisting would be entrepreneurs among IHL's student is a promising alternative. Based on the extended Theory of Perceived Behavior (TPB), this study examines the influence of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavior control on waqf-based entrepreneurial intentions among students. Waqf fund for entrepreneurs is faith-based and its existence is not widely aware especially among the younger part of the population, as such this study also introduced two variables namely religiosity and waqf awareness into the TPB model. A survey of 400 hundred students at various IHLs in Malaysia was conducted for this study. Partial Least Square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for the analysis. This study provides support that attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavior control, religiosity and waqf awareness are significant predictors for waqf-based entrepreneurial intention.","[Salleh, Nurjannah] Univ Teknol MARA, Melaka, Malaysia; [Noor, Abd Halim Mohd; Roni, Mohd Saiyidi Mokhtar Mat] Univ Teknol MARA, Accounting Res Inst, Melaka, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Salleh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol MARA, Melaka, Malaysia.",nuurjana@gmail.com; drabdhalim@bdrmelaka.uitm.edu.my; saiyidi@yahoo.com,"Roni, Saiyidi Mat/H-3481-2011",,"Accounting Research Institute, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Malaysia [600-RMI/ARI_IRES 5/3(0006/2016)]","Accounting Research Institute, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Malaysia","The researchers would like to acknowledge the grant (600-RMI/ARI_IRES 5/3(0006/2016)) provided by the Accounting Research Institute, Universiti Teknologi Mara, Malaysia for this study",,30,2,2,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,701,709,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300071,0

Then in 2013, the prison population was halved through a mass amnesty. Did this punitiveness and its sudden relaxation after 2012 impact attitudes to the law? We find that these attitudes remained negative regardless of levels of punitiveness. Furthermore, the outcomes of sentencing may be less important than procedures leading to sentencing. Procedural justice during both punitiveness and liberalisation was not assured. This may explain the persistence of negative attitudes to law. The Georgian case shows that politically-driven punitive turns or mass amnesties are unlikely to solve the problem of legal nihilism in the region.","[Slade, Gavin] Univ Glasgow, Cent & East European Studies, 8-9 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland; [Kupatadze, Alexander] Kings Coll London, Kings Russia Inst, Virginia Woolf Bldg,22 Kingsway Rd, London WC2B 6LE, England; [Kupatadze, Alexander] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, Virginia Woolf Bldg,22 Kingsway Rd, London WC2B 6LE, England",University of Glasgow; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London,"Slade, G (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Cent & East European Studies, 8-9 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland.",gavin.slade@glasgow.ac.uk; alexander.kupatadze@kcl.ac.uk,"Slade, Gavin/V-9757-2019",,,,,,111,5,5,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,6,,,,,879,896,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1357165,0.0,,,18,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FF4TT,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408950600002,0

After being subject to severe criticism, terminology of functionalism is still a part of the lexicon of social scientists nowadays. Functionalist reasoning and concepts of functionalism are used in sociology, political science and economics, even though often without full awareness of its theoretical implications. Recent revival of interest in the works by Elias is connected with the search for a new theoretical and methodological foundation of sociology but his views on functionalism have remained largely unexplored. For the analysis presented in this paper, main theoretical works by Giddens and major works by Elias have been used. Positions of the authors have been analysed with respect to main concepts and principles of functionalism, such as function, needs, internalization of values, consensus, equilibrium, and the notions of power and individual. The study shows that while Giddens strived to reject functionalism and the concept of social function altogether, in the figurational approach developed by Elias it is possible to use some of the concepts of functionalism without necessarily accepting its controversial tenets.","[Snitnikovs, Aleksejs] Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Snitnikovs, A (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,1,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2017,,,,,,,401,413,,10.17770/sie2017vol4.2449,0.0,,,13,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP8NT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000566189200035,0

Clusters enhance the competitiveness of enterprises, stimulate the production of goods and services which will generate revenue in domestic and international markets. Croatia, as a transition country, is faced with many problems, such as declining competitiveness, lack of direct foreign investments, decline of export. Additionally, a major problem is the fact that there are a lot of small enterprises in Croatia that compete with each other. While a number of years is necessary for cluster development from the bottom up, the state is trying to influence cluster development and accelerate the process of cluster assembly. The Poljomehanizacija cluster is one the more successful examples in Croatia, while it clearly shows all the positive effects of clusterization on increasing small enterprise productivity inside a cluster, as well as a cluster in general.","[Sopta, Martina; Zelic, Ana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Sopta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",msopta@efzg.hr; anazelic23@gmail.com,"Sopta, Martina/I-1163-2018","Sopta, Martina/0000-0001-7205-4989",,,,,30,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,220,242,,,,,,23,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000023,0

Reflection from the perspective of an organization's resilience implies, alongside continued security attention and integration, also a departure from traditional approaches to designing an organization. Although the endeavor to create design resilient systems is a step away from the traditional principles of risk management - in this paper we explore the possibilities of using the Monte Carlo simulation technique to determine some of the characteristic design parameters of the organizational working units. We focused the problem of asset portfolio, inventories and equipment with different levels of importance for the performance of business processes. Particular attention is paid to vulnerabilities and protection of information systems and information communication technologies. Offices space model has been created, which contains the characteristic material resources, process supporting equipment, and it is assumed that there is a probability of a fire in one such space. A number of scenarios for which simulations were conducted, regarding the outbreak and spread of fires, were elaborated. The results of these scenarios point to the different sizes of the expected time of direct threats to certain assets items by the fire and to the different levels of expected damage. Furthermore, predictions are not just about the expected damage of property, but also about the degradation of organizational capabilities of performing the processes. In accordance with these results, it is possible to formulate certain recommendations regarding the approach to system's design in terms of improving organizational elasticity as well as certain recommendations related to the development of the proactive components of organizational resilience.","[Vucina, Davor; Fabac, Robert] Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Vucina, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat, Zagreb, Croatia.",dvucina@foi.hr; rfabac@foi.hr,"Fabac, Robert/HII-6702-2022",,,,,,52,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,494,506,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300049,0

Later, in 1840, this office developed into an independent Directorate of administrative statistics. The radical quantitative development and significant modernization of work of the Directorate happened mainly thanks to Karl Czoernig (1804-1889), who led the Austrian national statistics in the years 1841-1865. The transition from a mechanical summarization of less credible data inconsistently collected by auxiliary officers to a professional statistical processing and later to scientific analysis of the results started already in 1840s thanks to the father of Austrian official statistics. Czoernig put huge importance on the necessary qualification of his staff and, he was in charge of the series of lectures on statistics for employees of various central offices of the monarchy. Management of the Austrian state statistics joined the starting international cooperation in the field. The third International Statistical Congress was held in year 1857 in Vienna. Following the model of Quetelet of Brussels the Central Statistical Commission was founded in Austria in 1863 as the authority managing the Directorate of administrative statistics. Czoernig became the first president of this commission. He was born in Cernousy (Tschernhausen) in North Bohemia (near Szklarska Poreba), he studied law in Prague and Vienna. He was conferment for merits in year 1852 as Freiherr von Czernhausen. From his extensive scientific activities and publications, we focus primarily on several notable early works related to Bohemia.","[Zavodsky, Prokop; Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Závodsky, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",prokop.zavodsky@vse.cz; ondrej.simpach@vse.cz,,,Internal Grant of the University of Economics Prague [39/2017],Internal Grant of the University of Economics Prague,This paper was supported by the Internal Grant of the University of Economics Prague no. 39/2017 Initial development of activities of the State Statistical Office.

The mid-sized city of Kingston, Ontario has recently introduced three express transit routes. Drawing from a longitudinal sample of university employees working in downtown Kingston (n = 906), we measured change in ridership and transit-related attitudes over time, and modelled the factors that best predict who will shift to transit for their commute. From 2013 to 2016, year-round transit mode share doubled, from 3.9% to 7.8%, while attitudes towards Kingston Transit grew more favourable. Transit shifters were most likely to: be female; have lower household income; live 5-10 km from campus; not have a Queen's parking permit in 2013; and be willing to spend at least 21 min on transit. These findings offer valuable insights for further increasing transit uptake in Kingston.","[Collins, Patricia A.; MacFarlane, Robert] Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, 99 Univ Ave,Mackintosh Corry Hall,Room E208, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Collins, PA (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Geog & Planning, 99 Univ Ave,Mackintosh Corry Hall,Room E208, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.",patricia.collins@queensu.ca; r.macfarlane@queensu.ca,,,,,,,54,4,4,4,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Recent contributions to Work, employment and society have highlighted challenges for engaged research. Based on the emancipatory epistemologies of Bourdieu, Gramsci and Burawoy, the authors examine moral challenges in workplace fieldwork, question the assumptions of mainstream ethics discourses and seek to identify an alternative approach. Instead of an ethics premised on a priori, universal precepts that treasure academic neutrality, this article recognises a morality that responds to the social context of research with participation and commitment. The reflection in this study is based on fieldwork conducted in the former Soviet Union. Transformation societies present challenges to participatory ethnography but simultaneously provide considerable opportunities for developing an ethics of truth. An approach that can guide engaged researchers through social conflict's 'messy' reality should hinge on loyalty to the emancipation struggles of those engaged in it.","[Morrison, Claudio] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London, England; [Sacchetto, Devi] Univ Padua, Sociol Work, Padua, Italy",Middlesex University; University of Padua,"Morrison, C (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, London NW4 4BT, England.",c.morrison@mdx.ac.uk,,"Sacchetto, Devi/0000-0002-3087-680X",,,,,44,3,3,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper uses the monthly data of CO2 emissions and FDI from January 1997 to December 2013 to analyze the regime states, switching probability and regime correlation between FDI and CO2 emissions with the help of nonlinear Markov-switching vector error correction model (MS-VECM), The results indicate that the influence of FDI on CO2 emissions shows the two-regime dynamic characteristics, FDI has played a stimulating role in promoting China's CO2 emissions during the period from January 1997 to October 2003, while played an inhibiting role during the period from November 2003 to December 2013. The duration of the inhibiting effect of FDI on CO2 emissions is longer, and the frequency is higher than that of the stimulating effect. Therefore, the overall influence of FDI on CO2 emissions during the period from January 1997 to December 2013 is inhibitive, which means FDI has contributed to CO2 emissions reduction. The innovation points of this study are mainly reflected in the following two aspects: first, nonlinear MS-VECM is introduced to dynamically study the relationship between FDI and CO2 emissions in contrast to prior studies that simply use static analysis method; second, the effect of China's foreign investment policies on CO2 emissions is evaluated in each period according to the empirical results of MS-VECM.","[Pan, Xiongfeng; Zhang, Jing; Li, Changyu; Quan, Rong] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Management & Econ, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China; [Li, Bin] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Li, B (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",libinsjtu@sohu.com,,,"National nature science Foundation Project [71734001, 71303029]; Liaoning province Social Science Fund Project [L16BJL002]; National nature science Foundation; Liaoning province Social Science Foundation",National nature science Foundation Project(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Liaoning province Social Science Fund Project; National nature science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Liaoning province Social Science Foundation,"This paper is the stage achievement of National nature science Foundation Project (71734001, 71303029), Liaoning province Social Science Fund Project (L16BJL002).

For the optimal forecast combination, SDE will minimize the cumulative density functions of the levels of loss at different quantiles of the forecast error distribution by combining different time-series model-based forecasts. Using two exchange rate series on weekly data for the Japanese yen/US dollar and US dollar/Great Britain pound, we find that the optimal forecast combinations with SDE weights perform better than different forecast selection and combination methods for the majority of the cases at different quantiles of the error distribution. However, there are also some very few cases where some other forecast selection and combination model performs equally well at some quantiles of the forecast error distribution. Different forecasting period and quadratic loss function are used to obtain optimal forecast combinations, and results are robust to these choices. The out-of-sample performance of the SDE forecast combinations is also better than that of the other forecast selection and combination models we considered.","[Pinar, Mehmet] Edge Hill Univ, Business Sch, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, Lancs, England; [Stengos, Thanasis] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Yazgan, M.

Some of these features are obvious to buyers and sellers (visible) and others are not easily observed (hidden). Prior research on the relationship between mitigation features and house prices has implicitly assumed the features are known and that buyers and sellers are equally informed. This paper contributes to the literature by examining the potentially different effects of the visible and hidden features, and the verification of each by professional inspection, on prices in an environment of incomplete and asymmetric buyer-seller information. Generally, findings are consistent with expectations - that visible mitigation features are positively correlated with price increases; that the effects of the visible and hidden features on price differ significantly; and that inspection information significantly increases the implicit price of hidden features. Interestingly, the inspection is found to also increase the implicit price of the set of visible features, suggesting the implicit prices of characteristics that are, or should be, visible to buyers and sellers may be affected by verification or disclosure.","[Gatzlaff, Dean] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Real Estate Ctr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [McCullough, Kathleen; Nyce, Charles M.] Florida State Univ, Dept Risk Management Insurance, Coll Business, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Medders, Lorilee] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Florida Catastroph Storm Risk Management Ctr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Gatzlaff, D (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Real Estate Ctr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",dgatzlaff@fsu.edu; kmccullough@fsu.edu; lmedders@fsu.edu; cnyce@fsu.edu,,,,,,,46,6,8,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

An unusual feature of the Spanish Commercial Code allowed the Justice Ministry to authorize the form by fiat. The SRL did not have a statutory basis until 1953. Thus SRLs formed between 1919 and 1953 relied on other sources for their rules. These early SRLs had distinctive ownership, governance, and capital-structure patterns. Most entrepreneurs creating SRLs modeled their firms on partnerships, but some pushed the form in the corporation's direction.","[Guinnane, Timothy W.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, Box 208269, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Martinez-Rodriguez, Susana] Univ Murcia, Dept Appl Econ, Reg Campus Int Excellence,Campus Mare Nostrum, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",Yale University; University of Murcia,"Guinnane, TW (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, Box 208269, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",timothy.guinnane@yale.edu; susanamartinezr@um.es,"Martinez-Rodriguez, Susana/AAM-9066-2020; MARTINEZ-RODRIGUEZ, SUSANA/AED-1493-2022","MARTINEZ-RODRIGUEZ, SUSANA/0000-0002-0710-6030",National Science Foundation; Yale University Economic Growth Center; McMillan Center at Yale; MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Espana) [HAR2013-42013-R],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Yale University Economic Growth Center; McMillan Center at Yale; MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Espana),"This research was partially funded by the National Science Foundation, the Yale University Economic Growth Center, the McMillan Center at Yale, and the MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Espana) (HAR2013-42013-R).",,48,3,4,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The government has backed this growth through the extensive development of airport infrastructure across the country. However, airline companies in India, periodically face financial distress as the internal and external environmental factors change dynamically. Company management, acting as the agent for all the stakeholders, needs to ensure that the distress condition does not develop into a bankruptcy situation. It needs to identify all those factors, which have a major impact on the financial condition of the company and monitor them continuously using various tools and techniques. These identified key factors could be from both the internal conditions of the company and from the external environment that the industry operates. By identifying these influencing factors early, management can take preventive measures before the distress condition becomes critical. Informed decisions can be taken when the value of these key parameters change over time. To identify and rank these key factors in terms of relative importance, this paper adopts a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach based on the technique of fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Processing (AHP). Robustness of the method is further tested through sensitivity analysis. The study finds that financial factors are the most critical and categorized as a major influence on the commercial stability of the airlines. Among these, operating revenue per air kilometer is the key variable for this sector. Operational factors, which are an indicator of the capacity and cost structure of the company, are ranked next, with the load factor taking the highest rank in this category. From the external environment aviation, fuel price per liter is ranked highest among all the factors and has a major impact on the profitability of the airline in India. Results also show that annual inflation and GDP growth rate in the country has a major influence on the sustainability of the airlines in India.","[Mahtani, Umesh S.] Goa Inst Management, Dept Finance & Accounting, Poriem, Goa, India; [Garg, Chandra Prakash] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Business, Dept Transportat Management, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttar Pradesh, India",Goa Institute of Management; University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES),"Garg, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Business, Dept Transportat Management, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttar Pradesh, India.",umesh@gim.ac.in; cpgarg86@gmail.com,"Mahtani, Umesh/AGF-9770-2022; Mahtani, Umesh/GLU-3555-2022","PRAKASH, CHANDRA/0000-0002-0619-215X; Mahtani, Umesh/0000-0003-3836-7089",,,,,67,64,66,4,87,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This paper develops an instrument which assists the ports' infrastructure investment-decision-making. A three-step approach is developed by combining the autoregressive distributed lag model with economic scenarios to capture the potential impact of specific risks. The empirical analysis is based on an annual time series (1995-2017) for the total container throughput measured in twenty-foot equivalent units for the main ports within the Hamburg-Le Havre (H-LH) range and a number of economic indices. The study shows that there exists a long-run relationship between the trade indices of EU19 and the total container throughput. The empirical model estimates that the elasticity of the container throughput in the H-LH range to trade indices is about 1.4 on average, and it shows that the moment at which congestion emerges depends strongly on the specific scenario considered.","[Rashed, Yasmine; Meersman, Hilde; Sys, Christa; Van de Voorde, Eddy; Vanelslander, Thierry] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, Antwerp, Belgium; [Rashed, Yasmine] Arab Acad Sci Technol & Maritime Transport, Cairo, Egypt","University of Antwerp; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport","Rashed, Y (通讯作者)，Coll Int Transport & Logist, POB 2033, Cairo, Egypt.",yasmine.rashed@uantwerp.be; hilde.meersman@uantwerp.be; christa.sys@uantwerp.be; eddy.vandevoorde@uantwerp.be; thierry.vanelslander@uantwerp.be,"Rashed, Yasmine/Y-3272-2019; Sys, Christa/S-4101-2018; Vanelslander, Thierry/I-6083-2015","Sys, Christa/0000-0001-5962-334X; Vanelslander, Thierry/0000-0001-5213-3444; Rashed, Yasmine/0000-0002-9019-9687","BNP Paribas Fortis Chair on Transport, Logistic and Ports at the University of Antwerp","BNP Paribas Fortis Chair on Transport, Logistic and Ports at the University of Antwerp","The authors would like to thank the BNP Paribas Fortis Chair on Transport, Logistic and Ports at the University of Antwerp for the financial support of the research.",,33,37,38,5,58,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,1879-2375,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Using a multiprovincial survey data set from China National Tourism Administration, we developed a utility-consumption model to empirically analyze the consumption effects of Weekend Getaway, Paid Leave, National Day Golden Week Holiday, and National Festivals and Memorial Days (NFMDs). Results show that while the consumption effects of the first three types of holiday are significant and robust, the effect of NFMDs on tourism consumption is not statistically significant. This suggests that the first three types of holiday in China may function more effectively than NFMDs in promoting willingness to travel and tourist consumption.

Strong trademark protection can lower consumers' costs of searching for preferred quality characteristics. With weak trademark protection, firms in developing countries may not be willing to provide high-quality products. With strong trademark protection, firms have an incentive to maintain or improve quality over time in order not to erode the value of their trademarks. By solving the theoretical model, we show that strengthened trademark protection in developing countries may induce domestic firms to become exporters and raise the quality of products on the export market. The welfare analyses show that strengthened trademark protection in developing countries benefits Southern customers and firms producing high-quality products, but harms firms producing counterfeits and uninformed customers, if firm H charges low prices. Given firm H charges a high price, the strengthened trademark protection only helps firm H and informed customers in the South while leaves the others unaffected.","[Yang, Lei] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xiaopeng; He, Yin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Dept Int Trade, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; University of International Business & Economics,"Yang, L (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Business, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,"YANG, Lei/0000-0002-0237-5821",,,,,10,1,1,0,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,3242,3254,,10.1111/twec.12468,0.0,,,13,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200016,0

One aspect of this emphasis on innovation is the assumption that innovation leads to tangible business outcomes that can sustain the competitiveness of industries and create jobs. This study examines the relationship between product and process innovation and profitability and employment growth using a unique set of cross-sectional data from the Georgia Manufacturing Survey over three time periods of 2005, 2010, and 2016. The results failed to show a connection between innovation and firm performance in the 2010 and 2016 periods. One implication from the 2010 and 2016 results is that standard product and process improvements may not be enough to achieve benefits in 2010 and 2016, because manufacturers may be having difficulty appropriating profits from these innovation practices in today's globally competitive climate. The results suggest a need for more nuanced measurement of innovation in associating it with business outcomes.","[Youtie, Jan] Georgia Inst Technol, Econ Dev Lab, 75 Fifth St,Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Shapira, Philip] Georgia Inst Technol, Publ Policy, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Shapira, Philip] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester Inst Innovat Res, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Enterprise, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Roper, Stephen] Univ Warwick, Enterprise Res Ctr, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Youtie, J (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Econ Dev Lab, 75 Fifth St,Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.",jan.youtie@innovate.gatech.edu,"Youtie, Jan Linker/L-4166-2019; Shapira, Philip/E-4638-2011","Youtie, Jan Linker/0000-0002-9759-5252; Shapira, Philip/0000-0003-2488-5985","Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership; National Institute of Standards and Technology under NIST [SB1341-03-Z-0014, 67142]",Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership; National Institute of Standards and Technology under NIST,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was undertaken with support from the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the National Institute of Standards and Technology under NIST Contract No. SB1341-03-Z-0014, order no. 67142 Innovation Activity.",,35,2,2,1,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Explanations are based on the uncertain outcome and high costs of R&D effort. When providing credit, the lender assesses the creditworthiness of the borrower. She relies on financial data and market analysis. The financial data analysis reveals costs and the market outlook is linked to the uncertainty of future profitability. In this paper we examine whether the credit assessment behaviour of banks hurts firms of a more innovative sector more and how this affects long term innovative success and economic development. We use an evolutionary approach a la Nelson and Winter but with two sectors. A bank provides credit and supplies it to single firms based on a rating. We illuminate the impact of rating process characteristics on the long term outcome. When the bank does not distinguish for sector-specific features, such as risk and market outlook, the high-tech sector benefits over-proportionally because the surviving firms have a high profitability and further innovations are more likely. The way that the bank forms expectations about the market outlook influences the allocation of credit between sectors. The innovative sector is supplied more credit if the market outlook is assessed in a rather conservative fashion. The impact on aggregates however, is limited because the bank uses other pieces of information as well.",,,,p-assmuth@gmx.de,,,DFG [GRK 1134/2],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work was carried out within the International Research Training Group EBIM (Economic Behavior and Interaction Models) financed by the DFG under contract GRK 1134/2.

Urban trees generate flows of ecosystem services in arid areas, but also require significant amounts of irrigation. In this paper, a bioeconomic-health model of trees and water use is developed to investigate management of an urban forest canopy when irrigation is costly, water has economic value, and trees provide ecosystem services. The optimal tree irrigation decision is illustrated for Albuquerque, New Mexico, an arid Southwest US city. Using a range of monetary values for water, we find that the tree irrigation decision is sensitive to the value selected. Urban deforestation is optimal when the value of water is sufficiently high, or alternatively starts low, but grows to cross a specific threshold. If, however, the value of water is sufficiently low or if the value of tree cover rises over time, then deforestation is not optimal. The threshold value of water where the switch is made between zero and partial deforestation is well within previously identified ranges on actual water values. This model can be applied generally to study the tradeoffs between urban trees and water use in arid environments.","[Jones, Benjamin A.] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 1 Univ New Mexico,MSC 05 3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Fleck, John] Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, Water Resources Program, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA",University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico,"Jones, BA (通讯作者)，Univ New Mexico, Dept Econ, 1 Univ New Mexico,MSC 05 3060, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",bajones@unm.edu,,,,,,,77,7,7,0,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2382-624X,2382-6258,,WATER ECON POLICY,Water Econ.

In contrast to 'traditional' methods based on linear-quadratic (LQ) techniques, this derivative-free method is very flexible with regard to the objective function specification. The proposed method is applied to a three-player dynamic game and tested versus a derivative-dependent method in approximating solutions of different game specifications. In particular, we consider a dynamic game between fiscal (played by national governments) and monetary policy (played by a central bank) in a monetary union. Apart from replicating results of the LQ-based techniques in a standard setting, we solve two 'non-standard' extensions of this game (dealing with an inequality constraint in a control variable and introducing asymmetry in penalties of the objective function), identifying both a cooperative Pareto and a non-cooperative open-loop Nash equilibria, where the traditional methods are not applicable. We, thus, demonstrate that the proposed method allows one to study more realistic problems and gain better insights for economic policy.","[Savin, Ivan] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Econ Policy, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Savin, Ivan] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7522, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Klagenfurt, France; [Savin, Ivan] Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Klagenfurt, Russia; [Blueschke, Dmitri; Blueschke-Nikolaeva, Viktoria] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt Am Worthersee, Klagenfurt, Austria",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Ural Federal University,"Savin, I (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Chair Econ Policy, Karlsruhe, Germany.;Savin, I (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, UMR 7522, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Klagenfurt, France.;Savin, I (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Klagenfurt, Russia.",Ivan.Savin@kit.edu; Dmitri.Blueschke@aau.at; viktoria.blueschke-nikolaeva@aau.at,"Savin, Ivan/P-9035-2016","Savin, Ivan/0000-0002-9469-0510; Blueschke, Dmitri/0000-0002-5493-1893; Bluschke-Nikolaeva, Viktoria/0000-0001-8911-8774","German Science Foundation [DFG RTG 1411]; Helmholtz Association [HIRG-0069]; Projex CSES, Initiative d'Excellence, Universite de Strasbourg; RFBR [18-010-01190]","German Science Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Helmholtz Association(Helmholtz Association); Projex CSES, Initiative d'Excellence, Universite de Strasbourg; RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR))","This work has benefited from a presentation at the WEHIA workshop in Nice.

The data were collected from randomly selected 239 farmers in June 2017. The data set were gathered by using a structured questionnaire with Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.946. According to the result, farmers had favorable perception in issues related to sustainable agricultural practices such as protection of agricultural resources, negative effects of agrochemicals on human health and the environment, input application, crop rotation, minimum tillage etc. In addition, the study revealed that agricultural programs on TV and radio, credit use and cooperative partnership were factors that affected farmers' sustainable agriculture perceptions. The study investigated farmers' sustainable agriculture perception, not predict whether farmers will adopt sustainable agriculture practices or whether they did them. Hence, it is necessary that further research should be conducted to find out whether farmers are likely to do so or whether really they did them.","[Hayran, Seyit; Gul, Aykut] Univ Cukurova, Dept Agr Econ, Adana, Turkey; [Saridas, Mehmet Ali] Univ Cukurova, Dept Hort, Adana, Turkey",Cukurova University; Cukurova University,"Hayran, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cukurova, Dept Agr Econ, Adana, Turkey.",shayran@cu.edu.tr,"saridas, mehmet/AFU-5425-2022; Gül, Aykut/J-1888-2018; hayran, seyit/G-7522-2018","hayran, seyit/0000-0002-0223-8034; saridas, mehmet ali/0000-0002-5180-1874",,,,,35,12,12,4,22,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2018,17.0,3,,,,,69,78,,10.30682/nm1803f,0.0,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HG5EB,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454998000007,0

This transition is characterized by an increase in per capita total calorie intake resulting from an increase in the consumption of fat and protein while the carbohydrate consumption decreases. This paper proposes to highlight the sociodemographic drivers of this transition over the period 2004-2014, using Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey data. We implement a method of decomposition of between-year differences in economic outcomes recently proposed in the literature. This method decomposes the between-year change in various indicators related to the outcome distribution (mean, median, quantiles, etc.) into (1) the effect due to between-year change in the conditional distribution of the outcome given sociodemographic characteristics, or structure effect, and (2) the effect due to the differences in sociodemographic characteristics across years, or composition effect. In turn, this last effect is decomposed into direct contributions of each sociodemographic characteristics and effects of their interactions. The composition effect, always positive, generally outweighs the structure effect when considering the between-year changes in distributions of per capita calorie intake or calorie intake coming from protein or fat. The effects of changes in the composition of the Vietnamese population thus overcome the effects of changes in preferences of the same population. This finding is reversed in the case of carbohydrates. Food expenditure and household size appear to be the main contributors to the composition effect. The positive effects of these two variables explain well most of the between-year shifts observed in the calorie intake distributions. Urbanization and level of education contribute negatively to the composition effect, with the noticeable exception of fat where the effect of urbanization is positive. But these two variables effects are negligible compared to those of food expenditure and household size. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The existing literature presents mixed results. More evidence is required from contexts that have not been explored in the literature, and using clinically-measured health outcomes. Using data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), and exploiting a policy change in the 1960s that eliminated public secondary school fees, we investigate whether additional years of schooling for those with lower socio-economic status (SES) have a causal effect on the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in later life. We find significant sizable effects of education on the prevalence of both hypertension and diabetes. An additional year of schooling decreases the probability of having hypertension by approximately 3% points, and decreases the probability of having diabetes by approximately 1% point, effects that are large given existing prevalence. Further analysis of possible mechanisms shows that additional schooling increases the probability of engaging in high levels of physical activity and refraining from smoking. In the context of an increasing focus on strategies to prevent chronic disease, evidence such as this provides important insights for policymakers tasked with designing public health interventions targeting risk factors for chronic disease.

We follow the performance of firms that first received the credit in 2012 when the amount of credit provided went up dramatically in 2012. We use propensity score matching to construct a control group of firms with which we compare the credit-receiving firms before and after 2012 in a difference-in-differences framework. These firms have increased their exports substantially in the following years compared to the matched firms with similar propensities to receive the rediscount credit. We find that firms that received the rediscount credit increased their exports by 65% and total sales by 19% compared to matched firms. We find no statistically significant effects on domestic sales and profits.

While at the product level, the pattern of specialisation barely changed, exporters exhibit new dynamics in international markets: firms not only expanded sales abroad by increasing their exports in existing markets, but also by entering into new destinations and adding new products. That is, new export strategies allowed exporters achieve greater resistance to the variations in the macroeconomic environment. We find that the importance of the different export margins changes overtime: while the currency is depreciated, the intensive margin explains most of export growth, whereas the subextensive and extensive margins become the main source of export growth once the currency appreciates. We also uncover a strong complementarity between import and export growth.","[Albornoz, Facundo] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England; [Albornoz, Facundo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Nottingham, England; [Lembergman, Ezequiel Garcia] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA; [Juarez, Leticia] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Nottingham; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Nottingham, England.;Albornoz, F (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Nottingham, England.",,,"Albornoz, Facundo/0000-0001-8123-0550",,,,,30,2,2,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2018,41.0,8,,,SI,,2129,2148,,10.1111/twec.12653,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GQ1ZZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441445000010,0

To address this issue we exploit a unique natural experiment in Britain: the closure of thousands of train stations, known as the Beeching Cuts, on the eve of General Election of 1964. We use several statistical methods to show that policy implementation was unaffected by partisan considerations and therefore it can be regarded as an exogenous intervention. An individual-level model of voting intentions from the first British Election Study conducted in 1963, and an aggregate model of party vote shares in the General Election of 1964 show that the closures significantly changed voting support for the Conservative party. The 1964 election was very competitive and the closures clearly contributed to the defeat of the incumbent government after.. years of uninterrupted rule.","[Flores, Alejandro Quiroz; Whiteley, Paul] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Flores, AQ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",aquiro@essex.ac.uk; whiteley@essex.ac.uk,,,,,,,63,3,3,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

Our focus is on models that include spatial lags of the dependent variable, e.g., the SAR specification. A major point is that practitioners rely on scalar summary measures of direct and indirect effects estimates to interpret the impact of changes in explanatory variables on the dependent variable of interest. We argue that these should be the focus of Monte Carlo experiments. Since effects estimates reflect a nonlinear function of both and , past studies' focus exclusively on and parameter estimates may not provide useful information regarding statistical properties of effects estimates produced by alternative estimators. Since effects estimates have recently become the focus of inference regarding the significance of (scalar summary) direct and indirect impacts arising from changes in the explanatory variables, empirical measures of dispersion produced by simulating draws from the (estimated) variance-covariance matrix of the parameters and should be part of the Monte Carlo study. An implication is that differences in the quality of estimated variance-covariance matrices arising from alternative estimators also plays a role in determining the accuracy of inference. An applied illustration is used to demonstrate how these issues can impact conclusions regarding the performance of alternative estimators.","[LeSage, James P.] Texas State Univ, Finance & Econ, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Pace, R.

Since standard New Keynesian models do not account for demographic trends and sectoral shifts, I propose adjusting hours worked per capita used to estimate such models accordingly to enhance the consistency between the data and the model. Without this adjustment, low-frequency shifts in hours lead to unreasonable trends in the output gap, caused by the close link between hours and the output gap in such models. The retirement wave of baby boomers, for example, lowers US aggregate hours per capita, which leads to erroneous permanently negative output gap estimates following the Great Recession. After correcting hours for changes in the age composition, the estimated output gap closes gradually instead following the years after the Great Recession.","[Wolters, Maik H.] Univ Jena, Jena, Germany; [Wolters, Maik H.] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Wolters, Maik H.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, IMFS, Frankfurt, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Goethe University Frankfurt,"Wolters, MH (通讯作者)，Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Carl ZEiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",maik.wolters@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

It argues that the degree of progress in EU social policy in the European Semester (2011-15) has been conditional and contingent. EU social policy is more oriented to supporting market development than it is to correcting for market failures.

In order to curb emissions and, considering the rapid growth of this industry Directive 101/2008/EC has included the aviation sector in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), thus generating additional costs for airlines. This paper develops an original model to analyse the impact of EU-ETS on the aviation sector. This study expands previous researches by explicitly considering abatement efforts in the airline cost function, by highlighting interdependence effects using strategies to reduce emissions, firm actions in the secondary market, free allowances, and fines. Several policy implications, which are particularly useful in an operational perspective, can be derived to support policy-making decisions through a better understanding of the overall EU-ETS effects. The pattern of results suggests the presence of a trade-off in determining profits between the efficiency cost of individual airlines and the share of allowances distributed free of charge. From a regulatory industrial perspective, the higher the latter, the lower the incentives for airlines to reduce GHG emissions. Moreover, the higher is the number of airlines competing on the same air route, the lower is the increase of profits under a Cournot oligopoly, and/or a market collusion structure. Still pending is the final effect of different strategies adopted by airlines in the allowance market.","[Nava, Consuelo R.] Univ Aosta Valley, Dept Econ & Polit Sci, Str Cappuccini 2A, Aosta, Italy; [Meleo, Linda] Int Telemat Univ Uninettuno, Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2 39, I-00186 Rome, Italy; [Cassetta, Ernesto] Univ Udine, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Tomadini 30-A, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Morelli, Giovanna] Univ Teramo, Fac Polit Sci, Via R Balzarini 1, I-64100 Teramo, Italy",Universita Della Valle D'aosta; UNINETTUNO; University of Udine; University of Teramo,"Nava, CR (通讯作者)，Univ Aosta Valley, Dept Econ & Polit Sci, Str Cappuccini 2A, Aosta, Italy.",c.nava@univda.it; l.meleo@uninettunouniversity.net; ernesto.cassetta@uniud.it; gmorelli@unite.it,"Nava, Consuelo/AAH-8788-2020","Nava, Consuelo/0000-0002-8046-8185; CASSETTA, Ernesto/0000-0002-7876-4903",,,,,47,30,31,3,38,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We adopt the representative consumer approach and calibrate the current equilibrium using the quasi-linear utility function. We find that the number of bus stops is already close to optimal. Welfare would increase if the peak frequency was increased, if the bus fares were lowered and differentiated between long trips and short trips and, and that the toll for longer car trips was increased. The optimal toll for cyclists, and the welfare benefit from it, is small and does not compensate the transaction costs. The distributional effects of bus fare changes and higher car tolls are small because on one hand, high income groups place more value on travel time gains, but on the other hand, low income groups travel less frequently by car. Surprisingly, we find that in the welfare optimum, the bus service only requires a small subsidy due to congestion in the bus lane, crowding in the buses, and extra boarding and alighting time per passenger. The Mohring effect is limited because the demand, and thereby the baseline frequency, is already high.","[Borjesson, Maria; Yan, Zifei] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fung, Chau Man; Proost, Stef] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Borjesson, Maria] VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology; KU Leuven; VTI,"Börjesson, M (通讯作者)，VTI Swedish Natl Rd & Transport Res Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",maria.borjesson@vti.se,"Alidadi, Mehdi/HJZ-0235-2023","Alidadi, Mehdi/0000-0001-5183-7829; Borjesson, Maria/0000-0001-9235-0232; Proost, Stefaan/0000-0003-3731-4532",,,,,44,11,11,2,22,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

These methods rely on observed school quality as a proxy for future school quality, but often ignore the potential for changes in people's expectations of future school quality. In particular, the border method is commonly used to measure school quality capitalization, as it differences out unobserved neighborhood characteristics that may be spatially correlated with school quality. However, it may produce estimates that are biased downwards since it relies on home sales near school borders, where residents' expectations of future school assignment may be different from contemporary expected school quality in the interior. I use 22,604 homes sales in DeKalb County, Georgia that occurred between 2003 and 2012 to investigate if information about potential school reassignment biases border method estimates downward. During this time, the school system sent differential signals to residents regarding their future school quality by announcing potential areas for reassignment long before the approval of final plans. Exploiting the variation between certain and uncertain borders, I find evidence that school assignment uncertainty reduces capitalization of school quality. The results provide evidence that residents' expectations of future school assignment are important factors contributing to the degree of school quality capitalization and suggest that future research should consider factors that irifluence people's expectations of school quality.","[Mothorpe, Christopher] Coll Charleston, Sch Business, Dept Econ, 66 George St, Charleston, SC 29424 USA",College of Charleston,"Mothorpe, C (通讯作者)，Coll Charleston, Sch Business, Dept Econ, 66 George St, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.",mothorpeca@cofc.edu,,,Dan Sweat Fellowship,Dan Sweat Fellowship,"I would like to thank the Dan Sweat Fellowship for its support of this research.

This paper addresses that omission, estimating the effect of sales taxes on employment at state borders using county-level quarterly data and a newly developed data set of local county tax rates. The findings indicate that sales tax increases, relative to cross-border neighbors, lead to losses of employment, as well as payroll and hiring, but these effects are only found in counties with large shares of residents working in another state. The employment effects are also likely to be relatively short-lived, as they occur in the period before tax competition occurs and competitive jurisdictions are able to strategically respond and minimize cross-border tax differentials. Comparing estimates of sales tax effects with and without local county sales taxes show that omitting county taxes does not lead to meaningfully different estimates.","[Rohlin, Shawn M.] Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Thompson, Jeffrey P.] Fed Reserve Board, Microecon Surveys Sect, Washington, DC USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Rohlin, SM (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Econ, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",srohlin@kent.cdu; jeffrey.p.thompson@frb.gov,,"Rohlin, Shawn/0000-0002-6956-1012",,,,,21,9,11,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Based on the theory of heterosis and existing genetic evidence, offspring of hybrid marriages (spouses originating from different states/provinces/countries/areas), though relatively rare due to physical boundaries, may exhibit greater genetic fitness in terms of intelligence, height, or physical attractiveness (the distanceperformance hypothesis). This study explores whether heterosis is a contributing factor to offspring's educational attainment in China by applying a high-dimensional fixed effects (HDFE) modelling framework to the unique 0.1% micro-sample of the 2000 Chinese Population Census data. Concerning potential endogeneity of hybrid marriages, we conduct a series of robustness checks. Reassuringly, the estimated heterosis effect remains significantly positive across various measurements, after controlling for parental educational attainments/height, environmental influences, and over a thousand region and region-by-year fixed effects. The effects in male and higher-educated offspring are found to be stronger. Results are replicated when analyzing body height using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Although endogeneity of hybrid marriages may not be completely ruled out, the current study sheds light on the potentially beneficial effects of interprovincial migration on population-level human capital accumulation, and we hope that this paper can intrigue future studies that further address endogeneity. The implied heterosis effect could, therefore, be profound for Homo sapiens as a species from an evolutionary point of view. An additional important implication is that the overall genetic influences of parents on offspring's performance may be further decomposed into a conventional heredity effect and a heterosis effect that has been neglected previously.

Two types of agents, which consist of fundamental traders and technical analysts, are considered in the proposed model. They differ in the expectation of future asset returns and the perceived risk. This paper incorporates the unique characteristics of high-frequency data into the model for the purpose of having a reliable and accurate empirical result. In particular, a two-test procedure is developed to test the market fractions hypothesis that distinguishes the heterogeneous agent model from the representative agent model. The proposed heterogeneous agent model is estimated on the Taiwan Stock Exchange data. The results suggest that fundamental traders expect the correction of over- or under-pricing in the future. Technical analysts act as contrarian traders. Technical analysts also believe that buyer-initiated (seller-initiated) trading will further raise (lower) future prices. The bid-ask spread has a crucial effect on the investment risk for the technical analysts. Moreover, technical analysts are short-sighted, have less market fraction, but perform slightly better.","[Huang, Ya-Chi] Lunghwa Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Int Business, 300,Sect 1,Wanshou Rd, Taoyuan 33306, Taiwan; [Tsao, Chueh-Yung] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, 259,Wenhua 1st Rd, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan",Chang Gung University,"Tsao, CY (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, 259,Wenhua 1st Rd, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan.",estherhyc12@yahoo.com.tw; cytsao@mail.cgu.edu.tw,,,Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 98-2410-H-182-010-MY3]; Healthy Aging Research Centre [EMRPD1F0301],Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology; Healthy Aging Research Centre,"Chueh-Yung Tsao acknowledges the assistance of the respected editor and the anonymous referees for their insightful and constructive comments, which have helped to improve the overall quality of the paper.

This paper draws on comparable school to work transition survey data to examine the nature of youth employment in four important and generally successful Asian economies that are relatively engaged in international trade, though to varying extents: Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal and Vietnam. In all four, many young people continue to be engaged in self-employment or unpaid family work; while in some cases, this may reflect the lack of opportunities for wage work in the formal sector, often such outcomes may be positive choices on the part of the young people. The availability of formal jobs for young people varies across the four countries, with the extent and diversity of industrialisation or exports being one important factor, as well as the level of education. In Vietnam, the country most advanced in these areas, the availability of formal jobs is significantly greater than in the other countries and is large on an international scale, while in Bangladesh and Cambodia, the textiles and garment sectors have played an important role in creating formal work opportunities, especially for females.","[McKay, Andy] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Mussida, Chiara] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Italy",University of Sussex; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"McKay, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",,,"McKay, Andy/0000-0002-5815-1739",,,,,19,4,4,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,APR,2018,41.0,4,,,SI,,1045,1067,,10.1111/twec.12622,0.0,,,23,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GC9JM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430113300006,0

Self-employment was found to be particularly associated with energised well-being in the form of job engagement. The presence in self-employment of greater challenge, such as an enhanced requirement for personal innovation, accounted statistically for self-employed professionals' greater job engagement, and self-employed professionals more strongly valued personal challenge than did professionals employed in an organisation. However, no between-role differences occurred in respect of supportive job features such as having a comfortable workplace. Differences in well-being, job content and work orientations were found primarily in comparison between self-employees and organisational non-managers.

The first example is based on the standard linear-quadratic permanent income model, and the other example uses a simple two-country DSGE model under autarky and under complete markets. When the conditional welfare criterion is used-with the social discount factor set at the private discount factor-we obtain the well-known results that the government should not intervene when there are no market imperfections and that complete markets generate risk sharing gains over autarky. In contrast, using an unconditional welfare criterion-which effectively implies that the social discount factor is set to unity-can generate unconventional welfare results.","[Kim, Jinill] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Sunghyun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Korea University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, S (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",jinillkim@korea.ac.kr; shenrykim@skku.edu,,"Kim, Sunghyun/0000-0002-9326-1028",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A5B8060964).,,17,4,4,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We begin by using asymmetric GARCH models to examine the marginal behavior of the returns, and then various copulas are used to understand extreme market co-movements. We also investigate the causal relationship and the spillover effects by using the Granger causality test and the BEKK representation of a multivariate GARCH process. Over the 1998-2017 period, we find evidence of an inverse relationship between the U.S. interest rates and the crude oil prices. Oil-exchange rate linkages become stronger for most of the oil dependent countries considered in this article in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. There is also asymmetric tail dependence for almost all of the oil-exchange rate pairs. The results of Granger causality tests mainly indicate that crude oil prices Granger cause exchange rates. We also find that there are unidirectional volatility spillovers from WTI to exchange rates for oil exporting countries and to the U. S. interest rates. These findings provide important implications for investors to hedge the possible risk with international portfolio diversification.","[Kim, Jong-Min] Univ Minnesota Morris, Div Sci & Math, Stat Discipline, Morris, MN 56267 USA; [Jung, Hojin] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota Hospital; University of Minnesota Morris; Jeonbuk National University,"Jung, H (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeonju Si 54896, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.",hojin.jung@jbnu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Jong-Min/0000-0003-3821-2060",,,,,46,14,15,3,45,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,MAR,2018,39.0,2,,,,,259,280,,10.5547/01956574.39.2.jkim,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FZ4RB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427578400012,0

M., and K. S. Rogoff. 2010. Growth in a Time of Debt. The American Economic Review 100: 573-578.) has triggered a debate about the effects of the public debt on GDP growth. They argue that a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent has a deleterious effect on long-run economic growth. In this paper, we examine the inter-temporal relationship between public debt and GDP growth rates. We examine debt-to-GDP thresholds in nonlinear panel models, using various econometric strategies, methodologies, and data samples. We also evaluate confidence intervals around the estimated thresholds to determine the accuracy of estimated thresholds. Our results demonstrate that in the majority of estimated models, threshold values are not uniquely defined and the estimated coefficients are insignificant in most model specifications, as in Enders, Falk, and Siklos (Enders, W., B. L. Falk, and P. Siklos. 2007. A Threshold Model of Real US GDP and the Problem of Constructing Confidence Intervals in TAR Models. Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics & Econometrics 11: 1322.). Next, we examine the inter-temporal relationship between the public debt and economic growth using structural panel data models as well as reduced form panel VAR models. In contrast to the standard presumption in the literature, we find that the inter-temporal effect of economic growth on the public debt is strong, but the effect of the public debt on economic growth is weak. We find similar results in sub-samples that include countries where the public debt is over 90 percent of GDP.","[Arcabic, Vladimir; Tica, Josip] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon & Econ Dev, Zagreb, Croatia; [Lee, Junsoo] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Sonora, Robert J.] Ft Lewis Coll, Dept Econ, Durango, CO 81301 USA",University of Zagreb; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Arcabic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Macroecon & Econ Dev, Zagreb, Croatia.",varcabic@efzg.hr,"Arčabić, Vladimir/H-8434-2018; Sonora, Robert/GQP-2058-2022; Tica, Josip/B-7628-2013","Arčabić, Vladimir/0000-0003-4173-8637; Tica, Josip/0000-0001-7937-1573",European Social Fund [SPIRITH]; Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost [7031],European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost,Financial support from European Social Fund (Funder Id: 10.13039/501100004895 and Grant Number: SPIRITH) and Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost (Funder Id: 10.13039/501100004488 and Grant Number: 7031).,,42,21,22,2,41,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

However, typically researchers make three restrictive assumptions. First, they assume a direction of movement of firm production toward the frontier. Second, they assume that actual quantities of inputs and outputs are allocatively or price efficient. Third, they assume exogeneity of all inputs and all outputs, except for the normalized one. The first contribution of this paper is to include parameters to estimate optimal directions which correspond to the firm's profit-maximizing (PM) position. The second contribution is to generalize the DDF to a shadow-quantity DDF. This entails adding distortion parameters to each input and output quantity of the DDF, creating shadow quantities. To estimate the shadow quantities and the structural parameters, we form the shadow DDF system, which includes the shadow DDF and all the first-order price equations from the shadow-PM problem. These include prices for bad inputs and bad outputs, where we approximate their missing prices for use in their first-order price equations. The third contribution is that we estimate the shadow DDF system using a Generalized Method of Moments approach, where all variables are potentially endogenous. This approach is simpler than the Bayesian one employed in Atkinson et al. (Estimating efficient production with bad inputs and outputs using latent prices and optimal directions. Working paper, University of Georgia, Athens, 2016), which estimated shadow prices and optimal directions. Using the same data set, both sets of results are qualitatively very similar, although they differ somewhat quantitatively.","[Atkinson, Scott E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Tsionas, Mike G.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Lancaster University,"Atkinson, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",atknsn@uga.edu; m.tsionas@lancaster.ac.uk,"Tsionas, Mike George/AAC-3783-2020","Tsionas, Mike George/0000-0003-3761-8106",,,,,18,10,10,1,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Selecting the data from 156 routes of China's 48 major cities from 2001 to 2014, the paper takes the aviation mileage as the threshold variable and the operation time as the control variable to build a panel threshold regression model. Firstly, under the consideration of the economic, demographic, environmental and railway indicators, the paper analyzes the influence of China's railway on the aviation passenger volume and the flight number; secondly, under the condition that the railway speed is more than 250 km/h, the paper analyzes the shock effect of China's high-speed railway on aviation transport. The conclusion shows that the higher the level of the economic development is, the more developed the aviation transport of the region will be. when the aviation mileage is below 1132 km, as the aviation mileage increases, the influence of China's railway to the aviation transport fall into a decline; China's high-speed railway has a positive shock effect on the aviation transport, and the shock effect reaches the maximum when the aviation mileage is from 650 to 755 km.

First, we show that the KSS test (Kapetanios, G., Y. Shin, and A. Snell. 2003. Testing for a Unit Root in the Nonlinear STAR Framework. Journal of Econometrics 112: 359-379) for nonlinear stationarity has local asymptotic power gains over standard Dickey-Fuller [DF] tests for certain degrees of nonlinearity in the ESTAR model, but that for other degrees of nonlinearity, the linear DF test has superior power. Second, we derive limiting distributions of demeaned, and demeaned and detrended KSS and DF tests under a local ESTAR alternative when a local trend is present in the DGP. We show that the power of the demeaned tests outperforms that of the detrended tests when no trend is present in the DGP, but deteriorates as the magnitude of the trend increases. We propose a union of rejections testing procedure that combines all four individual tests and show that this captures most of the power available from the individual tests across different degrees of nonlinearity and trend magnitudes.

We estimate two econometric models: a multinomial logit model, to assess whether renewables increase the occurrence of congestion, and a two stage least squares (2SLS) model to evaluate the impact of wind and photovoltaics on congestion costs. Our analysis suggests that larger renewable supply in importing regions decreases the probability of congestion compared to the no congestion case, while the reverse occurs when renewable production is located in an exporting region. The 2SLS estimations reveal that the same mechanisms explain the level of congestion costs. Our results also highlight that the magnitude of the congestion effects, both in terms of probability and costs, is very sensitive to the location of the historical efficient production, mainly hydro power, and to the geographical configuration of the transmission network.","[Ardian, Faddy] Univ Pertamina, South Jakarta, Indonesia; [Concettini, Silvia] Univ Tours, Chair Energy & Prosper, Tours, France; [Concettini, Silvia] Univ Tours, IRJI Francois Rabelais, Tours, France; [Creti, Anna] Univ Paris 09, Paris, France; [Creti, Anna] PSL Res Univ, Paris, France; [Creti, Anna] Climate Econ, Paris, France",Universite de Tours; Universite de Tours; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL,"Concettini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tours, Chair Energy & Prosper, Tours, France.;Concettini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tours, IRJI Francois Rabelais, Tours, France.",concettini@univ-tours.fr,,,Climate Economics Chair,Climate Economics Chair,Anna Creti acknowledges the support of the Climate Economics Chair.

It in turn is positively influencing the conditions of national economy even if migration processes are caused by negative tendencies. This article considers how forced migration stimulates an entrepreneurship and affects an entrepreneurial behavior in aspect of the international experience and realities of the Ukrainian economy. The increase in entrepreneurial activity caused by migration processes is researched, the level of their importance in case of decision making to begin own business in comparison with seven main motives of business activity is analysed. The main spheres of business which migrants are inclined to choose and degree of their economic success are determined. The received results have both the theoretical and practical value as allowed to formulate a tendency of influence of migration on business activity strengthening and to prove change of entrepreneurial behavior. It is revealed that the main motives stimulating an entrepreneurship in the conditions of migration are, first of all, desire to provide itself and the family with stable income, implementation of own business idea, lifework, aspiration to financial independence. At the same time, entrepreneurs are more inclined to show ethical qualities in business (socially responsible business, high-quality and ecologically safe product, customer relations) and are less inclined to the termination of business activity in the conditions of crisis.","[Bei, Hanna; Sarkisian, Larysa; Sereda, Ganna] Vasyl Stus Donetsk Natl Univ, Donetsk, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Vasyl Stus Donetsk National University,"Bei, HN (通讯作者)，Vasyl Stus Donetsk Natl Univ, Donetsk, Ukraine.",h.larycheva@donnu.edu.ua; l.sarkisyan@donnu.edu.ua; g.sereda@donnu.edu.ua,"Bei, Hanna/AAY-1783-2020; Sarkisian, Larysa/AAY-1791-2020; Sereda, Hanna/AAY-1668-2020","Sarkisian, Larysa/0000-0003-3030-5000; Bei, Hanna/0000-0002-6367-3494",,,,,25,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,158,165,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300019,0

While proponents laud ISDS as a neutral and efficient means of dispute resolution, critics claim that it shields transnational corporations from the oversight of national legal systems while enhancing their ability to interfere in host state policy matters. Moreover, because dispute settlement is carried out in international tribunals, ISDS is argued to disable citizen-driven politics. Governments have called on arbitration bodies to enhance the transparency of ISDS procedures and open spaces for civil society involvement. This reflects a desire to increase the legitimacy of ISDS in the face of mounting contestation. In this paper, I examine the multiple ways in which civil society actors intervene in investor-state arbitration inside and outside of formal channels. I focus specifically on two disputes involving foreign investors active in the water and hydrocarbons sectors of Argentina and Ecuador, respectively. I find that political pressure exerted by civil society actors influenced government decisions to break with investment rules and helped to shape government positioning within arbitral processes. Civil society actors must therefore be recognised as important participants in investor-state disputes.","[Calvert, Julia] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Hist & Polit, St John, NB, Canada",University of New Brunswick,"Calvert, J (通讯作者)，Univ New Brunswick, Dept Hist & Polit, St John, NB, Canada.",julia.calvert@unb.ca,,,,,,,76,8,9,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The Republic of Croatia is among countries that are placing a strong emphasis on tourism as a strategic industry that can improve the country's economic results. Although rural tourism can be connected with di]: ferent ways of spending free time in rural areas, it is usually defined as use of rural space in the context of the tourism. Eastern Croatia, especially Slavonia and Baranja, have all the necessary natural resources for the development of rural tourism, which could also be connected with tourism that is already well developed on the Adriatic coast. However, despite rich natural resources and incentives provided for the purpose of rural tourism development (both on national and regional level), the results are not so promising. In order to find out what is necessary for stimulation of rural tourism in Osijek-Baranja County, a detailed analysis of the business ecosystem has been done. Business ecosystem, as a relatively new term, defines all the stakeholders, as well as market contexts that can allow or restrict entrepreneurship. Further development of rural tourism is therefore strongly connected with the business ecosystem and its attributes: leadership, network density, government, talent, support services, engagement, companies and capital. In order to check the stage of development of the business ecosystem of Osijek-Baranja County, secondary data (yearend reports, publications and webpages) will be used. The results should provide an overview of the business ecosystem factors that strongly influence development of rural tourism in Osijek-Baranja County.","[Delic, Anamarija; Peric, Dora] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Delic, A (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",anamarija.delic@efos.hr; dora_peric@yahoo.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,12,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1636,1651,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300091,0

Inequality was rising the most in Bulgaria and Cyprus. The Gini index also increased in Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Spain. On the other hand, it was decreasing in Poland, Romania, UK and Portugal. The highest growth in disposable income was noticed in Bulgaria and Romania, but those countries are still behind EU average. Moreover, difference between the country with the highest and the lowest income per capita is decreasing during research period.

Organizational culture is assessed through four dimensions - orientation towards team, development, results and consistency, while knowledge management is assessed through ability to generate, transfer and implement knowledge, as well as intention to learn. The study aims at contributing to the missing link between organizational culture, knowledge management and organizational innovation by finding the answer to the question, what impact these factors could have on ORI development in a firm. A quantitative study of 134 small and medium-sized enterprises from various industries was conducted simultaneously in Latvia and Russia. The results provide evidence that organizational culture has strong, positive influence on both the knowledge management and ORI evolvement in a firm.

These are the industries that grow fast, are associated with intellectual capital and able to create new jobs. Increasing effectiveness, in turn, is important for every organisation in order to preserve competitiveness in the rapidly changing external environment. It is an integral part of the companies' competitiveness in every industry and the basis of successful operation in the long-term. The purpose of the research is to determine the possibilities of use of the Lean effectiveness method in creative industries of Latvia. The Lean Service approach that derived from the Lean effectiveness improvement method is a general way of thinking approach able to ensure balance between creativity and standardised work practices. This Lean approach is mainly focused on the optimisation of processes and services through the professionalisation of job functions. Within the framework of this research, the authors have proved that the use of the Lean Service in creative industries may have a positive impact on the turnover of such companies. In general it was concluded that entrepreneurs of Latvia's creative industries are aware of the Lean objectives, work at the reduction of costs and losses but in practice the majority of them do not find time to meet said objectives, do not develop standards for continuous improvement and do not conduct audits. The research, at first, summarises the theoretical substantiation of peculiarities of implementation of the effectiveness methods in creative industries including the theoretical analysis of the Lean approach and the Lean Service approach. The following section specifies the research methodology as well as analyses practical use of the Lean methods and their connection with the growth and amount of turnover. At the end of the research, conclusions and recommendations are given to increase the effectiveness of companies in creative industries. Theoretical and practical implications of the research entail the possibility to develop an analysis-based effectiveness improvement programme for Latvia's creative industries as a result of which the performance of said companies will be facilitated.

The apparent failure of many international statebuilding interventions has prompted a political economy' turn in development studies. This article critically assesses the key approaches that have emerged to address the interrelations between interveners and recipients, and advances an approach that places the politics of scale at the core of the conflicts shaping the outcomes of international intervention. Different scales privilege different interests, unevenly allocating power, resources and political opportunity structures. Interveners and recipients thus pursue scalar strategies and establish socio-political alliances that reinforce their power and marginalise rivals. This approach is harnessed towards examining the uneven results of the Aceh Government Transformation Programme, financed by the World Bank-managed Multi Donor Trust Fund following the 2005 peace agreement and implemented by the UNDP and the Aceh provincial government.","[Hameiri, Shahar] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Int Polit, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Hameiri, Shahar] Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Grad Ctr Governance & Int Affairs, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Scarpello, Fabio] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Int Relat, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Sussex,"Hameiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Int Polit, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.;Hameiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Polit Sci & Int Studies, Grad Ctr Governance & Int Affairs, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.",,,"Hameiri, Shahar/0000-0001-7262-2448",Australian Research Council [DP130102273],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Australian Research Council [grant number DP130102273].,,70,12,15,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

These principles of taxation represent guidelines for the state, for the bodies of public administration, especially Tax Department, Also the principles that are incorporated in tax system depend on the state in question, but once incorporated they should be properly executed through the implementation of particular tax, where the crucial role belongs to Tax Department. The administrative aspect of taxation must always be considered when analyzing tax policy, alongside the design of taxes. Tax authorities (i.e. Tax Department) are the bodies responsible for administering the tax laws of a particular country or regional or local authority. They perform various tasks, often referred to as Core functions; including: identification and registration of taxpayers, filing and payment of taxes, collection and recovery of taxes, audit and investigation, and dispute resolution. The paper is going to show the organization scheme of tax authorities in the Republic of Croatia and the effect that the work of the Tax Department has on tax compliance.","[Jerkovic, Emina] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair Financial Sci, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jerkovic, E (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair Financial Sci, Osijek, Croatia.",ekonjic@pravos.hr,"Jerković, Emina/HGE-5284-2022","Jerković, Emina/0000-0003-2721-1898",,,,,6,0,0,0,4,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,983,1000,,,,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300055,0

It argues that in ECEs these financial transformations, akin to the financialisation phenomena observed in Core Capitalist Economies (CCEs), are fundamentally shaped by their subordinated integration into a financialised and structured world economy. To analyse this subordinated financialisation, the paper draws on the framework of international currency hierarchies. It shows by means of two specific processes how the existence of a hierarchic international monetary system has changed the financial behaviour of domestic economic agents, and with it the structure of the financial system. The first process highlights the phenomenon of reserve accumulation and the changing behaviour of domestic banks. The second points to ECEs' sustained external vulnerability and its impact on the operations of Brazilian non-financial corporations. The paper also shows that not only were these financial transformations shaped by ECEs' subordinated financial integration, but also that it was these financialisation tendencies themselves which contributed to cementing existing hierarchies and further deepened existing asymmetries between ECEs and CCEs.","[Kaltenbrunner, Annina] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Painceira, Juan Pablo] Brazilian Cent Bank, Open Mkt Operat Dept DEMAB, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",University of Leeds,"Kaltenbrunner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.kaltenbrunner@leeds.ac.uk,,"Kaltenbrunner, Annina/0000-0003-3519-5197",,,,,174,105,114,5,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

CRISPR/Cas remains within species boundaries. The cisgenetic plants could also be the outcome of conventional breeding or natural evolution. Compared to former genetic modification (GM) techniques, this system is considered as relatively easy to apply, more precise, quicker and much cheaper. This new technological development has induced a debate on the adequacy of the current governance system within the EU, due to the current non-traceability of the modifications. A controversy point is whether cisgenic plants should be viewed as GMOs and thus fall under the current EU law for GMO approval, which was developed at a time when GM meant introducing transgenic DNA into a genome. The current debate on regulation is very much science based and focuses mainly on risk management aspects. However, there are a number of fundamental trade-offs to be considered in the context of governing CRSPR/Cas genome editing. Certain characteristics of the new technology set the key-requirements for governance options. Because it is easy to apply, cheaper and much quicker and non-traceability its outreach will be immense, therefore governance has to reflect the balance between the diverging interests and values and requires a continuous discourse between science and society. We will shed light on the ethical dilemma that, on the one hand, fast regulative action is needed to catch up with the developments and, on the other hand, the required societal debate needs time.","[Pirscher, F.; Theesfeld, I] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Fac Nat Sci 3, Dept Agr Environm & Food Policy, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg,"Pirscher, F (通讯作者)，Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Fac Nat Sci 3, Dept Agr Environm & Food Policy, D-06099 Halle, Saale, Germany.",frauke.pirscher@landw.uni-halle.de,,,,,,,21,3,3,3,15,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,419,423,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_66,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000066,0

Austria has the highest retail density within European retail, with 1,67m(2) Floor Size per capita. Whilst, omnichannel retailing is an opportunity, threat and the future on the one hand, stationary efficiency is the mission, purpose and the presence on the other hand. With reference to the future in Austria's retail, one of the main challenges is the creation of new competitive advantages that are associated with investments in the latest technologies, innovation, research, human capital. With reference to the presence, knowledge on performance and productivity growth is needed to improve competitiveness. Many hypotheses regarding efficiency in outlets in general and supermarket outlets in detail appear not well grounded with respect to the involvement of middle management. Still, middle management in many companies, are the experts with important tasks and topics such as; adopting best practices, strategic resource-allocation decisions and evaluation of personnel and shop performance. This paper will discuss on economic and management challenges. The area of research is the Austrian supermarket sector. The methodology is based on the estimation of a newly developed non-parametric model. The empirical analyses applied to panel data on a sample of supermarket outlets.

According to database of the UN Global Compact the quantity of nonfinancial reports submitted by SMEs of developed countries is much greater than those of emerging countries. In order to explain the difference an initial comparative analysis of SMEs in Germany and Russia was held. It was found that even though the Russian statistics presents quite impressive growth rates for the number of newly registered SMEs, there are a lot of problems and obstacles for efficient operation of SMEs, so SMEs in Russia is objectively simply much less prepared for introducing CSR. At the next stage the quality of the UN Global Compact reports was examined. The reports of German and Russian companies for years 2014 and 2016 were studied. The in-depth analysis has shown that almost a third of all reports were quite superficial: information didn't correspond to reality and was not supported by calculations or numerical data. Although in comparison with emerging economies the business environment in developed countries should favor the development of CSR, the quality of CSR statements submitted by representatives of both types of economy is not satisfactory. The nonfinancial reports in both cases found out to be often just formal and made only in order to keep the status of UN Global Compact member. In conclusion the suggestions for increase of SMEs involvement in CSR are made.","[Solovey, Tatiana] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Kanygina, Nadezda] Inst Complex Strateg Studies, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Solovey, T (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Solovey, Tatiana/E-3006-2018",,,,,,26,0,0,1,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-344-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,661,671,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP0MG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000535358500061,0

The methodology of the research is based both on the review of scientific literature and on the theoretical analysis of economic theory in order to provide arguments for the economic benefits of human capital migration for both recipient and donors countries, and to systematize the benefits and costs of migration of human capital. Theoretical analysis showed that, on the one hand, the influx of migrants creates a burden on social protection systems, on the other hand, developed countries taking the main migration, need of labour force and must compete for human capital of high quality. Although the integration of refugees entails large preliminary short- and medium-term financial costs, if successful, it will bring financial benefits in the long term. It is shown that the migration of human capital leads to the formation of a diversity of labor resources as a factor of sustainability of the socioeconomic system.

However, limits on the size of banks could entail economic costs if they prevent banks from achieving economies of scale. This paper presents new estimates of returns to scale for US banks based on nonparametric, local-linear estimation of bank cost, revenue, and profit functions. We report estimates for both 2006 and 2015 to compare returns to scale some 7 years after the financial crisis and 5 years after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act with returns to scale before the crisis. We find that a high percentage of banks faced increasing returns to scale in cost in both years, including most of the 10 largest bank holding companies. Also, while returns to scale in revenue and profit vary more across banks, we find evidence that the largest four banks operate under increasing returns to scale.","[Wheelock, David C.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO USA; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Wilson, Paul W.] Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Div Comp Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Clemson University; Clemson University,"Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Dept Econ, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.;Wilson, PW (通讯作者)，Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Div Comp Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",pww@clemson.edu,"Wheelock, David C/I-5757-2016","Wilson, Paul W/0000-0002-9865-033X",,,,,41,32,36,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0883-7252,1099-1255,,J APPL ECONOMET,J.

Demonstrating the important role of government policy, data-determined systemically important cities in the price spillover network appear to be consistent with core cities supported by several regional development plans of the Chinese government and agglomerate in five relatively concentrated areas. A higher administrative status, population, city GDP and secondary education are significant determinants of the (net) positive spillover pattern.

A methodology for assessing the effectiveness of budget resources management of the territories, considering the formed indicators in order to develop the model budgets, is proposed. The integrated indicator of the effectiveness of budget resources management is adopted as a basic criterion for classifying budget stability, which will allow to determine the type of model budget for the purpose of forming inter-budgetary relations in the region. The methodological basis was the methods of economic, system analysis and mathematical statistics. The methodology has been tested on the official data of the Finance Ministry of the Nizhny Novgorod region for 2014-2016. The result of the assessment is, the rating of municipalities, and two classes of model budgets are established. The first class is characterized: by high financial stability due to a growth of the distributions' norms of regulatory taxes to municipalities, increasing the share of own revenues to 80-90%, a reduction in subsidies, subventions, increased dotations, the possible growth of municipal borrowing; by norms of social standards per unit of consumers of budget services, established with an increased coefficient. The second class is characterized by sufficient financial stability of municipalities, requires a balanced approach to establishing the structure of income and financing of expenditures. This methodology will help to match the amount of expenditure obligations to the amount of disposable income and balanced budgets. The formation of model budgets will increase the responsibility of the regional state authorities and local governments for ensuring effective spending of funds, for creating a base for expanding their own revenue potential; will contribute to improving the budgetary process management effectiveness and the introduction of budgeting principles based on results.","[Yashina, Nadezhda; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya; Petrov, Sergey; Kashina, Oksana] Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Finance & Credit, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia",Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod,"Yashina, N (通讯作者)，Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Inst Econ & Entrepreneurship, Dept Finance & Credit, Bolshaya Pokrovskaya St 37, Nizhnii Novgorod 603000, Russia.",sitnicof@mail.ru; pronat89@mail.ru; petrov_ss@list.ru; oksana_kashina@mail.ru,"Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/AAH-2583-2021; Petrov, Sergey/R-7564-2016; Kashina, Oksana/O-8961-2017; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/HIR-3846-2022","Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/0000-0002-8924-2991; Pronchatova-Rubtsova, Nataliya/0000-0002-8924-2991",Russian Foundation for Basic Research [18-010-00909],Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government),The reported study was funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research according to the research project No 18-010-00909.,,20,2,2,0,3,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,857,864,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800109,0

The paper employs network analysis to detect productive and innovative activities of firms founded between 2001 and 2016. Our findings highlight that three clusters of interconnected technologies and transport-related solutions are emerging: new cars prototypes and alternative vehicles prompt innovation in autonomous driving; technologies for transport sharing and public transit data analysis stimulate new solutions in urban livability; management systems, platform development and vehicle-optimization technologies bring innovative specializations in the integrated logistics services.

Roemer argues that the standard economic theory of Nash equilibria is incapable of accounting for cooperative behavior such as recycling, reporting one's income honestly, and voting in national elections. Instead we should assume that a cooperator is motivated to do what would most benefit her if all did the same. In commenting on this proposal, the first section of the paper summarizes Kant's original formulation of the categorical imperative and relates it to psychological and historical studies of magical thinking. The next section distinguishes between unconditional and conditional norms of behavior and, within the latter, between the social norms of cooperation that can be triggered when what the agent does is being observed by others and the quasi-moral norms of cooperation that can be triggered when an agent observes what others do. To illustrate these ideas, the paper cites many experiments and historical case studies, the most important being the non-consumption, non-importation, and non-exportation movements in the American revolution. The concluding section summarizes Roemer's own empirical work, and discusses critically his argument that his findings can be explained by assuming that agents are conditional Kantians.","[Elster, Jon] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Elster, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 420 West 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",je70@columbia.edu,,,,,,,30,11,11,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2017,49.0,3-4,,,SI,,721,734,,10.1007/s00355-017-1029-9,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,FN5QB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416061600014,0

To represent the forecast uncertainty over the entire horizon, methods for constructing joint prediction bands for path forecasts from SETAR models are proposed. This class of nonlinear models is increasingly used in time series analysis and forecasting as it is useful for capturing nonlinear dynamics. Approaches based on statistical theory and explicit sequential and global optimization methods are both considered. Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the performance of the proposed methods. The comparison is done with regard to the actual coverage of the constructed prediction bands for full path forecasts as well as with regard to the width of the bands. An empirical application demonstrates the relevance of the choice of bands for indicating the uncertainty of path forecasts in nonlinear models.","[Grabowski, Daniel; Winker, Peter] Univ Giessen, Econ & Business Studies, Giessen, Germany; [Staszewska-Bystrova, Anna] Univ Lodz, Lodz, Poland",Justus Liebig University Giessen; University of Lodz,"Winker, P (通讯作者)，Univ Giessen, Econ & Business Studies, Giessen, Germany.",peter.winker@wirtscha.t.uni-giessen.de,"Staszewska-Bystrova, Anna/K-3864-2012; Winker, Peter/D-1389-2011","Winker, Peter/0000-0003-3412-4207; Staszewska-Bystrova, Anna/0000-0002-3941-4986","MNiSW/DAAD PPP Grant [56268818]; National Science Center, Poland (NCN) through HARMONIA [6:UMO-2014/14/M/HS4/00901]","MNiSW/DAAD PPP Grant; National Science Center, Poland (NCN) through HARMONIA","Support from the MNiSW/DAAD PPP Grant (56268818) and the National Science Center, Poland (NCN) through HARMONIA 6:UMO-2014/14/M/HS4/00901 are gratefully acknowledged.",,35,2,2,2,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

These subtle sacrifices contain vital clues as to why many people remain attached to car use, and their exposure can inform policy solutions that encourage car independence. This paper takes dog ownership as a case in point of an ostensibly health promoting and personally satisfying practice which, in many cities, either requires, or is enriched by, access to a private car. Drawing on empirical data from a convenience survey of over 1250 dog owners in Sydney, Australia, we explore the way cars augment and shape the human-dog bond and identify a high level of car use for dog-related trips. This suggests a distinct and previously unrecorded inclination for people to travel relatively long (that is, non-walkable) distances with their dog. It also reflects the fact dogs are prohibited on the public transport network in our case study city, leaving no legal alternative but to drive non-walkable dog-related trips. Enabling dogs to ride public transport with their owners is suggested as a potential way to reduce dog-related car trips, while fulfilling preferences for owners to travel with their dogs. Unsurprisingly, survey participants indicated nigh universal support for such policies, with many stating they would change their transport behaviour should such a policy be approved. Given the support and benefits of allowing dogs on public transport, the second part of the paper explores how such initiatives are regulated across the developed world and considers the practical and cultural implications of pursuit of such a policy in a car-dominated city. We conclude with reflections on lessons to be learned from differences in dogs-on-transport policy and practice from city to city. We explore whether such differences indicate the normalisation and acceptance of public dogs, or public transport.","[Kent, Jennifer L.] Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Mulley, Corinne] Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Kent, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Architecture Design & Planning, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",Jennifer.kent@sydney.edu.au; Corinne.mulley@sydney.edu.au,"Mulley, Corinne/ACN-0179-2022; Kent, Jennifer Lee/AAS-9035-2020","Kent, Jennifer Lee/0000-0002-3051-7698; Mulley, Corinne/0000-0001-6411-1269",,,,,50,14,14,0,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

However, still little is known about the quality of social interactions, although arguably the subjective quality of social interaction is more important for individuals' quality of social life than the quantity of it. It is, therefore, important to gain insight in the subjective aspects of social activities in addition to the objective aspects. To that end, this study summarizes empirical evidence of factors that make a particular social interaction valuable. Value or the quality of social interactions is measured by individual's subjective evaluation of the importance of social interactions. Based on social interaction diary data collected in 2014, two analyses were conducted - a negative binomial regression model to predict the number of (very) important face-to-face interactions per individual, and a two-level ordinal logit model to predict the importance of each interaction. Explanatory variables were individuals' personal, neighborhood and mobility characteristics. Results suggest that neighborhood and mobility characteristics are important in explaining the quality of social interactions. Frequency of important social interactions is positively associated with frequency of walking or cycling. The frequency of important social interactions was also found to be higher for people living in neighborhoods with higher levels of perceived social cohesion and walkability, and lower for people living in rural areas, in neighborhoods with higher percentages of older residents and in neighborhoods with higher percentages of ethnic minorities. Policymakers, urban planners and decision makers should therefore aim to increase walkability and neighborhood social cohesion, with due attention to neighborhoods with high percentages of elderly and immigrant population.","[van den Berg, Pauline; Weijs-Perree, Minou] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Fac Built Environm, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Sharmeen, Fariya] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Geog Planning & Enviroment, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Sharmeen, F (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Geog Planning & Enviroment, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",fariyasharmeen@gmail.com,"Sharmeen, Fariya/HMV-2349-2023; Van+Den+Berg, Pauline/ACY-3551-2022; Sharmeen, Fariya/P-2963-2015","Weijs-Perree, Minou/0000-0001-6368-003X; van den Berg, Pauline/0000-0003-1712-5873; Sharmeen, Fariya/0000-0002-6177-1795",,,,,57,53,57,10,84,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We investigate this over two quarterly intervals, both of which begin in 1955:1. The short sample ends in 1995:2 and is most similar to the one used by Bohn (Q J Econ 113:949-963, 1998), whereas the full sample ends in 2013:3. Our estimation results show that the full sample period is sufficiently different from the short sample period, that the asymmetric (nonlinear) empirical models used in this paper are important and that the sustainability of US government debt topic needed to be revisited. Indeed, the short sample provides evidence of fiscal policy sustainability in line with Bohn's (1998) findings. However, when considering the full sample, US fiscal policy is found sustainable during good economic times only according to the best fitting nonlinear model, but unsustainable for all specifications studied during times of distress. With regard to cyclicality, both samples show policy is asymmetric. Moreover, both samples show countercyclical policy during times of distress and the full sample results show some evidence that policy may be procyclical during good economic times.","[Cassou, Steven P.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Shadmani, Hedieh] Fairfield Univ, Dept Econ, Donnarumma Hall Rm 325,1073 North Benson Rd, Fairfield, CT 06824 USA; [Vazquez, Jesus] Univ Basque Country, EHU, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 2, Av Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain",Kansas State University; Fairfield University; University of Basque Country,"Cassou, SP (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, 327 Waters Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",scassou@k-state.edu; hshadmani@fairfield.edu; jesus.vazquez@ehu.es,"Vazquez, Jesus/D-3067-2019","Vazquez, Jesus/0000-0003-4788-4838","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2010-16970, ECO2013-43773-P]; Basque Government [IT793-13]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government),"We are grateful for helpful comments from the editor, two anonymous referees, Maximo Camacho, Josep Carrion and seminar participants at the 89th Annual Conference of the Western Economic Association International (Denver, USA), XXXIX Symposium of the Spanish Economic Association (Mallorca, Spain) and the IV Workshop in Time Series Econometrics (Zaragoza, Spain).

Experimentally assigned health exposures, namely those tested in randomized controlled trials, may provide opportunities to estimate the causal effects of health on socioeconomic status (SES). We revisit data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a randomized controlled trial of glucose control therapy in Type 1 diabetic patients, and use treatment assignment as an instrument for health status to test the causal effect of treatment related health improvement on subsequent SES measured during the trial's follow-up study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study. We used the Two-Factor Hollingshead Index of Social Position, which comprises education and occupation, to measure SES. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) served as a proxy for health status. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models showed that lower HbA1c at the trial's end was associated with higher SES at both the start of the follow-up and 17 years later. However, instrumental variable analyses showed no causal effect of HbA1c on SES, suggesting that OLS estimates are biased by endogeneity. Sensitivity analyses showed robustness to several alternate specifications. While the HbA1c advantage conferred by random assignment to treatment within the trial did not produce higher Hollingshead Index scores, we note that occupation and education categories may be harder to affect than are outcomes such as income. This analysis offers evidence that clinical trial data may be a rich and unrecognized resource for estimating health effects on SES. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Daepp, Madeleine I.

While the theoretical literature on optimum currency areas highlights the equilibrating effect of divergent wage growth after asymmetric exogenous demand shocks via the external demand channel, recent literature on euro area imbalances emphasizes its dis-equilibrating effect as a source of asymmetric domestic demand shocks, and therefore suggests a negative link to business cycle co-movement. Our empirical results reveal that the latter effect has been clearly dominating in the euro area: Wage growth differentials across countries - while of minor importance for non-euro area EU countries with sovereign currencies - significantly reduce business cycle co-movement within the monetary union and thus increase the cost of the common monetary policy. The large magnitude of the effect calls for enhanced co-ordination efforts of wage policies in the euro area.","[Gaechter, Martin; Riedl, Aleksandra] Oesterreich Nationalbank, Vienna, Austria; [Gruber, Alexander] Univ St Gallen, St Gallen, Switzerland",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB); University of St Gallen,"Gächter, M (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Nationalbank, Foreign Res Div, Otto Wagner Pl 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",martin.gaechter@oenb.at,,"Gachter, Martin/0000-0002-4583-3300",,,,,78,6,6,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

One way to help reduce the detrimental impact of motorized road transportation is to lead drivers, particularly car-dependent ones, to adopt eco-driving. However numerous drivers do not abide by highway laws or display driving-anger behaviors, which are in opposition to eco-driving. Unfortunately, few people practice eco-driving and many new adopters often have trouble maintaining this driving style. What is more, most studies on this issue have focused on eco-driving gains, the ability of people to put it into effect, and/or the continuous decline in the number of people who practice eco-driving. They usually do not take into account people's self-perceptions about their driving style, nor the associated beliefs. The aim of the present self-report study was twofold: identify drivers' self-perceptions about being an eco-driver, and determine how these self-perceptions about being an eco-driver or not are linked to eco-driving-friendly behaviors, levers favoring eco-driving (concern for the environment), and brakes on eco-driving (driving anger and road violations), according to gender. An online survey was carried out with 300 French drivers (127 men) ages 19-83. In our sample, 11.3% of the drivers said they felt they were eco-drivers (G1); 50% said they feel trying to eco-drive (G2); 9.7% said they had never heard of eco-driving and 25% said they knew about eco-driving but didn't do it (G3, felt they were not eco-driver), and 4% said they felt they had abandoned eco-driving (G4). The differences between the first three groups (G1 vs. G2/G3) were in line with their eco-driving self-perceptions: G1 had higher scores on three eco-driving-friendly behavior scale components and on environmental conservation, and lower scores on one factor of the driving-anger scale. Also in line with the groups' eco-driving self-perceptions, G2's scores were higher than G3's scores on one eco-driving friendly behavior component. A gender-by-group interaction was found for G1 vs. G3 on one eco-driving friendly behavior component, with a larger increase in the men's than the women's scores on eco-driving self-perceptions. Finally, violation scores, once again, were higher for men than for women on the speed and anger subscales. The findings of this study are discussed with respect to improving eco-driving learning.","[Negre, Julien; Delhomme, Patricia] IFSTTAR, AME, LPC, 25 Allee Marronniers, F-78000 Versailles, France; [Negre, Julien] Univ Paris 08, Lab CHArt, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis 02, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Paris-VIII,"Nègre, J (通讯作者)，IFSTTAR, AME, LPC, 25 Allee Marronniers, F-78000 Versailles, France.",julien.negre@ifsttar.fr,,,,,,,46,17,18,4,41,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Specifically, Amengual and Watson's (J Bus Econ Stat 25(1):91-96, 2007) method is sensitive to cross-sectional correlation, and Breitung and Pigorsch's (Oxf Bull Econ Stat 75(1):23-36, 2013) estimator is sensitive to the overestimation of the number of static factors.

We analysed EU pesticide standards on African exports alongside a complementary non-tariff measure in the form of a minimum entry price regulation, which aims to protect EU growers of certain fruits and vegetables against international competition. Analysis was based on Africa's exports of tomatoes, oranges, and lime and lemon to the EU between 2008 and 2013, using the gravity model of trade. Our results show that EU market access conditions constitute significant barrier to the formation of new trade relation between the EU and Africa. In addition, initiation of trade relationships is contingent not only on market access conditions but also on domestic market constraints in Africa. These results imply that negotiating preferential entry prices duties and the removal of domestic market restraints as well as strengthening domestic capacity to comply with EU standards to enhance continuous market access for the continent could stimulate food trade along the extensive margin.","[Kareem, Fatima Olanike] Univ Goettingen, GlobalFood Res Training Grp, Gottingen, Germany; [Bruemmer, Bernhard] Univ Goettingen, Dept Agr Econ, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Goettingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Goettingen, Ctr Stat, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I,"Kareem, FO (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, GlobalFood Res Training Grp, Gottingen, Germany.",,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014; Brümmer, Bernhard/C-5067-2009","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557; Brümmer, Bernhard/0000-0001-8052-4346; Kareem, Fatima Olanike/0000-0002-5509-9517",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),Inmaculada Martinez-Zarzoso gratefully acknowledges the financial support received from the lSpanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project reference: ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R).,,46,10,10,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2017,40.0,10,,,,,2277,2300,,10.1111/twec.12466,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FK2XT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413347400011,0

Accordingly, the main research question to what extent the combination of travel modes changes after moving to another city. In discussing this, the paper is based on two conceptual assumptions. First, residential relocations are understood as biographical transitions within a mobility biography. Second, in recent years there has been a trend towards multimodal transport systems, especially in big cities, comprising both the supply and demand of urban transport. We believe that this tendency towards multimodality varies by the overall mobility culture of a particular city, which is expressed, for example, by its car dependence or cycling-friendliness. Combining these findings we believe that people who move between cities representing different mobility cultures are likely to change their use and combination of travel modes. Empirically, this assumption is scrutinized by surveying people who recently moved between the German cities of Bremen, Hamburg and the Ruhr area and showed a monomodal mode choice before the relocation (N = 449). One central finding of this study is that people who moved to a public transport or cycling-friendly city are more likely to become multimodal than the ones who moved to auto-oriented cities.

Some UN institutions require mandatory dues, but most rely substantially on voluntary contributions, which donors can choose to earmark for specific purposes. How donors provide resources has widespread effects on the authority of UN governing bodies, donor control over UN programs, and the efficiency of UN operations. What explains how donors choose to fund UN programs and agencies? We advance a theory that emphasizes member state preferences over the affordability and policy substance of IO activity. Using data from two novel experiments and a case study of U.S. funding practices toward the United Nations (1945-1980s), we provide mixed-method evidence showing that a state is more likely to provide voluntary contributions when its preferences over the affordability and policy of IO activity differ from those of the governing coalition and more likely to provide mandatory contributions when its preferences are consistent with those of the governing coalition. Further, we demonstrate that preferences over policy substance are particularly important in explaining recent trends in donor earmarking.","[Bayram, A.

Instead of relying on renewable energy consumption or generation as commonly done in the literature, we focus on the capacity for solar and wind power generation, which is largely a consequence of the EU's renewable energy policies. In summary, we find that, to date, renewable energy policy-induced wind and solar power capacity promotes growth and/or employment in the short run, but these capacity increases do not stimulate economic growth in the long run in the EU-15 region. In fact, our results tend to support the opposite relationship: increases in wind and solar power capacity are associated with negative economic growth, at least at the total economy level.","[Jaraite, Jurate; Karimu, Amin; Kazukauskas, Andrius] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, CERE, Biblioteksgrand 6, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Jaraite, J (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, CERE, Biblioteksgrand 6, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",jurate.jaraite@umu.se,"Karimu, Amin/JFK-6275-2023","Karimu, Amin/0000-0003-3931-8828; Jaraite, Jurate/0000-0002-0023-3846",,,,,37,13,13,6,35,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,SEP,2017,38.0,5,,,,,197,222,,10.5547/01956574.38.5.jjar,0.0,,,26,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FE2PY,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000408059400010,0

To be successful, such strategies require a very detailed understanding of potential tourists' levels and patterns of spending. Empirical studies of tourist expenditure have tended to employ ordinary least squares regression for this purpose. There are, however, a number of important limitations to this technique, chief among which is its inability to distinguish between tourists who have higher- and lower-than-average levels of spending. As such, some researchers recommend the use of an alternative estimation technique, known as quantile regression, which does allow such distinctions to be made.

In this manner, we can evaluate the impact of the global economic crisis on this sector. To tackle this issue, we apply alternative Malmquist productivity index decompositions to distinguish between different components of productivity. The results reveal that the economic downturn had major negative effects on hotel productivity for 2 years (2008 and 2009). After that period, hotels have increased their productivity levels driven by both technological and catching-up changes. This result provides new evidence supporting the fact that units operating in those destinations might avoid the process of decline predicted by Butler's life cycle model.","[Cordero, Jose M.] Univ Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain; [Tzeremes, Nickolaos G.] Univ Thessaly, Volos, Greece",Universidad de Extremadura; University of Thessaly,"Cordero, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Extremadura, Dept Econ, Ave Elvas S-N, Badajoz 06006, Spain.",jmcordero@unex.es,"Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./AAX-5079-2020; FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/S-5567-2018; Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./AAF-6971-2020","FERRERA, JOSE MANUEL CORDERO/0000-0001-8783-6748; Tzeremes, Nickolaos G./0000-0002-6938-3404",,,,,17,15,15,0,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

As a consequence, the ratio between variances and the dynamic dependence of the common and idiosyncratic differentiated components may change with respect to the original components. In this paper, we analyze the effects of these changes on the finite sample properties of several procedures to determine the number of factors. In particular, we consider the information criteria of Bai and Ng (Econometrica 70(1):191-221, 2002), the edge distribution of Onatski (Rev Econ Stat 92(4):1004-1016, 2010) and the ratios of eigenvalues proposed by Ahn and Horenstein (Econometrica 81(3):1203-1227, 2013). The performance of these procedures when implemented to differentiated variables depends on both the ratios between variances and dependencies of the differentiated factor and idiosyncratic noises. Furthermore, we also analyze the role of the number of factors in the original non-stationary system as well as of its temporal and cross-sectional dimensions. Finally, we implement the different procedures to determine the number of common factors in a system of inflation rates in 15 euro area countries.","[Corona, Francisco; Ruiz, Esther] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Stat, Calle Madrid 126, E-28903 Getafe, Spain; [Poncela, Pilar] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Poncela, Pilar] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Poncela, P (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.;Poncela, P (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",fcorona@est-econ.uc3m.es; pilar.poncela@jrc.ec.europa.eu; ortega@est-econ.uc3m.es,"Corona, Francisco/HLH-3046-2023; Poncela, Pilar/AAB-1726-2019; Pérez, Ana/GQA-6861-2022; Ruiz, Esther/L-1737-2014","Poncela, Pilar/0000-0002-0848-3997; RUIZ, ESTHER/0000-0002-5944-9449","Spanish government [ECO2015-70331-C2-1-R, ECO2015-70331-C2-2-R]",Spanish government(Spanish Government),"Financial support from the Spanish government, contract grants ECO2015-70331-C2-1-R and ECO2015-70331-C2-2-R (MINECO/FEDER) is gratefully acknowledged.",,48,8,9,1,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In this article, I identify determinants that predict a basketball player's susceptibility to choking under pressure. Identification of these determinants adds to our understanding of players' psychology at pivotal points in the game. My analysis draws on play-by-play data from ESPN.com that feature over 2 million free-throw attempts in women's and men's college and professional basketball games from the 2002-2013 seasons. Using regression analysis, I explore the impact of both gender and level of professionalism on performance in high-pressure situations. I find that in the final 30 seconds of a tight game, Women's National Basketball Association and National Basketball Association players are 5.81 and 3.11 percentage points, respectively, less likely to make a free throw, while female and male college players are 2.25 and 2.09 percentage points, respectively, less likely to make a free throw, though statistical significance cannot be established among National Collegiate Athletic Association women. The discrepancy in choking between college and professional players is pronounced when comparing male college players who do and do not make it to the professional level; the free-throw performance of those destined to go pro falls 6 percentage points more in high-pressure situations. Finally, I find that women and men do not differ significantly in their propensity to choke.","[Toma, Mattie] Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst Res Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Toma, M (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Becker Friedman Inst Res Econ, 1126 E 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",mattietoma@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,24,40,44,4,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

We conduct a detailed investigation of the differences in observed travel times by taxi and a bicycle-sharing system (BSS) in New York City in 2014. The taxi trips with origins and destinations in proximity to BSS stations are identified and compared to BSS trips from the same origin and destinations. The travel time comparison is conducted along following dimensions: (a) all trips, (b) temporal dimension including different time periods of the day, weekday versus weekend, and seasonal variation, and (c) distance categories. It is found that during weekdays' AM, Midday and PM time periods for more than half of OD pairs with distance less than 3 km, BSS is either faster or competitive with taxi mode. To further shed light on the travel time comparison, we develop a multivariate analysis using a random utility framework in the form of a panel mixed multi-nomial logit model. Identifying and understanding the factors that influence the travel time differences can help planners to enhance the BSS service offerings. The provision of information to bicycling-inclined individuals on the faster alternative could be used as a marketing tool to attract higher usage for BSS within dense urban cores. The comparison of BSS and taxi can also shed light on the competition between bicycle and car modes in general in dense urban areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Information provided prior to travel has included printed timetables, newspaper advertisements, telephone services and marketing campaigns. During the trip, providers have tended to offer maps at public transport stops (i.e. bus stops, train stations, ferry wharves, etc.) as well as timetables static, dynamic or real-time. Some of these channels are still used but improvements in digital technology has led to a wider range of information distributed using different digital media. Whilst Transport for NSW and transport operators continue to provide the more traditional information, there has been a plethora of third party applications which are accessible on the move. The literature recognises that the need for information and the importance of information provision differs at the various stages of the trip, from planning, to entry into the system, to wayfinding during the trip and egress from the system. However, no systematic research exists as to how information preferences and usage differ between customer segments. It is important for operators and regulators to identify the segments and their information preferences so as to promote public transport use. This paper addresses this important issue by presenting the results of an internet survey of the public's awareness and usage of public transport information, focussing on commuters. The paper looks at awareness and usage of information sources and how this varies by stage of journey and frequency of usage of public transport. Factor analysis is used to identify segments of customers by attitudes towards public transport and usage of information sources. The paper uses an ordered choice modelling approach and finds few differences between frequent and infrequent users but confirmed the role of attitudes in framing the respondent's identification of their satisfaction with the overall public transport trip and with the information sources provided. The paper also identifies the importance of recognising the non-homogeneity of information sources. The paper concludes how the type of information preferred by travellers varies by public transport mode and varies by trip segment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In a continuation of neo-liberal privatisation and labour market activation, the financialised welfare state pursues a policy of welfare retrenchment, while engaging in forms of social engineering aimed at producing self-responsibilised individuals and communities who are financially literate, investment-ready' and economically productive. New financial instruments such as social impact bonds are deployed to these ends, both to solve social problems' and enable cost saving. Through the use of such financial instruments, the implementation of regulatory infrastructures and tax incentives, the financialised welfare state becomes a vehicle for the transfer of wealth from the public to private investors, while subjecting the domain of social policy to the vicissitudes of global financial markets. This paper offers a critique of these developments, situating the case of Britain within the broader global context and with regard to the implications for understanding the current political economy of the welfare state.","[Dowling, Emma] Middlesex Univ, Dept Criminol & Sociol, London, England",Middlesex University,"Dowling, E (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, Dept Criminol & Sociol, London, England.",e.dowling@mdx.ac.uk,,"Dowling, Emma/0000-0001-8710-8265",,,,,82,108,115,2,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Using dynamic panel data models, the authors find that the elasticity of Russian tourists' overnight hotel stays with respect to exchange rates is significantly larger than 1 (approximately 1.6) in absolute terms, indicating that Russian tourists are highly sensitive to changes in exchange rates. There is some evidence that the sensitivity of Russian tourism demand increased following the introduction of economic sanctions in August 2014. The sensitivity of tourism demand to exchange rate changes differs highly across regions and cities, with higher elasticities in border regions and cities not too far from the Russian border. These regions and areas attract a significant number of short-stay Russian visitors who are often motivated by cross-border shopping and other activities.","[Falk, Martin] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Vieru, Markku] Univ Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland",University of Lapland,"Vieru, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lapland, Fac Social Sci, MTI, Yliopistonkatu 8, FI-96300 Rovaniemi, Finland.",markku.vieru@ulapland.fi,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019; Vieru, Markku/L-7843-2013","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513; Vieru, Markku/0000-0002-8833-5248",,,,,18,3,4,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The empirical results show that the share of the working-age population has a positive effect on trade openness.

Yet, one area remains almost entirely overlooked in the literature - allocation of aid-financed contracts. This article aims to address the shortcoming of the existing research and develops a theory of contract allocation in a prominent multilateral aid organization - the World Bank. The theoretical argument explores the relationship between formal procurement arrangements and recipients' control over contract allocation, and the role of this relationship in explaining patterns of contract allocation. My empirical analyses using data on the World Bank's contracts provide evidence of recipients' ability to allocate contracts in favor of domestic companies, as well as bilateral aid donors.","[McLean, Elena V.] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Polit Sci, 507 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"McLean, EV (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Polit Sci, 507 Pk Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",elenamcl@buffalo.edu,,"McLean, Elena/0000-0002-0512-7495",,,,,47,12,12,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

In 2006, the Colombian government pledged not to spray a 10 km band around the frontier with Ecuador due to diplomatic frictions arising from the possibly negative collateral effects of this policy on the Ecuadorian side of the border. We exploit this variation to estimate the effect of spraying on coca cultivation by regression discontinuity around the 10 km threshold and by conditional differences in differences. Our results suggest that spraying one additional hectare reduces coca cultivation by 0.022 to 0.03 hectares; these effects are too small to make aerial spraying a cost-effective policy for reducing cocaine production in Colombia.","[Mejia, Daniel] Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Restrepo, Pascual] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rozo, Sandra V.] USC Marshall Sch Business, Finance & Business Econ Dept, Los Angeles, CA USA",Universidad de los Andes - Chile; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Mejía, D (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Dept Econ, Santiago, Chile.",dmejia@uniandes.edu.co; pascual@mit.edu; sandra.rozo@marshall.usc.edu,"Rozo, Sandra V./R-7622-2018","Rozo, Sandra V./0000-0001-7025-1583",,,,,64,15,22,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Questionnaire-experimental studies of population ethics and policy,SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Is a larger population of people living good lives a better population, all else equal? This question is central to population issues in social welfare, ethics, and policy. Many answers in the philosophical literature argue that if a policy choice results in the birth of additional people living good lives, these extra lives are irrelevant to any evaluation of the policy. This paper applies the questionnaire-experimental method of empirical studies of social choice to investigate participants' policy choices and social orderings with respect to population size and average well-being. In general, heterogeneous responses depended on the quantitative and qualitative properties of the question. In particular, an experimentally manipulated increase in population size caused an option to be more likely to be selected, on average. Overall, responses suggest that population size is not neutral to social welfare. Many participants, although not all, reported that a larger population of people living good lives could be strictly preferable, at small or no costs to average well-being.","[Spears, Dean] Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, New Delhi, India; [Spears, Dean] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Spears, Dean] Rice, New Delhi, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Spears, D (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, New Delhi, India.;Spears, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Dept Econ, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Spears, D (通讯作者)，Rice, New Delhi, India.",dean@riceinstitute.org,,,"r.i.c.e.

In all, we have a complete set of building structure and household characteristics for dwellings on almost 30,000 lots for each of these years. We estimate a logit model to predict joint lot redevelopment, based on structural characteristics of lots and dwellings and on social characteristics of their occupants. The results show that both types of characteristics significantly explain land assembly, and the regression coefficients adhere to the theoretical land assembly literature. This paper contributes importantly to our knowledge of the specific land parcel and structural physical characteristics that impact redevelopment.

The estimation results of the dynamic linear logit model reveal that the dynamic adjustment in the input demand system is very sluggish. In addition, the estimation results show that an increase in gasoline output no longer raises the share of ethanol after imposing the mandated percentage standard for ethanol. The estimated price elasticities of input demand offer statistical evidence that ethanol demand is less responsive to crude oil prices in the post-ethanol-mandate period than in the pre-ethanol-mandate period. The decompositions of cross-price elasticities strongly support that the reduced elasticities of ethanol demand with respect to the price of crude oil are more attributable to the mandated percentage standard for ethanol rather than the relative price of ethanol to crude oil.","[Suh, Dong Hee; Moss, Charles B.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Suh, DH (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL 32610 USA.",do1ghsuh@ufl.edu,"Moss, Charles/U-5254-2017","Moss, Charles/0000-0002-1172-7112; Suh, Dong Hee/0000-0002-6154-3864",,,,,55,0,0,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Analysis of interviews with union officials and union members in publicly funded, in-home personal support reveal two community dimensions: both caring and racialized relations between workers and service recipients. Scholarship on care workers emphasizes empathy and coalition with service recipients as a key aspect of union renewal, yet says little about racialized tensions. Studies of domestic workers emphasize organizing in response to racialization, but provide little insight into caring social relations at work. This article develops arguments that both positive and negative worker-recipient relations shape union organizing and representation in the service sector by specifying the ways in which racialization contributes to this dynamic. It suggests that anti-racist organizing at work, alongside coalition building and collective bargaining, are important renewal strategies for this sector.","[Bauer, Louise Birdsell] Univ Toronto, Sociol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Cranford, Cynthia] Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Bauer, LB (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Sociol, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada.",louise.birdsellbauer@utoronto.ca,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [410-06-1424, 895-2012-1021]",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We would like to acknowledge the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Grants 'Negotiating quality care and quality work: Personal care providers and people with physical disabilities' (File No: 410-06-1424) for supporting data collection and 'Gender, migration and the work of care' (File No: 895-2012-1021) for supporting analysis and writing of this article.",,51,9,11,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

I show that when individuals are more social gain seeking than social loss averse (i.e. gloating is stronger than envy), social comparison predicts more risk-taking as well as a preference for negatively correlated gambles. Testing these two joint propositions in a laboratory experiment, I find that preference for positively or negatively correlated outcomes is highly correlated with risk-taking in a social risky investment task. While only a third of subjects prefer negatively correlated outcomes in a peer comparison setting, in line with relatively stronger social gain seeking, those subjects invest on average 50 % more in a risky gamble in their peer comparison setting than a reference group that made the same decision in an isolated individual setting. Subjects with a preference for positively correlated outcomes, in line with relatively stronger social loss aversion, do not show a higher propensity to invest in a risky gamble compared to the individual reference group.","[Dijk, Oege] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Econ, IMR, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Dijk, O (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Econ, IMR, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",o.dijk@fm.ru.nl,,,European Research Council,European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"O.

To explore factors affecting fatigued driving behaviour from the perspective of social psychology, a questionnaire was designed based on the theory of planned behaviour. A sample of 214 drivers was examined. Drivers with poor sleep quality or a history of fatigue all showed a greater tendency to continue driving while fatigued, to have a more positive attitude towards driving while fatigued, and to perceive a higher level of control while driving fatigued. Furthermore, hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed overall support for the predictive utility of the theory of planned behaviour, accounting for 30.4% of the variance of fatigued driving behaviour after controlling for demographic variables. Overall, the results suggest that subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention have significant effects on self-reported continued driving while fatigued. Hence, a multiple-strategy approach should be utilized in addressing this issue. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Since 2002, the Taichung City Government has proposed a series of reforms to gradually improve bus operations. As a result, bus ridership grew more than 20 times from 13,000 per day in 2001 to 330,000 per day in 2014. These successful reforms have led to increased public acceptance of bus service and created a win-win-win situation for the government, the public and the bus companies. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the crucial strategies and policies that resulted in the successful implementation of bus reforms in Taichung City. The causes and effects, in terms of new institutional economics, are also discussed. The results showed that before the implementation of reforms, the Taichung bus market was locked in a vicious cycle. The Taichung City Government re-shaped the market structure through fare adjustment, electronic fare payment, subsidies and promotional efforts. Through institutional change, a new market-oriented framework was created. Institutional change is a gradual process that involves numerous interactions among relevant parties and interest groups. Policy progress is not made by the government alone, but rather through limited consensus among interest groups. The results of this paper also suggested that the government play the role of initiator of a new institutional environment and provide direction for institutional evolution. The case of Taichung City bus reform provides a good reference for similar-sized cities planning to upgrade or reform their public transportation system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the parameters of the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by auto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMM), in order to capture the underlying characteristics of the financial time series. Portfolio optimization is then performed by maximizing the return achieved with a predefined probability instead of optimizing the predictability parameter, which provides more profitable portfolios. The selection of the optimal portfolio according to the goal function is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint in terms of providing a sparse portfolios which minimize the transaction costs (and, as a result, maximize the interpretability of the results). In order to use the method for high frequency trading (HFT) we utilize a massively parallel GPGPU architecture. Both the portfolio optimization and the model identification algorithms are successfully tailored to be running on GPGPU to meet the challenges of efficient software implementation and fast execution time. The performance of the new method has been extensively tested both on historical daily and intraday FOREX data and on artificially generated data series. The results demonstrate that a good average return can be achieved by the proposed trading algorithm in realistic scenarios. The speed profiling has proven that GPGPU is capable of HFT, achieving high-throughput real-time performance.","[Sipos, I.

Therefore, credit controls on the flows can be used as a policy tool to pursue economic and financial stability.","[Ali, Faek Menla; Spagnolo, Fabio; Spagnolo, Nicola] Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Spagnolo, Nicola] CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Brunel University; Australian National University,"Ali, FM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ London, Dept Econ & Finance, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",faek.menlaali@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,22,4,4,1,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Exponential discounting has a well-established axiomatic foundation originally developed by Koopmans (Econometrica 28(2):287-309, 1960, 1972) and Koopmans et al. (Econometrica 32(1/2):82-100, 1964) with subsequent contributions by several other authors, including Bleichrodt et al. (J Math Psychol 52(6):341-347, 2008). The papers by Hayashi (J Econ Theory 112(2):343-352, 2003) and Olea and Strzalecki (Q J Econ 129(3):1449-1499, 2014) axiomatize quasi-hyperbolic discounting. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an alternative foundation for exponential and quasi-hyperbolic discounting, with simple, transparent axioms and relatively straightforward proofs. Using techniques by Fishburn (The foundations of expected utility. Reidel Publishing Co, Dordrecht, 1982) and Harvey (Manag Sci 32(9):1123-1139, 1986), we show that Anscombe and Aumann's (Ann Math Stat 34(1):199-205, 1963) version of Subjective Expected Utility theory can be readily adapted to axiomatize the aforementioned types of discounting, in both finite and infinite horizon settings.","[Anchugina, Nina] Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Anchugina, N (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Math, Auckland, New Zealand.",n.anchugina@auckland.ac.nz,,,University of Auckland,University of Auckland,"I would like to thank my supervisor Matthew Ryan for thoughtful advice and support.

In a two-step estimation procedure, the authors first quantify the price effect of single room and hotel services and then examine the relationship between accommodation prices and city characteristics. They find that hotel services differ significantly from city to city and that room characteristics such as size, breakfast, air conditioning, and free-cancellation options are services for which customers are willing to pay a significant markup. Moreover, the service content of accommodation is negatively correlated with the value of the city center where the hotel is located: increasing competition on the European market seems to be producing partial price convergence via adjustment of service and quality content, so that cities with higher factor costs tend to cut service quality while cheaper towns improve it.","[Baldassin, Luigino; Gallo, Massimo; Mattevi, Elena] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Mattevi, E (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Stat Directorate, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",elena.mattevi@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,38,10,11,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A unique administrative dataset with assigned settlement municipalities is used to identify the causal effect of initial location characteristics. Being placed in a labor market where other non-OECD immigrants do well increases own annual labor earnings up to 6 years after immigration. Extended models suggest that this effect is not driven by individual scarring effects: when controlling for the contemporaneous employment rate in the assigned region, effects of initial conditions disappear. Rather, the effects appear to be due to persistence in local labor market conditions combined with limited geographical mobility in response to adverse labor market conditions.","[Godoy, Anna] Inst Social Res, Oslo, Norway",,"Godoy, A (通讯作者)，Inst Social Res, Oslo, Norway.",a.a.godoy@socialresearch.no,,,"Norwegian Research Council [202513, 217264]",Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This research is part of the projects Social Insurance and Labor Market Inclusion in Norway (Grant 202513) and Convergence or Segregation (Grant 217264), financed by the Norwegian Research Council.",,13,19,20,2,26,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The Mikan rule was intended to curb the offensive potency of tall players whose primary contribution to team output consisted of points scored close to the basket. The Mikan rule limited players' ability to stand close to the basket, and hence made it more difficult for these players to score. However, the rule change did not account for strategic offsetting behavior-that defensive players' optimal allocation of resources would change in response to the rule. I engage the literature on strategic offsetting behavior and estimate a two-way fixed effects model that strongly suggests the Mikan rule did not have its intended effect due to strategic offsetting behavior.","[Salter, Alexander W.] Berry Coll, Econ, Mt Berry, GA USA",,"Salter, AW (通讯作者)，Berry Coll, 2277 Martha Berry Hwy NW, Mt Berry, GA 30149 USA.",asalter@berry.edu,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This research proposes several theories of how participation affects success but cannot distinguish between them. I ask a fundamentally different question, whether an athlete performs better or worse, academically, during the season in which they participate in sports, focusing on the time allocation theory of participation. Time spent on sports may substitute from time on academics or negative leisure activities, causing academic performance to improve or decline in-season, respectively. This paper finds a small negative and significant in-season effect on academic performance for varsity athletes and a small positive and significant in-season effect on academic performance for junior varsity (JV) athletes. Decreases in in-season grade point average (GPA) for varsity athletes occur through a decline in performance in English and history courses, while increases in in-season GPAfor JV athletes operate through an improvement in math and science courses. Results are robust to controlling for various measures of course ease across semesters. The relatively small in-season effects suggest that estimates of the effects of participation in the rest of the literature operate primarily through mechanisms other than time allocation.","[Schultz, Katie] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Morton Hall 110,621 Jamestown Rd, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Schultz, K (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Morton Hall 110,621 Jamestown Rd, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",keschultz01@wm.edu,,,,,,,18,4,8,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Each player has a strategy set, with strategies such as setting interest rates, lending, borrowing, producing, consuming, investing, importing, exporting, defaulting, and penalizing default. Markets for goods, debt, and capital are modeled endogenously. This conceptualization of strategic opportunities for as many as six types of players is richer than anything that has been attempted earlier. 2005-2011 empirical data for Greece is used to analyze how utility is impacted by public consumption and lump sum transfers, and negative productivity shocks, and to analyze equilibrium over several time periods with and without the possibility of default. 2007-2008 empirical data for Greece and Germany is used to determine how the two countries' utilities depend on Greece's public 2007 consumption, with and without negative productivity shocks. Greece's high debt burden is shown to make default optimal when productivity shocks are large and the default penalty is small. We find that Germany has limited ability, through its available strategies, to prevent a Greek default, and may need to resort to unconventional tools such as debt forgiveness and changing the default penalty.","[Welburn, Jonathan William] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Ind Engn, 1550 Engn Dr,Room 3158, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Hausken, Kjell] Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Hausken, K (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Fac Social Sci, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",welburn@wisc.edu; kjell.hausken@uis.no,,,National Science Foundation [DGE-0718123]; Research Council of Norway [DGE-0718123]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1256259],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank an anonymous referee of this journal for useful comments.

Perhaps not surprising, many governments all around the world are providing incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles (EVs). A positive response from consumers means that the demand for the charging infrastructure increases as well. We investigate how an existing traditional parking lot, upgraded with chargers, can suit the present demand for charging stations. In particular, a resulting EV-enabled parking lot is an electricity trading agent (i.e., broker) which acts as an energy retailer and as a player on a target electricity market. In this paper, we use agent-based simulation to present the EV-enabled parking lot ecosystem in order to model the underlying dynamics and uncertainties regarding parking lots with electricity trading agent functionalities.

As EU promotes the BEPS project, the Council decision to integrate the results of the BEPS project as identical as possible for all member states was implemented by the Commission by proposing a set of directives. One of these proposals was adopted by the Council in 2016, Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 of 12 July 2016 laying down rules against tax avoidance practices (ATAD) that directly affect the functioning of the internal market. The CCTB Directive is still pending in Council. The scope of this article is to make a short presentation of the new ideas for computing the tax base of companies and permanent establishments included in the EU proposal and to analyse the legal effects of these provisions at the transposition into the Romanian Tax Code.

In the case of developing countries in some economic models it is considered as a factor that can help to avoid middle income trap. From the regional perspective developing digital economy can support the process of convergence and closing development gap between the regions. As a result, a comparative research concerning the development level of digital economy is an important scientific task. In this context, the aim of the article is to assess and compare the development level of digital economy in Polish regions (NUTS 1). The digital economy is commonly considered as a multiple-criteria phenomenon. Thus, an approach based on TOPSIS method with application of generalized distance measure GDM was used in the analysis. Six diagnostic variables concerning digital infrastructure and level of its utilization were used. The research was conducted for the years 2012-2015 with application of Eurostat Data. The conducted analysis confirmed relatively quick progress in the field of building digital economy obtained by Polish regions.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Balcerzak, AP (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",adam.balcerzak@umk.pl; michal.pietrzak@umk.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,17,5,5,0,9,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,21,28,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000002,0

This article focuses on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an executive body created in 1975 ostensibly to stand sentry on the US's 'open' investment door. Previous accounts have explained CFIUS's origins in terms of an inter-branch conflict between an 'internationalist' Executive and a 'protectionist' Congress, but these accounts are far from comprehensive. Based on new archival evidence as well as a broad review of congressional-hearing transcripts, government reports and trade publications, this article finds that existing analyses underestimate the influence of internationally oriented segments of capital, overlook the emergence of key conflicts within the Executive and disregard the specific economic ideas that motivated policy-makers to establish CFIUS and later reform it. These findings buttress the article's conclusion that CFIUS represents not merely a generic case of inter-branch conflict, but a concrete case of neoliberal state-building.","[Baltz, Matthew J.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Baltz, Matthew J.] Bucknell Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Bucknell University,"Baltz, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Sociol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;Baltz, MJ (通讯作者)，Bucknell Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA.",mjbaltz@ucla.edu,,,Gerald R.

The novel methodology is applied to Japanese imports of manufacturing goods at the most detailed level of classification. It is shown that the North lost market share in direct competition with the South in all of the three product segments (low, medium and high), and in every sub-period from 1988 to 2010, except in the high segment inthe 1988-91 sub-period. Most of the North's direct loss to the South took place in the low and medium segments. China accounts for most of the South's direct gains in these two segments, while the rest of the developing countries of Asia accounts for most of these gains in the high segment.","[Batista, Jorge Chami] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Liu, Yan] Dalian Nationalities Univ, Int Business Sch, Dalian, Peoples R China",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Dalian Minzu University,"Batista, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,CAPES/Ministry of Education of Brazil; National Social Science Fund of China [13CGJ034],CAPES/Ministry of Education of Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Social Science Fund of China,"Financial support from CAPES/Ministry of Education of Brazil and from the National Social Science Fund of China (Project No. 13CGJ034; Project Title Research on the Chinese Manufacturing Export Quality) are gratefully acknowledged by Chami Batista and Y.

This has reflected the fallacy of the financial reporting model to communicate a company's risk profile, the recent scandals and the financial crisis. The European Union, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and other national standard setters have introduced specific requirements in order to impose companies to highlight the principal financial risks and uncertainties that they face. The idea is that high-quality risk disclosure help investors and other market participants in their decision-making process, by providing a better understanding of the risk exposures and risk management practices of companies. Previous studies show large heterogeneity in risk reporting within individual countries and identify size as key determinant of risk disclosure. A few researches propose a cross-country investigation of risk reporting and to date there is a lack of evidence about companies operating in Southern Europe, especially in the Balkans. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we fill this gap by analyzing risk reporting regulations in Albania and in Italy to examine the different requirements. Second, we examine risk information disclosed by a sample of 12 Albanian companies and 12 Italian companies within their annual reports, using content analysis. Due to small sample size we offer preliminary findings about financial risk disclosure. The results show that on average Albanian companies disclose less information on financial risk than Italian companies. Different explanations can be given for this evidence: i) risk disclosure regulation is less incisive in Albania, because it is limited to inform investors about the relevance of financial instruments and the terms and conditions of loans; ii) Albanian companies have fewer incentives to disclose risk information than Italian companies.","[Dicuonzo, Grazia; Dell'Atti, Vittorio] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Largo Abbazia Santa Scolast 53, Bari, Italy; [Fusco, Antonio] Catholic Univ Our Lady of Good Counsel, Univ Katolik Zoja e KeshillitteMire, Rr Dritanhoxha, Tirane, Albania",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Dicuonzo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Largo Abbazia Santa Scolast 53, Bari, Italy.",,"Dicuonzo, Grazia/AAT-5110-2020","Dicuonzo, Grazia/0000-0002-8022-026X; Fusco, Antonio/0009-0007-1688-5324",,,,,25,2,5,0,2,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2017,,,,,,,182,196,,10.18502/kss.v1i2.656,0.0,,,15,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BJ1DU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417433200014,0

It follows that the value of the shareholding may not simply be equal to the pro rata value of the business capital, but rather its valuation has to take into consideration the features, peculiarities, and effects, which are inherent to the typology of the shareholding to be transferred. Discounts and premiums do not just affect the value of a company; they play a crucial role in influencing a host of other factors and conditions that can make or break a deal.

We argue that mobile payments should be understood in the context of changing consumption practices and the wider problematic of the consumer subject in International Political Economy. One (managerialist) view of these changes suggests that certain immaterial' values in brands, logos or networks can become an important element in economic growth. Thus, businesses increasingly craft user experiences to realise brand value as the indicator of future consumption, for example, Facebook, Netflix. Against this view, the critical literature has underlined how the customer relationship should be understood as an element in corporate power; enticing consumer subjects to dedicate their social lives to the task of monetisation. Rather than choose between sides of this dichotomy, we suggest it may be more fruitful to reflect upon the unanticipated potentialities of mobile payments. By reflecting on the sociality of money, we move beyond a simple cost-benefit analysis, or a structural determinism, to emphasise the contingency of market subjects, questioning how to think about the relationship between consumer subjects, on the one hand, and and a putatively impersonal (yet palpable) global economy, on the other.","[Kremers, Ruben; Brassett, James] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies PAIS, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Brassett, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies PAIS, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",j.brassett.1@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,10,11,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

However, resulting price modifications might also swing surplus across producers and consumers. In this paper, we calculate nodal prices for the Mexican power system and further analyze how allocations of financial transmission rights (FTRs) can be used to mitigate resulting distributional effects. The share of FTRs to be allocated to different generation plants and loads is studied as a second step of an electricity tariff subsidy reform agenda that includes, as a first step, the change to nodal pricing and, as a third step, the reformulation of actual regressive subsidies in a progressive way. We test our model in a realistic nodal price setting, based on an hourly modeling of the Mexican power system.","[Kunz, Friedrich; Kemfert, Claudia] DIW Berlin, Dept Energy, Transportat, Environm, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Rosellon, Juan] CIDE, Dept Econ, Carretera Mexico Toluca 3655 Col Lomas Santa Fe, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

By monitoring the evolution of the performance of each employee, we were able to evaluate the success of the model. Although there are several methodologies in the market, none of them results from a symbiosis between traditional and iterative methodologies, and there is no reference to any model that can dynamically address the employee's motivation.

This article tests Duverger's law through analysis of a dataset covering Mongolian parliamentary elections in the period of 1996-2004. The results show consistent, but not linear, movement towards the Duvergerian equilibrium in Mongolia, with large part of the districts conforming to the Duvergerian norm of two-party competition. Duverger treated his law merely as an important tendency but insisted that social forces are the main determinants of the number of political parties. The main factor that limited Mongolian voters' rationality, and created problems with their strategic ability to distinguish and abandon hopeless candidates, was weak institutionalization of the Mongolian party system. Finally, I prove that the emergence of bipolar party politics was not an immediate process and will continue over a series of elections, supporting the so-called  learning hypothesis.","[Maskarinec, Pavel] Univ JE Purkyne, Philosoph Fac, Dept Polit Sci & Philosophy, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Maskarinec, P (通讯作者)，Univ JE Purkyne, Philosoph Fac, Dept Polit Sci & Philosophy, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",maskarinec@centrum.cz,"Maškarinec, Pavel/J-8629-2014","Maškarinec, Pavel/0000-0002-5336-4073",,,,,52,6,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The empirical results suggestusing infinite-horizon returns and all of the caveats that accompany such a perspectivethat real estate allocations of approximately 10-15% of the mixed-asset portfolio represent an upper bound for most investors. For those investors preferring low-risk portfolios, (unlevered) private real estate is the vehicle serving this allocation preference; for those investors preferring high-risk portfolios, public real estate (with its embedded leverage of 40-50%) is the vehicle serving this allocation preferencewith such vehicles serving as substitutes for a variety of noncore real estate strategies. In some sense, the distinction between private and public real estate is more about the use of leverage.

Due to country risk, companies should demand higher returns in some countries, for the same investments. than in others. The key question of the paper is to find robust risk measure of country risk for longer term valuations. We analyze the hypothesis that country risk ratings are less volatile than market indicators to economic and financial uncertainties. Sovereign risk and country risk ratings also provide information about the country risk, but the methods are different. The paper follows three steps. The first is to analyze the most common alternatives to measure country risk. The second is to examine the relationship between country risk based on IHS Global Insight (GI) score and sovereign risk based on five-year sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads, thereafter comparing the stability of the two types of measures (i.e. risk scores vs. CDS spreads). The comparison confirmed our hypothesis. Beside measurement, it is of key importance how a country's risk exposure could be mitigated, in which insurance might play the crucial role.

First, two groups of EU member countries with different levels of development of their renewable energy sectors are identified. Then, the dynamic common correlated effect estimator proposed by Chudik and Pesaran (2015) is used in order to estimate the error correction models in both groups of countries as well as in all EU countries. The results reveal that the level of development of the renewable energy sector influences energy-growth nexus. The findings on long-term output elasticities suggest that both renewable and non-renewable energy plays a significant role in economic growth in countries with a relatively high level of development of the renewable energy sector. The results obtained for a short-term perspective indicate bidirectional causal relations in this group. In the other group only non-renewable energy consumption influences economic growth.","[Papiez, Monika; Smiech, Slawomir; Frodyma, Katarzyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Papiez, M (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Rakowicka 27 St, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",papiezm@uek.krakow.pl; smiechs@uek.krakow.pl; frodymak@uek.krakow.pl,"Papież, Monika/I-3257-2018; Śmiech, Sławomir/I-3253-2018; Frodyma, Katarzyna/I-4596-2018","Papież, Monika/0000-0003-3597-2080; Frodyma, Katarzyna/0000-0003-3201-4805","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland [2015/17/B/HS4/02685]","National Science Centre (NCN), Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This paper was supported by funds from the National Science Centre (NCN), Poland through grant No 2015/17/B/HS4/02685.",,14,1,1,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,280,289,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000029,0

A great number of changes in the environment and their dynamics require continuous readiness for changes and swift reactions on the part of enterprises. Such a situation enforces changes inside enterprises that stem from their reaction to changes in the environment, not to mention some planned changes being a part of the development strategy and the necessity to react to continuous processes taking place inside an enterprise. Many enterprises cope with the abovementioned issues but some are unable to take advantage of the occurring opportunities and deal with limitations and managerial difficulties. Efficient management ensures stability and economic stability both for the enterprise as well as for the employees and the management team. The purpose of this paper is to indicate durability and stability factors of an enterprise in the period of intensive changes. Conclusions were drawn based on the analysis of quantitative and qualitative research. The base method comprised of a survey questionnaire which for the purpose of the conclusion drawing process was supported with an in-depth interview. Research has been carried out in May and June 2017 in eight enterprises from podlaskie voivodship that are recognised leaders in their area in Poland. These are large enterprises from construction, engineering and pharmaceutical industries. Each and every one of those frequently awarded enterprises has great experience, operates using modern technologies, has creative R&D departments and sells its products and services abroad. Enterprises for the research were selected intentionally, based on their position on the market, growth and economic stability and the ability to manage change. The main conclusions resulting from the research are related to factors conditioning market success that make those enterprises durable and resilient. The main factors include: effectiveness of change management, agile managerial staff, proper selection of target markets, the ability to identify goals and interests of both internal as well as external stakeholders, negotiation capabilities and the ability to control emotions in an effective way.","[Paszkowski, Jerzy] Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Paszkowski, J (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Bialystok, Poland.",j.paszkowski@pb.edu.pl,"Paszkowski, Jerzy/S-9115-2018","Paszkowski, Jerzy/0000-0002-2565-4954",,,,,29,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,653,659,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300065,0

Parental leaves and Early Childhood Education and Care services (ECEC) are among main forms of social investment, contributing to child poverty reduction and increasing equality, as well as underpinning the potential for skilled workers in the future. The aim of the paper is to analyse availability of the main forms of social investment in preschool age children - early childhood education services and parental leaves, in Vidzeme region (Latvia) for a case study. An analysis of policy documents, parents' surveys at pre-school institutions, interviews with education institution representatives and local authorities regarding education and social matters were conducted in the research. The support system for parents is still dominated by the passive form of support system. However, social investment policies are becoming increasingly more important. This is achieved by supporting parents' access to social investment services and by increasing the amount of parental leave benefits. In 2013-2015 funding for child-care and family policy has increased. Expenditure growth was mostly affected by an increase in the allowance for childcare and the minimum parental allowance. The availability of ECEC is moderate, but since 2009 private institutions and since 2013 babysitting services have been co-funded at the national level till May 31, 2016 to improve it. Since September 2015 a 3-year innovative project Vouchers for the provision of child minder services to workers with nonstandard work schedules has been introduced too, to promote parental employment and work and family balance. In Vidzeme region, for example, service availability is additionally stimulated by free transport services, ECEC fee discounts for poor, low-income and large families, etc. Results show that the availability of ECEC has been improved and there has been signs of positive changes in children's development. Nevertheless, the availability of ECEC is moderate, and in some poorer municipalities in Latvia Matthew effects can be spotted - the middle and highest strata of society use services to a higher extend then the low-income society.","[Rajevska, Feliciana; Reima, Katrine] Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Valmiera, Latvia",Vidzeme University of Applied Sciences,"Rajevska, F (通讯作者)，Vidzeme Univ Appl Sci, Valmiera, Latvia.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,13,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2017,,,,,,,353,362,,10.17770/sie2017vol4.2247,0.0,,,10,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP8NT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000566189200031,0

Our aim is to clarify some aspects of their regularity condition for preorders, showing that, as far as rationalization of a choice correspondence alone is concerned, no further restriction is imposed by requiring the preorder to be regular. However, if one is also interested in capturing other observable aspects of the individual's choice procedure, such as Eliaz and Ok's notion of c-incomparability or the notion of behavioral indifference introduced in this paper, then the only option is to use a regular preorder. We also argue that their weak axiom of revealed non-inferiority (WARNI) is too strong a property if our aim is to characterize the rationalizability of a choice correspondence by a (possibly incomplete) preorder. Finally, as we have mentioned above, we introduce the notion of behavioral indifference and argue, not only that Eliaz and Ok's notion of c-incomparability (observable incomparability) can be derived from it, but also that it has a wider range of applicability than their notion of observable incomparability.","[Ribeiro, Mauricio; Riella, Gil] Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Riella, G (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Econ, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",mauriciocouri@gmail.com; riella@nyu.edu,"Riella, Gil/Q-3416-2019",,,,,,7,6,8,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2017,82.0,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1007/s11238-016-9556-x,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EK8BE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394148100001,0

Likewise, women are stereotypically good communicators, being capable of empathy, thus providing support in the quest to develop a corporate social responsibility (CSR) vision that is at the core of a business goals and strategies. This study examines the impact of board gender diversity on CSR for listed companies at the Bucharest Stock Exchange, over 2007-2011. Even if the frequency analysis emphasizes that the number of companies adopting CSR has increased, the CSR in Romania is still at an incipient stage. The parametric investigation via independent samples t test reveals that there are significant difference as regards the number and the share of women on boards, as measures of board gender diversity, between CSR and no CSR companies, but only in 2007 and 2008. Further, by estimating logistic regressions, alongside mixed effects logistic regressions, the results provide support for a negative impact of the number, as well as the share of women on boards on CSR. The empirical evidence also shows that board size has a positive impact on CSR, whilst the link between the gender of CEO and CSR was not statistically validated. However, current investigation supports that women directors encounter barriers that limit their capacity to contribute to an effective decision-making process.","[Simionescu, Liliana Nicoleta; Gherghina, Stefan Cristian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Simionescu, LN (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",liliana.simionescu@fin.ase.ro; stefan.gherghina@fin.ase.ro,"Gherghina, Ştefan Cristian/J-3339-2012","Gherghina, Ştefan Cristian/0000-0003-2911-6480",,,,,64,0,0,0,1,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-383-6,,,,2017,,,,,,,229,246,,,,,,18,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7OU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455266300017,0

Attention is important to learning and other cognitive processes. Learning is most efficient when a person is paying attention. Adolescence is a critical transition period, during which fundamental changes prepare the adolescent for becoming an adult. The neurobiology of adolescent behaviour have emerged, promoting the central role of reward and motivation, coupled with cognitive immaturities. It was concluded that maturation and experience are significant in the allocation of attention problems and errors during everyday tasks. The aim was to explore adolescents' attention and to compare two methods of focus for improvement. 24 teenagers take a part in this experiment (16 girls, 8 boys). The teenagers were 12-16 (average age 14, 3). Three groups were created (two groups with different methods and control group). The activities lasted 3 months. The first group of respondents (EGA) practiced the author's developed methods of playing music in vocal ensemble twice a week, while the other group of respondents (EGB) practiced with computerized equipment CogniPlus. Attention indicators were analysed using the Vienna Test System (SCHUHFRIED) - COG and WAFF tests. Both tests measured various aspects of attention. It was concluded that the EGA group response time statistically significantly improved compared to baseline - 2.28 sec. vs. 1.92 sec. (P = 0.039), but the EGB and CG groups showed no statistically significant differences. In turn, WAFF test, which has to assess to auditory attention reaction time, EGA group has found no statistically significant differences - 0.74 sec. vs. 0.46 sec. (P = 0.002), while EGB are seen only a tendency to improvement in the reaction rate. The results show that although both methods contribute to improvements in attention, however, playing music, influenced by attention statistically significantly. It is planned to continue the study by increasing the number of respondents, as well as the test of attention scores.","[Trubina, Irena] Riga Teacher Training & Educ Management Acad RTTE, Riga, Latvia",,"Trubina, I (通讯作者)，Riga Teacher Training & Educ Management Acad RTTE, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,REZEKNE HIGHER EDUC INST-REZEKNES AUGSTSKOLA,REZEKNE,"LIBERATION ALLEY 90, REZEKNE, SL-4600, LATVIA",1691-5887,,,SABIED INTEGR IZGL,,,2017,,,,,,,147,157,,10.17770/sie2017vol4.2270,0.0,,,11,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Economics; Public Administration",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Business & Economics; Public Administration,BP8NT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000566189200013,0

The dataset comprised the 60 main airports that were under Infraero administration in 2009 and 2015, three years before and three years after concessions began to come into effect. In that period, concessions were granted on 5 major airports previously administered by Infraero, which are among the main hubs in Brazil, and one smaller, new airport. DEA modelling was used to analyse performance in the study years. In 2009, the airports considered accounted for 56% of the market; in 2015, the percentage fell to 52%. The findings show that not only did this set of airports lose market share, their performance declined significantly. In the study period, the enterprise's overall performance index fell from 71.48% to 62.73%, as it failed to encounter pathways to improvement in the scenario of concessions of airports to private administration.","[Fernandes, Elton; Pacheco, Ricardo Rodrigues] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPE, Prod Engn Program, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Pacheco, RR (通讯作者)，Ctr Tecnol, Bloco F Sala 108,Cidade Univ, BR-21945970 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",tglcoppe@gmail.com; rpacheco48@gmail.com,"Pacheco, Ricardo Rodrigues/AAQ-8376-2020; Fernandes, Elton/I-2908-2017","Pacheco, Ricardo Rodrigues/0000-0003-2636-3152; Fernandes, Elton/0000-0001-9340-8547",,,,,45,16,16,0,25,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

Assessing the effects of these tradeoffs on consumer welfare requires estimates of both the degree of the tradeoffs, and consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for the foregone benefits. This paper has two objectives. The first is to review recent literature that presents, or can be used to calculate, marginal WTP (MWTP) for vehicle attributes to describe the attributes that have been studied and the estimated MWTP values. We found 52 U.S.-focused papers with sufficient data to calculate WTP values for 142 different vehicle attributes, which we organized into 15 general groups of comfort, fuel availability, fuel costs, fuel type, incentives, model availability, non-fuel operating costs, performance, pollution, prestige, range, reliability, safety, size, and vehicle type. Measures of dispersion around central MWTP values typically show large variation in MWTP values for attributes. We explore factors that may contribute to this large variation via analysis of variance (ANOVA) and find that, although most have statistically significant effects, they account for only about one third of the observed variation. Case studies of papers that provide estimates from a variety of model formulations and estimation methods suggest that decisions made by researchers can strongly influence MWTP estimates. The paper's second objective is to seek consensus estimates for WTP for fuel cost reduction and increased acceleration performance. Meta-analysis of MWTP for reduced fuel cost indicates that estimates based on revealed vs. stated preference data differ, as do estimates from models that account for endogeneity and those that do not. We find greater consistency in estimates of MWTP for acceleration despite substantial uncertainty about the overall mean. We conclude with recommendations for improving the understanding of consumers' MWTP for vehicle attributes.","[Greene, David] Univ Tennessee, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Hossain, Anushah] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Hofmann, Julia; Beach, Robert] RTI Int, 3040 Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Helfand, Gloria] US EPA, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Research Triangle Institute; United States Environmental Protection Agency,"Greene, D (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, 1640 Cumberland Ave, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",dgreen32@utk.edu; anushah.h@berkeley.edu; jhofinann@rti.org; helfand.gloria@epa.gov; rbeach@rti.org,"Greene, David/AAB-1183-2021","Beach, Robert/0000-0001-8549-8546; Greene, David/0000-0002-7667-5376","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EP-C-11-045, EP-C-16-021]",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency),This research was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under contracts EP-C-11-045 and EP-C-16-021.

The electric driving share, i.e. the share of kilometres driven electrically, is specific to PHEV and a key factor for its fuel economy. Altogether, a detailed understanding of all factors influencing PHEV fuel economy is missing, especially with regard to driving distances. We analyse the influence of driving behaviour on fuel economy and more precisely the influences on the electric driving share based on mobility data. We applied a regression with mobility data of 780 vehicles to identify the main factors explaining this variation. Our results indicate that real-world fuel economy of PHEV differs widely among users. The resulting factors that explain up to 80% of the fuel economy are the all-electric range, the annual mileage, the regularity of daily driving, and the likelihood of long-distance trips. In our empirical analysis, the average electric driving share of N = 1,831 Chevrolet Volt in real world driving is 78%. When the electricity for charging comes from renewable energy sources the resulting real-world well-to-wheel CO2 emissions of these PHEV are 37 gCO(2)/km. However, even with the current US electricity mix, the annual CO2 savings of all registered Chevrolet Volts in the U.S. amount to about 57 kt CO2 in comparison to conventional cars. Furthermore, a full charge per day is necessary for high fuel economy and any necessary recharging during the day increases the share of electric driving and lowers the consumption of conventional fuel. Current test-cycle fuel economy ratings neglect these factors. Although fuel economy ratings are good estimates for average usage patterns, they fail to account for the high variation in individual driving behaviour. This should be taken into account by future test-cycles and policies should incentivise high electric driving shares.","[Ploetz, Patrick; Funke, Simon Arpad] Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Jochem, Patrick] KIT, IIP, Chair Energy Econ, Hertzstr 16,Bldg 06-33, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Plötz, P (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res ISI, Breslauer Str 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany.",patrick.ploetz@isi.fraunhofer.de,"Jochem, Patrick/Q-8828-2019","Jochem, Patrick/0000-0002-7486-4958","Fraunhofer Society; federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; national High Performance Center by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft; Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labour and Housing in Baden-Wurttemberg","Fraunhofer Society; federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; national High Performance Center by the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft; Ministry of Economic Affairs, Labour and Housing in Baden-Wurttemberg","The authors would like to thank Frank Konnig for writing the initial python wrapper.

The novelty of the paper resides in the use of a VAR-IRF that encompasses previous hysteresis studies, using long-term unemployment, productivity, capital stock and real long-term interest rates, and in the use of specific Labour Market Institutions shocks, such as benefits, taxation or unions' power. This allows us to disentangle what specific demand and supply-variables affect unemployment in the long-run, i.e. the NAIRU. Our findings suggest that there is hysteresis in both countries, and that it happens through several channels. Further, we find that the influence of Labour Market Institutions on unemployment depend on their impact on the real wages-productivity gap. These results have implications for structural and macroeconomic policies that we also discuss. Finally, we investigate the impact of different supply and demand-shock on long-term unemployment and discuss the relevant policy implications.","[Rodriguez-Gil, Antonio] Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Rodriguez-Gil, A (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Univ Business Sch, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",a.rodriguezgil@leeds.ac.uk,"Gil, Antonio rodriguez/C-1392-2013","Rodriguez Gil, Antonio/0000-0002-3414-4438",,,,,63,3,3,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We aim to assess the empirical performance of success functions for draws and analyze the differences between European soccer leagues in terms of home bias, return on talent (ROT), and talent inequality. We use a data set with 10,569 matches acquired manually from containing club-based average market values of the lineup of teams for each match played through 12 seasons from 7 major European soccer leagues. The results are obtained estimating the parameters of the success functions with a general maximum-likelihood method, and the hypotheses suggested by success functions are controlled with a probit regression. Two of the success functions outperform one conclusively. The difference in the performance between these two groups results from the contrast in the main determinant of the success function in allocating the probability of a draw. The high-performing success functions take difference in aggregate talent levels as the main determinant in drawing, while the other takes the aggregate talent as the main determinant. The results also show that there are major differences across leagues in terms of ROT, home bias, and talent inequality, despite the similarities in economic environment and the homogeneity in the rules of the game imposed across leagues. Our analysis sheds light on the contributions and implications of microeconomic theory to model sports and presents the differing characteristics of the European soccer leagues that impact match results significantly.","[Yildizparlak, Anil] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Durham University,"Yildizparlak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",anil.yildizparlak@durham.ac.uk,,"Yildizparlak, Anil/0000-0002-7115-6075",,,,,41,9,9,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

This paper analyzes these two standards under imperfect competitive. We limit our attention to (1) short-run analyses and (2) a situation in which all states are subject to the same type of standard. We show that while the cross-subsidy inherent in the performance-based standard might effectively reduce power prices, it could also inflate energy consumption. A dominant firm with a relatively clean endowment under the performance-based standard would be able to manipulate the electricity market as well as to elevate permit prices, which might worsen market outcomes compared to its mass-based counterpart. On the other hand, the cross-subsidy could be the dominant force leading to a higher social welfare if the leader has a relatively dirty endowment.","[Chen, Yihsu] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Tanaka, Makoto] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, London, England; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] Stockholm Univ, Dept Comp & Syst Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Siddiqui, Afzal S.] HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; University of London; University College London; Stockholm University; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Chen, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Baskin Sch Engn, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",yihsuchen@ucsc.edu; mtanaka@grips.ac.jp; afzal.siddiqui@ucl.ac.uk,"Tanaka, Makoto/M-9489-2014","Tanaka, Makoto/0000-0002-8606-865X; Chen, Yihsu/0000-0002-9990-8232",University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program; United States NSF (CyberSEES) [1561144]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [26380291]; JSPS KAKENHI [15H02975]; HEC Montreal; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H02975] Funding Source: KAKEN,"University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program; United States NSF (CyberSEES); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); HEC Montreal; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Chen was supported by the University of California Santa Cruz New Faculty Research Grant (NFRG) program and the United States NSF (CyberSEES #1561144).

The objective of this study is to determine whether or not, and to what extent, limited attention is prevalent in residential energy markets. We use data on more than 10,000 randomly selected customers of a California-based utility company and examine consumption responses as measured by changes in kilowatt-hours after a bill has crossed a salient threshold. The results of a sharp regression discontinuity design indicate that consumers use significantly less electricity in a month following the receipt of a bill that crossed a given threshold, such as $50 for lower-income households, who then show a 2-4% reduction in the consumption. We find that even at the threshold, the degree of inattention is roughly 0.75, consumers still tend to ignore the actual (i.e., full) cost of energy use. As previous studies have found inattention to be related to income, we focus primarily on lower-income households. However, there is some evidence that higher-income households have a similar response at higher thresholds. Considering the urgent need to reduce greenhouse emissions and increase energy savings, our results may contribute to the design of more effective billing and feedback mechanisms for energy-end-users.","[Keefer, Quinn] Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Econ, 333 S Twin Oaks Valley Rd, San Marcos, CA 92096 USA; [Rustamov, Galib] Claremont Grad Univ, Div Polit & Econ, 160 E 10th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",California State University System; California State University San Marcos; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School,"Rustamov, G (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Div Polit & Econ, 160 E 10th St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",galib.rustamov@cgu.edu,,,,,,,75,5,5,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Within the larger context of post-war reconstruction, it argues that the failure of the public housing program provided the stimulus for the spread of owner-occupation. The failure is explained as the outcome of economic constraints and the shrinking political capacity of post-war reconstruction.","[Macintyre, Stuart] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Macintyre, S (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",s.macintyre@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,52,4,4,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-8992,1467-8446,,AUST ECON HIST REV,Aust.

I found that cities connected to the HSR network experienced a significant growth in the employment of the retail/wholesale and hotel/food industries, while no measurable effects were found in other sectors. In order to explore whether the HSR effects are a growth or reorganization, this paper compared the effects of the HSR on the connected cities to those on adjacent cities, and found that the HSR promoted growth in the cities it directly passed through by drawing activities away from their neighbors. The further market potential approach suggests that the more people connected to the city within one to four commuting hours through the High-Speed Railway network, the higher the employment growth will be in the related sectors.","[Dong, Xiaofang] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University,"Dong, XF (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, D232 Econ Bldg, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",xfdong@xmu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303201],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author thanks to the two referees for their valuable comments.

It surveys literature on social skills, workplaces, social remittances and relational learning. It devotes attention to destination workplaces as spaces where people who left their comfort zones experience disjuncture between origin and destination. This can bring insights, noticing differences and making comparisons. On return to their workplaces in their origin countries, migrants are able to reflect upon and eventually remit these experiences, packaged as social remittances. Three categories of social skill were distilled from biographical interviews with returnees to Poland: (1) the capability for cross-cultural communication; (2) the capability for dealing with emotional labour; (3) the capability for taking initiative and acting independently. The study analysed situations of disjuncture as a result of migration which led to learning, non-learning and alienation. By bringing migration to the forefront, we consider social skills as social remittances.","[Grabowska, Izabela] SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Warsaw, Poland; [Grabowska, Izabela] Ctr Migrat Res, Warsaw, Poland",SWPS University of Social Sciences & Humanities; University of Warsaw,"Grabowska, I (通讯作者)，SWPS Univ Social Sci & Humanities, Warsaw, Poland.",izabela.grabowska@swps.edu.pl,"Grabowska, Izabela/AHA-5224-2022; Grabowska, Izabela/AAD-6532-2019","Grabowska, Izabela/0000-0001-7957-4901",,,,,49,19,20,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Major differences exist across countries in how successful these efforts are, and the United States is often used as the key example of a country with a strong resistance to shifting away from private car use. Even within the United States however, there is strong heterogeneity across regions and across different types of travellers. This paper seeks to add empirical evidence to understand the drivers of mode choice for intercity travel, using stated choice data from two major US intercity corridors: the Northeast Corridor (NEC) and the Cascade Corridor. We develop a hybrid choice model that allows for deterministic and random variations across travellers in their preferences, some of which can be linked to underlying attitudinal constructs. Our results highlight extensive heterogeneity and provide interesting insights into the drivers of behaviour, and the relationship between attitudes and actual choices. As an example, we see that for some groups, notably West Coast respondents, a stronger anti-car attitude is counter-acted by a reduced utility for non-car modes when making choices, possibly due quality of public transport provision. Similarly, for other groups, such as older and female travellers, a reduced concern for privacy, which would benefit public transport, is counter-acted by a stronger pro-car attitude. These findings highlight the complex way in which attitudes can influence choices and provide insights for targeted policy interventions. Through scenario testing, we also show how future modal split might change depending on how these patterns of heterogeneity evolve over time, noting that the way this might happen is of course unknown at present.","[Hess, Stephane; Spitz, Greg; Bradley, Mark] RSG, 55 Railrd Row, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA; [Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Hess, Stephane] Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Coogan, Matt] New England Transportat Inst, Ten Clay Rd, White River Jct, VT 05001 USA",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Hess, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Choice Modelling Ctr, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",s.hess@leeds.ac.uk; gspitz@rsginc.com; mark.bradley@rsginc.com; cooganmatt@aol.com,"Hess, Stephane/AAX-2672-2020","Hess, Stephane/0000-0002-3650-2518",TRB's NCRRP program; European Research Council [615596-DECISIONS],TRB's NCRRP program; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),The original study on which this work is based was funded by TRB's NCRRP program.

We, therefore, estimate a simultaneous equations system on matched sale-rental pairs, as a housing unit cannot be owner-occupied and renter-occupied at the same time. We confirm that a higher turnover rate is associated with a lower rental yield. We also identify a form of dichotomy in empirical determinants of rental yields and turnover rates at the estate level: the demographic structure and past returns affect an estate's turnover rate, while popularity, human capital, mortgage burdens, and long-run rent growth determine its rental yield. The robustness of our results is established through a series of tests.

The Baba-Engle-KraftKroner (BEKK) version of the multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedastic (MGARCH) method was used to evaluate the conditional correlations and the time variation of the volatilities of the prices of the selected products on a monthly basis. The analysis period covers the timeframe between January 2003 and August 2017. The findings of the BEKK MGARCH model provide evidence that there is a one-way, strong and permanent volatility spillover from the corn and barley market to the wheat market. In addition, the findings of the conditional correlation analysis show that the wheat and feed market interdependence has increased to this extent for the first time since the global crisis. The results reveal that monitoring the livestock and feed policies in order to eliminate the problems in the wheat market would be beneficial.

I show that the equity payout adjustment costs are crucial for the transmission mechanism of financial shocks. The model is estimated using the Bayesian methods and simulated using the observed exogenous shocks for two periods, 1954:III-1983:IV and 1984:I-2015:I. Overall, it is found that financial shocks can account for the observed dynamics of employment and output, especially the sharp decreases during the Great Recession 2007-2008. Additionally, the financial shock is the third and second biggest contributor to output and employment variations, respectively, in the earlier period, but it turns out to be the main source of employment and output fluctuations in the later period. I find that firms are faced higher equity payout adjustment costs in the period 1984:I-2015:I, which accounts for greater variations in the equity payouts in the period.","[Khieu, Hoang] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Gutenberg Sch Management & Econ, Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Khieu, H (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Gutenberg Sch Management & Econ, Mainz, Germany.",hkhieu@uni-mainz.de,,"Khieu, Hoang/0000-0002-5136-5945",,,,,22,3,3,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Such possibilities are founded upon an increasingly fine-grained electronic connectivity of people, places and objects allied to powerful data gathering and processing capabilities. Urban mobility of the future could be transformed, with developments such as: new forms of propulsion; new forms of vehicle control; changing business models of ownership and use; mobile technologies that equip and empower individuals; and opportunities to undertake activities without the need to travel. 'Smart' is the order of the day. Smart urban mobility conjures up a sense of new opportunity; of progress. However, what is really meant by smart? This paper examines this question, revealing a lack of consensus in terms of smart cities and a paucity of literature seeking to make sense of smart urban mobility. The paper considers how smart relates to sustainable, raising concerns about potentially dichotomous constituencies of commentators and discourses. Critical commentary associated with smart includes caution that large corporations are exerting significant influence in the era of smart in pursuit of goals that may not strongly align with those of urban planners concerned with social and environmental sustainability as well as economic prosperity. The paper puts forward and explores the following definition of smart urban mobility: connectivity in towns and cities that is affordable, effective, attractive and sustainable. This is intended to help draw the paradigms of smart and sustainable closer together towards a common framework for urban mobility development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the main challenges for academic research are aspects related to its measurement and decomposition. This article proposes a novel way to decompose seasonality by multiplicative factors. Specifically, as an illustrative example, we decompose the seasonal concentration of tourism revenues into three components: revenue per tourist per day, average length of stay and tourist numbers. In addition, the methodology has been applied to Spain as a whole, where the results obtained indicate the predominant and increasing weight of tourist numbers in the recently heightened seasonality.

We relax the assumption that unobserved time effects have homogeneous impacts on states; therefore, states with right-to-carry laws may follow different time trends which might be stronger or weaker than those of other states including states with no right-to-carry laws. The heterogeneous time trends are modeled by a factor structure where time factors represent time-varying unobservables, and factor loadings account for their heterogeneous impacts across states. No assumption is imposed on the shape of the time trend. Crime statistics exhibit spatial dependence, and a state's adoption of right-to-carry law may have external effects on its neighboring states. Using a dynamic spatial panel model with interactive effects, we find positive spatial spillovers in crime rates. Depending on a crime category, an average reduction in crime rates in neighboring states can decrease crime rates by 0.069-0.287%, with property crimes exhibiting higher degrees of spatial dependence than violent crimes. We find that although the passage of right-to-carry laws has no significant effects on the overall violent or property crime rates, they lead to short-term increases in robbery and medium-term decreases in murder rates. The results are robust to the number of factors, a different sample ending point, and some alternative spatial weights matrices and model specifications.","[Shi, Wei] Jinan Univ, Inst Econ & Social Res, Guangzhou 510632, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Lung-fei] Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Jinan University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Lee, LF (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Econ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",shiweiemail@gmail.com; lee.1777@osu.edu,"Shi, Wei/JPY-0293-2023",,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [17JNQN009],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This project was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Project No. 17JNQN009).

The EU has committed to include gender perspectives by implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda (WPS) within its foreign security practices. While researchers and practitioners recognise the importance of integrating gender issues into SSR operational effectiveness, there is limited knowledge about how this functions within the EU's security architecture. This article uses Feminist Institutionalism (FI) to understand the process of gender mainstreaming within the EU's support to SSR programmes. It does this by using two crucial theory-testing cases of SSR programmes - Ukraine and Afghanistan. It finds that the EU's ability to promote gender inclusive approaches to SSR is limited by the structure of the EU's own assumptions and capabilities, and institutional constraints in third countries.

Using variation in the hours of the DC curfew, we find that this policy increases gunfire incidents by 150% during marginal hours.

Second, the degree of monocentricity-polycentricity also affects segregation: while a higher concentration of jobs in and around the CBD decreases segregation in monocentric cities, a higher employment concentration in and around subcenters located far from the CBD decreases segregation in polycentric cities. Third, results are heterogeneous according to city size: local density does not increase segregation in small (monocentric) cities, it increases segregation in medium size cities, and it decreases segregation in large (polycentric) cities.

However, when these judgments are logically connected to further beliefs, the notion of closeness should also take into account to what extent the individuals would have to revise their entire belief set to reach an agreement. In this work, we present a model for generation of agreement with respect to a given agenda which allows individual epistemic entrenchment to influence the value of the consensus. While the postulates for the transformation function and their construction resemble those of AGM belief revision, the notion of an agenda is adapted from the theory of judgment aggregation. This allows our model to connect both frameworks.","[Heidemann, Marcel] Univ Bayreuth, Dept Philosophy, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany",University of Bayreuth,"Heidemann, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Dept Philosophy, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany.",marcel.heidemann@uni-bayreuth.de,,"Heidemann, Marcel/0000-0002-7452-4611",DFG-GARC research project SEGA [RO 4548/6-1],DFG-GARC research project SEGA,I would like to thank Franz Dietrich and two anonymous referees very much for their detailed and constructive comments on an earlier version of this paper.

While this concept is often presented as a set of factors, which together shape the EU's capacity to act internationally, the literature displays a surprisingly deficient understanding of how these factors interact in the emergence of actorness. To address this gap, this article theorizes about actorness from an interactionist role theory perspective, which draws on the works of social psychologist George Herbert Mead. In building on this perspective, the article conceptualizes actorness as an entity's capacity to (re)-imagine and realize roles for its self' in (specific contexts of) international affairs. This capacity, the approach suggests, emerges in the interplay of (social and material) resources, creative action and (domestic and external) role expectations.","[Klose, Stephan] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Klose, S (通讯作者)，Free Univ Brussels, Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, Pl Laan 2,Off Pl Laan 5-1st Floor, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",stephan.klose@vub.be,"Klose, Stephan/J-5148-2019","Klose, Stephan/0000-0003-3073-3937",,,,,59,14,15,1,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

To this end, we explore the role of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the recent surge in the internationalisation of patents that originates from the newly emerging economies. The aim is to capture the outreach of the Northern intellectual property culture to the South and the South-North globalisation of the resulting intellectual property that emerges in the South. Global bilateral patent data are used to investigate the location specificity of IPR enforcement for the emergence of this phenomenon. We find that the harmonisation of IPR protection encourages foreign-patenting activities of Southern innovators. Our findings suggest that a global convergence of IPR protection can stimulate the production and the internationalisation of intellectual property in the South. As the North and the South grow closer in terms of levels of development, a harmonised institutional structure becomes more adequate as they increasingly share similar markets.","[Naghavi, Alireza; Prarolo, Giovanni] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Naghavi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy.",,,"prarolo, giovanni/0000-0003-3151-3733",,,,,46,2,2,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2018,41.0,7,,,SI,,1847,1866,,10.1111/twec.12648,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GO3GZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439879000007,0

This paper studies the transfer feasibility for elderly passengers passing through specific barriers at high-speed train stations. Questionnaires were distributed at Beijing High-Speed Train Station, with 716 valid samples involved. This paper divides the transfer procedure into seven phases, and proposes various points of interest at each phase with different barriers. These points of barriers are categorized into three major different types: Serious AND Common, Serious BUT NOT Common, and Common BUT NOT Serious. The quantitative relationships between each point of barriers and old travelers' information have been explored using decision tree and binary logistics regression. As a conclusion, we suggest some recommendations for improving the transfer environment, longdistance mobility, as well as wellbeing of the older adults at high-speed train stations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the transfer feasibility at high speed train stations for seniors both qualitatively and quantitatively, especially dealing with the complicated transfer procedure.Y","[Zhao, Wei; Xu, Liangjie] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Transportat, Wuhan 430063, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wei] Inner Mongolia Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ, Baotou 014010, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wei; Qin, Lingqiao; BinRan] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Dong, Zhijie Sasha] Texas State Univ, Ingram Sch Engn, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Qi, Bozhao] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Comp Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Wuhan University of Technology; Inner Mongolia University of Science & Technology; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Dong, ZJS (通讯作者)，Texas State Univ, Ingram Sch Engn, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.",sasha.dong@txstate.edu,"Qi, Bozhao/L-4037-2019; Qin, Lingqiao/B-7351-2018","Qin, Lingqiao/0000-0003-2861-4090",Social Science and Humanity on Young Fund of the ministry of Education of China [16YJCZH157],Social Science and Humanity on Young Fund of the ministry of Education of China,The authors are thankful to the Social Science and Humanity on Young Fund of the ministry of Education of China (16YJCZH157) for financially supporting this research.

If both players approve the other's choice, the outcome is the result of the chosen strategies in the prisoner's dilemma; however, if either rejects the other's choice, the outcome is the same as if they had mutually defected from the prisoner's dilemma. In theory, such an approval mechanism implements cooperation in backward elimination of weakly dominated strategies, although this is not the case in the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. By contrast, the compensation mechanism proposed by Varian (Am Econ Rev 84(5):1278-1293, 1994) implements cooperation in the latter but not in the former. This result motivates the present experimental study of the two mechanisms. The approval mechanism sessions yield a cooperation rate of 90% in the first period and 93.2% across periods, while the compensation mechanism sessions yield a cooperation rate of 63.3% in the first period and 75.2% across periods. In addition, the backward elimination of weakly dominated strategies better predicts subjects' behavior than does the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium in both mechanism sessions.","[Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Kochi Univ Technol, Res Ctr Future Design, 2-2 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan; [Saijo, Tatsuyoshi] Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, 457-4 Motoyama, Kyoto 6038047, Japan; [Masuda, Takehito] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, Mihogaoka 6-1, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan",Kochi University Technology; Research Institute for Humanity & Nature (RIHN); Osaka University,"Saijo, T (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Res Ctr Future Design, 2-2 Eikokuji, Kochi 7808515, Japan.;Saijo, T (通讯作者)，Res Inst Humanity & Nat, Kita Ku, 457-4 Motoyama, Kyoto 6038047, Japan.",tatsuyoshisaijo@gmail.com,"Masuda, Takehito/S-2746-2019; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/D-1788-2012","Masuda, Takehito/0000-0001-9639-2480; Saijo, Tatsuyoshi/0000-0001-7216-5611","Suntory Foundation; Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24243028, 16K13354]; Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN Project) [14200122]; Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K13354, 17K13701] Funding Source: KAKEN","Suntory Foundation(Suntory Foundation for Life Sciences); Joint Usage/Research Center at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Research Institute for Humanity and Nature (RIHN Project); Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank the associate editor and two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions.

Specifically, the sectors PDEH and SPM play the main role in pushing carbon dioxide emission, while the sectors OTHERS and MFT have important effect on pulling carbon dioxide emission. Second, the sectors with high supply carbon dioxide emission are inconsistent with those having high demand carbon dioxide emission.

For this purpose, we use six waves of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) dataset and construct a health deficit index. Results from log-linear regressions suggest that, on average, elderly European men and women developed about 20 percent more health deficits when they experienced a hunger episode in their childhood. The effect becomes larger when the hunger episode is experienced earlier in childhood. In non-linear regressions (akin to the Gompertz-Makeham law), we obtain greater effects suggesting that health deficits in old age are up to 40 percent higher for children suffering from hunger. The difference of health deficits between hungry and non-hungry individuals increases absolutely and relatively with age. This implies that individuals who suffered from hunger as children age faster. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The CEE region shows highly concentrated banking markets and less-developed financial markets; thus, the level of bank concentration and the resulting credit supply are crucial for firm creation and survival. Despite this, there is little evidence on these countries in the literature. Our empirical results suggest an inverted-U relationship: industry growth is fostered by bank concentration, but there is a turning point from which higher concentration begins producing the opposite effect. Moreover, the positive impact has a greater intensity during the crisis period compared to the pre-crisis period. Between sectors' analysis shows that high-tech sectors are less reactive to changes in the concentration level.","[Bergantino, Angela S.; Capozza, Claudia] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Capozza, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.",angelastefania.bergantino@uniba.it; claudia.capozza@uniba.it,,"BERGANTINO, Angela Stefania/0000-0001-9490-9917",,,,,40,2,2,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our heritage amenities include conservation areas, listed historic buildings, and designated heritage which includes churches, palaces, historic buildings and lithic structures. We construct gridded spatial fixed effects which mitigate biases from the modifiable areal unit problem, and further employ a geographic regression discontinuity ensuring the robustness of results. The analysis is complemented with spatial interactions and mixed geographically weighted regressions (MGWR) to explore spatial heterogeneity of impacts. Conservation areas yield 4.1% premiums with spillover benefits of 3.3%, while proximity to designated heritage has a positive price elasticity of 0.0075. This impact is equivalent to an additional designated heritage within 100 m. Ten additional listed buildings within 500 m on the other hand yield 0.5% premiums. We find spatial variation in heritage amenity impacts with MGWR and spatial interactions highlighting common patterns whereby positive price impacts are strongest for the closest properties, and the biggest for landmark amenities. We compare these two manners to evaluate spatial non-stationarity of impacts and highlight the benefits of high-level GIS techniques which are commonly lacking in hedonic studies with urban spatial data.","[Franco, Sofia F.; Macdonald, Jacob L.] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Franco, SF (通讯作者)，Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",sfranco@novasbe.pt; jacob.macdonald@novasbe.pt,"Macdonald, Jacob L./GNW-5507-2022; Li, Wang/M-1612-2019; Azambuja, Bruno/HKW-8663-2023","Macdonald, Jacob L./0000-0002-3940-4876;",[UID/ECO/00436/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/00436/2013] Funding Source: FCT,; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This article is part of the Strategic Project: UID/ECO/00436/2013.,,46,28,29,3,46,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Using these data, this article aims at evaluating if such monetary value has a significant role in stimulating visits to cultural sites for the years 1996-2010. We also control for other factors potentially affecting the number of visits to cultural sites, such as alternative tourist attractors and the regional performance in the tourism sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to investigate the effect of CH monetary value on cultural participation.","[Guccio, Calogero; Lisi, Domenico; Mignosa, Anna; Rizzo, Ilde] Univ Catania, Catania, Italy",University of Catania,"Lisi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Econ & Business, Corso Italia 55, I-95129 Catania, Italy.",domenico.lisi@unict.it,"Guccio, Calogero/M-4127-2015","Guccio, Calogero/0000-0002-1053-4968",,,,,54,14,15,1,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This paper develops an example in which MLU induces an ambiguity averse maxmin expected utility (MEU) decision-maker to (1) prefer a bet on an ambiguous over a risky urn and (2) be more willing to bet on the ambiguous urn compared to an (ambiguity neutral) subjective expected utility (SEU) decision-maker. This is challenging, since prior to observing (symmetric) draws from the urns, the MEU decision-maker (in line with the usual notion of ambiguity aversion) actually preferred the risky over the ambiguous bet and was less willing to bet on the ambiguous urn than the SEU decision-maker. The identified switch in betting preferences is not due to a violation of dynamic consistency or consequentialism. Rather, it results from MLU's selection of extreme priors, causing a violation of the stability of set inclusion over the course of the updating process.","[Heyen, Daniel] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Heyen, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst, London, England.",D.Heyen@lse.ac.uk,,"Heyen, Daniel/0000-0001-9606-1817","German Research Foundation [GO 1604/2, HE 7551/1-1]",German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I thank the editors and two anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions.

This means that individuals may prefer stochastically dominated lotteries. In this sense, hope, understood as a small probability of a better outcome, can be a curse. While KAszegi and Rabin focus on a linear specification of the utility function, we show that this effect occurs more broadly. Using fairly plausible assumptions and parameter values, we specify the conditions under which it occurs, as well as the type of lotteries in which this should be expected. We then show that while a simple subjective transformation of probability into weights of the reference point may in some cases mitigate the issue, in others, it can intensify it or even generate new ones. Finally, we extend the model by adding the individual's current reference point (status quo) to the stochastic reference point. We show that this modification can reconcile KAszegi and Rabin's model with the apparent empirical infrequency of stochastically dominated choices while maintaining its main qualitative results.","[Le Lec, Fabrice] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, CNRS, Umr 8174, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France; [Mace, Serge] Edhec Business Sch, 24 Rue Gustave Delory, F-59057 Lille, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School,"Macé, S (通讯作者)，Edhec Business Sch, 24 Rue Gustave Delory, F-59057 Lille, France.",fabrice.le-lec@univ-paris1.fr; serge.mace@edhec.edu,,"Le Lec, Fabrice/0000-0002-1869-5520",,,,,37,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,MAY,2018,84.0,3,,,SI,,429,451,,10.1007/s11238-017-9621-0,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,GD5PH,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000430558400007,0

We start with a basic and generally accepted model of the liberalized wholesale electricity market in which firms have insufficient incentives to invest and we illustrate how the entry of renewable generation tends to aggravate that problem. We show that the incentives to invest in firm capacity (e.g. conventional thermal plants) may be restored by means of a capacity auction mechanism. That mechanism is vulnerable and, hence, may prove ineffective unless governments can credibly commit not to sponsor the entry of new capacity outside the auction mechanism. We explain that such commitment may be particularly difficult in the current political context where energy policy is conditioned by environmental and industrial-policy goals. We finally propose a way to enhance the credibility of capacity auctions by committing to optimally retire idle (conventional) power plants in response to entry outside the auction.","[Llobet, Gerard] CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Padilla, Jorge] Compass Lexecon, Washington, DC USA",,"Llobet, G (通讯作者)，CEMFI, Casado Alisal 5, Madrid 28014, Spain.",llobet@cemfi.es,"Padilla, Jorge/JFS-3911-2023; Llobet, Gerard/L-5996-2014","Llobet, Gerard/0000-0002-6421-5890",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitivity [ECO2014-57768]; Gas Natural,Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitivity(Spanish Government); Gas Natural,Earlier versions of this paper benefited greatly from discussions with Luis Agosti and Albert Riera.

We combine a spatial econometric approach with stochastic frontier analysis to control for unobserved environmental conditions when measuring efficiency of electricity distribution utilities. Our empirical strategy relies on the geographic location of firms as a source of information that has previously not been explored in the literature. The underlying idea is to utilise data from neighbouring firms that can be spatially correlated as proxies for unobserved cost drivers. We illustrate this approach using a dataset of Norwegian distribution utilities for the 2004-2011 period. We show that the lack of information on weather and geographic conditions can be compensated with data from surrounding firms. The methodology can be used in efficiency analysis and regulation of other utilities sectors where unobservable cost drivers are important, e.g. gas, water, agriculture, fishing.","[Orea, Luis] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Oviedo, Spain; [Alvarez, Inmaculada C.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Madrid, Spain; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Durham, England",University of Oviedo; Autonomous University of Madrid; Durham University,"Orea, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Oviedo, Spain.",lorea@uniovi.es,"Alvarez, Inmaculada C/K-5808-2014; Orea, Luis/K-5298-2014",,Government of the Principality of Asturias; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),Government of the Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),This research was partially funded by the Government of the Principality of Asturias and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

Our estimation results suggest the existence of a sizable crowd support's effect on the home advantage generated through the encouragement of players' performance.

India's performance, along different margins, is compared and contrasted with that of China. The results show that while China outperforms India at both the margins, the gap is particularly wide at the intensive margin. Decomposition of intensive margin along quantity and price margins shows that Chinese products are generally sold cheaper than Indian products. Higher price margin, however, has not translated into high intensive margin for India due to its abysmally low quantity margin. We examine different explanations for China's superior performance relative to India, along different margins, using a gravity model. Our results suggest that China's exchange rate policy was not the prime reason for its export success. Neither do we find that FDI inflows were significant in explaining the export performance gap between them. The results show that China's export relationship bias towards high-income partner countries holds the key in understanding its superior performance. This bias is a natural consequence of China's high degree of specialization in labor-intensive activities. India, by contrast, due to an idiosyncratic pattern of specialisation, has failed to exploit its export potential in high income countries.","[Veeramani, Choorikkad; Aerath, Lakshmi] Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Gupta, Prachi] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan",,"Veeramani, C (通讯作者)，Indira Gandhi Inst Dev Res, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.",,"Aerath, Lakshmi/AAJ-1748-2020","Aerath, Lakshmi/0000-0002-5839-8723",,,,,37,6,7,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2018,41.0,5,,,,,1196,1222,,10.1111/twec.12592,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GF5VX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000432037100003,0

Based on maritime economic theory we propose that a vessel's capacity utilization - defined as the ratio of cargo size divided by DWT - should be positively correlated with freight rates, as poor market conditions will force vessels to compete for lower-than-optimal stem sizes. Furthermore, we propose that capacity utilization is dependent on the distance sailed, the fuel price and the value of the cargo. Using a unique data set sourced from port agent lineup reports and covering nearly 10,000 individual shipments of iron ore from Brazil between 2009 and 2014 we estimate a multiple regression model consisting of macroeconomic, route-specific and vessel-specific determinants. Our empirical results suggest that vessel-specific determinants (DWI) dominate the impact of general market conditions, with smaller vessels typically having lower capacity utilization. The impact of freight market conditions conforms to our a priori expectations. Our findings and modeling approach contributes to maritime environmental policymaking by enabling more accurate bottom-up estimation of emissions. The research is also crucial for improved modeling of real vessel earnings and tonne-mile demand based on observations of global ship movements from AIS data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This work has resulted in an expanded data pool potentially usable for evaluating the social and economic implications of wastewater investments, particularly those incorporating reuse projects. We present the results of a systematic and comprehensive review of available empirical studies that assessed individual willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates of recycled wastewater. Using a meta-analysis method (MA), we investigated the results of 84 WTP estimates from 22 international studies covering 12 countries. From our general meta-regression model, we estimated the mean WTP for recycled wastewater at US$ 52.62 per-household/per-year. We find that WTP can vary in a systematic and predictable way with respect to key factors that determine an individual's WTP for recycled water, such as socioeconomic and contextual characteristics as well as the individuals' attitudes and perceptions concerning recycled water. We demonstrate that such categories of variables are important for the potential use of MA for value transfer. This finding can be useful to inform and guide research and development on future empirical valuation studies, and to facilitate the use of value-transfer methods through the MA model.","[Bouzit, Madjid] French Geol Survey, BRGM, 1039 Rue Pinville, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Das, Sukanya] TERI Univ, Dept Policy Studies, Delhi 110070, India; [Cary, Lise] French Geol Survey, BRGM, 3 Ave C Guillemin,BP 6009, F-45060 Orleans, France",Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM); TERI University; Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM),"Bouzit, M (通讯作者)，French Geol Survey, BRGM, 1039 Rue Pinville, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",m.bouzit@brgm.fr,"Das, Sukanya/AAC-5603-2020; Cary, Lise/AAR-4263-2020","Das, Sukanya/0000-0003-4524-4247; Cary, Lise/0000-0002-7131-2285",European Commission [308672]; Indian Department of Science and Technology; BRGM,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Indian Department of Science and Technology(Department of Science & Technology (India)); BRGM(Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres (BRGM)),"This work is part of the EU-India collaborative SARASWATI Supporting consolidation, replication and up-scaling of sustainable wastewater treatment and reuse technologies for India project in the ENV.2012.6.6-1 theme.

Does it also induce skill upgrading by the industry's existing workforce? To answer these questions, we follow individual workers across skills/occupations, firms and industries using a longitudinal matched employer-employee data set covering virtually all workers and firms in Portugal over the 1986-2000 period. To identify the effects of international competition, we use two exogenous measures at the industry level. First, a quasi-natural experiment based on the strong appreciation of the Portuguese currency in 1989-92 period and pre-existing differences in trade exposure across industries in a differences-in-differences estimation. Second, source-weighted real exchange rates defined at the industry level. Based on both empirical strategies, and on two different skill definitions, we show that international competition increases returns to skill and induces skill/occupation upgrading within an industry.","[Falvey, Rod] Bond Univ, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Greenaway, David] Univ Nottingham Ningbo China, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Silva, Joana] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Bond University; University of Nottingham Ningbo China; The World Bank,"Falvey, R (通讯作者)，Bond Univ, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia.",,"Falvey, Rodney/F-6944-2013; Greenaway, David/ABE-1059-2021; Silva, Joana/T-4702-2018","Silva, Joana/0000-0002-8847-7502",Leverhulme Trust [F/00/114/AM]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/13162/2003]; Economic and Social Research Council [PTA-026-27-1258]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/13162/2003] Funding Source: FCT,Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We are grateful to participants at the Festschrift Conference in Honor of Professor Chris Milner, the Midwest International Economics Meetings, IZA/World Bank Conference, Canadian Economic Association Annual Meetings, COST Workshop on Firms and Wages: New Research Using Linked Employer-Employee Data, and seminars at the World Bank.

We empirically test this hypothesis for rural Benin. Daily water collection times are reduced by 41 minutes but still take 2 hours after the installation of a public pump. Even though walking distances are reduced, women still spend a lot of time waiting at the water source, and not all women use the improved water source. Moreover, a reduction in time to fill one water container induces women to fill more containers per day. Time savings are rarely followed by an increase in the labor supply of women. The economic value of the annual time savings is 1%-2% of a rural households' income.","[Gross, Elena] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany; [Gunther, Isabel] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Schipper, Youdi] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Bayreuth; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Günther, I (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.",isabel.guenther@nadel.ethz.ch,,"Schipper, Youdi/0000-0002-4580-725X; Gross, Elena/0000-0002-6839-8516",German KfW Development Bank; Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands; Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development Germany (BMZ),German KfW Development Bank; Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands; Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development Germany (BMZ),"We thank the German KfW Development Bank, the Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, and the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development Germany (BMZ) for funding this research and for permission to make use of the data that were collected by us for a multidonor (IOB/BMZ/KfW) impact evaluation.

Using fixed-effects models in a longitudinal national sample, this study examines differences in job satisfaction between women and men promoted into lower and higher-level management, after controlling for key determinants of job satisfaction. Results indicate that promotions to management are accompanied by an increase in job satisfaction for men but not for women, and that the differing effect lasts beyond the promotion year. Moreover, following promotion, the job satisfaction of women promoted to higher-level management even starts declining. The type of promotion (internal or lateral) does not modify this effect. By clarifying the relationship between gender, promotion to managerial position and job satisfaction, the study contributes to the literature on the gender gap in managerial representation.","[Lup, Daniela] Middlesex Univ, Sociol, London, England",Middlesex University,"Lup, D (通讯作者)，Middlesex Univ, London NW4 4BT, England.",d.lup@mdx.ac.uk,"Lup, Daniela/IAP-6312-2023",,,,,,62,14,21,1,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

From Wallonia holding-up the EU-Canada trade deal, to Catalonia and Scotland seeking independence. However, beyond these attention-grabbing events, more fundamental transformations have taken place, away from the media spotlight and sometimes also under the (theoretical and empirical) radar of scholarly work. This article highlights that the more gripping events making the headlines are only the tip of the iceberg. They belie a rather peaceful and calm process of regionalization of our political systems. Functional, community, and identity logics have driven this process. It has significantly affected all dimensions of the policy-politics-polity triptych. We encourage scholars to break free from the shackles of methodological nationalism. Engaging in multi-level analysis is cognitively taxing. However, it is well worth the investment. The state is not independent from developments at the sub- and supra-state levels. Modelling interdependence is challenging, but it is empirically and theoretically rewarding.

We explore alternative approaches for constructing convex combinations of different types of dependence between observations. Pace and LeSage (2002) as well as Hazir et al. (2016) use convex combinations of different connectivity matrices to form a single weight matrix that can be used in conventional spatial regression estimation and inference. An example for the case of two weight matrices, W-1, W-2 reflecting different types of dependence between a cross-section of regions, firms, individuals etc., located in space would be: W-c = gamma(1) W-1+ (1 - gamma(1))W-2, 0 <= gamma(1) <= 1. The matrix W-c reflects a convex combination of the two weight matrices, with the scalar parameter gamma(1) indicating the relative importance assigned to each type of dependence. We explore issues that arise in producing estimates and inferences from these more general cross-sectional regression relationships in a Bayesian framework. We propose two procedures to estimate such models and assess their finite sample properties through Monte Carlo experiments. We illustrate our methodology in an application to CEO salaries for a sample of nursing homes located in Texas. Two types of weights are considered, one reflecting spatial proximity of nursing homes and the other peer group proximity, which arise from the salary benchmarking literature.","[Debarsy, Nicolas] Univ Lille, LEM UMR 9221, CNRS, Cite Sci,Bat SH2, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [LeSage, James] Texas State Univ San Marcos, Dept Finance & Econ, 601 Univ Dr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Texas State University System; Texas State University San Marcos,"Debarsy, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, LEM UMR 9221, CNRS, Cite Sci,Bat SH2, Villeneuve Dascq, France.",nicolas.debarsy@cnrs.fr; jlesage@spatial-econometrics.com,,"Debarsy, Nicolas/0000-0002-2262-0193",Region Centre Val de Loire (APR-IA) [2014 00094514],Region Centre Val de Loire (APR-IA),"Nicolas Debarsy acknowledges financial support of the Region Centre Val de Loire (APR-IA 2014 00094514).

The authors use recently published county-level data to study the determinants of intergenerational mobility, measured by income levels and teen birth rates. Following Solon's mobility model, the authors study the impacts of public investment in human capital, returns to human capital, and taxation. The results show that better school quality and higher returns to education increase adult incomes and reduce teen birth rates for children from low-income families. By comparing counties within or adjacent to metropolitan areas to other counties, the authors find that urban upward mobility is sensitive to parents' education, while nonurban upward mobility is sensitive to migration opportunities.","[Li, Minghao] Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, 568F Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Goetz, Stephan J.] Penn State Univ, Agr & Reg Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Weber, Bruce] Oregon State Univ, Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Iowa State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Oregon State University,"Li, MH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Ctr Agr & Rural Dev, 568F Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.;Li, MH (通讯作者)，Iowa State Univ, Dept Econ, 568F Heady Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.",minghao@iastate.edu,,"Goetz, Stephan/0000-0003-4529-552X",Pennsylvania State University; USDA-NIFA,Pennsylvania State University; USDA-NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded in part by Pennsylvania State University and various USDA-NIFA grants supporting the Northeast Regional Center for Rural Development.",,32,4,5,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

This unfading popularity is arguably driven by the ability of radial distance functions, unlike alternative directional distance functions, to allow for unit-free multiplicative changes in arguments as well as, by implicitly postulating the radial direction, to free researchers from the dilemma of having to explicitly choose the directional vector. In this paper, we offer a generalization of the standard radial distance function to polluting technologies that can accommodate undesirable by-products in a more economically meaningful way. Specifically, we propose modeling undesirable outputs via a hedonic output index, which is meant to ensure that pollutants are treated as outputs, as opposed to inputs or theoretically unregulated frontier shifters, while also recognizing their undesirable nature. By using a radial input distance function generalized to encompass an (unobservable) hedonic output index of desirable and undesirable outputs, we are able to meaningfully describe relationships between different products (including the complementarity of desirable and undesirable outputs) within producible output sets as well as to represent technically feasible polluting production possibilities given inputs. An empirical application of our methodology to the case of Dutch dairy farms in 2001-2009 demonstrates the complexity of interactions between outputs, thereby attesting to the value of more elaborate representations of production possibilities.","[Malikov, Emir] Auburn Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Sociol, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Bokusheva, Raushan] OECD, Trade & Agr Directorate, Paris, France; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Kumbhakar, SC (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Econ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",emalikov@auburn.edu; raushan.bokusheva@oecd.org; kkar@binghamton.edu,"Bokusheva, Raushan/ABB-1198-2020",,Swiss National Science Foundation [100014_128967],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The data used in the present paper come from the Dutch FADN system as collected by the Dutch Agricultural Economics Research Institute (LEI).

Definitions and categorizations of clusters vary, however, hindering the development of econometric models for cluster analysis. The authors propose empirical measures relevant to researchers and practitioners for cluster strength/specialization, cluster diversity/diversification, and identifying regional growth clusters. The latter measure uses location quotients, shift-share analysis, and other criteria to identify robust clusters that are important for thriving regions. These measures are calculated for local and traded clusters using employment data for 366 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. Additionally, the authors estimated the relationship of their cluster performance measures to four traditional measures of economic performance: growth in gross domestic product, productivity per employee, compensation per employee, and personal income. The authors find traded cluster strength is positively related to compensation per employee growth and positively related to productivity growth, the latter being consistent with expected Marshall-Arrow-Romer externalities. Traded growth clusters are positively related to gross domestic product growth.","[Slaper, Timothy F.; Harmon, Karter M.] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Rubin, Barry M.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Harmon, KM (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Indiana Business Res Ctr, 1315 East 10th St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",kartharm@indiana.edu,,,,,,,31,26,28,1,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

The strategically important nature of knowledge results firstly from the fact that it is harder to imitate and substitute when compared with material resources, and secondly from the fact that it is more flexible, i.e. more useful for the creation or improvement of various elements of the enterprise's offer. Knowledge is currently perceived as a strategic enterprise resource and as such it should be subject to constant identification, measurement, acquisition, development, utilization and protection. Business in the 21st century is being redefined by a data-driven revolution. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play an essential role in the global economic growth. The share of the Polish SME sector in GNP has been at 48% for years now. This sector has been also among the most dynamically developing and computerising areas in the Polish economy. ICT (Information and Communication Technology) systems create the foundation of modern economic organizations in the times of digital transformation. This applies in particular to advanced ICT infrastructure, which is the condition sine qua non for the effective knowledge management. The objective of this article is to discuss organizational and technological aspects within the modern knowledge management using ICT called SMAC (Social, Mobility, Analytics, Cloud), being at present the canon of ICT support in this respect.

Today, Danish farms are mainly family-owned, and the employees are often of other nationalities, and one third are unskilled. The aim of this paper is to document how employees perceive animal welfare and to discuss how they deal with ethical assumptions in daily work. The paper reports the findings of qualitative interviews with 23 employees from five Danish farms (mink, dairy and pig production). Employees emphasise physical aspects of animal welfare relating to feed, water and health. However, some employees described naturalness, which is known to be of importance to the public, as an area that could be negotiated.

Getting used to impose pain in daily work was described as a working condition in the job which one had to accept.

The main reason for Croatian Brain-Drain isn't low salaries, but the lack of human resource specialists who could improve the working conditions and help in the social development of the healthcare institutions in Croatia. Notably, a high salary appears to have a lesser relevance compared to the quality of working conditions.

This results from the fact that the positive changes in this sector can contribute to higher economic development and improvement of economic welfare. The aim of the paper was to identify the tendencies in energy intensity in European Union countries, and their causes and effects since 2000. The hypothesis that with economic growth (measured by GDP per capita) the energy intensity of an economy decreases and energy consumption per capita falls too, was tested. Descriptive statistics methods, Pearson correlation coefficient and analysis of intensity (intensity indicators) were used in the paper. The changes in variables are presented mainly using dynamics and geometric mean indexes. The source of data is the European Commission, Eurostat and the World Bank. The hypothesis was proved in 20 countries and for the European Union as a whole. For 7 countries it was not proved (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland). Although some medium-developed countries increased the use of energy per capita during the period from 2000-2015 (Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland), these countries improved their energy efficiency much more (they reduced energy intensity). Finally, the effects are positive in these countries. There is the lowest energy intensity in highly-developed countries: Ireland, Denmark, United Kingdom, France, but there were the highest nominal and real decreases of energy intensity in countries with various GDPs (different GDP per capita levels): Ireland, Slovak Republic, Romania, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Sweden, Poland. Among the most important determinants affecting the lower energy intensity belong restructuring of the economy and structural changes, technological changes, putting more capital into research and development and improvement of energy management systems.","[Borychowski, Michal; Stochmal, Radoslaw] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Borychowski, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Poznan, Poland.",michal.borychowski@ue.poznan.pl; radoslaw.stochmal@gmail.com,"Borychowski, Michał/AAE-8489-2021","Borychowski, Michał/0000-0001-6256-2680",,,,,32,0,0,0,4,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,299,314,,10.14595/CP/01/020,0.0,,,16,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000020,0

We will argue that this replacement is due to a tacit agreement on a number of assumptions, previously seen as mutually exclusive, and not due to a settlement by 'nature'. As opposed to econometrics and microeconomics and despite massive progress in the access to data and the use of statistical software, macroeconomic theory appears not to be a cumulative science so far. Observational equivalence of different models and the problem of identification of parameters of the models persist as will be highlighted by examining two examples: one in growth theory and a second in testing inflation persistence.","[Chatelain, Jean-Bernard] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Ralf, Kirsten] Esce Int Business Sch, 10 Rue Sextius Michel, F-75015 Paris, France",Paris School of Economics; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Ralf, K (通讯作者)，Esce Int Business Sch, 10 Rue Sextius Michel, F-75015 Paris, France.;Chatelain, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",jean-bernard.chate-lain@univ-paris1.fr; Kirsten.Ralf@esce.fr,"Chatelain, Jean-Bernard/B-8632-2012","Chatelain, Jean-Bernard/0000-0001-7768-9369; Ralf, Kirsten/0000-0002-8030-1035",,,,,70,2,2,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

In the early phase of the conflict, many Armenian activists and politicians drew parallels between the evolving struggles of the present and the traumatic events of 1915. This essay explores the ways in which Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey have referred to the events of 1915 to formulate their policies towards the conflict. The essay argues that the largely suppressed past trauma was present in the mass psychology of the conflicting parties, although in radically different ways, and that it shaped developing events. After depoliticising genocide commemorations in the early years of its independence, Armenia has recently witnessed an increase in references to the genocide in political discourse. The same also applies, somewhat paradoxically, to Azerbaijan, which has developed its own state-sponsored discourse of genocide, vehemently denying that the genocide took place while portraying Azerbaijan as a victim of genocide itself. This exchange of roles clearly needs further explanation.","[Cheterian, Vicken] Univ Geneva, Hist & Int Relat, 22 Bd Philosophes, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Cheterian, Vicken] Webster Univ Geneva, 22 Bd Philosophes, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva,"Cheterian, V (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Hist & Int Relat, 22 Bd Philosophes, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.;Cheterian, V (通讯作者)，Webster Univ Geneva, 22 Bd Philosophes, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.",vicken.cheterian@unige.ch,,,Webster University Geneva,Webster University Geneva,The author would like to thank Webster University Geneva for a research grant that made this essay possible.,,70,8,12,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2018,70.0,6,,,SI,,884,903,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1489634,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,GP3EU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000440725600003,0

A framework for developing and well-skilled/educated workforce can be achieved through the motivation in the public sector to create, share and transmit knowledge. We start with the assumption that the higher level of education of the working age population may cause an employment growth and thus can have a significant impact on economic growth overall, since the sustainable development of economy and society is closely related to education.

By analysing the political economy of carbon market design, this paper highlights a number of design features that are instrumental in depressing carbon prices across the world's emission trading schemes, keeping them well below those considered necessary to spur deep emission reductions in order to avoid catastrophic global warming. In doing so, it advances critiques of carbon trading by illuminating the extent to which carbon markets manifest as expressions of specific power relations rooted in the political economy of advanced capitalism, with low prices ensuring minimal disruption to business as usual.","[Ervine, Kate] St Marys Univ, Int Dev Studies Program, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H C3C, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Ervine, K (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Int Dev Studies Program, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H C3C, Canada.",kate.ervine@smu.ca,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada,Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),Research for this paper has been supported by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada.,,104,21,22,4,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In the 2000s, the result of this development was a sharp decrease in real interest rates across the eurozone periphery, leading to rapid but inflationary growth. This eroded the competitiveness of exporters in the European periphery, making them more reliant on capital inflows to pay for growing current account deficits. Those deficits became problematic after the disruption of eurozone financial markets beginning in 2008. The policy response to the crises has focused on reducing the competitiveness gap between the core and periphery - while overlooking the financial forces that contributed to those competitiveness differentials in the first place. Indeed, it is the fragile and perverse complementarity in eurozone financial markets - more than any external shock or competitiveness differences - that lies at the root of Europe's ongoing crisis.","[Fuller, Gregory W.] Univ Groningen, Dept Int Relat & Int Org, 26 Oude Kijk Int Jatstr, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Fuller, GW (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Dept Int Relat & Int Org, 26 Oude Kijk Int Jatstr, NL-9712 EK Groningen, Netherlands.",g.w.fuller@rug.nl,,,,,,,58,19,19,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A quantitative study of post-Soviet countries since independence finds that much of the observed variation in political closure reflects timing, or the particular point at which a country happens to be within a regime cycle, rather than structural or other factors usually cited to explain regime change. Specifically, how much time a president has had to coordinate rivalrous networks around his or her authority is at least as strong a predictor of the level of regime closure as are economic development, economic growth, resource rents, proximity to Europe, and key cultural factors, even when controlling for the level of closure in the preceding year. This pattern is not found among countries with divided-executive constitutions, indicating it is related to the constitution rather than a general phenomenon.","[Hale, Henry E.] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Hale, HE (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",hhale@gwu.edu,,,,,,,62,1,1,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

This paper presents survey of the former key decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union concerning national exit taxation provisions and compares them to the current ATAD exit taxation provisions. The legal analysis suggests that several former Court of Justice of the EU decisions considerably differ from the adopted ATAD exit taxation rules. This shift might suggest that judgements of Court of Justice of the European Union and tax policy of the European Union institutions might not provide enough consistency and legal certainty. The paper hypothesizes four unspoken reasons which might lay behind introduction of the common harmonized exit taxation rules in the EU.","[Kubicova, Jana] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Finance, Dolnozemksa Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Kubicová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Finance, Dolnozemksa Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",jana.kubicova@euba.sk,"Kubicová, Jana/AAP-6268-2020","Kubicová, Jana/0000-0002-8816-3968","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic [VEGA 1/0776/16]","Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic","This paper is 1,0 result of the research project supported under the scheme VEGA 1/0776/16 Taxation of Financial Sector and Harmonization Tendencies in the EU funded by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic.",,12,1,1,0,8,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,348,354,,,,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800045,0

Therefore it is essential to establish a risk management system in order to identify, analyze, assess and to control risks properly. Many companies suffer on ill-structured decision-making processes and insufficient risk management systems. This can be traced back to fact that risk management is often underestimated in organisations. Due to the fierce competition and rapid changes on the markets, the topic of risk management has become vital in both academia and in practice over the last several years. The aim of this paper is to develop a comprehensive risk management model which allows the responsible bodies to gain structure under uncertainty and to turn risks into competitive advantages.

We can state that the changes of the individual adjustments of tax base are the most significant in the case of all sectors, but on the other hand, when it comes to the rest of the items their impact differs.","[Lisztwanova, Karolina; Ratmanova, Iveta] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Lisztwanová, K (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",karolina.lisztwanova@vsb.cz; iveta.ratmanova@vsb.cz,"Ratmanová, Iveta/I-6299-2018; Lisztwanová, Karolina/ABF-3884-2020",,SGS Project VSB - TU Ostrava [SP2018/154],SGS Project VSB - TU Ostrava,This paper was supported by the SGS Project VSB - TU Ostrava SP2018/154 Financni rozhodovani podniku a financnich instituci za rizika.,,8,1,1,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,372,379,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800048,0

Behavioural accounting study the impact of the psychological aspects of human behaviour on accounting processes. The genesis of mainstream behavioural accounting is the result of criticism of the main assumptions of economics and finance. Accounting dogma is an assumption of the efficiency of capital markets, where investors take a fully rational decisions, assessing risks and return on alternative investments. Behavioural accounting is defined as a multi-disciplinary field that draws on theoretical construction of behavioural sciences. All processes related to accounting: planning, budgeting, decision making, control and financial reporting have behavioural aspects. Behavioural accounting investigates the areas, which are related to the behaviour of accountants and others involved in the accounting system, rejecting the foundation of economic rationality of behaviour.

Drawing on extensive fieldwork and 42 key informant interviews sides, we explain this outcome with reference to the logic of competitive influence-seeking: Russia is currently unable to achieve a friendly and stable regime in Kyiv and thus hedges against the consolidation of an unfriendly pro-Western and stable regime by maintaining its control over parts of eastern Ukraine and solidifying the dependence of local regimes there on Russian support. This gives Russia the opportunity to maintain the current status quo or settle for re-integration terms through which Russia can sustain long-term influence over Ukraine's domestic and foreign policy. We conclude by reflecting on the consequences of competitive influence-seeking in the post-Soviet space: the likely persistence of low-intensity conflict in Ukraine; the further consolidation of territorial divisions in other post-Soviet conflicts; and the need for policy-makers in Russia and the West to prioritize the management of the consequent instability.","[Malyarenko, Tatyana] Natl Univ, Odessa Law Acad, Odessa, Ukraine; [Wolff, Stefan] Univ Birmingham, Inst Conflict Cooperat & Secur, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; National University Odesa Law Academy; University of Birmingham,"Wolff, S (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Inst Conflict Cooperat & Secur, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",S.Wolff@bham.ac.uk,"Wolff, Stefan/ABD-5890-2021; Malyarenko, Tetyana/AAC-2003-2019","Wolff, Stefan/0000-0001-9931-5309; Malyarenko, Tetyana/0000-0002-5346-1180","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M009211/1]; ESRC [ES/J020710/1, ES/M009211/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J020710/1, ES/M009211/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M009211/1].,,57,55,57,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Universities and its constituents as organizations are quite unique and because of that, they require special approach in institutional management as well as in leadership that becomes even more important. The aim of this study was to identify types of leadership in management boards of university constituent units of Croatian universities and their impact on knowledge management within these institutions. This cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted from June to September 2015 among 80 members of management boards of university constituents of two Croatian universities. The study showed that among all study participants there were 98.8% of participants who practiced one out of five possible leadership roles (21.5% edgy catalyser, 16.5% visionary motivator, 6.3% measured connector, 12.7% tenacious implementer and 43.0% thoughtful architect) while there was 1.2% of those who did not practice any leadership role during his/her work within the management board of university constituent. Unique characteristics of each previously mentioned leadership role strongly influence the knowledge management in Croatian universities. Taking into account that in different phases of knowledge management process, a leader performs different tasks it is necessary for him or her to adjust his/her individual leadership role to the particular ongoing phase of this process. In order to be able to do that each member of university constituent management board needs additional education about leadership in general as well as about possible leadership roles and also needs to be aware of his/her dominant leadership role. Only by following all that, Croatian universities and its constituents will surely be prepared for all possible challenges and changes that can affect such organizations and be sure that constant and continuous growth and development can be certainly achieved.","[Miskulin, Ivan; Crnkovic, Boris; Miskulin, Maja] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ, Fac Med Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Miskulin, I (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ, Fac Med Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",ivan.miskulin@mefos.hr; bcrnko@efos.hr; maja.miskulin@mefos.hr,"Miskulin, Maja/B-9488-2016",,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,504,522,,,,,,19,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300029,0

In fact, European countries mostly evaluate the effects of an introduction of sugar tax rather than excise duties on soft drinks, but in the last few years the latter gained prominence in the academic literature. By using a holistic approach, the aim of this paper is to show the possible effects of an increase in excise duties on soft drinks in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). After a brief analysis of the status of taxation of soft drinks in the European countries, we focus on the case of BiH. We conduct a comprehensive economic analysis of the possible effects of an increase in the existing excise duties on soft drinks in BiH in three simulation scenarios: a simulation where the additional tax burden is fully absorbed by the producers; a simulation where the additional tax burden is fully levied on consumers and a simulation where the additional burden is shared between the producers and consumers. In all three simulation scenarios, our results show that an increase in the excise duty on soft drinks in BiH increases inefficiency for both producers and consumers and is therefore discriminatory and harmful.","[Pijalovic, Velma] Univ Sarajevo, Dept Econ Theory & Policy, BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Lazovic-Pita, Lejla] Univ Sarajevo, Dept Finance, BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo; University of Sarajevo,"Pijalovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Dept Econ Theory & Policy, BiH, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",velma.tahmaz@efsa.unsa.ba; lejla.lazovic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Lazovic-Pita, Lejla/AAP-4342-2021","Lazovic-Pita, Lejla/0000-0001-9421-1842",,,,,39,0,0,0,0,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,842,863,,,,,,22,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300047,0

Adopting the case of the US and using a narrative approach (Romer and Romer, 2010), I study the vertical effects of federal tax shocks. I find that vertical tax externalities are modest in their size and are only present in corporate taxation. In particular, I estimate that a $1 billion increase in federal tax revenues reduces total state corporate tax revenues by approximately $27 million. Non-corporate state tax revenues do not seem to be affected by federal tax shocks.

Yet, after a drop in deposits in the wake of Pakistan's 2008 crisis, deposits are still struggling to return to their mid-1990s' levels. Focusing on distortions in the banking sector, the Central Bank attributes this to crowding out' amidst a steep rise in the propensity to consume. This study draws on extensive fieldwork, identifying heightened financial risk driven by multifaceted monetary instability since the liberalisation of the rupee and of Pakistani markets. It proposes that heightened monetary risk has translated into a broad-based shift out of the rupee akin to hyperinflationary responses, but revealed in relatively moderate monetary conditions. It argues that, exposed to global markets, national currency itself has become a risky asset, pushing store-of-value and transactional holdings into unconventional liquid assets. This suggests that monetary stability, expressed in the currency itself and in broader pricing patterns in the economy, is key to the uptake of financial intermediation. The issue at the root of disintermediation in Pakistan, it is argued, is less one of crowding out' than of disruption to the role of national currency as money itself.","[Settle, Antonia] Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Settle, Antonia] Sustainable Dev Policy Inst, Islamabad, Pakistan",University of Sydney; Sustainable Development Policy Institute - Pakistan,"Settle, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Settle, A (通讯作者)，Sustainable Dev Policy Inst, Islamabad, Pakistan.",aset7246@uni.sydney.edu.au,,"Settle, Antonia/0000-0002-1214-1658",,,,,78,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The aim of the research is to understand the financial analysis and business feasibility of establishing a small-scale industry of cinnamon jelly candy, as well as developing a production plant layout for the jelly candy industry. The methodology consists of several steps, setting the location and presumptions, analyzing Net Present Value, Benefit-Cost Ratio, Internal Rate of Return, Pay Back Period and, designing the layout of the production area. The result shows that production of candy jelly in one production batch is 334 packs and the price is Rp. 9,300 per package. The discount factor is 9.75% for a five-year projection. With the Net Present Value is Rp. 47,256,870, the Benefit-Cost Ratio is 1.09, the Internal Rate of Return is 32.82%, and the Pay Back Period is 2 years 3 months and 21 days. Layout of the production area was adjusted based on the order of the production process using the Activity Relationship Chart method. It is possible to develop small-scale industry of cinnamon jelly candy with 19% profit of the production price. Thus, this will support the growth of small industries in Indonesia.","[Sukotjo, Setiarti; Muhami; Mastikha, Alifatul] Inst Teknol Indonesia, Dept Agroind Technol, Tangerang Selatan, Indonesia; [Sukmadi, Indrati] Inst Teknol Indonesia, Dept Informat, Tangerang Selatan, Indonesia",,"Sukotjo, S (通讯作者)，Inst Teknol Indonesia, Dept Agroind Technol, Tangerang Selatan, Indonesia.",teti.sukotjo@iti.ac.id; indrati.sukmadi@iti.ac.id; muhami@iti.ac.id; amastikha@gmail.com,"Sukotjo, Setiarti/GLR-9559-2022",,KemenristekDikti,KemenristekDikti(Ministry of Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (RISTEK)),"The team would like to express its sincerest gratitude to KemenristekDikti for providing the research funds and to the Department of Agro-Industrial Technology for providing the research facilities.

The set of explaining determinants describes three characteristics of the banking system - depth, efficiency and stability. The data is collected from following databases: World Development Indicators, Global Financial Development, KOF Index of Globalization and Financial Access Survey. Two-step system GMM estimator is used to address the issue of endogeneity. Robustness of the obtained results is tested with fixed-effects estimator. Using these methods we find that bigger banking system per se does not foster economic output, however its quality does. In case of high-income countries greater effect of banking sector instability on economic growth is observed.","[Vodicka, Lukas] Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Vodicka, L (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ Brno, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Finance, Lipova 507-41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",421426@mail.muni.cz,,,Masaryk University,Masaryk University,The author wishes to thank Mr. Oleg Deev for his helpful comments and remarks.

Still, as for financing decisions there is no consensus on the direction of the impact, and in assessing this - some research show using excessive debt while others debt-conservatism. We, in turn, assume that inconsistency on the capital structure decisions of overconfident managers might be explained by debt capacity of the their companies. We think that companies managed by overconfident managers have lower debt capacity and, at the same time, they use a higher debt ratio than their debt capacity allows. We collected a unique sample composed of 145 non-listed companies and their financial data for the 2010-2015 period. We then divided the sample into two subsamples depending on managerial overconfidence. We found that debt capacity is lower for companies managed by overconfident managers. There are also differences in sources of debt capacity: for companies managed by overconfident managers the main source is size and tangibility. Moreover, companies managed by overconfident managers have lower debt ratio. This might indicate safe financing strategy, but using a low debt ratio means that companies managed by overconfident managers are constrained to use equity because they exhaust their debt capacity.","[Wronska-Bukalska, Elzbieta] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Econ, Pl MC Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Wronska-Bukalska, E (通讯作者)，Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Fac Econ, Pl MC Sklodowskiej 5, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.",elzbieta.bukalska@umcs.lublin.pl,"Bukalska, Elżbieta/AAM-6461-2021; Bukalska, Elżbieta/JXL-6679-2024","Bukalska, Elżbieta/0000-0001-8097-5964; Bukalska, Elżbieta/0000-0001-8097-5964",,,,,24,1,1,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,831,838,,,,,,8,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800106,0

This study aims to examine the asymmetric price transmission process in the meat supply chain in the Turkish market. For this purpose, market power was investigated by the Asymmetric Error Correction Model (AECM) developed by von Cramon Taubadel in order to analyze the transmission between farm meat prices and retail meat prices. The long-run relationship between these two prices was examined by using two step Engle-Granger and Gregory-Hansen co-integration test and monthly data set covering the period from January 2003 to February 2015. According to the results of co-integration test, the price series move together in the long run, which means they are co-integrated. We found evidence of a structural break in 2009. Results also indicate that, contrary to common belief price transmission between producer and retail levels is symmetric. Although no evidence has been found supporting the monopoly power, it should be highlighted that there is further need to improve the competitiveness of producers against the big retailers/wholesalers in the sector.","[Boluk, Gulden] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, Dumlupinar Bulvari,Kampus, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey; [Karaman, Suleyman] Akdeniz Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Dumlupinar Bulvari,Kampus, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University; Akdeniz University,"Bölük, G (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, Dumlupinar Bulvari,Kampus, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",guldenboluk@akdeniz.edu.tr; skaraman@akdeniz.edu.tr,"KARAMAN, Suleyman/C-6000-2016; Bölük, Gülden/C-2326-2016","KARAMAN, Suleyman/0000-0003-0042-7912;",,,,,55,4,4,2,10,EDIZIONI DEDALO S R L,BARI,"V LE LUIGI JACOBINI, 5, ZONA INDUSTRIALE - BARI, CASELLA POSTALE BA-19, BARI, 70123 BA, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,DEC,2017,16.0,4,,,,,2,11,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,FX4EX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426026600001,0

Likewise, policy makers need to determine how to allocate limited funding across multiple technologies. Unfortunately, existing modeling tools to study these questions lack a realistic representation of electric power system operations, the innovation process, or both. In this paper, we present a new modeling framework for long-term R&D and electricity generation capacity planning that combines an economic representation of endogenous non-linear technical change with a detailed representation of the power system. Die model captures the complementary nature of technologies in the power sector; physical integration constraints of the system; and the opportunity to build new knowledge capital as a non-linear function of R&D and accumulated knowledge, reflective of the diminishing marginal returns to research inherent in the energy innovation process. Through a series of numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses-with and without carbon policy-we show' how using frameworks that do not incorporate these features can over- or under-estimate the value of different emerging technologies, and potentially misrepresent the cost-effectiveness of R&D opportunities.","[Santen, Nidhi R.] MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, E19-341L,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Webster, Mort D.] Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, 123 Hosler, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Popp, David] Syracuse Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Ctr Policy Res, Maxwell Sch, 426 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Popp, David] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio] Univ Pontificia Comillas, BP Chair Energy & Sustainabil, IIT, Alberto Aguilera 23, Madrid 28015, Spain; [Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio] MIT, CEEPR, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Syracuse University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Comillas Pontifical University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Santen, NR (通讯作者)，MIT, MIT Energy Initiat, E19-341L,77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",nrsanten@mit.edu; mort@psu.edu; depopp@maxwell.syr.edu; ignacio.perez@iit.upcomillas.es,"Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio/ABF-7662-2020","Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio/0000-0002-1466-8613","MIT Office of the Graduate Dean for Education John S.

However, many BOT highway projects are terminated before the expiry of the concession period for a variety of reasons, such as unreasonable decisions and a lack of a risk allocation mechanism. As the most concerning issue for the government and private sector, compensation for early termination has been a major controversy due to the lack of a fair and reasonable decision approach. This paper proposes an effective method to evaluate the compensation amount for projects with incomplete contracts using game theory. First, a bargaining-game model with complete information is constructed to analyse the process of negotiation, for which the influences of the government investing in a new road and the traffic demand changes of the early terminated project on bargaining are taken into consideration. Then, the Nash equilibrium solution of the model is derived by backward induction, and a discussion of the properties of the solution is presented. Finally, the model results are verified using the Wutong Mountain Tunnel BOT project in China. This paper provides a solution to compensation for early termination of BOT highway projects with incomplete contracts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As a source of income variation we use a change in the eligibility criteria for receipt of an unconditional cash transfer in Ecuador. Two years after families lost the transfer, which they had received for seven years, their young children weigh less and are shorter and more likely to be stunted than young children in families that kept the cash transfer. We find no statistically significant effect on young children's height and weight two years after gaining the cash transfer.

However, it is still unknown whether millennials will continue to use sustainable transport modes as they age, or whether their travel patterns will revert to the car dependence displayed by previous generations. This research addresses this overlooked area in the travel behaviour research through an in-depth, qualitative prospective exploration of the interactions between life course and mobility of millennials in three Australian cities (Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra). Drawing from life-course transition research, fifty-five in-depth interviews found that Australian millennial life courses could be categorised into three typologies: (a) traditional, (b) delayed-traditional and (c) non-traditional/uncertain. In addition, millennial mobility was categorised into four typologies: (a) choice multi modals, (b) captive multi-modals, (c) choice drivers and (d) captive drivers. Many millennials preferred living in inner urban areas, were multi-modal and somewhat 'mode agnostic,' open to using whatever travel mode best suited their needs; very few showed a strong preference for cars. However, the research does suggest that as millennials approach adult milestones such as having children, the difficulty in finding suitable housing near transit may push some of them into neighbourhoods where sustainable transport is no longer a practical option. Policy interventions that support a sustainable lifestyle are suggested and research directions are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The New Deal era was a period in which this allocation changed significantly in the United States, as provision of public assistance shifted from local governments to states and the federal government, accompanied by a large increase in government transfer payments. Focusing on assistance to the elderly and using variation in state laws governing the division of funding between local and state governments for the Old Age Assistance (OAA) Program, this paper investigates the responsiveness of OAA payments and recipiency to local government funding shares. Payments per elderly resident were significantly lower in states with higher local funding shares, driven largely by reductions in recipiency. The baseline results suggest that had local governments needed to fund half of OAA payments in 1939, on the lower end of local funding shares prior to the New Deal, the share of the elderly receiving OAA would have been 5 percent rather than 22 percent, and perhaps even lower. More speculative results suggest that greater local funding led to lower representation of blacks among OAA recipients relative to their share of the population, particularly in the South.

The change happens because, in the FIFA World Cup, a quota of countries participate from each continent and this opens up new tourism markets. We show that the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa had a smaller growth effect on South Africa's traditional tourism markets but attracted a large increase from nontraditional ones. However, the size of the effect, we find, is partly due to randomness: It depends on match results in the qualification phase of the tournament. We use a new long-run data set of tourism flows to South Africa and a gravity model for tourism flows and run counterfactual examples of play-off matches during the qualification phase to estimate how much more South Africa could have benefited had larger or richer countries qualified. We conclude that the random results of a few play-off games significantly affect the extent to which the World Cup benefits the host country's economy.","[Fourie, Johan] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, Stelllenbosch, South Africa; [Santana-Gallego, Maria] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca, Spain",Stellenbosch University; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Fourie, J (通讯作者)，Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Econ, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, Stelllenbosch, South Africa.",johanf@sun.ac.za,"Santana, Maria/H-9163-2015","Santana, Maria/0000-0001-5977-7875",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: An earlier version of this article appeared as ERSA Working Paper #508.

This pattern, which is also shared by other countries in Southern Europe, disappeared at the turn of the 20th century. Rather than female infanticide or other type of extreme violence against girls, these results might be explained by gender discrimination in terms of an unequal allocation of food, care and/or workload within the household. In high-mortality environments, this type of discrimination easily resulted in higher female mortality rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Tapia, Francisco J.

The planning professional is ill-equipped to deal with fundamental urban challenges that threaten the quality and competiveness of cities and regions. For decades, Planning Support Systems (PSS) are being developed to address this challenge. The PSS research domain grew accordingly. Only recently did researchers start to focus more directly on how PSS are used (or not used) by planning practitioners. Understanding the real-life application of PSS is fundamental for addressing the challenges of knowledge use. This commentary argues that we need to go beyond the current simplistic understanding of several key concepts. It identifies academic pathways that further mature the conceptualization of PSS, of planning processes, of the participants and the relationship between them. The argument builds on ten years of full-time research in this domain and combines this with recent insights from other academic fields, such as group performance and behavior psychology. This provides us pathways towards a more realistic evaluation of how knowledge can regain its important role in urban planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Joint modeling of temporal and spatial adjustment effects is necessarily important when prices and loads are determined in a network grid. By using different spatial weight matrices, statistical tests show significant spatial dependence in the spot price dynamics across areas. In fact, estimation of the model shows that the spatial dependence is as important as the temporal dependence in describing the spot price dynamics. We decompose price impacts into direct and indirect effects and demonstrate how price effects transmit to neighboring markets and decline with distance. A forecasting comparison with a non-spatial model shows that the space-time model improves forecasting performance for 7 and 30 days ahead forecasts. A model with time-varying parameters is estimated for an expanded sample period and it is found that the spatial correlation within the power grid has increased over time.

Based on the welfare state literature and existing public opinion research in foreign aid, we expect citizens with more rightist political orientations as well as those who do not perceive their own state apparatus to function in a meritocratic way to be more likely to support political conditionality. Our multi-level analysis supports these hypotheses in general, but also shows that the effect of political orientations on support for political conditionality in foreign aid is limited to traditional EU donor countries, where the left/right-cleavage has been dominant in politics.","[Bodenstein, Thilo] Cent European Univ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Faust, Joerg] German Inst Dev Evaluat DEval, Bonn, Germany",Central European University,"Bodenstein, T (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Nador U 9, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",bodensteint@spp.ceu.edu,,,,,,,80,23,23,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In the first stage, a DEA-Malmquist model in a metafrontier framework is used to obtain the productivity scores. This approach lets us take the possible technological differences among the port terminals into account. In the second stage, an Arellano-Bond model was estimated, to explain the differences in productivity change. The empirical evidence shows that the Class 1 terminals produce output under certain less favourable technological conditions than. the Class 2 terminals. Moreover, on average, both classes present positive evolutions of the catching up effect, which shows that the terminals as a whole are moving nearer to the efficiency metafrontier. We also observe a technological regress during 2004-2014 and that the terminals have been affected by the financial crisis which started in the United States in 2008. Finally, we identified that the container/bulk rate and that private management contribute positively to the change in productivity, whereas the bulk rate and the total factor productivity change lagged contribute negatively.

In the current study, a four-step analysis approach is developed to investigate the psychosocial determinants of public transportation usage behavior within the background of a small-sized Chinese city. The results suggest that public transportation specific factors including attitude, subjective norm, satisfaction, habit, and behavioral intention, as well as perceived car control, all contribute to explaining the target choice behavior. Behavioral intention is confirmed to be the most critical factor that influences public transportation usage behavior, while habit and satisfaction are important mediators in the process defined by the theory of planned behavior. Moreover, an examination upon gendered difference reflects that effects of both perceived car control and satisfaction vary distinctively across men and women groups, which demonstrates the necessity of demand management differentiation.

Drawing from consumption value theory, consumers' value perceptions of EVs are classified into functional values (monetary, performance and convenience values) and non-functional values (emotional, social and epistemic values). We try to explore how consumers' intention to adopt EVs is affected by these two groups of values and how such effects are mediated by their attitude towards EVs. Via a survey of car drivers in Hefei, China, 607 responses were obtained to empirically test the relationships. The results indicate that the perceived functional value have both direct and indirect effects on consumers' intention to adopt EVs. While the perceived non-functional value have only indirect effects on the adoption intention, which is mediated by attitude. This research deepens the existing understanding of consumers' multi-dimensional value perceptions towards EVs. In practice, the findings could provide sensible guidelines for making the marketing strategies and offer references for policy makers to enhance the operability and pertinence of current policies.

The paper also considers the case when factors exhibit a unit root. We provide feasible estimators and show in a simulation study that they are more efficient than the PC estimator in finite samples. In application, the estimation procedure is employed to estimate the Lee-Carter model and life expectancy is forecast.

These deviations occur for clusters of cities that experience simultaneous housing contractions. We find that cities do not form housing regions in the traditional geographic sense. Instead, similarities in factors affecting the demand for housing (such as population growth or availability of credit) appear to be more important determinants of cyclical co-movements than similarities in factors affecting the supply for land (such as the availability of developable land or the elasticity of land supply).","[Hernandez-Murillo, Ruben] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, External Outreach & Reg Analyt, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Owyang, Michael T.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Rubio, Margarita] Univ Nottingham, Dept Econ, Nottingham, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; University of Nottingham,"Owyang, MT (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Div Res, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",Ruben.Hernandez-Murillo@clev.frb.org; Owyang@stls.frb.org; Margarita.Rubio@nottingham.ac.uk,"Owyang, Michael T/I-5750-2016; Hernandez-Murillo, Ruben/P-4834-2018","Owyang, Michael T/0000-0002-2109-3432; Rubio, Margarita/0000-0002-1525-9766",,,,,48,19,20,0,16,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Our setting is the German federal state of Bavaria, where in 1995 a state-wide reform introduced the possibility to initiate direct democratic legislation into the local government code. Relying on a sample of all Bavarian municipalities over 1980-2011, we hypothesize that complementing a representative form of government with the initiative process leads to (i) higher local tax rates and (ii) a shift of the local tax mix from taxes with broader (property taxes) to taxes with narrower bases (business taxes). For identification, we rely on a difference-in-discontinuity design. Our results suggest that the ease with which local initiatives can be implemented measured by signature and quorum requirements increases local tax rates and shift the tax mix toward taxes with narrower bases.","[Asatryan, Zareh; Heinemann, Friedrich] ZEW Mannheim, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Baskaran, Thushyanthan] Univ Siegen, Siegen, Germany; [Heinemann, Friedrich] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Universitat Siegen; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Asatryan, Z (通讯作者)，ZEW Mannheim, L7 1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",asatryan@zew.de,,,,,,,47,11,14,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

Entry into the market by rival leagues challenged the incumbent monopsony cartel's ability to restrict compensation. Using a sample of player salaries from the first 40 years of the reserve clause (1880-1919), this study examines the impact of inter-league competition on player wages. This study finds a positive salary effect associated with rival league entry that is consistent with monopsony wage suppression, but the effect is stronger during the 20th century than the 19th century. Changes in levels of market saturation and minor-league competition may explain differences in the effects between the two eras.","[Bradbury, John Charles] Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, 560 Parliament Garden Way NW, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Bradbury, JC (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Quantitat Anal, 560 Parliament Garden Way NW, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",jcbradbury@kennesaw.edu,"Bradbury, John/V-6080-2019","Bradbury, John/0000-0001-9209-569X",,,,,44,4,4,0,3,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0014-4983,1090-2457,,EXPLOR ECON HIST,Explor.

Given the potential destructive power of tornado events and their largely unpredictable nature, it is important to identify the major determinants of vulnerability. To date, only a limited number of studies have empirically investigated the determinants of tornado-induced deaths. Based on a conceptual framework where risk is considered to be a function of physically defined natural hazards and socially constructed vulnerability, we extend previous empirical studies by examining a wider range of potential socioeconomic, governmental, and housing factors that determine tornado-induced fatalities. Using detailed county level data for years 1980-2014, we find that counties with higher per capita income and per capita government spending on public safety and welfare have fewer deaths, whereas counties with greater income disparity are more vulnerable to tornadoes. We explore which aspects of poverty seem most associated with fatalities. Housing quality (measured by mobile homes as a proportion of housing units) is a critical factor in explaining tornado-induced fatalities.","[Lim, Jungmin; Loveridge, Scott; Shupp, Robert; Skidmore, Mark] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Skidmore, M (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Justin S Morrill Hall Agr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",mskidmor@msu.edu,,"Lim, Jungmin/0000-0002-5444-5457",Michigan State University AgBioResearch [MICL02160]; North Central Regional Center for Rural Development [C106420],Michigan State University AgBioResearch; North Central Regional Center for Rural Development,Financial support from Michigan State University AgBioResearch (#MICL02160) and the North Central Regional Center for Rural Development (#C106420) is gratefully acknowledged.,,45,29,37,2,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

This study contributes to extant literature regarding transportation economics and policy because few studies have analyzed the accuracy of toll road traffic forecasts and current studies on this topic do not use a succinct econometric framework to infer the forecast's bias and efficiency, which are determinants of the accuracy of forecasts. The data for this study include 68 toll road projects where forecasts and actual out-turns were available. All projects that are included in this study were opened for traffic during 1975-2014. Transport models were made mandatory for forecasting toll traffic in 2006. The results of this study reveal the following: (i) Norwegian toll road traffic forecasts are underestimated but are close to accurate because the mean percentage error is a mere 4%. This result sharply contrasts international studies that resulted in large overestimations at more than -20%. (ii) The accuracy of forecasts has not improved since transport models became mandatory. (iii) The Norwegian toll road traffic forecasts are unbiased, which implies that they do not tend to be one-sided. (iv) Norwegian forecasts are efficient, which implies that available information is used adequately when making forecasts. Our conclusion is that the toll traffic forecasts in Norway perform fairly well compared to the forecasts of other countries. In addition, we recommend that the assessment of forecasts in the transportation sector should be based on succinct econometric frameworks; otherwise, the conclusions may lack important information regarding the bias and efficiency of the forecasts.

The scarce research that exists on firm behaviour, corruption and lobbying shows that these activities can be regarded as alternative, and interdependent, influence forms. This paper provides the novel contribution of investigating how the market infiltration of corruption and lobbying affects the firm's investment decision. We identify the interdependent effects using census data for Swedish manufacturing firms that allows a complete identification of the firm's market selection. Our results reveal that these private-public sector links influence the firm's investment decision differently, as market selection is deterred by corruption and stimulated by lobbying, and that they function as substitutes. We show that the stimulating lobbying effect largely can be attributed to its interdependency with corruption, which suggests that firms are more shielded from corruption in lobbying environments. Further investigation reveals that the corruption and lobbying effects are not always representative of larger firms: The largest firms are undeterred by corruption in markets where lobbying forms an integral part of the business environment and larger firms are not stimulated by lobbying in markets largely void of corruption.","[Thede, Susanna; Gustafson, Nils-Ake] Univ Malta, Inst European Studies, Msida, Malta",University of Malta,"Thede, S (通讯作者)，Univ Malta, Inst European Studies, Msida, Malta.",,,"Thede, Susanna/0000-0002-7540-9295",,,,,47,6,6,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2017,40.0,7,,,,,1266,1290,,10.1111/twec.12488,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FA2RN,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000405288600001,0

Utilising product-level trade data, this paper examines the impact of time zone differences on the intensive and extensive margin of exports. Furthermore, this paper examines the non-linear impact of different levels of time zone differences on exports. Using the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimation, the results indicate that the time zone differences negatively affect exports primarily via the extensive margin, with no effect on the intensive margin, which suggests that time zone differences act as a fixed cost of exporting. Furthermore, quartile analysis shows non-linearities in the time zone measure, more specifically that time zones matter more at larger time zone differences.

Inspired by the social norm theory of unemployment, the relevance of regional unemployment levels and workplace closure are explored, using multilevel analyses of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement. In line with the social norm theory, the results show that - only for men displaced workers are less depressed and use less medication than the non-displaced unemployed. However, they report more depressive symptoms than the employed, which supports the causal effect of unemployment on mental health. Non-displaced unemployed men are also more likely to consume medication than the displaced unemployed. In addition, using regional unemployment as a proxy for the social norm of unemployment can be questioned when studying mental health effects, as it seems to be a stronger measurement of labour market conditions than of the social norm of unemployment, especially during a recession.","[Buffel, Veerle; Bracke, Piet] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium; [Missinne, Sarah] Univ Ghent, Dept Sociol, Hlth & Demog Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Buffel, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Sociol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Veerle.Buffel@UGent.be,"Bracke, Piet/E-4007-2012","Bracke, Piet/0000-0002-9477-3236; Buffel, Veerle/0000-0001-6602-9525",,,,,68,27,29,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This decline is most pronounced for rural females over the age of 25 who have a primary education; it has been accompanied by a systematic increase in the productivity of the labor force, as it has moved from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity services and manufacturing. We also show that, although the employment share in manufacturing is not expanding rapidly, in most of the low-income African countries the employment share in manufacturing has not peaked and is still expanding, albeit from very low levels.

In particular, when all rank-order outcomes matter, multistage elections are in general less sensitive to perturbation, while in the case where the election's outcome simply produces a singular winner and stages are not closely correlated, some multistage elections show similar or higher levels of intrinsic vulnerability to manipulation, error, and fraud as positional or multiple elections.

Considering the latter case in this paper a new filtering method for distributed parameter systems, is developed for estimating option prices variations without knowledge of initial conditions. The proposed filtering method is the so-called derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter and is based on a decomposition of the nonlinear partial-differential equation model into a set of ordinary differential equations with respect to time. Next, each one of the local models associated with the ordinary differential equations is transformed into a model of the linear canonical (Brunovsky) form through a change of coordinates (diffeomorphism) which is based on differential flatness theory. This transformation provides an extended description of the nonlinear dynamics of the option pricing model for which state estimation is possible by applying the standard Kalman Filter recursion. Based on the provided state estimate, validation of the Black-Scholes PDE model can be performed and the existence of inconsistent parameters in the Black-Scholes PDE model can be concluded.","[Rigatos, G.; Zervos, N.] Ind Syst Inst, Unit Ind Automat, Rion 26504, Greece",,"Rigatos, G (通讯作者)，Ind Syst Inst, Unit Ind Automat, Rion 26504, Greece.",grigat@ieee.org,"Rigatos, Gerasimos/AAO-4726-2020","Rigatos, Gerasimos/0000-0002-2972-7030",,,,,37,3,3,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

It is therefore essential to clearly articulate the goals which are to be achieved by the introduction of this new financing tool. This paper provides a critical review of pros and cons of EU taxes put forward in the literature. Reviewing the conventional fiscal federalism and political economy literature on this topic it can be concluded that there is no convincing (overall) case for funding the EU budget with EU taxes rather than with contributions by Member States which currently make up for the lion's share of EU own resources. There are, however, some specific issues arising from a sustainability perspective, which could be addressed with the introduction of EU taxes. Departing from a comprehensive concept of sustainability which is based on the economic, the social, the environmental and the cultural/institutional pillar of sustainability, the paper identifies existing sustainability gaps in taxation in the EU. EU taxes if designed accordingly may be suitable instruments to reduce these sustainability gaps and thus to strengthen sustainability-orientation of taxation in the EU.","[Schratzenstaller, Margit; Krenek, Alexander] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Nerudova, Danuse; Dobranschi, Marian] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Schratzenstaller, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria.",Margit.Schratzenstaller@wifo.ac.at; Alexander.Krenek@wifo.ac.at; d.nerudova@seznam.cz; marian.dobranschi@mendelu.cz,"Dobranschi, Marian/V-6136-2018; Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012","Dobranschi, Marian/0000-0002-5642-0341; Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107",,,,,124,5,5,2,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

J,"Freund, F",,,,"Freund, Florian",,,Reciprocal Tariff Reductions Under Asymmetric Bargaining Power,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MARKET ACCESS; TRADE; COUNTRIES; COSTS,"Increasing heterogeneity of participants that form the basis of WTO trade negotiations has raised concerns about unfair treatment of weak countries due to their lack of bargaining power. The WTO responds to these concerns by arguing that the institutional design with its specific rules such as the principle of reciprocity serves to reduce inequalities in bargaining power by giving smaller (weaker) countries more voice. A recent study has challenged this result for a particular type of reciprocity, namely the volume approach. Given the wide discretion of how reciprocal concessions are conducted, I give a more complete picture of how different kinds of reciprocity affect the bargaining outcome of asymmetric countries. It turns out that, while the volume approach amplifies the negative effects of power asymmetries, a tariff formula approach has the ability to reverse this effect. For low symmetries, the Swiss formula does the best job, whereas for larger power differences, a linear formula is best suited to reduce the impact of power asymmetries.","[Freund, Florian] Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany",University of Regensburg,"Freund, F (通讯作者)，Univ Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAY,2017,40.0,5,,,,,978,992,,10.1111/twec.12481,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,ET9RB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000400644200008,0

That is, before an econometric model is estimated, observations are selected in such a way that the resulting subset of data is sufficiently homogeneous to be of interest for the specific research question pursued. In the context of estimating equivalence scales for household income, we use matching techniques and balance checking at this initial stage. This can be interpreted as a non-parametric approach to preprocessing data and as a way to formalize informal procedures. To illustrate this, we use German micro-data on household expenditure to estimate equivalence scales as a specific example. Our results show that matching leads to results which are more stable with respect to model specification and that this type of formal preprocessing is especially useful if one is mainly interested in results for specific subgroups, such as low-income households.","[Werding, Martin] CESifo GmbH, CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany; [Dudel, Christian; Garbuszus, Jan Marvin; Ott, Notburga; Werding, Martin] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Social Sci, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",Ifo Institut; Ruhr University Bochum,"Werding, M (通讯作者)，CESifo GmbH, CESifo Res Network, Munich, Germany.;Werding, M (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Social Sci, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",christian.dudel@ruhr-uni-bochum.de; jan.garbuszus@ruhr-uni-bochum.de; notburga.ott@ruhr-uni-bochum.de; martin.werding@ruhr-uni-bochum.de,,"Dudel, Christian/0000-0002-2985-6684; Werding, Martin/0000-0003-3833-8173",,,,,45,2,2,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The definition of the FAO in 1996, i.e. when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, presents the following four core dimensions. It includes: a) physical availability of food, b) economic and physical access to food, c) food utilization, and d) stability of the other three dimensions. Consequently, achieving food and nutrition security, as the main goal of food systems, requires adequate Food Availability, Food Accessibility, Food Utilization and Food Stability. The pathway to food and nutrition security begins by exploring the challenges, whose knowledge is needed for developing adequate solutions. Thus, decision-making is the process of discovering the best decision from all of the possible alternatives. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Models have received much consideration from researchers as a tool to assess and rank alternatives. Amongst various multi-criteria decision-making models, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) remains to work adequately. The major focus of the paper is to provide a synthesizing judgment about the Food and Nutrition Security (FNS) performance, including multiple and conflict criteria. We apply TOPSIS technique as a multi-criteria method, to build a dynamic quantitative national-level food and nutrition security index to be used as a benchmark for all dimensions of food and nutrition security, and prioritize the vulnerabilities of food system in the delivery of food and nutrition security in Iran. Using this technique, we survey how the food system has worked to provide food and nutrition security over time, in order to check if it has improved or worsened. We also analyze the level of overall vulnerability of food system by investigating changes in the four dimensions of food and nutrition security over the time in Iran.","[Ardakani, Zahra; Bartolini, Fabio; Brunori, Gianluca] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, Pisa, Italy",University of Pisa,"Ardakani, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Environm Econ, Pisa, Italy.",zahra.ardakani@gmail.com,"Ardakani, Zahra/E-7141-2019; Bartolini, Fabio/C-5232-2011; brunori, Gianluca/E-1687-2014","Bartolini, Fabio/0000-0002-8946-3110; brunori, Gianluca/0000-0003-2905-9738",,,,,64,6,6,1,12,Bologna Univ Press,Bologna,"Via Saragozza 10, Bologna, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,MAR,2017,16.0,1,,,,,18,28,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EU8RD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000401305300003,0

Social partnership emerged in the NHS following political devolution in 1998 which transferred powers to left-wing governments in Scotland and Wales. These arrangements helped improve health services, modernize industrial relations and enhance staff terms and conditions. In NHS Scotland, union participation in strategic decisions produced extensive co-operation to dismantle the internal health market, improve services and enhance staff terms and conditions. Union participation in NHS Wales was restricted to discussing workforce issues, and although co-operation increased when Welsh governments gained enhanced legislative powers and dismantled the internal health market, it delivered fewer improvements in service and pay levels. Differences in government political positioning (against public sector marketization) and degree of independence (with devolved administrations granted different legislative powers) help explain the operation and outcomes of social partnership.","[Bacon, Nicolas] City Univ London, London, England; [Samuel, Peter] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Employment Relat, Nottingham, England",City University London; University of Nottingham,"Bacon, N (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",nick.bacon.1@city.ac.uk,,,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RA2153],UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was supported by funding from the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the grant 'Evaluating Labour-Management Partnership in NHS Scotland' (award no.

We construct a theoretical model to show that agency problems arise when a listing agent attempts to maximize his or her payoff while setting the commission split. Mitigation to these agency problems can be achieved through the imposition of a limited duration on listing contracts. Our model produces several testable hypotheses, which are supported by empirical evidence.

Equivalence scales with constant elasticity with respect to family size have been argued to provide a good approximation to a large variety of scales (see, e.g., Buhmann et al., Equivalence scales, well-being, inequality and poverty: sensitivity estimates across ten countries using the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) database. Rev Income Wealth 34:115-142, 1988) and they therefore play a prominent role in empirical work. Focusing on inequality of well-being, we first show that, if one requires that the index of inequality is-in addition to standard properties-invariant to modifications of the relative (marginal) distributions of needs and income across households, then the equivalence scales must be isoelastic. In addition, if all households' members have the same preferences and if households maximise the sum of their members' utilities, then the only preferences consistent with isoelastic scales are of the Cobb-Douglas type.","[Ebert, Udo] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Volkswirtschaftslehre, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Moyes, Patrick] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, UMR 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Moyes, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, GREThA, UMR 5113, Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",ebert@uni-oldenburg.de; patrick.moyes@u-bordeaux.fr,,,ANR-DFG programme [HEWI/ANR-07-FRAL-020],ANR-DFG programme(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This paper forms part of the research project Heterogeneity and Well-Being Inequality (Contract No. HEWI/ANR-07-FRAL-020) of the ANR-DFG programme whose financial support is gratefully acknowledged.

We conducted an investment game with two separate treatments. In the uncorrelated treatment, the outcomes of the investment game were determined individually. In the correlated treatment, the outcomes of the investment game were determined collectively within a reference group. From an evolutionary perspective, men should be more concerned about relative outcomes, because their reproductive success mainly depended on their relative standing within society. Women, by contrast, should be more concerned about absolute outcomes, because their reproductive success was mainly linked to their access to resources for themselves and their children. Therefore, we predict that the type of outcome correlation structure has a larger impact on men than on women. In particular, we hypothesize that men are less ambiguity averse under an uncorrelated outcome structure. In this situation, the ambiguous alternative should be more attractive, because it potentially reduces inequality and thereby improves men's relative standing within society. Women's choices should not be significantly affected by different outcome correlation structures. Both hypotheses are supported by evidence from laboratory experiments.","[Friedl, Andreas; Ring, Patrick; Schmidt, Ulrich] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Friedl, Andreas; Schmidt, Ulrich] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Ring, Patrick] Univ Kiel, Dept Psychol, Kiel, Germany; [Schmidt, Ulrich] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; University of Kiel; University of Johannesburg,"Friedl, A (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.;Friedl, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Kiel, Germany.",andreas.friedl@ifw-kiel.de,"Ring, Patrick/K-6881-2019; Ring, Patrick/ABB-6675-2021","Ring, Patrick/0000-0002-2214-3139;",,,,,35,3,4,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2017,82.0,2,,,,,211,219,,10.1007/s11238-016-9565-9,0.0,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EL2BL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000394425000003,0

Analysis of the data reveals a new form of hyper flexible and precarious work that is labelled neo-villeiny in this article. Neo-villeiny is characterized by four features: bondage to the organization; payment of rent to the organization; no guarantee of any income; and extensive unpaid and speculative work that is highly beneficial to the organization. The neo-villeiny of the self-employed personal trainer offers the fitness centre all of the benefits associated with hyper flexible work, but also mitigates the detrimental outcomes associated with precarious work.

This paper uses a novel ecological index of malaria transmission to study the effect of child mortality on fertility. We find that temporal variation in the ecology of the disease is well-correlated to mortality, and pernicious malaria conditions lead to higher fertility rates. We then argue that most of this effect occurs through child mortality, and estimate the effect of child mortality changes on fertility. Our findings add to the literature on disease and fertility, and contribute to the suggestive evidence that child mortality reductions have a causal effect on fertility changes.

This study identifies and characterizes current and potential users of public transport in Sweden and identifies the most important determinants of travel satisfaction with Public Transport services for each segment of travelers. In addition, it investigates the changes over time of attribute importance among the different segments and the inter-segment geographical variation of overall satisfaction. The analysis is based on a dataset of almost half a million records. Travelers were clustered based on their socio-demographics, travel patterns and accessibility measures to enable the analysis of determinants of satisfaction for different market segments. The cluster analysis results with five segments of Swedish travelers include: (i) inactive travelers; (ii) long distance commuters; (iii) urban motorist commuters; (iv) rural motorist commuters and; (v) students. By contrasting satisfaction with the importance of each quality of service attribute, three key attributes that should be prioritized by stakeholders are identified: customer interface, operation, network and length of trip time. Interestingly, the results suggest an overall similarity in the importance of service attributes among traveler segments. Nevertheless, some noticeable differences could be observed. The quality of service attributes' importance levels reveal overall changes in appreciations and consumption goals over time. The more frequent public transport user segments are more satisfied across the board and are characterized by a more balanced distribution of attribute importance while rural motorist commuters are markedly dissatisfied with service operation attributes. This work can help authorities to tailor their policies to specific traveler groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that veto players can be amenable to new policy initiatives - in our case preferential trade agreements (PTAs) - but then choose to exert a strong influence on their contents. Drawing upon more than a dozen PTA-design variables for an expanded collection of postwar trade agreements, our quantitative tests reveal that veto players systematically shape what is included in, and excluded from, PTAs. Most notably, agreements concluded under greater veto-player constraints contain fewer liberalization commitments, weaker dispute settlement, and more opt-outs in the form of trade remedies. Our findings highlight domestic political actors as important determinants of international institutional design and show that veto players exert additional, and perhaps stronger, influence on what is proscribed in agreements, not just whether they are enacted in the first place.","[Allee, Todd] Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Elsig, Manfred] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Bern,"Allee, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Govt & Polit, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,"Elsig, Manfred/0000-0001-6950-108X",Swiss National Science Foundation's NCCR Trade Regulation,Swiss National Science Foundation's NCCR Trade Regulation,This work was financially supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation's NCCR Trade Regulation.,,65,13,16,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Penang is one of the major destinations in Malaysia. It's rich cultural heritage and golden sandy beaches are amongst the quality of Penang as a destination. Nevertheless, limited study was conducted investigating online tourism image of Penang in particular. Therefore, this study was conducted. This study used qualitative approach that combined QDA Miner 4.0 and Word Stat 7.1 software, which were used to analyze the textual content from 25 different OTD. The websites were classified under five sub-categories; Government tourism portal, news and media websites, travel agency websites, travel guide websites, and travelogue website. The finding suggests that each sub-category is unique to itself, and has its own focus and possibly target market. 'Malaysia', the top projected image generated from the study indicates Penang as a location rather than a destination. However, a few images that are also listed might suggest Georgetown, the capital of Penang is the World Heritage site. This research could bring awareness to local tourism marketers, by assisting them to improve Penang image projection. Several Penang major attractions and activities that are not related to heritage and food seem to be less discussed on the studied websites.

In parallel with the industry's growth worldwide, customer expectations are rising, while competition is intensifying, setting up additional challenges for tourism and hospitality organizations to distinguish themselves in service quality and overall performance. Taking the view that employees are one of the most important assets for tourism organizations, the current study is aimed at exploring the industry's professionals' cross-cultural communication competence as a potential source of competitive advantage. Based on a sample of 157 respondents employed in the tourism and hospitality sector, and 328 British and Irish tourists visiting the City of Pula and neighboring municipalities in the County of Istria, Croatia during the 2016 tourist preseason, our study examines the tourism professionals' cross-cultural communication competence as perceived by the professionals themselves, as well as by the tourists who participated in the survey. In particular, this study investigates the two dimensions of cross-cultural communication competence as identified by the authoresses: communicative effectiveness and intercultural sensitivity. The 12-items research instrument to examine the two dimensions was developed and adapted form the Cross-Cultural Communication Competence Model by Matveev et al. (2001). The results showed slight differences between the professionals' and tourists' perceptions of the two dimensions, demonstrating how tourists' expectations somewhat exceed professionals' self-perceived capabilities. Statistically significant differences in the perceptions of the two studied groups were, however, found for one item in each dimension. Our findings have important practical implications for the tourism sector: they may help professionals improve their working efficiency and advance their career prospects, and provide the employers with abetter understanding of customers' expectations when integrating cultural elements with communicative skills in ensuring proper further education for their employees, as well as provide a valuable tool in managing human resources and recruiting qualified personnel. The authoresses suggest it is crucial for the industry to take into account the potential impact of personnel's cross-cultural communication competence on both the service providers' success, and on the service recipients' satisfaction. Finally, they suggest ways of implementing strategies to successfully improve interactions in intercultural tourism settings.","[Bobanovic, Moira Kostic; Novak, Maja] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Novak, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",mnovak@unipu.hr,"Novak Lađarević, Maja/AAB-8731-2021; Kostić Bobanović, Moira/HMO-7246-2023","Novak Lađarević, Maja/0000-0001-8895-6952;",,,,,49,1,1,0,3,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

We integrate endogenous growth theory and technology-based activity analysis into a dynamic numerical general equilibrium model. Both market-based and policy-mandated nuclear phase-out are studied. Using data from the Swiss economy we find that the aggregate welfare loss of carbon policy is as large as 1.21% and that nuclear phase-out raises the loss to 1.58%. Nuclear phase-out has no significant effect on economic growth. Increased investment, induced innovation, and sectoral change are the reasons that the economic impact of nuclear phase-out and the trade-off between energy and climate policy are moderate, once the dynamics of an economy are taken into account. Optimal phase-out time for nuclear depends mainly on future cost escalation in the energy sector.","[Bretschger, Lucas] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Ctr Econ Res, Zurich, Switzerland; [Zhang, Lin] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; City University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",l.zhang@cityu.edu.hk,"Zhang, Lin/O-5851-2017","Zhang, Lin/0000-0002-5945-5451",,,,,48,11,11,1,23,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JAN,2017,38.0,1,,,,,167,194,,10.5547/01956574.38.1.lbre,0.0,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EF8XK,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000390615100007,0

However, there is spatial heterogeneity in the impact of environmental regulations on FDI, wherein the results of the threshold effect in eastern regions are similar to those of the whole country.

However, thus far, Russia's compliance record with its WTO commitments has been mixed, and WTO membership has given Russia limited economic benefits and few political gains. In analyzing why, this article uses neoclassical realism as a framework for assessing Russia's behavior in WTO trade disputes and negotiations. During Russia's economic recession, the regime of President Vladimir Putin advanced protectionist policies and maintained statist control over the heights of the economy, while using rhetorical strategies to counter accusations from Western powers that Russia had violated WTO norms. Russia's struggling economy weakened its status as a global economic power, and it was viewed as unqualified to sit among the core group of negotiators in the WTO.","[Jordan, Pamela A.] Southern New Hampshire Univ, Fac Social Sci, Manchester, NH 03106 USA",,"Jordan, PA (通讯作者)，Southern New Hampshire Univ, Fac Social Sci, Manchester, NH 03106 USA.",p.jordan@snhu.edu,,,,,,,92,4,4,2,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Interestingly, this motivational force seems without any commitment, as long as the citizens does not have to declare the income to tax authorities due to taxes or social security contributions too high. The size and impact of these choices or motivations vary from one country to another, depending on the degree of education, the complexity of tax laws, the standard of living and the state's development capacity. That is precisely why the tax morality represents the first step in achieving a coherent and effective image of the taxpayer's tax behaviour. Without a detailed analysis of the factors that influence the degree of tax morality, we can't talk about voluntary compliance. In fact, tax compliance means the taxpayer's ability to understand fiscal policy mechanisms, to adapt to the State needs, and to voluntarily pay for its obligations. The appropriate behavior of the taxpayer must represent a desideratum of voluntary compliance, without which the State can no longer sustain a long term sustainable growth and ensuring the well-being of the population. The modernization of tax authorities must start and put the relationship with its taxpayers first, as the current society is becoming more digitized, leaving behind the traditional concepts of taxman and the long-held mentality that the tax authorities holds monopoly. Their control over citizens no longer takes place in the present, when most societies are geared towards providing quality services, based on experience gained over time and the opportunity to maintain the high standards.","[Madalina, Caraus; Mirela, Calugareanu; Tatiana, Stanese Ioana] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania; [Dragos, Ungureanu Mihai] Spiru Haret Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Spiru Haret University,"Madalina, C (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Sibiu, Romania.",Mada.caraus@gmail.com; Mirelacalugareanu@gmail.com; Tatiana@stanese.ro; Dragos.ungureanu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,165,174,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300018,0

We contend here that the core complexity of state agency and state power needs to be much more carefully understood in GVC and related debates, as a basis on which the governance of the evolving GVC world can be properly theorised as revolving around the inseparability of economic and political power. We advance a framework for understanding the role of politics and states in the construction and maintenance of a GVC world, using a three-fold typology of facilitative, regulatory and distributive forms of governance, and propose a notion of 'outsourcing governance' as an attempt to capture the ways in which states purposefully, through active political agency, have engaged in a process of delegating a variety of governance functions and authority to private actors.

A higher degree of flexibility was seen as a condition for rising of the growth, productivity and the enablement of the reallocation of jobs towards developing sectors with positive macroeconomic effects manifested by the growth in employment. Globalisation, technological change, demographic development, new information and communication technologies as well as large-scale social changes are generally considered to be the factors that explain the need to implement labour market reforms in the European Union. Since the early 1990s, increased flexibility of the labour market has become a part of the OECD recommendations concerning its strategy of employment growth. Flexibilization of labour markets is one of the key objectives for EU countries on the national and international level in the European Employment Strategy. The use of various measures for a more flexible labour market is considered to be an integral part of the modernization of labour markets, which effectively contribute to solving the current problems, with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups in the labour market. Flexicurity, as a strategy with the aim of jointly enhancing flexibility and security for the benefit of both parties in an employment relationship, was identified as one of the key objectives in advancing European labour markets in the context of the European Employment and the Lisbon Strategy. Adaptation to the changing conditions requires a flexible labour market combined with a certain level of security, which suits both employees and employers. Overall, the effects of globalisation show an increasing tendency of strengthening the flexicurity phenomenon for all workers in the EU, and this is also due to the sustainability of social protection systems. The contribution aims to identify the importance of flexibility including its various forms, as well as the importance of flexicurity of European labour markets within the context of ongoing changes in society.","[Rievajova, Eva] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Privara, Andrej] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dept Social Dev & Labour, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava,"Rievajova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",eva.rievajova@euba.sk; andy.privara@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,260,266,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000026,0

Managing product variety is a great challenge that manufacturers have to address to be successful. The associated complexity makes product variety difficult to manage, although adequate management is essential to guarantee revenue and profit. Before making the decision to broaden the product range, it is recommended to check whether the profit of product variety outweighs the effort. There is also the question regarding the optimal product variety that enables the maximum net benefit for the manufacturer. Moreover, decisions on product variety are far-reaching due to their interconnectivity to almost all other managerial decisions. If manufacturers were capable to understand and oversee all the drivers and enablers of product variety, they would be in a better position to weigh all the pros and cons before arranging changes in the product portfolio. How to support decision-makers in this process? The approach presented in this paper addresses challenges by creating a unified framework of the factors impacting product variety. This is achieved by systematically studying management literature and integrating the found mechanism in a conceptual cause-effect model created with Garp3 - a workbench which offers meaningful visualization and simulation opportunities. After selecting appropriate literature, the relevant concepts are represented in a knowledge graph using the Garp3 software. The consequent preparation of the concepts enables deliberate decisions on wordings (types), number of model fragments, and level of abstraction. The simulation tool works without any numerical information, but still enables users to start from different scenarios (e.g. manufacturer with a single product starts to increase its portfolio) and observe the behavior of the system and its underpinning explanation in terms of cause-effect relationships.","[Schabasser, Christina; Bredeweg, Bert] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Schabasser, C (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",christina.schabasser@live.at; b.bredeweg@uva.nl,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,507,514,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300050,0

Parametric last-digit frequency tests (a multivariate extension of last-digit tests) are employed to analyze fraud heterogeneity during the vote count stage. We also utilize author-assembled data harvested from the election monitoring non-governmental organization Golos's regional reports of misconduct to explore the co-variance of lastdigit fraud with other irregularities extending beyond the falsification of electoral records. We find that while higher regional education levels positively correlate with exposure of electoral malpractice, an educated populace may also incentivize regional officials to channel misconduct toward election-day fraud -perhaps because pre-electoral manipulations would be more visible to the public than tampering with ballots, and thus, more vulnerable to exposure. Furthermore, last-digit fraud is associated with (a) fake turnout counts; (b) fake votes disproportionally benefitting Putin; and (c) vote  re-distribution whereby votes cast for some candidates are systematically miscounted. We also find that citizen reports of election-day misconduct are positively correlated with our region-specific last-digit fraud measures. The results indicate that reports by independent observers of subnational electoral irregularities could be employed as reasonably reliable indicators of fraud, and could be utilized alongside other data to ascertain the incidence of misconduct in Russia and other settings.","[Skovoroda, Rodion] Univ Nottingham, Sch Business, Nottingham, England; [Lankina, Tomila] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London, England",University of Nottingham; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lankina, T (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, London, England.",t.lankina@lse.ac.uk,"Lankina, Tomila/AAP-5337-2020","Lankina, Tomila/0000-0002-8303-1747; Skovoroda, Rodion/0000-0002-1706-3011",British Academy (Mid-career fellowship); London school of economics and political science (CIDS),British Academy (Mid-career fellowship); London school of economics and political science (CIDS),This work was supported by British Academy (Mid-career fellowship) and London school of economics and political science (CIDS).,,67,22,23,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Important strands within the literature have emphasised the role of ideas and of central bank institutions in the diffusion process, although not placing ultimate explanatory weight on central bankers' actions and activities in order to explain differences in patterns of diffusion between countries. Norway represents an outlier in the diffusion process, not reforming its central bank legislation until 2003 - six years later than the United Kingdom. The article explores this late shift to CBI by building on an ideational approach, investigating whether Norwegian central bankers' translation strategies and actions adds more explanatory value than the mainly structural arguments dominating the existing diffusion literature. The article finds that central bank action and changing strategies actually helps us a great deal explaining why Norwegian authorities chose to alter central bank legislation when they did.","[Thomassen, Eivind] Univ Oslo, Dept Archaeol Conservat & Hist, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Thomassen, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Archaeol Conservat & Hist, Oslo, Norway.",eivind.thomassen@iakh.uio.no,,,,,,,57,4,4,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In this paper, it is suggested that the only accurate part of this statement relates to the century in which Henry Sidgwick lived. It is argued that modern readers lack sensitivity to questions of faith and religiosity that were commonplace in the later nineteenth century, and that to have doubts in an Anglican faith did not necessarily imply any weakening of Christian faith. Furthermore, a misreading of Sidgwick as a moral philosopher in the modern sense neglects Sidgwick's central role in a Moral Sciences Tripos that included logic and political economy. Only after Marshall extracted political economy and political science from the Moral Sciences Tripos in 1903 did that Tripos become the foundation for a new Philosophy Tripos, and it is an error to read that later configuration back into the Tripos that Sidgwick led from 1883 to 1900.",,,,tess@dircon.co.uk,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Farmers of this new DIY economy, who use the tools and means of the information age for problem solving, best practice sharing, or implementing new business models from the rise of the collaborative consumption can be called cyber farmers. To solve problems in real life we look for information, knowledge in many ways by formal, informal learning, experience sharing. The wide spread of information technology, social media globally has a significant impact on the knowledge sharing, experience mining. The knowledge gathered from the available sources over the internet is accidental also the application of this knowledge locally in a global environment raises many questions. Nicholas Carr (2016) in one of his blogs talks about the illusion of knowledge, how the internet is making us shallow, but at the same time giving us the illusion that our knowledge is deep. In today's environment with around 8000 disciplines, by specializing in one or couple would mean to ignore more than 7990 (Nicolescu, 2002). This leads to the need of transdisciplinary approach, which would mean to not only look at certain problems from one or more disciplines, but go beyond the disciplines. In the process to mind, validate the knowledge available globally the following have to be considered (1) consistency of the accessible knowledge; this relates to the notion of internal validity, (2) relevance of the consistent knowledge; this relates to the notion of construct validity and (3) applicability of the relevant knowledge; this relates to the notion of external validity. The aim of this paper is to show a model for cyber farmers to help their learning process in the DIY economy.","[Varga, Eniko] Szechenyi Istvan Univ Gyor, SzEEDs Doctoral Program, Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Varga, E (通讯作者)，Szechenyi Istvan Univ Gyor, SzEEDs Doctoral Program, Gyor, Hungary.",vargaeniko.szeeds@gmail.com,"Varga, Eniko/AAH-2119-2020",,,,,,12,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,437,442,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8SX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428763000044,0

The paper applies extreme bounds analysis on a panel of countries to test the robustness of 43 variables in capturing varying financial crises. At a stricter bound and keeping the growth rate of real gross domestic product per capita constant, regulation emerges as the most indispensable factor for the control of episodes of financial crises. Characterizing the potential dynamic relationship among the variables of interest, growth in real gross domestic product per capita, regulation, remittance, global stock volatility, institutional quality, and export and import of goods and services robustly relate with financial crises. While these variables are important, in recent times and under a coefficient normality assumption, more variables emerge as robust determinants of financial crises.

Yet our understanding of the broader dynamics of IO policy-making is limited. This article offers the first comparative analysis of macro patterns in IO policy-making. Theoretically, we draw on punctuated equilibrium theory to develop hypotheses about stability and change in the orientation of IO policy agendas. Empirically, we examine novel data on the policy output of five general-purpose IOs between 1980 and 2015, combining statistical analysis and comparative case illustrations. The analysis yields two central results. First, the policy agendas of all five IOs display patterns of punctuated equilibria, with longer periods of stability interrupted by shorter periods of dramatic change. Second, the level of institutional friction in decision-making contributes to variation in punctuations across IOs and within IOs over time. The results suggest four broader implications: (1) punctuated equilibrium theory applies to a broader empirical domain than previously thought; (2) patterns of change in IOs are more complex than conventionally expected; (3) institutional friction matters for IOs' responsiveness to societal demands and problem pressures; and (4) deeper integration of punctuated equilibrium theory into the study of IOs can pave the way for a promising IR research agenda.","[Lundgren, Magnus; Tallberg, Jonas] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Squatrito, Theresa] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway",Stockholm University; University of Oslo,"Lundgren, M (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.lundgren@statsvet.su.se; theresa.squatrito@jus.uio.no; jonas.tallberg@statsvet.su.se,"Lundgren, Magnus/AFJ-8877-2022","Lundgren, Magnus/0000-0002-9961-3645",Swedish Research Council; Norwegian Research Council,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"Earlier versions of this article were presented at the 2016 Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, the 2016 General Conference of the European Consortium for Political Research, the 2017 Annual Conference of Political Economy of International Organizations, the 2017 Annual Conference of the Midwest Political Science Association, and the 2017 Comparative Agendas Project Conference, and at the workshop on the Empowerment of International Organizations at Technical University of Munich in 2016.

Using China's Global Investment Data from 2005 to 2015 provided by the Heritage Foundation, we find that a country attracts more Chinese OFDI when it rotates onto the council.

Studies have shown the advantages and disadvantages of each design in terms of safety, mobility, environment, and enforcement, among other factors. With a focus on improving the operational performance of HOV facilities, this paper proposes a new design called partially limited access control where the continuous access is mostly designated along the freeway to achieve higher travel speed while buffers between the HOV lane(s) and the adjacent GP lanes are strategically placed on selected freeway segments to accommodate higher throughput on those segments. The placement of buffers primarily aims to reduce the impact of HOV cross-weave flow on the capacity of GP lanes. In this research paper, a methodology for determining the location and length of buffers in the partially limited access control has been developed. A case study is performed along a 13-mile section of HOV facility on SR-210 E in Southern California, which is coded and evaluated in traffic microsimulation. The results show that the partially limited access control increases the throughput (represented by total vehicle miles traveled or VMT) and decreases the delay (represented by total vehicle hours traveled or VHT) of the freeway as compared with either the limited access or continuous access control. As a result, the overall efficiency (represented by average travel speed calculated as VMT/VHT) of the freeway with partially limited access HOV facility is 21% and 6% higher than that of the freeway with limited access and continuous access HOV facility, respectively, under the baseline traffic demand.","[Shan, Xiaonian] Hohai Univ, Coll Civil & Transportat Engn, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hao, Peng; Boriboonsomsin, Kanok; Wu, Guoyuan; Barth, Matthew] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Environm Res & Technol, 1084 Columbia Ave, Riverside, CA 92507 USA; [Chen, Xiaohong] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Rd Traff Engn, 4800 Caoan Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China",Hohai University; University of California System; University of California Riverside; Tongji University,"Shan, XN (通讯作者)，Hohai Univ, Coll Civil & Transportat Engn, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",shanxiaonian@126.com; haop@cert.ucr.edu; kanok@cert.ucr.edu; gywu@cert.ucr.edu; barth@ece.ucr.edu; chenxh@tongji.edu.cn,"chen, xia/GYR-3948-2022; chen, xia/GXM-5435-2022; chen, xin/IQW-3432-2023; chen, xi/GXH-3653-2022; Hao, Peng/AAE-8344-2022; Wu, Guoyuan/AAJ-8804-2020; Chen, Xiao/JBJ-7561-2023","Hao, Peng/0000-0001-5864-7358; Chen, Xiao/0000-0002-9797-8384; Barth, Matthew/0000-0002-4735-5859",California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) [65A0544],California Department of Transportation (Caltrans),This research is supported by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) under contract no. 65A0544.

Even allowing for attenuation bias because of actual appreciation does not equal expected appreciation, evidence for the DDM is not strong. This research has included an implicit assumption that risks associated with housing investment are common across housing markets. In addition, many previous tests have used the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Rent Index to construct the CAP rate although recent research by Ambrose et al. (2015) has questioned this data. The American Housing Survey is used to construct estimates of the CAP rate which is then combined with standard appreciation measures to estimate total return and its variance over time for larger Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) in the U.S. Using statistically constructed estimates of the CAP rate and adding variance in total return to conduct tests of the DDM produces far stronger results than those obtained in previous studies of a cross section of cities in the U.S. But, when the BLS Rent Index is used to measure CAP rates and risk, the results are not consistent with DDM.","[Bao, Ge] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100052, Peoples R China; [Feng, Guoliang] China Investment Corp, New Poly Plaza 19fl, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Feng, GL (通讯作者)，China Investment Corp, New Poly Plaza 19fl, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China.",baoge@uibe.edu.cn; fenggl@china-inv.cn,,,the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities in University of International Business and Economics [16QN03],the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities in University of International Business and Economics,This research is supported by the Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities in University of International Business and Economics (16QN03).

Following the interactions-based model of discrete choices in Lee et al.

Furthermore, the estimated model can be used to identify the power neighbor through whom a foreclosure prevention policy can generate the largest impact on a neighborhood. Compared to other homeowners, the power neighbor on average has less neighbors that defaulted in the past, a less risky loan, a smaller payment size, a higher credit score, and a more central location in the neighborhood.","[Chomsisengphet, Souphala] Off Comptroller Currency, Washington, DC USA; [Liu, Xiaodong] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kiefer, Hua] Fed Deposit Insurance Corp, Washington, DC USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),"Liu, XD (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Souphala.Chomsisengphet@occ.treas.gov; HKiefer@fdic.gov; Xiaodong.Liu@colorado.edu,"Chen, Lingling/JCD-4631-2023; liu, xiao/HKE-9880-2023; QI, LIU/IQR-4870-2023; LIU, YU/HTR-1607-2023; yang, liu/HTN-9175-2023; liu, xiao/HMD-7454-2023",,,,,,31,3,3,2,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0166-0462,1879-2308,,REG SCI URBAN ECON,Reg.

To control for biases due to self-selection, we conducted a randomised controlled trial and invited randomly selected firms to participate in 1-day seminars. Because only some of the invited firms participated in the seminars, we employ an instrumental variable approach in which the dummy variable for a random invitation is used as an instrument for quantifying the effects of participation. We find that seminar participants were more likely to sense the difficulties of the export procedures and were, on average, unlikely to start exporting in the short run. However, the seminars encouraged large firms, which possibly embody higher productivity and absorptive capacity, to start exporting shortly after the seminars. This effect was not sustained in the long term without additional stimuli. We have also identified spillover effects of participants on non-participants through informal information networks within the cluster. Overall, the results suggest that the provision of information about export is useful only to adequately productive larger firms with a sufficient absorptive capacity.","[Kim, Yu Ri] Sophia Univ, Sophia Inst Human Secur, Tokyo, Japan; [Todo, Yasuyuki] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Shimamoto, Daichi] Waseda Univ, Waseda Inst Polit Econ, Tokyo, Japan; [Matous, Petr] Univ Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Sophia University; Waseda University; Waseda University; University of Sydney,"Kim, YR (通讯作者)，Sophia Univ, Sophia Inst Human Secur, Tokyo, Japan.",,,"Kim, Yu Ri/0000-0003-3782-2043; Todo, Yasuyuki/0000-0002-3201-4488; Matous, Petr/0000-0002-6140-6843",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Waseda University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101003] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Waseda University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Waseda University,,44,8,9,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,2954,2982,,10.1111/twec.12658,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200006,0

We then use equations derived from this model, in conjunction with alternative functional forms for trade costs, to estimate the effects of terrorism on bilateral air passenger service flows from 58 source countries to 26 destination countries during 2000-14. An additional small-scale terrorist incident in the origin country and destination country together results in a reduction in bilateral air passenger travel by, at least, 1.3% and 0.81%, respectively, for pairs of countries located 1,000 and 2,000 km or less apart. The adverse impact of transnational terrorism is approximately five times larger. Terrorism adversely impacts bilateral air passenger travel both by reducing national output and especially by increasing psychological distress. Last but not the least, international air passenger travel is found to be extremely sensitive to fatal terrorist attacks and terrorist attacks on targets such as airports, travel or tourists.","[Mitra, Devashish] Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Pham, Cong S.] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Burwood, Vic, Australia; [Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA",Syracuse University; Deakin University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Mitra, D (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Dept Econ, Maxwell Sch Citizenship & Publ Affairs, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",,"Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/I-5739-2016","Bandyopadhyay, Subhayu/0000-0003-1626-6543",,,,,35,20,21,6,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,NOV,2018,41.0,11,,,,,2852,2882,,10.1111/twec.12680,0.0,,,31,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,HA3DC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000450129200001,0

Sustainable progress in energy efficiency achievement is beneficial to energy security and the achievement of the Paris Agreement. This article combines the stochastic frontier method with the panel Markov-switching regression to model energy efficiency transitions. The estimated energy efficiency scores show significant regional and provincial heterogeneity. Also, while human capital development, urbanization, and foreign direct investment promote energy efficiency, price and income per capita reduce it. The transition probabilities indicate that the high energy-efficient state is less sustainable, and the movement towards the frontier seems less persistent than movement from the frontier. Thus, it appears that China is not making sustainable progress in energy efficiency. The unsustainable nature of the high energy-efficient state suggests that in China, there are weak energy efficiency efforts and energy efficiency policies lack robustness.","[Zhang, Lin; Adom, Philip Kofi] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",l.zhang@cityu.edu.hk; adomonline@yahoo.co.uk,"Zhang, Lin/O-5851-2017; ADOM, Prof. PHILIP KOFI/K-4651-2017","Zhang, Lin/0000-0002-5945-5451; ADOM, Prof. PHILIP KOFI/0000-0001-8135-7260","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [CityU 21603917]; City University of Hong Kong [7200527]","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong)","This article benefited from the useful comments of five anonymous reviewers and the editor.

Vehicle transaction decision processes are simulated within an agent-based integrated Transport Land Use and Energy (HIE) modeling system. The influence of life-stage transitions and interactions of decisions at different domains along the life-time is accommodated as lead and lag events within the micro-behavioral models and computational procedures of iTLE. For example, trade and disposal decisions are found to be positively influenced by residential move as 1-year lead and 2-year lead events respectively. The simulation starts by generating baseline information for 2006 and runs for 15 years from 2007 to 2021 for Halifax, Canada. The validation results suggest that the majority of the predicted vehicle ownership levels lie within a few percentage points from the observed population. For instance, zero vehicle ownership is under-represented by 1% only. In terms of microsimulation results, a higher proportion of zero vehicle ownership households is predicted in the Halifax urban core. Households with a higher vehicle ownership level are predicted to reside towards the suburban areas. For vehicle transaction type, a higher proportion of first vehicle purchase is predicted to include lower income younger population. In 2021, the average vehicle per household member is predicted to be 0.72. Around 75% of the households are predicted to own at least one vehicle per household member. At the neighborhood-level, the median value of average vehicle ownership per household is predicted to increase to 1.41 in 2021 from 1.37 in 2007. In summary, this paper offers interesting insights on the spatio-temporal evolution of vehicle ownership and transaction pattern, which will assist in testing alternative transport and land use policies.","[Fatmi, Mahmudur Rahman] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, Room D215,D Bldg,1360 Barrington St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Habib, Muhammad Ahsanul] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Planning, Room B105,B Bldg,1360 Barrington St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Habib, Muhammad Ahsanul] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, Room B105,B Bldg,1360 Barrington St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University; Dalhousie University,"Habib, MA (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Sch Planning, Room B105,B Bldg,1360 Barrington St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.;Habib, MA (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Civil & Resource Engn, Room B105,B Bldg,1360 Barrington St,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",mahmudur.fatmi@dal.ca; ahsan.habib@dal.ca,,"Habib, Muhammad Ahsanul/0000-0003-1461-9552",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) - Discovery Grant; Nova Scotia Department of Energy,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) - Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Nova Scotia Department of Energy,The authors would like to thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) - Discovery Grant and the Nova Scotia Department of Energy for their financial support.

This includes 'smart specialization' in which regions are deliberately specialized and connected following technological relatedness, 'gatekeepers' in which there are pipelines between dense regional networks, and a 'regional mix' of knowledge that allows sustained 'branching'. We develop and use an agent-based model to study the conjecture that, to stimulate (supra)regional innovativeness, social planners need to consider both, in conjunction, the mix of technological knowledge in regions and the (inter)regional innovation network topology. We use this agent-based model to evaluate the performance of and study the internal mechanisms of these newpolicy paradigms in a variety of scenarios. To increase the external validity of our findings, we calibrate the knowledge graph searched by the agents in our model to the OECD patent database. We confirm that access to related variety is important, yet that, on top of that, access to incidentally related knowledge is crucial to prevent high-level lock-in and ensure long term technological progress. Moreover, we find that networks with regional gatekeepers are particularly innovative, because these gatekeepers form 'knowledge hubs', create short paths to potential partners, and enlarge the total pool of knowledge. In case agents have few relationships, we find exceptionally high performance for the gatekeeper network in combination with regional diversification. The smart specialization network is a solid second option, although it lacks access to incidentally related knowledge and thus will ultimately fall behind whenever agents have relatively few relationships. The study elaborates on specific scenarios to reveal intricacies in the relationship between knowledge distribution, network topology, and the structure of interrelationships between knowledge fields.","[Vermeulen, Ben; Pyka, Andreas] Hohenheim Univ, Inst Econ, Chair Innovat Econ, Wollgrasweg 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany; [Vermeulen, Ben] Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, Den Dolech 2,POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands",University Hohenheim; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Vermeulen, B (通讯作者)，Hohenheim Univ, Inst Econ, Chair Innovat Econ, Wollgrasweg 23, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.;Vermeulen, B (通讯作者)，Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, Den Dolech 2,POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.",b.vermeulen@uni-hohenheim.de,"Pyka, Andreas/IST-6329-2023","Pyka, Andreas/0000-0001-6207-6690; Vermeulen, Ben/0000-0001-6563-2568",DACH research program Innovation Networks for Regional Development - German science foundation DFG [PY 70/8-1]; Dutch science foundation NWO [458-03-112]; MOST-DAAD Germany-Taiwan PPP [57219050],DACH research program Innovation Networks for Regional Development - German science foundation DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Dutch science foundation NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); MOST-DAAD Germany-Taiwan PPP,"This work was realized with financial support of the DACH research program Innovation Networks for Regional Development funded by the German science foundation DFG, Grant PY 70/8-1, extending work done within the Netwerken van netwerken program funded by the Dutch science foundation NWO, Grant 458-03-112.

Results indicate high levels of usage and approval of the shoes by children in the treatment group, and time diaries show modest evidence that the donated shoes allocated children's time toward outdoor activities. Difference-in-difference and ANCOVA estimates find generally insignificant impacts on overall health, foot health, and self-esteem but small positive impacts on school attendance for boys. Children receiving the shoes were significantly more likely to state that outsiders should provide for the needs of their family. Thus, in a context where most children already own at least one pair of shoes, the overall impact of the shoe donation program appears to be negligible, illustrating the importance of more careful targeting of in-kind donation programs.","[Wydick, Bruce; Katz, Elizabeth] Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA; [Wydick, Bruce] Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Calvo, Flor] 3Ie, Washington, DC USA; [Gutierrez, Felipe] Vet Affairs Hlth Care Syst, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Gutierrez, Felipe] Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Phoenix, AZ USA",University of San Francisco; University of Notre Dame; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); University of Arizona,"Wydick, B (通讯作者)，Univ San Francisco, Dept Econ, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.;Wydick, B (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Kellogg Inst Int Studies, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",wydick@usfca.edu; egkatz@usfca.edu; facalvo@dons.usfca.edu; felipe.gutierrez@va.gov; bjanet0@gmail.com,,,USF Faculty Development Fund; TOMS Shoes,USF Faculty Development Fund; TOMS Shoes,"Bruce Wydick (corresponding author) is a professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco and Research Affiliate, Kellogg Institute of International Studies, University of Notre Dame; his email address is wydick@usfca.edu.Elizabeth Katz is an associate professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco; her email address is egkatz@usfca.edu.Flor Calvo is a research assistant at 3ie in Washington, DC; her email address is facalvo@dons.usfca.edu.Felipe Gutierrez is a physician with the Veterans Affairs Health Care System and the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, Arizona; his email address isfelipe.gutierrez@va.gov.Brendan Janet is an independent field research consultant; his email address is bjanet0@gmail.com.We would like to thank Zachary Intemann, Nicole Shevloff, and the directors and staff of World Vision El Salvador for extensive help during field research and David McKenzie, Robert Jensen, and Yaniv Stopnitsky for helpful comments.

We argue that the effect of such commitments depends on the degree of leverage held by one partner over the other. In a comprehensive analysis of the European Union's (EU's) relations with developing countries, we find that human rights clauses are conditionally effective; they are associated with improved political freedom and physical integrity rights only in countries that are more heavily dependent on EU aid. An in-depth look at the EU's enforcement of its human rights clause in the African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) group reveals that the Union most often responds to violations of political rights-particularly coups and flawed elections-and that enforcement is indeed a more powerful catalyst for change in highly aid-dependent states. Alternative explanations-that the impact of the human rights clause depends on legalization, the country's strategic importance, NGO activity, or domestic institutions-find little support.","[Donno, Daniela; Neureiter, Michael] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, 4600 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Donno, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Polit Sci, 4600 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",donno@pitt.edu; min24@pitt.edu,,"Neureiter, Michael/0000-0002-2800-229X",,,,,100,30,31,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The effects of such reforms on employment across industries as a function of their use of services as intermediate inputs are theoretically ambiguous and remain largely understudied. This paper uses sector-level data for 24 transition economies for the 1990-2012 period to assess the impacts of services policy reforms on downstream manufacturing employment. We find a negative effect of services reforms on manufacturing sector employment. This is mostly associated with the process of transition to a market-based economy. Controlling for transition-specific dynamics, the data suggest a neutral effect of progress towards adopting best practice policies for upstream services on employment in downstream manufacturing. Furthermore, in line with the extant literature, we confirm that services policy reforms enhance productivity of downstream manufacturing industries. Finally, we find that the negative effects on downstream employment are mitigated in countries with better economic governance and human capital.","[Fiorini, Matteo; Hoekman, Bernard] EUI, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Global Governance Programme, Fiesole, Italy; [Hoekman, Bernard] CEPR, Fiesole, Italy; [Malgouyres, Clement] Paris Sch Econ, Inst Polit Publ, Paris, France; [Malgouyres, Clement] CREST, Paris, France",European University Institute; Paris School of Economics,"Fiorini, M (通讯作者)，EUI, Robert Schuman Ctr Adv Studies, Global Governance Programme, Fiesole, Italy.",,,"Hoekman, Bernard/0000-0002-6839-7142",,,,,52,2,2,5,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2018,41.0,9,,,,,2320,2348,,10.1111/twec.12710,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GS6NI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000443813500002,0

They are often characterized as inefficient because they are a burden to patients without generating any gains for providers. There is an ongoing debate in Germany regarding the preferential treatment given to private health insurance (PHI) holders while statutory health insurance (SHI) holders face continuously increasing waiting times. In order to tackle this problem in the outpatient sector, Germany initiated a reform in 2015 which was aimed at providing SHI holders with appointments within an acceptable time frame. We exploit longitudinal experimental data to examine waiting times for six elective outpatient treatments in Germany for PHI and SHI holders before and after the reform. We find a considerable difference in waiting times favoring private patients. For SHI holders, waiting times remained stable over time (27.5 days in 2014, 30.7 days in 2016, Delta 3.2 days, p-value = 0.889) while PHI holders experienced a significant improvement (13.5 days in 2014; 7.8 days in 2016; Delta 5.7 days, p-value = 0.002). The results indicate that even after the reform there is still an unequal access to elective outpatient treatment depending on the patient's insurance status.","[Heinrich, Nils; Wuebker, Ansgar; Wuckel, Christiane] RWI Leibniz Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Wübker, A (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Wirtschaftsforsch, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, Essen, Germany.",nils.heinrich@rwi-essen.de; ansgar.wuebker@rwi-essen.de; christiane.wuckel@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,20,5,5,0,5,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The target population were women aged 15-49 in the capital cities of the nine states of the Northeast region of Brazil. We find that more educated women were less likely to report suffering from Zika (or its symptoms) and more likely to report having taken precaution against Zika, such as having used long and light-colored clothes, having used mosquito repellent or insecticides, having used mosquito protective screens or kept windows closed, and having dumped standing water where mosquitoes can breed. In addition, more educated women were more likely to report being informed about the association between Zika and microcephaly and to avoid pregnancy in the last 12 months.

Therefore, the current study first proposes to examine ICFS in the context of the restaurant industry. More importantly, this study also examines a moderating role of franchising to better explain ICFS, considering a major role of franchising in the restaurant industry, based on theories of pecking order, resource scarcity, and risk sharing. Findings of the current study deepens the understanding of ICFS via franchising, making meaningful contributions to not only to existing ICFS literature but also restaurant franchising literature.","[Choi, Serin] Korea Foodserv Ind Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Seoki] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Choi, Kyuwan] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Sun, Kyung-A] Temple Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Kyung Hee University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Sch Hospitality Management, 217 Mateer Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",leeseoki@psu.edu,"Lee, Seoki/AFK-7195-2022; Choi, Serin/AAX-1301-2021","Lee, Seoki/0000-0003-4720-9170;",,,,,72,19,20,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

This paper designs two sequential network formation games - a leadership game and a trade liberalisation game, to model this phenomenon and predict the equilibrium result. In the first game, we show how the incorporation of leadership affects the choices among different trading structures. Specifically, we show that the parallel trading blocs emerge as the equilibrium outcome only when there exists large loss from giving up leadership. In the second game, we describe how the globalisation is arrived and conduct numerical simulations to test our theoretical results. The predictions of the game are supported by the real-world data based on simulation results.","[Lin, Guijun; Pei, Jiansuo; Zhang, Jin] Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",University of International Business & Economics,"Lin, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Int Business & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,"Pei, Jiansuo/0000-0003-4360-8705",,,,,26,2,2,1,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,AUG,2018,41.0,8,,,SI,,2102,2128,,10.1111/twec.12474,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GQ1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441445000009,0

In contrast to previous studies, we distinguish between the average systematic risk of REITs and their asymmetric risk in the sense of a disproportionate likelihood of joint negative return clusters between REITs and the stock market. We find that REITs with low systematic risk are typically small, with low short-term momentum, low turnover, high growth opportunities and strong long-term momentum. Holding systematic risk constant, the main driving forces of asymmetric risk are leverage and, to some extent, short-term momentum. Specifically, we find that leverage has an asymmetric effect on REIT return dependence that outweighs the extent to which it increases the average sensitivity of REIT equity to market fluctuations, explaining the strong negative impact of leverage on firm performance especially during crisis periods that has been documented in recent empirical work.","[Alcock, Jamie] Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Steiner, Eva] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England",University of Sydney; University of Cambridge,"Steiner, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 9EP, England.",es434@cam.ac.uk,"Steiner, Eva/GQP-3194-2022; Alcock, Jamie/D-8850-2013","Alcock, Jamie/0000-0002-9194-2129",RERI; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance,RERI; Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance,"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from RERI.

Framing regards the way in which messages are worded concerning a particular object. In many consumer markets such as train journeys, firms frame messages in both positive and negative lights to persuade individuals to make purchase decisions (take intended journeys). We thus go beyond the literature's current focus on consumer-generated content (CGC), and bring into contention the important role that marketer-generated content (MGC) plays in shaping the social media-based consumer relationship management (CRM) strategies. Specifically, we analyze commuter tweets about 14 train operators, along with the companies' Twitter feeds. The findings, obtained using sentiment analysis tools, suggest that consumer sentiments only moderately impact travel performance, as measured by operator ratings, CPM (consumer performance measure; a measure based on travel incidents) and firm financial performance. On the other hand, it appears that train operators use tweets in relation to their services particularly well, while keeping customers engaged by listening to and learning from criticism, thus confirming the moderating role of their Twitter-based message framing strategies. Train operators should look to maintain their social media use practices, ensuring they are consistently applied within an overarching CRM framework, particularly in key 'pain' areas such as delay and cancellation.","[Nisar, Tahir M.] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Prabhakar, Guru] UWE, Fac Business & Law, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of Southampton; Solent University; University of West England,"Nisar, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",t.m.nisar@soton.ac.uk; Guru.Prabhakar@uwe.ac.uk,,"Prabhakar, Guru/0000-0001-5516-9434",,,,,74,31,35,4,64,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The parameters of the distribution of the maxima are estimated using two main statistical approaches based on extreme value models: Block-Maxima for different window lengths (daily, weekly and monthly) and Peak-over-Threshold. Our statistical model implies that the largest daily net debit position across participants exceeds roughly $1.5 billion once a year. Despite relying on extreme-value theory, the out of sample forecasts may still underestimate an actual exposure given the absence of observed data on defaults and financial stress in Canada.

An agent-based supply-side simulation is built to assess the performance of the proposed service in fifty-two scenarios with different fleet sizes and ridesharing preferences.

Precarity, as explored in this article, speaks to feelings of disempowerment, a profound sense of livelihood insecurity and a crisis of social reproduction that has resulted from workplace reorganization that marginalizes workers. The findings contribute to the study of precarity and masculinity by first unpacking how masculine identities are built around men's access to masculine service niches and their control over working conditions in these niches. It then shows how precariousness negates these male workers' sense of self by simultaneously taking away the control that distinguishes their work from factory employment and female-dominated service jobs; and undermining their capacity to meet the provider norm.","[Choi, Susanne Y.

Substantial experimental evidence suggests that human behavior may significantly deviate from the traditional expected utility maximization framework when faced with uncertainty. The problem of portfolio selection should be revised when the investor's preference is for CPT instead of expected utility theory. However, because of the complexity of the CPT function, little research has investigated the portfolio choice problem based on CPT. In this paper, we present an operational model for portfolio selection under CPT, and propose a real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) to solve the problem of portfolio choice. To overcome the limitations of RCGA and improve its performance, we introduce an adaptive method and propose a new selection operator. Computational results show that the proposed method is a rapid, effective, and stable genetic algorithm.","[Gong, Chao; Xu, Chunhui; Wang, Ji] Chiba Inst Technol, Chiba 2750016, Japan",Chiba Institute of Technology,"Gong, C (通讯作者)，Chiba Inst Technol, Chiba 2750016, Japan.",gongchao80@gmail.com,,,,,,,73,8,9,2,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Increasingly however, PTAs go far beyond liberalizing trade and investment flows. Especially controversial features included in most modern PTAs are environmental and labor standards. Do these standards affect business activity? If so, how do investors react to such non-trade issues in trade deals? The literature provides inconclusive findings about the impact of standards on foreign direct investment (FDI). Some contributors argue that strict standards decrease FDI, whilst others claim that environmental and labor protection increases productivity and, in consequence, inward investment. In all likelihood, the usage of aggregated FDI data, as is the case for most studies, causes confusion. I expect standards to influence investors' decisions - but heterogeneously across sectors. Environmental and labor standards should reduce FDI in polluting and low-skilled labor endowed industries, but increase investment in environmentally clean and high-skilled labor abundant sectors. Based on an original dataset of environmental and social standards in trade agreements and at the sector-level disaggregated US-FDI data, I find robust support for my argument. The paper provides a more nuanced picture on the standards and investment nexus: Standards have no uniform effect on multinationals.

An invasion of Phylloxera in the 1870s turned France from the world's leading exporter to a massive importer of wine and grapes. When French production recovered a combination of tariffs, safety regulations and quality standards were introduced to protect its French producers, causing dramatic changes in global wine and grape production and trade, including in Spain, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. Changes in wine regulations were caused by relative income and loss aversion factors in political economy. Tariffs were the preferred policy instruments as they directly restrict imports, bring in revenues, have low transaction costs and are preferred political instruments when there are information imperfections. Safety regulations and quality standards, including labelling and input prohibitions, reduce asymmetric information for consumers or undesirable externalities, and simultaneously protected domestic producers. Regulations were often targeted at imported products (wine and raisins) when tariffs were ineffective or constrained by institutions (such as on colonial wine). Hence, tariffs and quality regulations were jointly used in wine policy, both as complements and as substitutes in policy design.","[Meloni, Giulia; Swinnen, Johan] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Dept Econ, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium; [Meloni, Giulia; Swinnen, Johan] Ctr European Policy Studies, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Meloni, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Dept Econ, LICOS Ctr Inst & Econ Performance, Leuven, Belgium.;Meloni, G (通讯作者)，Ctr European Policy Studies, Leuven, Belgium.",,"Swinnen, Johan/AAC-1736-2021","Swinnen, Johan/0000-0002-8650-1978; Meloni, Giulia/0000-0002-3670-446X",KU Leuven (Methusalem Funding),KU Leuven (Methusalem Funding),This research was funded by the KU Leuven (Methusalem Funding),,134,7,7,2,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2018,41.0,6,,,,,1567,1595,,10.1111/twec.12655,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,GI6XL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000434646400005,0

The results presented here are perhaps even more compelling than those from prior research-indicating that a marginal increase in surf break quality leads to a relatively large increase-in this case more than 30% points-in the probability of observing fierce localism at surf breaks. The finding here of a larger marginal effect of surf break quality on localism in big-wave surfing than in traditional surfing supports the idea that big-wave surfing and traditional surfing represent distinct markets, characterized by different technologies and inherent dangers, such that localism at big-wave surf breaks exceeds that at traditional surf breaks in terms of ferocity, ceteris paribus. Although this study focuses specifically on the relationship between surf break quality and localism, our research highlights the importance of informal property rights protection of common-pool resources.","[Mixon, Franklin G., Jr.] Columbus State Univ, Ctr Econ Educ, 4225 Univ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907 USA; [Caudill, Steven B.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",University System of Georgia; Columbus State University; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Mixon, FG (通讯作者)，Columbus State Univ, Ctr Econ Educ, 4225 Univ Ave, Columbus, GA 31907 USA.",mixon_franklin@columbusstate.edu,,,,,,,26,4,4,0,9,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

With Virgin's purchase of Tiger Airways, a new duopoly between two airlines groups, each consisting of a full service airline (FSA) and a low cost carrier (LCC), emerged in the domestic market. In this study, we analyze the pricing dynamics among the four airlines of the duopoly groups, using panel data of online fares on the four most densely travelled routes in the domestic market. Our empirical results suggest that market segmentation allows the FSAs to charge significantly higher prices than the LCCs. Still, there is clear evidence of competition within and across the market segments, and the airlines' pricing responses are asymmetric. Virgin's price responses to Qantas and Jetstar are moderate. In comparison, more than one third of Qantas's fare changes and less than half of Jetstar's fare changes are in response to Virgin's fare adjustments in the previous period. Despite Qantas and Jetstar's large market share, after lengthy and costly price wars in previous years, the Qantas group still responds to Virgin as if competing with an entrant. All four carriers adopt revenue management practices, but the pricing of Qantas and Jetstar does not seem to be coordinated. Our study identifies a complex competition pattern between airline groups offering dual-brand services, and suggests that the Australian domestic market has not reached a stable equilibrium.","[Zhang, Yahua; Huang, Zhibin] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia; [Sampaio, Breno] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Econ, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Fu, Xiaowen] Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; University of Sydney,"Fu, XW (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Inst Transport & Logist Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",yahua.zhang@usq.edu.au; brenorsampaio@gmail.com; xiaowen.fu@sydney.edu.au; xiaohoangau@gmail.com,"sihite, janfry/B-2951-2015","Fu, Xiaowen/0000-0002-1925-046X; Zhang, Yahua/0000-0003-1522-3402; Sampaio, Breno/0000-0001-9740-9192",University of Sydney Business School,University of Sydney Business School,"For helpful comments we would like to thank two anonymous referees, guest editor of the special issue, and participants of the 2016 ATRS Conference.

A comprehensive cross-sectional data set of all Viennese Airbnb listings that were active between July 2015 and June 2016 is examined. Estimation results, which are obtained by cluster-robust ordinary least squares, show that Airbnb demand in Vienna is price-inelastic. Significant positive drivers include listing size, number of photos, and responsiveness of the host. Significant negative drivers include listing price, distance from the city center, and response time of the host. Implications for the traditional accommodation industry are that, on the one hand, it should better communicate its sought-after advantages (e.g. lower average minimum duration of stay). On the other hand, it should increase its offer of bigger and better equipped hotel rooms since hosting more than two guests at a time is one of the major benefits of Airbnb.","[Gunter, Ulrich; Oender, Irem] MODUL Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",,"Gunter, U (通讯作者)，MODUL Univ Vienna, Dept Tourism & Serv Management, Kahlenberg 1, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",ulrich.gunter@modul.ac.at,"Önder, Irem/AAC-6894-2020",,PKF hotelexperts; Vienna Tourist Board; Michaeler and Partner,PKF hotelexperts; Vienna Tourist Board; Michaeler and Partner,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would like to express their special gratitude to the consortium consisting of Michaeler and Partner, PKF hotelexperts, and the Vienna Tourist Board that kindly funded the purchase of the data used in the present study.",,48,113,115,2,85,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, the managing effluent quality should be a requirement because excess nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) can generate eutrophication problems in wetlands. In the Mediterranean area in general, wetlands are strongly vulnerable to eutrophication, which is why they are classified as sensitive areas. Our study uses a data set from 24 WWTPs, effluents of which are discharged to wetlands in the coast of Community of Valencia. We use the shadow prices methodology to quantify the environmental avoided costs and the environmental benefit (both in monetary units) of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in waste-water effluent.

Such data are extremely rare for the early post-war period when U.S. unions were at their peak. After describing patterns of selection into unions, we measure the union wage premium using unconditional quantile methods. The wage premium was larger at the bottom of the income distribution than at the middle or higher, larger for African Americans than for whites, and larger for those with low levels of education. Counterfactuals are consistent with the view that unions substantially narrowed urban wage inequality at mid-century. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

By adding a jump term in the geometric Brownian motion, the jump diffusion model can be used to describe abnormal changes in asset prices when there is a serious event in the market. In this paper, we propose an importance sampling algorithm to compute the portfolio's VaR under a multi-variate jump diffusion model. To be more precise, an efficient computational procedure is developed for estimating the portfolio loss probability for those assets with jump risks. And the tilting measure can be separated for the diffusion and the jump part under the assumption of independence. The simulation results show that the efficiency of importance sampling improves over the naive Monte Carlo simulation from 9 to 277 times under various situations.","[Fuh, Cheng-Der] Natl Cent Univ, Grad Inst Stat, Taoyuan, Taiwan; [Teng, Huei-Wen] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Informat Management & Finance, Hsinchu, Taiwan; [Wang, Ren-Her] Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",National Central University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Tamkang University,"Wang, RH (通讯作者)，Tamkang Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 151 Yingzhuan Rd, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan.",cdfuh@cc.ncu.edu.tw; venteng@gmail.com; 138230@mail.tku.edu.tw,"Teng, Huei-Wen/JXY-6447-2024","Teng, Huei-Wen/0000-0002-3651-9934","NSC [100-2118-M-008-002-MY3, 101-3113-P-008-005, 102-2118-M-008-002, 100-2410-H-032-024]","NSC(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","The research of the first author is supported in part by a Grant NSC 100-2118-M-008-002-MY3 and NSC 101-3113-P-008-005, the second author is supported in part by a Grant NSC 102-2118-M-008-002, and the third author is supported in part by a Grant NSC 100-2410-H-032-024.",,26,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Accounts Receivable Financing (ARF) is a type of trade credit that facilitates Korean interfirm transactions. Under ARF, the obligation to reimburse the bank is imputed to the seller if the buyer does not repay the loan to the bank. When the buyer confronts a liquidity shortage and fails to repay the trade credits, unfortunately, the shock is not limited to damage to only the seller because it propagates throughout the interfirm network. The shock is easily propagated because it is highly likely that the seller would also be unable to repay obligations to its own sellers. Since annual interfirm networks follow a scale-free network model, a single liquidity shock triggers a systemic risk. The insolvency of topologically more central buyer firms is shown to pose a higher potential risk to the financial market. In contrast, the firm size is not significantly related to potential risk. Therefore, firms with high centrality should be closely monitored to prevent insolvency crisis and propagation of the liquidity shock in the interfirm network.","[Kwon, Ohsung; Han, Seung Hun; Chung, Yang Hon; Lee, Duk Hee] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Technol Management, Coll Business, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Yun, Sung-guan] Bank Korea, Payment & Settlement Syst Dept, Seoul 04531, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Bank of Korea,"Lee, DH (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business & Technol Management, Coll Business, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.",dukheelee@kaist.ac.kr,"Han, Seung Hun/C-1783-2011; Kwon, Ohsung/AAP-7166-2021; Chung, Yanghon/C-1782-2011","Kwon, Ohsung/0000-0001-9678-6156; Kwon, Ohsung/0000-0003-2746-0747; Kwon, Ohsung/0000-0002-0968-1215; Chung, Yanghon/0000-0002-9964-7917",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [2014S1A3A2044459],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (2014S1A3A2044459).,,39,6,8,6,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In this paper, we study the relationship between the allocative efficiency of a market and the quantity of information about the realisation of the network structure that is available to its participants. We confine our study to thin buyer-seller markets with a few traders who can only trade together if they are linked. We assume that these links are independently formed with the same probability p, assembling a random bipartite graph A la ErdAs-R,nyi, and that traders behave strategically using linear markup strategies. Under these conditions we derive the equilibrium strategies, for complete and incomplete information about traders' valuations. We demonstrate that the quantity of information that is available about the network structure has a non-monotonic effect on efficiency. Moreover, the shape of this non-monotonicity flips when we switch from complete to incomplete information about traders' valuations. Under complete information about valuations it is recommended that traders receive either all the information about the network or nothing, and under incomplete information solely information about the existence of the own trading partners.","[van de Leur, Michiel] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [van de Leur, Michiel] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, CeNDEF, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; University of Amsterdam,"van de Leur, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.;van de Leur, M (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Econ, CeNDEF, Roetersstr 11, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands.",M.C.W.vandeLeur@uva.nl,,,European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),I thank Marco LiCalzi and participants of the CEF conference in Oslo and the ISDG conference in Amsterdam for their helpful comments and useful suggestions.

This contribution provides a better understanding of the under-researched development of this policy domain, asking how and why the EU has extended the scope of its external activities in the scientific area. To answer these questions, it conducts an analysis of EU policy-makers' discourses on external science policies inspired by role theory. It finds that EU role conceptions in this domain take the forms of science for diplomacy' or diplomacy for science', and that they correspond either to an image of normative or market power Europe. These findings are confirmed by a study of the EU's recent external science policies. The article argues that the ambiguity of rationales invoked for introducing a genuine science diplomacy in the EU helps to appeal to different constituencies.

The purpose is to facilitate the flow of goods, services, and persons across intra-European borders. How successful is it in achieving this goal? We apply an econometric gravity analysis to bilateral trade. Unlike earlier analysis, we acknowledge that Schengen treats different country pairs differently, depending on their relative geographical location. Moreover, we find it crucial to carefully control for other elements of European integration such as membership in the customs union, the single market or the currency union, and to factor in countries' trade with themselves. Schengen has boosted trade by about 2.81 per cent on average, on top of the EU's trade effects (equivalent to a drop in tariffs between 0.46 and 1.02 percentage points). Trade creation effects for services are stronger than for goods, but estimates feature larger parameter uncertainty. Peripheral countries benefit more than central ones.

We relax the hypothesis that all countries follow the same unique growth regime in favor of multiple regimes, and test whether the impact of remittances on growth depends on the growth regime to which an economy belongs. We follow the recent literature that has applied the finite-mixture-of-regressions method in other circumstances to endogenously identify growth regimes, correcting for unobserved heterogeneity. We find that our data are best described by an econometric model with two different growth regimes: one in which remittances have a positive and significant marginal impact on growth; and another in which the impact of remittances is insignificant. The analysis of the determinants of the probability of being in the remittances growth-enhancing regime shows that being a Sub-Saharan African country increases significantly this probability, while financial development moderately reduces this probability but with strong reservations on the statistical significance of the estimates on the different indicators of financial development.","[Konte, Maty] United Nations Univ UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Konte, M (通讯作者)，United Nations Univ UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands.",konte@merit.unu.edu,,,,,,,47,14,16,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The primary data was obtained by questionnaires that were given out to 54 producers. The main purpose of this study is investigating the effects of TMO's Appointment System for Procurement (ASP) on marketing structure of wheat and the decision-making process of farmers. Some general characteristics of the sample farms are as follows; (1) 93% of enterprises are registered to Farmer Register System, (2) registration rate increases as size of enterprises increases, (3) property and land rate (61%) decreases as size of enterprises increases, (4) average parcel number is 8.8, (5) maturity level of product is taken into consideration while determining harvest season of wheat, (6) availability of combine harvester is also an important factor, (7) 77% of producers are not encountering harvest problem, (8) 61% of them sell their products through appointment system of TMO and (9) 36% of them change appointment dates. As a result of factor analysis, we determined 5 factors explaining 79% of the total variance for product marketing condition of producers.

I propose an eigenvalue-based measure of comovement implied by the state-dependent correlation matrix estimated using a novel multivariate semi-Markov-switching approach. I show that compared to a basic Markov-switching structure the refined model performs very well in terms of capturing the well-known stylized facts of stock returns such as volatility clustering. With a focus on large-cap stocks, I illustrate the significance of comovement differential across states and document the different comovement patterns in different industries. Although the financial sector tends to conform to the conventional sentiment that comovement is highest when market is down and volatile, the conclusion should be tempered with caution when applied to other industries. In some cases, it is the high return state that registers the highest comovement.","[Deng, Kaihua] Renmin Univ China, Hanqing Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Deng, KH (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Hanqing Adv Inst Econ & Finance, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",dengk@uw.edu,,,,,,,23,2,2,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Including principal components is useful in that they extract information about the overall economy from multiple economic indicators in a statistically optimal way. Additionally, given that uncertainty may influence Federal Reserve decisions, we incorporate an uncertainty index in the reaction function of the Federal Reserve. We find substantial evidence that the Federal Reserve responded to increases in macroeconomic uncertainty by cutting the Federal Funds rate over the sample period. We also find evidence that the Federal Reserve responded aggressively to increases in capacity utilization, especially when the inflation rate was above 2%.","[Ma, Jun] Northeastern Univ, Coll Social Sci & Humanities, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Olson, Eric] West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Univ Nebraska, Coll Business, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Wohar, Mark E.] Loughborough Univ, Omaha, NE 68182 USA",Northeastern University; West Virginia University; University of Nebraska System,"Olson, E (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",eric.olson@mail.wvu.edu,"Olson, Eric/N-9896-2013","Olson, Eric/0000-0002-8716-9532",,,,,119,3,3,0,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

These authors argue that height is a proxy for cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, which earns the positive return. In this paper, I collected data on over 2,200 English and Welsh railwaymen from staff ledgers to test if the same relationship held during the Victorian and Edwardian period. Using an OLS model, it is found that a wage-height premium existed. Applying the same model to different subgroups of railwaymen, it was found that the premium only accrued to taller men working in skilled grades that required a higher cognitive and non-cognitive skill to strength ratio. No such premium existed in the physically taxing entry-level railway grades. A probit regression finds that taller Great Western signalmen working in Wales did not have a lower probability of receiving a fine upon committing an infraction; a finding that contradicts heightism as an explanation of the wage-height premium. I conclude that taller railwaymen benefited because height indirectly measured their cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, not their strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J Risk Uncertain 36:203-223, 2008) is a theory of choices and of judgments of highest buying and lowest selling prices of risky prospects, i.e., of willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA). The gap between WTP and WTA is sometimes called the endowment effect and was previously called the point of view effect. Third generation prospect theory (TGPT) combines cumulative prospect theory for risky prospects with the theory that judged values are based on the integration of price paid or price received with the consequences of gambles. In TGPT, the discrepancy between WTP and WTA is due to loss aversion-losses have greater absolute utility than gains of the same value. TGPT was developed independently of similar developments by Birnbaum and Zimmermann (Organ Behav Hum Decis Process 74(2):145-187, 1998) and Luce (Utility of gains and losses: measurement-theoretical and experimental approaches. Erlbaum, Mahwah, 2000). This paper reviews theoretical and empirical findings, to show that TGPT fails as a descriptive model of both choices and judgments. Evidence refutes three implications of TGPT, but they are consistent with configural weight models (Birnbaum and Stegner, J Personal Soc Psychol 37:48-74, 1979) in which loss aversion is not needed to describe the results. In the configural weight models, buyers place greater weight on lower consequences, attributes or estimates of value compared to sellers, who place greater configural weight on higher aspects of an object or prospect.","[Birnbaum, Michael H.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Psychol, CSUF H-830M,POB 6846, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",California State University System; California State University Fullerton,"Birnbaum, MH (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Psychol, CSUF H-830M,POB 6846, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.",mbirnbaum@fullerton.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES DRMS-0721126],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Support was received from National Science Foundation Grant, SES DRMS-0721126.

Consequently, it is important for investors to analyze the direction of influence between crude oil, gold and stock markets when designing and implementing their investment strategies. Thus, this paper studies the direction of the causality among the three markets for the US case. In doing so, we apply linear and non-linear Granger causality tests for daily data from the Great Moderation onwards. Evidence is provided as to the importance of considering the possibility of nonlinear relationships between the three markets, a feature which cannot be revealed using conventional linear causality tests which would therefore lead to an information loss about the true link. The results for the full sample indicate that the causality goes in all directions, which implies that changes in the stock market returns may be monitored by observing changes in the returns of the two commodity markets considered (and vice versa). This may help to design substitution investment strategies.

We can consider two points of view on this issue, either an eco-efficiency or eco-effectiveness approach. The fundamental problem, namely the environmental sustainability of farms is different depending on the criterion we apply. When we assume the eco-efficiency criterion and use total output as an effect indicator, producers maximise it by adopted input (polluting capital), but when it comes to the eco-effectiveness criterion, there is a different priority - not production, but the lowest possible strain on the natural environment (environmental subsidies). 125 European regions (excluding the Canaries, Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg - outliers) were analysed in 2015, as the last available year in FADN.

However, when it comes to legal grounds referring to types of business entities, it becomes clear that there is a broad regulatory frame for business activities in Croatia. That variety, however, becomes an issue when defining business forms and business models which can further complicate any result of scientific research as well as the official statistics. For example, the term company has become frequently used in journalism and research, when it has not been made clear neither what the business model is nor has it been specified what business activities the term itself covers. Furthermore, various research results often use the terms micro, small, medium and large business entities, which is, according to the positive legal regulations, accurate only for some business entities, i.e. only for some types of business entities in the Republic of Croatia. Finally, research results often display the total sum of business activities in Croatia, without considering non-profit organisations or public and non-business organisations. In order to solve this confusion, a clear system of terms for the forms of business organisation following ontological principles should be determined.

However, some projects entirely support the organization's strategic goals, some support only in some parts, and some do not support them at all. The problem arises when the organization's strategic goals are not clearly expressed or measurable or because a certain number of managers do not understand them or do not understand them in the correct way. Thus, it is necessary to establish a strong connection between clearly set business strategy and correctly chosen projects and that the relationship is continuously strengthened and maintained during project implementation. Tis is enabling to achieve optimal results in the realization of each project and optimal results on the organization level as well. This is representing a new approach to the development of the project management - strategic project management. Its task is to assure the alignment of the realization of strategical organizations' goals and implementation of organizations' projects. This paper is presenting basic elements of this new approach in project management which connects organizations strategy and implementation of a set of projects. Authors will show the link between strategic goals and project management on the example of the Zagrebacki holding.

Private enterprises make their own adaptability and matching decisions under such an objective and inevitable macroeconomic environment. At this stage, globalization has led to the economic integration to a certain extent, which has increased the volume of regional and international trade, and increased the degree of regionalization and internationalization of capital flows. For private enterprises, foreign trade is subject to both domestic and foreign political and economic factors.

This article investigates popular opinion in Donbas before armed conflict began, to determine whether the high concentration of ethnic Russians there drove support for separatism. Analysis of a KIIS opinion poll shows that, on the one hand, ethnic Russian respondents were divided on most separatist issues, with a minority backing separatist positions. On the other hand, they supported separatist issues in larger numbers than both ethnic Ukrainians and respondents with hybrid identities. Thus, while ethnic identity does not produce polarized preferences, it is relevant in shaping political attitudes. Also, analysis of an original database of statements made by Donbas residents indicate that they were motivated to support separatism by local concerns exacerbated by a sense of abandonment by Kyiv rather than by Russian language and pro-Russian foreign policy issues.","[Giuliano, Elise] Columbia Univ, Harriman Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Giuliano, E (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Harriman Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",eg599@columbia.edu,,,"Tymkiw Ukrainian Studies Faculty Research Grant and Harriman Institute, Columbia University","Tymkiw Ukrainian Studies Faculty Research Grant and Harriman Institute, Columbia University","This work was supported by a Tymkiw Ukrainian Studies Faculty Research Grant and Harriman Institute, Columbia University.",,56,56,64,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The ability of returned migrants to succeed in Turkmenistan's labor market is complicated by a variety of factors, including variation in educational quality across countries, intrusive state regulation of foreign education, and Turkmenistan's large informal sector. Based on a survey of 98 Turkmen citizens, this study compares the career trajectories and perceptions of the labor market of people educated in Turkmenistan to those educated elsewhere. Because men and women undertake different strategies of educational migration, it also compares patterns of labor market integration by gender. Country of education does appear to matter for employment in Turkmenistan, but the effect is most prominent immediately after graduation. Women were less likely to be employed in Turkmenistan, partly because they were more likely to have been educated abroad, and more likely to have a partner abroad.","[Hofmann, Erin Trouth] Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Hofmann, ET (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Sociol Social Work & Anthropol, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Erin.Hofmann@usu.edu,,,Academic Fund Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) [16-01-0121],Academic Fund Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE),This work was supported by Academic Fund Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) [grant number 16-01-0121].,,39,6,6,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

In addition to the technological procedure of creation of photographs, the entire photo industry has changed, and one of the derivates of the newly created digital economy is digital stock photography, which has grown into a global business with a gross turnover of about US$ 5 billion annually. However, stock photography today is faced with difficult challenges, because with low price and high quality of cameras, modern technology has made photography extremely popular and readily accessible, literally to everyone. With high technical quality of digital photographs, amateurs have seriously endangered the existence of professional photographers.

Because of the tendency of the representatives of cooperatives to participate in the research, the research had been conducted on a sample of 41% of the dairy cooperatives from Swietokrzyskie and Malopolskie provinces from Poland using the interview questionnaire. Cooperatives' representatives were asked to indicate activities that, in their opinion, have an influence on customers' value on such markets as: province in which the cooperative is established, other Polish provinces, European Union markets, and other major markets. The results of the research show that cooperatives from both provinces differ in indicating activities affecting customer value realized on particular markets in the area of distribution. They differ in indicating such activities as the sales of products on the Internet, the ownership of retail chain, the provision of products in a shorter time than competitors, the provision of products on time, the assurance of convenient time of purchase, the assurance of convenient place of purchase, the differentiation of distribution methods, individualization of deliveries in terms of time, size, range and method of delivery, the assurance of the reliability of supplies in terms of time, quality and quantity of delivered products, the assurance of the fast communication with the buyer (on-line), the assurance of the logistics and transport services.","[Konieczna, Izabela] Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Kielce, Poland",Jan Kochanowski University,"Konieczna, I (通讯作者)，Jan Kochanowski Univ Kielce, Kielce, Poland.",izabela.konieczna@ujk.edu.pl,"Konieczna, Izabela/W-2755-2018","Konieczna, Izabela/0000-0002-3632-3245",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,182,190,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300019,0

It was found that the level of employment in agriculture, and labour productivity in agriculture, against the background of the economy of regions is highly diversified. Large differences in labour productivity in the sector are an obstacle for the convergence of regional agriculture. A positive relationship was observed between the state of development of the economy of individual regions, and the effectiveness and potential of agriculture. A higher level of regional economic development makes it possible to effectively eliminate structural defects in agriculture, especially related to excess labour force. As a result of the research, a beneficial feedback loop was shown between the development of a region's economy and the economic efficiency of agriculture, expressed, among others, by labour productivity and the productivity of fixed assets.","[Kusz, Dariusz] Rzeszow Tech Univ, Rzeszow, Poland; [Kata, Ryszard] Univ Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology; University of Rzeszow,"Kusz, D (通讯作者)，Rzeszow Tech Univ, Rzeszow, Poland.",dkusz@prz.edu.pl; rdkata@ur.edu.pl,"Kusz, Dariusz/ABA-9687-2021","Kusz, Dariusz/0000-0002-5643-5404; Kata, Ryszard/0000-0001-6085-3935",,,,,23,0,0,0,9,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,106,120,,10.14595/CP/01/008,0.0,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000008,0

Many of these instruments do not fully comply with the WTO rules. On the other hand, the US argues with the facts that the US economy is disadvantaged in world trade. The protectionist measures that have been taken lead to the development of new trade agreements, such as China, which will create more favorable conditions for US producers and investors in the Chinese market.

This research investigates the optimal balance between the risk of overinvesting in non-carbon sources that are ultimately not needed and the risk of underinvesting in non-carbon sources and subsequently needing to reduce carbon emissions dramatically. We employ a novel framework that incorporates a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the U.S. into a two-stage stochastic approximate dynamic program (ADP) focused on decisions in the electric power sector. We solve the model using an ADP algorithm that is computationally tractable while exploring the decisions and sampling the uncertain carbon limits from continuous distributions. The results of the model demonstrate that an optimal hedge is in the direction of more non-carbon investment in the near-term, in the range of 20-30% of new generation. We also demonstrate that the optimal share of non-carbon generation is increasing in the variance of the uncertainty about the long-term carbon targets, and that with greater uncertainty in the future policy regime, a balanced portfolio of non-carbon, natural gas, and coal generation is desirable.","[Morris, Jennifer F.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Srikrishnan, Vivek; Webster, Mort D.] Penn State Univ, John & Willie Leone Family Dept Energy & Mineral, State Coll, PA USA; [Reilly, John M.] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Morris, JF (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",holak@mit.edu,"; Srikrishnan, Vivek/J-1966-2015","Morris, Jennifer/0000-0001-7675-558X; Srikrishnan, Vivek/0000-0003-0049-3805","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science [DE-SC0003906, DE-FG-0294ER61937]; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [XA-83600001-1]; National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF [GEO-1240507]; Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; Directorate For Geosciences [1240507] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-SC0003906] Funding Source: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency); National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)); U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for this work provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science under grants DE-SC0003906 and DE-FG-0294ER61937; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under grant XA-83600001-1; the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Network for Sustainable Climate Risk Management (SCRiM) under NSF cooperative agreement GEO-1240507 and the Penn State Center for Climate Risk Management; and other government, industry, and foundation sponsors of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

Conceptualising NGOs as autonomous social systems and drawing on two qualitative case studies of Russian NGOs in the fields of human rights protection, we show how these organisations manage to cope with the state's withdrawal of legitimacy by creatively handling their diverse environmental dependencies.

The Partial Least Square (PLS) Method was used for analysing data and testing hypotheses; the measurement scales were checked before the hypotheses were tested. Results confirmed that the participants considered a wish for fulfilment as very significant, that is, they do not pay much attention to material wealth and aspire to non-material forms of consumption and mental growth, which is characteristic for individuals who acquire voluntary simplicity. The study showed young people's average level of materialism which was negatively related to life satisfaction. A voluntary simplicity life style, being increasingly acquired by young people, did not show a statistically significant correlation with life satisfaction when the whole sample was considered, while a correlation between voluntary simplicity and life satisfaction was positive in the segmented sub-sample, which in the latter case implies the importance of materially simpler life when it comes to achieving life satisfaction. The paper is oriented only to the population of young people who should be compared to the population of adults and a group of voluntary simplifiers. The key value of the study lies in the simultaneous research into the orientation to materialism or voluntary simplicity as related to life satisfaction in young people; this has been the first one of this type in the Croatian context.","[Nefat, Ariana; Benazic, Dragan] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia; [Suran, Tiziano] Int Sch Adv Studies SISSA, Trieste, Italy",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula; International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA),"Nefat, A (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkovic, Pula, Croatia.",anefat@unipu.hr; dbenazic@unipu.hr; tsuran@sissa.it,"Benazic, Dragan/AID-1260-2022","Benazic, Dragan/0000-0001-5396-3706; Suran, Tiziano/0000-0002-5471-8929",,,,,58,2,2,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,147,162,,,,,,16,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540720300017,0

The voivodeships constitute the highest level of Polish self-government administration. One of their responsibilities is to support regional development on their territory. Regional development includes quantitative and qualitative changes in the social and economic aspects of operation of voivodeships. Development is an ambiguous notion and it can be perceived through multiple social and economic determinants. It can be expressed both by research of macroeconomic variables, as well as the ongoing social and qualitative changes regarding the citizens' standard of living. The purpose of this article is the assessment of socio-economic development differentiation of Polish voivodeships between 2011 and 2016. The assessment was carried out using Hellwig taxonomic development measure. The level of development for each voivodeship was described with 23 variables. Among them the following can be mentioned: rate of natural increase per 1000 people, percentage of people in working age, total length of expressways and motorways per 1000 km2, percentage of people using the water supply network, number of beds in general hospitals per 10 thousand people, number of people per one library facility, number of registered passenger cars per 1000 residents, net enrolment rate on secondary school level, number of children in kindergarten facilities per 1000 children between 3 and 5 years of age, degree of use of bed places, share of protected areas in the voivodeship area, percentage of voivodeship councillors with higher education, migration rate per 1000 residents, rate of registered unemployment, the average monthly gross salary, GDP per capita, voivodeship own revenue per capita, share of PIT tax revenue in the total own revenue of the voivodeship, share of CIT tax revenue in the total own revenue of the voivodeship, gross worth of fixed assets per capita, capital expenditure per capita, number of entities entered into the REGON registered per 10 thousand residents. A model of development was created, i.e. a hypothetical voivodeship with the best observed values of variables and the distance of every voivodeship to the model voivodeship was calculated. The research proposed a hypothesis assuming the existence of a differentiation in regional development in Poland. The average distances of voivodeships from the model for the years in question were found to be on a low, relatively stable level. At the same time the particular voivodeships also maintained their distance from the model and their rank on a comparable level. It was a proof of an existence of a relatively stable developmental differentiation for the voivodeships in question. The voivodeship characterised by the highest level of development in all the years in question was the Masovian voivodeship, while the voivodeships characterised with the lowest level of development were Lublin voivodeship and Warmian-Masurian voivodeship.","[Podstawka, Marian; Suchodolski, Bartlomiej] Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Siedlce, Poland",,"Podstawka, M (通讯作者)，Siedlce Univ Nat Sci & Humanities, Siedlce, Poland.",marian.podstawka@uph.edu.pl; bartlomiej.suchodolski@uph.edu.pl,,,,,,,11,3,3,1,5,STANISLAW STASZIC UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES PILA,PILA,"UL PODCHORAZYCH 10, PILA, 64-920, POLAND",,,978-83-62617-89-0,,,,2018,,,,,,,187,201,,10.14595/CP/01/013,0.0,,,15,Development Studies; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,BM3DE,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461899000013,0

They are strangers to be governed by integration' policy and border management. Refugees and migrants are, however, subjects of contemporary capitalism struggling to render themselves valuable capitalist modes of production. I study the government of refugees and migrants in order to examine capitalist value regimes. Societal values and hierarchies reflected in capitalist modes of production impact on struggles of racialised subaltern groups to translate body power into valued labour. Marx's account of surplus populations points to the common marginalisations of people called refugees' and other subaltern groups struggling to translate their body power into valorised labour. The essay includes a study of the gentrification of a district in Budapest, and its transformation into a means for the reproduction of capital, leading to the marginalisation of groups who no longer fit the new value regimes. Studying refugees as surplus populations allows for a sense of the common marginalisations of subaltern and racialised groups before capitalism, and questions the treatment of refugees and migrants as strangers'.","[Rajaram, Prem Kumar] Cent European Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Rajaram, PK (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.",rajaramp@ceu.edu,,,,,,,38,81,83,3,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The result of this study showed that the Biosecurity level of poultry farming was on a medium level. That condition was caused by farmers who paid little attention to Biosecurity system, especially in the sanitation of food place and traffic control aspects. On the other hand, farmers who applied Biosecurity system well paid adequate attention to vaccinations, handling of dead poultry and quarantine.

The aim of the study is the selection of an optimal structure of co-branding alliance for an integrated business structure based on the assessment of economic effects from co-branding and evaluation of the brand congruence level. The study presents a comprehensive system of synergistic co-branding strategy development built upon the implementation of a three-stage algorithm. The goal of synergistic co-branding strategy development is attaining such a branding alliance out of all possible alternatives where the economic benefits from a particular brand of integrated business structure will transform into synergistic interaction effects within the co-branding alliance. With the aim of empirical testing the relevance relationships and components of consumer attitudes to co-branding an expert evaluation of potential co-branding alliances for the Fozzy Group integrated business structure has been carried out. Given the brand congruence assessment results in terms of brand relevance and customer expectations indicators, clustering of possible co-branding alliances by the specified criteria has been performed. The evaluation of economic effects from co-branding was carried out among those co-branding alliances which demonstrated the highest level of congruence. To determine the optimal variants for co-branding alliances within Fozzy Group an ABC-analysis has been used. This study provides the rationality that co-branding is a logical follow-up of the innovation process expansion and enhancement of integrated marketing of IBS activities. The emergence of a joint product resulting from such strategic partnership between business units becomes a determining factor in the co-branding strategy and in the context of integrated structures fosters full integration of their marketing mix. From this perspective, building a co-brand seems to be a logical approach and optimal solution for further joint activities of integrated business units.","[Shcherbak, Valeriia; Nifatova, Olena] Kyiv Natl Univ Technol & Design, Nemirovich Danchenko St 2, UA-01011 Kiev, Ukraine; [Kaliuzhna, Olena] Mykolayiv Natl Agr Univ, Georgiya Gongadze St 9, UA-54020 Mykolayiv, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Kyiv National University of Technologies & Design; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Mykolayiv National Agrarian University (MNAU),"Shcherbak, V (通讯作者)，Kyiv Natl Univ Technol & Design, Nemirovich Danchenko St 2, UA-01011 Kiev, Ukraine.",valery_shcherbak@i.ua; helen_bykhova@live.ru,"Nifatova, Olena/HTQ-8274-2023; Velychko, Olena/GRS-0430-2022; Nifatova, Olena/AAN-4175-2020","Velychko, Olena/0000-0001-7273-9769; Nifatova, Olena/0000-0001-9325-6176",,,,,16,0,0,3,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,181,190,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300022,0

On the initiative of the European Union, the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region has been prepared and implemented. The Strategy recognises tourism as one of the priorities of development. Taking into account the fact that the Russian Federation is the only non-EU country located at the Baltic Sea, this country needs to be engaged in cooperation and macroregional exchange. Such cooperation is particularly important for the Russian Federation's oblasts situated at the Baltic Sea. It is reflected in the strategy documents of regional authorities. The stimulation of tourism exchange in the BSR is determined by a range of factors, among them a special role is played by the demand factor. The aim of this paper was to analyse Kaliningrad Oblast as a tourist-generating area for the Baltic Sea Region. For this purpose, relevant literature research and a critical analysis of legal documents have been conducted. Furthermore, a survey has been carried out among 110 randomly selected students of the Kant University in Kaliningrad. The survey enabled to identify tourist preferences among respondents, including the rank of BSR countries among the visited countries. The attractiveness of the countries in the Region has been analysed. Respondents indicated the strengths and weaknesses of Baltic destinations. This enabled to identify barriers and suggest ways to reduce them. A barrier to the development of outbound tourism is, first of all, visa problems and further financial problems. There is a need for improved transport accessibility, lower prices of transport services and more intensified marketing activities in the Russian Federation's market.","[Studzieniecki, Tomasz; Wanagos, Marzena; Urbanyi-Popiolek, Ilona] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland",Gdynia Maritime University,"Studzieniecki, T (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Gdynia, Poland.",t.studzieniecki@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; m.wanagos@wpit.am.gdynia.pl; i.urbanyi@wpit.am.gdynia.pl,"Studzieniecki, Tomasz/Q-7351-2018; Urbanyi-Popiołek, Ilona/R-5237-2018","Studzieniecki, Tomasz/0000-0002-1272-0908;",,,,,19,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,139,147,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Development Studies; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Development Studies,BP1SG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540723300017,0

Following the 2008 economic crisis, many countries' economies or even whole European Union and US were in recession. Unemployment rate increased, GDP declined and some businesses bankrupted, mainly banks. In order to support economic growth, countries have taken various steps such as quantitative easing, interest rate cuts, investment incentives etc. The US market has recovered from the crisis sooner than rest of the world, even though the trigger for the crisis was in the US. The US economy is considered to be the most developed, as it has a huge banking and capital market. The banking sector or mortgages market to be concrete was the trigger for the crisis, but the capital sector can be considered as a support system in the rebuilding of the US economy. In our paper we deal with the US capital market, which is the largest in the world and supports the US economy and therefore employment, GDP, economic growth, capital inflows and more. The size and usability of the US capital market is unparalleled and therefore its aspects need to be further explored. The European Union has one of the main objectives of building a capital markets union on the US image where capital markets operate at a much better level. For this reason, our research addresses various indicators of the US capital market and their impact on unemployment and GDP in the US.","[Suchy, Erik; Soltes, Michal] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Suchy, E (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",erik.suchy@tuke.sk; michal.soltes@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Michal/AAA-5822-2020","Šoltés, Michal/0000-0002-1421-7177",,,,,16,0,0,1,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8980-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,708,714,,,,,,7,"Area Studies; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BM4AM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000462948800090,0

Due to their,,inciting power': liability rules can influence individuals' behavior. Altering liability rules also alters their control effect. Such decisions of legislature or judicature can be evaluated by the economic outcomes of the altered control effect. In this paper, the efficiency effects of liability rules regarding product liability are analyzed. The product recall of implanted medical devices as in the ECJ Judgment from 5th March 2015 in the joined cases C-503/13 and C-504/13 is examined in detail. Contrary to the economic considerations, health protection is pursued with the Product Liability Directive. Though the ECJ extended the liability only to recalls, necessary due to the devices particular danger. A general recall obligation was explicitly not implemented, but the judgment introduced the opportunity to stipulate a recall obligation on a case-by-case basis. The additional incentives set by contractual liability and tortious producer liability were not within the scope of the analysis. A multi-level precaution model could include precautionary measures while development, production, and monitoring of products. Other measures as a producers' obligation were not examined. The liability for a defect-free device, influencing the level of harm and the recall costs in the model, was excluded too, A need for further research in that subject remains.","[Wenning, Winona] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Rancic, Nenad; Pilipovic, Ozren] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Chair Econ, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Bonn; University of Zagreb,"Wenning, W (通讯作者)，Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",winona.wenning@uni-bonn.de; nrancic@pravo.hr; opilipovic@pravo.hr,"rancic, nenad/ABB-6385-2021",,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"UNIV APPLIED SCIENCES, FAC ECONOMIC OSIJEK, HOCHSCHULE PFORZHEIM, TRG SV, TROJSTVA 3, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-0408,,,INTERDISC MANAG RES,,,2018,14.0,,,,,,1001,1017,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM9DQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000470808300056,0

Germany, Austria, Switzerland) are utilized by hunting free-living specimens, or - to a small extent - by holding wild game in a similar way like domestic animals ('farmed game'), with meat or trophies as main products. Evidence exists that meat from wild game is favourable in various quality aspects over meat of comparable domestic species. As ethics is concerned, the production of game meat is often thought to be comparable to products from organic farming of domestic species. Currently, keeping wild animal in fenced areas for the purpose of hunting and hunting techniques which are based on mobilisation/disturbance of animals are under heavy debate as regards exposure of animals to unnecessary stress and pain, and related ethical concerns. Like in slaughter animals, indicators for ante-mortem distress and delayed onset of death exist for hunted game, e.g. insufficient post-mortem acidification of muscle tissue is associated with ante-mortem energy depletion (distress). The location of the wound channel allows assessing if sudden death occurred. Drive hunts on wild ruminants, suids and small game are associated with higher probabilities (compared to still hunts) for discomfort, distress and pain, due to chasing of animals and non-fatal wounds. Although field data demonstrate that it largely depends on the actual conditions if wound patterns and energy status of carcasses from one drive hunt differ from that from carcasses from still hunts, there is a higher probability of such adverse effects in sentient animals killed in drive hunts. This is an ethical issue, which needs to be dealt with in Codes of Practice, e.g. in guides to good practice in hunting. Such codes should preferably be issued by hunters' associations, or, if this is not feasible, codified in legislation on hunting.","[Winkelmayer, R.] Pachfurth, Dorfitrasse 19, A-2471 Rohrau, Austria; [Paulsen, P.] Vetmeduni Vienna, Inst Meat Hyg, Vet Pl 1, A-1210 Vienna, Austria",University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna,"Winkelmayer, R (通讯作者)，Pachfurth, Dorfitrasse 19, A-2471 Rohrau, Austria.",tierarzt@winkelmayer.at,,,,,,,21,1,1,2,3,WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL,WAGENINGEN,"POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS",,,978-90-8686-869-8; 978-90-8686-321-1,,,,2018,,,,,,,174,178,,10.3920/978-90-8686-869-8_26,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ethics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Business & Economics,BQ4QI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000593891000026,0

Base on the above analysis, we finally propose some suggestions for improvement, such as diversifying profit model, optimizing regional allocation and diversifying marketing model.","[Xu, Lianfeng; Qiu, Qiang] Minjiang Univ, Res Ctr Fiscal & Financial Dev Haixi, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",Minjiang University,"Qiu, Q (通讯作者)，Minjiang Univ, Res Ctr Fiscal & Financial Dev Haixi, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China.",,,,Research Center for Fiscal and Financial Development in Haixi (Minjiang University) [HXCJ1718],Research Center for Fiscal and Financial Development in Haixi (Minjiang University),Funded by Research Center for Fiscal and Financial Development in Haixi (Minjiang University) (No. HXCJ1718),,7,0,0,1,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-521-4,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2018,182.0,,,,,,531,534,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BM5RA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000465424800126,0

The NAFTA experience changed that. Where other studies have only hinted at the reasons for NAFTA controversies, this paper makes clear three causal factors: (i) changing patterns and intensity of FDI, (ii) the application of those rules to developed countries amid those changing FDI patterns and (iii) ambiguities in ISDS rules themselves. The paper explores these and traces the ways in which lessons of the NAFTA have been instrumental in changing the pursuit of investment protection agreements. BITs used to be uncontroversial, but the NAFTA focused attention on reforms to ISDS that maintain the utility of BITs in the governance of FDI, without creating a legal structure for simply challenging the state.","[Anderson, Greg] Univ Alberta, Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Anderson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",,,,,,,,58,4,4,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,DEC,2017,40.0,12,,,,,2937,2965,,10.1111/twec.12515,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FO8JB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417130900015,0

Several policy measures are evaluated to identify a means of stimulating a shift from single occupancy vehicle (SOV) use to modes that make sustainable usage of the car, namely carpooling and car-sharing. Consequently, an indication of increased levels of 'car-shedding' in the GDA is ascertained. Behavioural indicators such as market elasticities and simulation models are estimated from multinomial logit (MNL) modelling of choices from a stated preference (SP) survey. The analysis determined that reductions in the modal share of SOVs of up to 8% in a 'best case scenario', could be achieved if policies are put in place to reduce the time and cost attributes of commuting to work by carpooling and car-sharing. Furthermore, a 1% change in the convenience, time and cost attributes yielded a direct effect or increase in the probability of carpooling and car-sharing being chosen, of up to 0.34%, suggesting that the carpool and car-share modes may be relatively elastic to attribute changes. A comparison of means analysis of other survey data is also included in this paper. Ultimately, this paper offers support to the argument that greater investment in policy incentives alone is worth considering in order to increase the occupancy of vehicles commuting to work and education.","[Carroll, Paraic; Caulfield, Brian] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, Ireland; [Ahern, Aoife] UCD, Sch Civil Engn, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Caulfield, B (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Civil Struct & Environm Engn, Dublin, Ireland.",brian.caulfield@tcd.ie,"Carroll, Páraic/AAT-3798-2020; Caulfield, Brian/GYU-3314-2022","Carroll, Páraic/0000-0002-6235-3798; Caulfield, Brian/0000-0003-3877-475X",Environmental Protection Agency of Ireland,Environmental Protection Agency of Ireland(Environmental Protection Agency Ireland (EPA)),The authors would like to thank the Environmental Protection Agency of Ireland for funding this research under the Greening Transport project.,,41,21,21,1,28,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

The literature proposes several transmission channels through which these effects may occur and even the existence of two different forms of inequality. However, empirical studies have not generally distinguished between these channels, nor have they considered the two forms of inequality and their separate effects on growth. In this paper, we review the theory and the evidence of the transmission channels through which inequality influences growth. We contribute to the literature by using a system of recursive equations, following a control function approach, to empirically assess the relevance of these channels and to differentiate between two forms of inequality. In a single model, we capture both a negative and a positive effect of inequality on long-run economic growth.","[Castells-Quintana, David] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Castells-Quintana, David; Royuela, Vicente] Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Castells-Quintana, D (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Appl Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.;Castells-Quintana, D (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, AQR IREA, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",dcastells@ub.edu,"Royuela, Vicente/A-4162-2009; Castells-Quintana, David/Z-2511-2019","Castells-Quintana, David/0000-0002-0250-7214",[ECO2013-41022R],,"We thank Raul Ramos, Gustavo Marrero, and Paula Herrera-Idarraga for valuable comments.

To further examine the robustness of our findings, we additionally utilize tests that consider non-normal errors. Testing is undertaken using quarterly data for the time period 1983Q1-2013Q3. Overall, we find support for unit root hysteresis in 4 of the 14 countries, the traditional natural rate hypothesis in 3 countries, and the structuralist hypothesis (a natural rate with structural breaks) in 7 countries.

A different measure of socioeconomic status, maternal education, is employed. In addition, the depth and severity of obesity are examined as well as the incidence. Finally, the use of two waves of longitudinal data permits the analysis of the persistence of obesity. Results show that overall childhood obesity stabilised between the two waves.

Multivariate regression analyses of the teacher's assessment, controlling for the child's actual test performance, their BMI, their mother's BMI, other socio-demographic and teacher characteristics were undertaken. The study highlighted that child BMI was not a significant determinant but that children whose mother was obese were more likely to be rated as below average in reading and in maths compared to those whose mother was leaner, after adjusting for their measured ability. The potential for mother's weight status to influence teachers' assessments of their children's perceived ability could have long term ramifications for educational outcomes and warrants further study.

Yet, much empirical work fails to account for human capital's multidimensional nature and limits its focus to specific childhood stages. Using longitudinal data from the Philippines, I estimate a model of multidimensional human capital formation from birth through adulthood where health, cognitive, and noncognitive dimensions are jointly produced. I examine during which developmental stages parental investment is most influential and address the endogeneity of investment using a policy function where investment depends on child characteristics, exogenous conditions at birth and local prices. Findings imply that not only will early human capital disparities persist into adulthood without early remediation but also that cognitive gains yielded from early remediation will be lost without complementary investment in adolescence. Findings further suggest that interventions will be undervalued if their multidimensional effects are not accounted for. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines patterns and determinants of global production sharing with an emphasis on how Australian manufacturing fits into global production networks (GPNs). Though Australia is a minor player in GPNs, there is evidence that Australian manufacturing has a distinct competitive edge in specialised, skill-intensive tasks in several industries such as aircraft, medical devices, machine tools, measuring and scientific equipment and photographic equipment. Specialisation in high-value-to-weight components and final goods within GPNs, which are suitable for air transport, helps Australian manufacturing to overcome the tyranny of distance in world trade.

I confirm much of their original hypothesis with new data and techniques, and expand upon it, finding that another explanation, Williamson's (1997) psychosexual one, might complement the economic one. I also discover that, in line with an economic competition framework, lynchings predict more black out-migration from 1920 to 1930, and higher state-level wages.

We axiomatize a multiattribute decision time (MDT) representation, which is a dynamic extension of the classic multiattribute expected utility theory that allows potentially incomplete preferences. Under this framework, one alternative is preferred to another in a certain period if and only if the weighted sum of the attribute-dependent expected utility induced by the former alternative is larger than that induced by the latter for all attribute weights in a closed and convex set. MDT uniquely determines the decision time as the earliest period at which the ranking between alternatives becomes decisive. The comparative statics result indicates that the decision time provides useful information to locate indifference curves in a specific setting. MDT also explains various empirical findings in economics and other relevant fields.","[Koida, Nobuo] Iwate Prefectural Univ, Fac Policy Studies, 152-52 Sugo, Takizawa, Iwate 0200693, Japan",Iwate Prefectural University,"Koida, N (通讯作者)，Iwate Prefectural Univ, Fac Policy Studies, 152-52 Sugo, Takizawa, Iwate 0200693, Japan.",nobuo@iwate-pu.ac.jp,"Koida, Nobuo/AAJ-6484-2020","Koida, Nobuo/0000-0003-4245-3895","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [24730168, 26380241]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730168] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I would like to thank Atsushi Kajii, Takashi Ui, Norio Takeoka, Kazuya Hyogo, Youichiro Higashi, Hitoshi Matsushima, Koki Oikawa, and numerous seminar and conference participants for helpful discussions and comments.

Our approach allows the incorporation of partial information about the preferences of the agents into the model, and permits the identification of the set of equilibria in accordance with this information. We also propose an additional conservative criterion which can be applied in this framework in order to predict the results of interaction. The potential application of the theoretical results is shown with an analysis of a mixed oligopoly in which the agents value additional objectives other than their own benefit. These objectives are related to social welfare and to the profit of the industry. The flexibility of our approach provides a general theoretical framework for the analysis of a wide range of strategic economic models.","[Marmol, Amparo M.; Monroy, Luisa; Zapata, Asuncion] Univ Seville, Dept Econ Aplicada 3, Seville, Spain; [Marmol, Amparo M.; Monroy, Luisa] Univ Seville, IMUS, Seville, Spain; [Angeles Caraballo, M.] Univ Seville, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla,"Mármol, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Dept Econ Aplicada 3, Seville, Spain.;Mármol, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, IMUS, Seville, Spain.",amarmol@us.es; lmonroy@us.es; mcaraba@us.es; azapata@us.es,"Mármol, Amparo/N-3175-2019; Caraballo, M.

The research aims to uncover the various strategies that were applied to structurally re-engineer the carrier in order to adapt to its evolving competitive landscape. The key pillars underpinning Aer Lingus' turnaround as a value hybrid were as follows: strict adherence to capacity discipline; relentless cost control and value-adding, consumer-driven product differentiation; innovative partnerships including contract flying to alleviate its problematic seasonality issues inherent in Aer Lingus markets; and by re-engineering its Dublin-based hub airport.

We use panel data for Korean firms between 2000 and 2012 and estimate the firm-level productivity of import-competing firms before and after AD imposition. Using a difference-in-difference framework, we compare firm productivity changes in a treatment group that receives AD protection to a control group that does not. In contrast to recent findings on the effects of AD measures, we find that the average protected firms experience productivity loss during the AD protection period. Examining the changes in external market condition and internal resource allocation during the protection period, such loss appears to be more evident inside highly concentrated import-competing sectors. Further, we find that protected firms are more likely to reallocate their resources abroad via FDI at the expense of domestic production and investment once they receive temporary protection.","[Sun, Joo Yeon] Yonsei Univ, Global Leadership Div, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Seungrae] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Daegu, South Korea",Yonsei University; Kyungpook National University,"Sun, JY (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Global Leadership Div, Seoul, South Korea.",,,"Sun, Joo Yeon/0000-0002-7368-0129",,,,,30,0,0,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,SEP,2017,40.0,9,,,,,2007,2030,,10.1111/twec.12463,0.0,,,24,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,FG5AD,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000410299900013,0

For example, see Morellec (Journal of Financial Economics, 61(2), 173-206, 2001) and Bharath et al. (Review of Financial Studies, 22(8), 3211-3243, 2009). We follow and extend that literature by looking at the liquidity of market based options to forecast REIT capital structure changes. REITs, unlike typical listed firms, tend to have high leverage and a more dynamic capital structure because of regulation. Thus, understanding potential management behavior could be important to investors. By looking at actions of the managers as revealed through the liquidity in the option's market, we are able to estimate what REIT managers are likely to do in terms of future capital structure changes. We do so using option data which update at higher frequency than traditional accounting characteristics. Our results are similar to those of Borochin and Yang (2016) who study this issue for non-REIT firms. We find that REITs with higher historical volatility or lower option market liquidity (as measured by number of daily unique call options, daily call open interest, and daily volume of option traded) are less likely to increase leverage in the following quarter. REITs with higher option liquidity or lower realized volatility are more likely to increase net long-term debt (issuing more debt or retire less debt) in the following quarter.","[Borochin, Paul] Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Sch Business, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Glascock, John L.; Lu-Andrews, Ran] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Real Estate & Urban Econ Studies, Sch Business, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lu-Andrews, Ran] Calif Lutheran Univ, Sch Management, 60 West Olsen Rd, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA; [Yang, Jie] Georgetown Univ, McDonough Sch Business, 37th & O St NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; California Lutheran University; Georgetown University,"Borochin, P (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Finance, Sch Business, 2100 Hillside Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",paul.borochin@business.uconn.edu,,,,,,,19,4,4,0,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The proposed approach is supported by two sequential stages: the first estimates the commodity-based truck O-D trip tables primarily derived from the commodity flow database, and the second refines the O-D estimates using the observed truck counts. The first stage uses national commodity flow data from the Freight Analysis Framework Version 3 (FAF(3)) database to develop a commodity-based truck trip table, while the second stage uses the path flow estimator (PFE) concept to refine the truck trip table obtained from the first stage using the truck counts from the statewide truck count program. The model allows great flexibility for data incorporation at different spatial levels in terms of estimating the statewide truck O-D trip table. To show proof of concept, a case study is conducted using the Utah statewide freight transportation network to demonstrate how the two-stage approach can be implemented in practice. The results show that the proposed approach is applicable for estimating a statewide truck O-D trip table with limited resources, and can be used to conduct truck corridor analysis to determine congested links and potential bottlenecks in Utah.

Recent research has shown that half of the variability in income of World population was determined by country of birth and income distribution. Since health and income are generally strictly related, the aim of this paper is to estimate how much variability in income and health is determined by external circumstances. We use data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement (SHARE) and the English Longitudinal Survey on Ageing (ELSA), two comparable multidisciplinary surveys that provide micro-level data on health and financial resources among the elderly for a large number of European countries. Our baseline estimation shows that about 20% of the variability in income is explained by current country-specific circumstances, while health outcomes range from 12% using BMI to 19% using self-rated health. By including early-life circumstances, the explained variability increases almost 20 percentage points for income and for self-rated health but less for other health outcomes. Finally, by controlling for endogeneity issues linked with effort, our estimates indicate that circumstances better explain variability in health outcomes. Results are robust to some tests, and the implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The main argument is that a costly exchange of information can improve the recipient's incentives to comply with conditionality. If creditors can credibly signal that suspending financial assistance is a viable option, they will be able to extract concessions from the recipient. Conversely, if the feasibility of the outside option is in doubt, threats to withhold financial support will be toothless. Our contribution is to highlight the role of information exchanges during crisis bargaining. Such signalling mechanisms are central to understanding the outcomes of the Greek debt drama, but are absent from existing accounts.","[Hennessy, Alexandra] Seton Hall Univ, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA",Seton Hall University,"Hennessy, A (通讯作者)，Seton Hall Univ, Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Affairs, 400 South Orange Ave, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",alexandra.hennessy@shu.edu,,,,,,,37,11,11,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The sector regulators aim to identify the best performing utilities as frontier firms to determine the relative efficiency of firms. This paper develops a nested latent class (NLC) model approach where unobserved differences in firm performance are modelled using two 'zero inefficiency stochastic frontier' (ZISF) models nested in a 'latent class stochastic frontier' (LCSF) model. This captures the unobserved differences due to technology or environmental conditions. A Monte Carlo simulation suggests that the proposed model does not suffer from identification problems. We illustrate the proposed model with an application to Norwegian distribution network utilities for the period 2004-2011. We find that the efficiency scores in both LCSF and ZISF models are biased, and some firms in the ZISF model are wrongly labelled as inefficient. Conversely, inefficient firms may be wrongly labelled as being fully efficient by the ZISF model.","[Orea, Luis] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo Efficiency Grp, Oviedo, Spain; [Jamasb, Tooraj] Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England",University of Oviedo; Durham University,"Jamasb, T (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Business Sch, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",lorea@uniovi.es; tooraj.jamasb@durham.ac.uk,"Orea, Luis/K-5298-2014","Orea, Luis/0000-0003-1146-9261",Government of the Principality of Asturias; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF),Government of the Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(European Union (EU)),We would like to thank William Greene for his comments and support at various stages during the elaboration of the paper.

Our analysis suggests that in the highly populated and developed corridors the HSR expansion is likely to leave LCCs with little survival room, which is also shown by our case study on Spring Airlines. On the other hand, in the low-density corridors especially in the central and western China, LCCs might leave HSR with little survival room in the long run. By conducting a propensity score matching to pair HSR-linked city pairs in China to the counterfactual US airline routes, we find that most of these Chinese routes would be viable markets for LCCs to operate. The benefits of HSR expansion may thus be overestimated if not recognizing the LCCs' role as an alternative mode to serve these markets. In particular, for the routes to the central and western China with very small travel demand and high HSR construction cost, LCC service could be more cost efficient and operationally flexible than HSR. Our analysis calls for a more careful evaluation of the program and, more generally, a balanced and coordinated HSR and LCC development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Watson, M",,,,"Watson, Matthew",,,"Historicising Ricardo's comparative advantage theory, challenging the normative foundations of liberal International Political Economy",NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,David Ricardo; comparative advantage; War of Spanish Succession; Methuen Treaty; transatlantic slave trade,,"David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage is now two centuries old, but it remains at the heart of economists' theories of international trade. It also continues to provide the underlying economic ethic for liberal International Political Economy (IPE). Ricardo's numerical illustration of the mutually shared gains from specialisation and trade involved complementary structures of comparative advantage being exhibited by a productively superior hypothetical Portugal' and a productively inferior hypothetical England'. Yet, the historical back-story of actual eighteenth-century trading relations between the two countries reveals Portugal's repeated struggles to meet its treaty obligations to the English in the context of the European quest for empire. Those difficulties persisted even when it harnessed its (less profitable) commercial trade to (much more profitable) slave trading practices. Ricardo's account of the purely mathematical logic of comparative advantage writes out of economic history the centrality of both imperial wars and African slavery to the early English and Portuguese experience of free' trade. Given this historical back-story, liberal IPE thus appears to be in urgent need of new normative foundations to decouple it from these highly illiberal economic processes.","[Watson, Matthew] Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Watson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",matthew.g.watson@warwick.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship [ES/K010697/1]; ESRC; ESRC [ES/K010697/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K010697/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This article was written with financial assistance from an Economic and Social Research Council Professorial Fellowship.

More specifically, we use stock returns in MASI, CAC, DAX, FTSE and NASDAQ as representatives of Moroccan, French, German, British and US markets, respectively. The data sample frequency is daily and spans from January 2002 to December 2012 excluding holidays. Using the estimation results of a bivariate VAR-BEKK GARCH model, we analyze the return and volatility spillover effects between the Moroccan market and the other considered markets. Moreover, the identification of break point due to the subprime crisis is made by Lee and Strazicich (Rev Econ Stat 85(4):1082-1089, 2003, Econ Bull 33(4):2483-2492, 2013), Papell and Prodan (J Money Credit Bank 38:1329-1349, 2006) and Prodan (J Bus Econ Stat 26(1):50-65, 2008) structural break tests.

A case study approach is used to analyze the cost performance of 16 rail projects constructed by a contractor between 2011 and 2014, which ranged from AU$3.4 to AU$353 million. Findings indicate that scope changes during construction were the key contributors that lead to the amendment of each project's original contractual value. As a result, there is a need for public and private sector asset owners to establish a cost contingency using a probabilistic rather than a deterministic approach to accommodate the potential for scope changes during construction. To improve cost certainty during the construction of rail projects, it is suggested that use of collaborative forms of procurement juxtaposed with the use of Building Information Modelling and Systems Information Modelling are implemented. The utilization of such technological and process innovations can provide public and private sector asset owners charged with delivering and maintaining their rail networks with confidence projects can be delivered within budget and are resilient to unexpected events and adaptable to changing needs, uses or capacities.

Finding the right balance between economic benefits and environmental costs is essential to reach sustainable development, ensuring that tourist numbers do not exceed the carrying capacity of the tourism destination. In this context, the author analyses the determination of the optimal number of visitors in a tourism-based economy and shows that if the tourist number is optimally determined long-run sustainable growth will be possible. He also shows that the optimal number of tourists is strictly smaller than the carrying capacity of the tourism destination, and that such a condition is vital to achieve long-run growth.","[Marsiglio, Simone] Univ Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Marsiglio, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Northfields Ave, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",simonem@uow.edu.au,"Marsiglio, Simone/K-2863-2012",,,,,,40,36,40,5,52,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A long quality, short junk portfolio (QMJ) is found to produce average risk-adjusted returns of 3.6 % per quarter (14.4 % annually). QMJ has a significantly positive coefficient when added as a dependent variable to a 4-factor model explaining U.S. real estate excess returns, including market, size, value and momentum factors, and leads to a small improvement in the overall fit of the model. Further investigation of the components of quality shows that profitability has a consistently positive relationship with real estate excess returns, while higher dividend payout is consistently associated with lower returns, in contrast to findings for conventional firms.","[Anzinger, Sara Kelly] SK Anzinger Consulting, NL-1094 JL Amsterdam, Noord Holland, Netherlands; [Ghosh, Chinmoy] Univ Connecticut, Sch Business, Dept Finance, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Petrova, Milena] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",University of Connecticut; Syracuse University,"Petrova, M (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Dept Finance, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",s.k@saraanzinger.com; Chinmoy.Ghosh@business.uconn.edu; mpetrova@syr.edu,"Petrova, Milena/AAX-5309-2021; ghosh, chinmoy/AAE-2935-2022",,,,,,0,3,3,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

In this paper, I introduce new data on IMF loan approval periods: The days that transpire between when a borrower submits a Letter of Intent to the Executive Board requesting a loan and when the Board approves that request. The data reveal considerable variation across requests. Why are some loan requests approved swiftly while others wait much longer for approval? I argue that the financial interests of the G-5 economies drive variation in responsiveness contingent on when a request was made. I expect that during much of the 1980s, as G-5 commercial bank exposure increases, borrowers will face longer waits for approval. In such cases, the G-5 should have been more likely to press for the use of the concerted lending strategy. This protected G-5 financial systems by catalyzing private financing on behalf of those countries, but it also delayed loan approval. Into the 1990s, global capital flows grew more complex and catalyzing private capital flows required a swift response. Thus, during these years I expect increased G-5 bank exposure to be associated with shorter waits for approval. In such cases, the G-5 should have been more likely to press for accelerated approval. A quick response would have the best chance of attracting back private capital and reduce the threat posed by the crisis. Statistical analyses of 275 loan requests from 1984-2012 support these expectations.","[McDowell, Daniel] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Dept Polit Sci, 100 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Syracuse University,"McDowell, D (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Dept Polit Sci, 100 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA.",dmcdowel@maxwell.syr.edu,,,Appleby-Mosher Fund,Appleby-Mosher Fund,"I would like to thank J.

We find that financial reforms are associated with improvements in within-sector, but not between-sector allocation of capital. These results imply that for South Africa to unleash the potential for take-off that is often associated with reallocation of resources from the primitive to modern sectors, reforms that focus beyond the financial sector are necessary.

These studies are usually based on self-reported hearing difficulties, which are potentially endogenous to labor supply. We use unique representative data collected in the spring of 2005 through in-home interviews. The data contains self-reported functional and clinically-measured hearing ability for a representative sample of the Danish population aged 50-64. We estimate the causal effect of hearing loss on early retirement via disability benefits, taking into account the endogeneity of functional hearing. Our identification strategy involves the simultaneous estimation of labor supply, functional hearing, and coping strategies (i.e. accessing assistive devices at work or informing one's employer about the problem). We use hearing aids as an instrument for functional hearing. Our main empirical findings are that endogeneity bias is more severe for men than women and that functional hearing problems significantly increase the likelihood of receiving disability benefits for both men and women. However, relative to the baseline the effect is larger for men (47% vs. 20%, respectively). Availability of assistive devices in the workplace decreases the likelihood of receiving disability benefits, whereas informing an employer about hearing problems increases this likelihood.

The problem is closely related to shortages in housing supply, which are, in turn, largely associated with constraints imposed by the English land planning system. A leading theory for explaining these constraints posits that they reflect political economy forces that convey the interests of current homeowners to planning decisions in disproportionate and excessively influential ways. We test this theory by examining survey data on public attitudes to house building in local communities; and by investigating whether these attitudes are related to local planning decisions. We find that there is a tendency for owner-occupiers to express greater opposition to local house building and that, in the decade to 2011, the housing stock grew significantly less in local authorities with higher proportions of owner-occupiers among local households. The results suggest the risk that planning decisions might have been distorted in favour of current homeowners is real and economically significant. We discuss a range of historical, socio-economic and policy trends that help explain why successive governments of various stripes have been reluctant to address head-on problems in housing supply and put a curb on house prices.","[Coelho, Miguel; Ratnoo, Vigyan] Inst Govt, London, England; [Dellepiane-Avellaneda, Sebastian] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Dellepiane-Avellaneda, S (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Sch Govt & Publ Policy, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",sebastian.dellepiane@strath.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L008289/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L008289/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L008289/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/L008289/1].,,106,22,23,0,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A multilevel analysis is carried out to examine the determinants of individual weight status and obesity, controlling not only for the individual effects and those of the immediate environment but also for the broader setting to which individuals and their immediate environment belong. Our findings suggest that attributes from all three levels of analysis have an effect on individual weight status and obesity.

The endogeneity of wages is taken into account with an instrumental variables approach; we find that the wage rate affects sleeping time in general, corroborating Biddle and Hamermesh's (1990) main conclusion. A ten percent increase in the wage rate leads to an 11-12 min decrease in sleep per week. But this number Masks several effects. The responsiveness of sleep time to wage rate changes depends upon the sex of the individual, whether or not sleep problems are present and general economic conditions. By far the largest adjustment is found for insomniacs in 2010, a year of general economic downturn in Canada. We also investigate the non randomness of insomnia in the population by using a Heckman procedure, and find that the sleep time of female non-insomniacs is even more responsive to wage rate changes once account is taken of this selection bias, but otherwise selection was not a problem in our samples.

Thanks to the specific subsidies provided to rural grid construction and transportation, 72% of the energy subsidies were distributed to residents in 2012, while fixed capital and export carried another 13% and 10%. Poorer urban household received higher energy subsidy ratio through dwelling and food expenditures, but lower ratio through transportation and communication expenditures. The overall energy subsidies are slightly regressive, thus adequate reform can narrow wealth gap on the one hand and reduce budgetary pressure on the other.","[Chen Zhan-Ming] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China,"Chen, ZM (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",chenzhanming@ruc.edu.cn,"Chen, Zhan-Ming/B-1351-2011",,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [14XNJ011],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,I thank the three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on the earlier version of this paper.

This civil movement of volunteers searches for the remains of fallen soldiers left on the battlefields of World War II all over Russia and has young people as its main target group. Despite in many ways being critical of the state, the Search Movement explicitly wants to make a contribution to the patriotic upbringing of Russian youth. In its work, the movement relates to the official government plans for patriotic education. Several obligations are central to the notion of patriotism: for the Search Movement, an obligation to the past, to remember, is the most important. In this article I will examine how the malleable concept of duty allows the Search Movement to carry out work implicitly critical of state failings in the name of patriotism.","[Dahlin, Johanna] Linkoping Univ, Dept Culture Studies, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Dahlin, J (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Culture Studies, S-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",johanna.dahlin@liu.se,,"Dahlin, Johanna/0000-0003-2040-913X",,,,,36,6,6,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2017,69.0,7,,,,,1070,1089,,10.1080/09668136.2017.1374353,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,FL1AT,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413946100004,0

The connection between the SP choices and corresponding elicited certainty ratings is modelled through an entropy-based measure of SP choice task complexity. Empirical applications of the proposed model are presented by using two SP survey datasets collected in Vancouver and Toronto. Empirical models reveal that the SP choice task complexity, measured through SP choice entropy, directly influences SP certainty ratings. Such direct relationship proves to be important through establishing an endogenous relationship between them. It is clear that capturing such endogeneity improves the efficiency of parameter estimates of the SP choice model. However, the level and extent of such benefit gains vary by the nature and complexity of the SP survey. Empirical investigation presented in the paper proves that both efficiency gain and higher goodness-of-fit are probable with the choice contexts with higher number of choice alternatives. However, even for the smaller number of choice alternative case, efficiency in parameter estimates can be increased by proposed joint model formulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, it is relevant to build a viable model for predicting the number of daily road accidents. One of the most important parts of the model is the model of daily seasonality. Since this seasonality exhibits a long seasonal period, approaches based on basis expansion can be used for its modelling. We also investigate the multiple seasonality pattern and specific time events which could potentially affect the number of accidents.

The reason is that a leader's information advantage can deprive followers of the information necessary for profitable defection. In this paper, we focus on situations where the decision to restrict access to information is an endogenous choice made by the leader. We experimentally investigate if leaders choose to strategically withhold information when appropriate to improve outcomes. To address this question, we adopt a single-shot collective action game in which a leader-follower setting with information advantage for the leader can potentially solve the free-riding problem and coordination failures. Our results suggest that leaders, in many circumstances, fail to utilize their information advantage to improve efficiency. This implies that groups may benefit if a nontransparent information regime is exogenously imposed on them.","[Komai, Mana] St Cloud State Univ, Dept Econ, 720 4th Ave South, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA; [Grossman, Philip J.] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Bldg 11,Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3000, Australia; [Benie, Evelyne] Wolters Kluwer, 100 South 5th St, Minneapolis, MN 55402 USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Saint Cloud State University; Monash University,"Grossman, PJ (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Econ, Bldg 11,Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3000, Australia.",philip.grossman@monash.edu,,"grossman, philip/0000-0003-2581-883X",Midwestern American University Student Research grant; Australian Research Council Grant [DP130101695],Midwestern American University Student Research grant; Australian Research Council Grant(Australian Research Council),Funding was provided by a Midwestern American University Student Research grant and an Australian Research Council Grant (DP130101695).

The population's awareness of the problem of Sosnowsky's hogweed may be viewed as one of the preventive measures to avoid the spread of the weed, which also allows optimally using financial resources. Research studies show that the levels of public awareness of Sosnowsky's hogweed and its harmfulness are different. The paper is based on the implementation results for the research grant Investigation into the Information Society regarding the Control and Hazards of Sosnowsky's Hogweed in Rezekne Municipality. The research aim of the paper is to examine the Rezekne municipality population's awareness of the harmfulness of Sosnowsky's hogweed and their wish to acquire or build up their knowledge about the harmfulness of Sosnowsky's hogweed based on the results of a survey/interview of experts and a survey of the population. The research results - the results of the survey and the interview - revealed that the population could identify Sosnowsky's hogweed in nature, and the population, including agricultural land owners/managers were sufficiently informed about the harmfulness of Sosnowsky's hogweed. For the population, the most appropriate way of acquiring information about Sosnowsky's hogweed would be Internet websites, even though the experts considered the websites to be a partly effective way of informing the public.

However, similar congruence between electoral support and development potential was not found in the case of most new parties. Spatial regression analyses then show that class conflict has ceased to be the unambiguous primary factor of political competition in the Czech Republic.

In this paper we examine the potential differences between iso-inequality contour plots for these two groups of measures, confronting with the properties of measure belonging mutually to both of the groups.","[Ostasiewicz, Katarzyna] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Ostasiewicz, K (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",katarzyna.ostasiewicz@ue.wroc.pl,,"Ostasiewicz, Katarzyna/0000-0002-0115-3696",,,,,16,0,0,0,0,WYDAWNICTWO UNIW EKONOMICZNEGO & WROCLAWIU,WROCLAW,"UL KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WROCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",2453-9902,,978-83-7695-693-0,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2017,,,,,,,331,342,,10.15611/amse.2017.20.27,0.0,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BP1SD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000540714200027,0

Information asymmetry occurring between actors makes that agent's actions are not fully observed by the principal. This leaves room for inefficient or undesirable behaviour from the agent. Voter turnout and education of councillors can be considered as variables improving agency relationship. Greater voter turnout is often argued to indicate citizens' awareness of public problems and greater interest in politics. That may create a pressure on the effective behaviour of the rulers. While the career concern model indicates that voters attempt to choose the most competent politicians who can provide them with more public goods. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these variables on the efficiency of public goods delivery within polish municipalities. Efficiency is measured by the PSE (Public Sector Efficiency) index. On the basis of statistical data published by GUS and PKW, two elections, in 2010 and 2014, are analyzed. Using a linear regression model for cross-sectional data we can estimate the significance of selected explanatory variables. Our results suggest that voter involvement has negative or no impact on efficiency and the education of councillors has positive or no impact on efficiency. This indicates that people's engagement in politics does not foster efficiency of the public sector, however, people may care about the education of candidates.","[Piwowarski, Radoslaw] Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Piwowarski, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Econ & Sociol, Lodz, Poland.",radpiw@uni.lodz.pl,,"Piwowarski, Radoslaw/0000-0001-7826-2527",,,,,13,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,354,360,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300035,0

For quarterly data of the 2001-2016 period, we find a robust positive impact of both government expenditure and revenue upon output in Ukraine. Otherwise, the fiscal policy transmission mechanism exhibits several standard features (e.g., as an increase in government expenditure after a positive shock to government revenue or widening of the budget deficit following an interest rate hike). Our results reflect the prediction of the Mankiw Summers model that tax cuts could be restricted under (i) strong demand for money of consumption expenditure in comparison to the investment-based demand for money combined with (ii) significant interest rate elasticity of investments. The results suggest feasibility of revenue-based austerity policies in Ukraine, as higher tax rates and better tax collection may contribute to economic growth even in the short run. The findings also imply that the real exchange rate depreciation brings about a decline in output and a symmetrical decrease in either government revenue or government expenditure. Also, there is a rather strong inverse relationship between interest rate and output.","[Shevchuk, Victor] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland; [Kopych, Roman] Lviv Natl Univ Named Ivan Franko, Univ Ska 1, UA-79005 Lvov, Ukraine",Cracow University of Technology; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ivan Franko National University Lviv,"Shevchuk, V (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",vshevchuk@pk.edu.pl; kopych_r@bigmir.net,"Shevchuk, Victor Oleksiy/F-9951-2019",,,,,,18,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-85-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,369,378,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BJ0TS,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417167000038,0

In the following section, Spencer's view of altruism is contrasted to that held by Comte, and then I consider the reaction of French political economists, defending the moral value bought about by their science. In the final section, I explain how the Comtean approach was re-enacted by Durkheim and then by Mauss, at the head of the sociology of religion section of L'Annee sociologique, the Durkheimian journal, to give birth to the theory of gift-giving behaviour that Mauss used to critique political economy in the 1920s.","[Steiner, Philippe] Univ Paris Sorbonne, Dept Sociol, Maison Rech, 28 Rue Serpente, F-75006 Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite,"Steiner, P (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sorbonne, Dept Sociol, Maison Rech, 28 Rue Serpente, F-75006 Paris, France.",philippe.steiner@paris-sorbonne.fr,,,,,,,53,5,5,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

The extent to which such balance is achieved is highlighted by the Beveridge curve. This paper examines the efficient operation of the Romanian labour market, as measured by the relevant indicators of labour demand and supply. In order to capture the evolution of these indicators across the three target sub-periods (the crisis, the rebound and the resumption of an upward trend), the timeline subject to survey was 2008Q2-2016Q3. The survey conducted to this purpose revealed fluctuations in the number and rate of job vacancies, respectively in the unemployment rate. However, in the last part of the surveyed period, the trend of such indicators was downward for the unemployment rate and upward for the number and rate of job vacancies. Even so, these indicators failed to match the levels recorded before the outbreak of the economic crisis. Due to such evolutions, the Beveridge curve presented shifts of direction specific to the three sub-periods. Throughout the last part of the surveyed period, the curve seemed to recover slightly towards the top-left direction at national level. However, regionally, the evolutions of labour supply and demand varied, and the Beveridge curves varied accordingly. Surprisingly, it was not Bucharest-Ilfov, considered the best economically developed area in Romania, which reported the best correlation between labour supply and demand, but the Central region.","[Steliac, Nela] Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Steliac, N (通讯作者)，Babes Bolyai Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",nela.steliac@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Steliac, Nela/ABA-2530-2020","Steliac, Nela/0000-0003-4661-836X",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2017,,,,,,,60,69,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BJ8CX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427987300007,0

The goal of spectral analysis is to create a decomposition of the original series into a large number of small independent components such as slow fluctuating trend, oscillator components, and structural noise. The advantage of spectral analysis is that it allows the identification and characterization of dominant trends and cycles, as well as seasonal and oscillatory components. In this paper. we will use spectral analysis to study the most important macroeconomic variables for Croatia. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to use elements of spectral analysis to get more accurate and reliable macroeconomic series that could be useful in evaluating and/or forecasting future economic developments.","[Tomic, Daniel; Stjepanovic, Sasa] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Tomic, D (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism Dr Mijo Mirkov, Pula, Croatia.",dtomic@unipu.hr; sstjepan@unipu.hr,"Tomić, Daniel/AAD-8845-2020; Stjepanović, Saša/AAL-4337-2020; Tomić, Daniel/N-7647-2019","Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096; Stjepanović, Saša/0000-0003-1938-3681; Tomić, Daniel/0000-0002-7309-6096",,,,,32,0,0,0,0,JURAJ DOBRILA UNIV PULA,PULA,"DEPT ECONOMICS & TOURISM, P.

One result of our study is that, in his analysis of institutional dynamics in the United States, Commons' rejection of laissez-faire is derived from a racist analytical framework: the superior races should be protected from the inferior races. Another result is that Commons adopts a neo-Lamarckian framework which takes education as the basis for the assimilation of inferior races. This article then shows that policies often defended as progressives, as education policies, may be derived from racist foundations.

Different techniques have been applied for analysing SQ and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is one of the most widely used due to its ability to address different kinds of variables and to model a whole phenomenon occurring at one time. Nevertheless, its confirmative nature requires previous knowledge, a hurdle that can be overcome by applying Bayesian Networks (BN) as a technique that learns directly from data without pre-assumptions. The aim of this paper is to apply a novel methodological approach in the field of SQ, based on a two-step process, which combines the techniques of BN and SEM, to model SQ in the Metropolitan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Service of Seville (Spain). In other words, in this paper, the proposed methodological approach has been applied to extract and confirm, directly from data and without necessity of assumptions, the possible relationships among the LRT service characteristics and how they are related with passengers' overall SQ perception. For this purpose, firstly, a BN was automatically learnt from the data and allowed to establish relationships between SQ dimensions describing the service. SEM was then used to check the SQ model and the relationships between the dimensions extracted from the BN. The model fit parameters of SEM and its consistency with the real life expected scenario supported and validated the SQ model designed in this study. Furthermore, the different relationships among dimensions extracted from BN were analysed and support the usefulness and potential of this methodological process that could lead to the development and confirmation of new theories and models in any field of knowledge based on data and expert supervision.","[Diez-Mesa, Francisco; de Ona, Rocio; de Ona, Juan] Univ Granada, Civil Engn Dept, TRYSE Res Grp, Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"de Oña, R (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Civil Engn Dept, TRYSE Res Grp, Severo Ochoa S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",rociodona@ugr.es,"de Oña, Juan/A-4762-2008; de Oña, Rocio/AAB-8720-2019","de Oña, Juan/0000-0001-7133-2481; de Ona, Rocio/0000-0002-5116-5652",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [TRA2015-66235-R]; FEDER of the European Union,Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); FEDER of the European Union(European Union (EU)),Support from the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness (Research Project TRA2015-66235-R) is gratefully acknowledged.

The study uses a dataset collected through a large-scale survey of the students of all four universities in Toronto. The specific aim of the study is to improve understanding of factors affecting the choice of acquiring drivers license by university students in Toronto. Unlike similar studies, it employs econometric approach for the disaggregate analysis using a unique dataset of social-economic, personal, transportation system and land use related variables. Results reveal that the living conditions of university students in the form of living with parents/family show the highest influence in delaying in acquiring drivers licenses. However, the empirical model also identifies that better transit accessibility plays the second most critical role in delaying the choice of acquiring a drivers license. Public transit pass ownership is proven to be an important mobility tool that discourages the acquiring of drivers licenses by the students. Students living in densely populated neighborhoods are more likely to delay or do not acquire a drivers license. Students who delay acquiring their drivers license may remain transit-users during their time as students and may also continue to have similar public transit use in future.","[Habib, Khandker Nurul] Univ Toronto, Civil & Mineral Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada",University of Toronto,"Habib, KN (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Civil & Mineral Engn, Toronto, ON M5S 1A4, Canada.",khandker.nurulhabib@utoronto.ca,,,NSERC Discovery Grant,NSERC Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),The study was funded by an NSERC Discovery Grant.

In this paper, we exploit advances in sequential monte carlo methods to estimate a time-varying nonlinear Taylor rule that addresses these four issues simultaneously. Our findings suggest that US monetary policy has experienced substantial changes in terms of both the response to inflation and to real economic activity, as well as changes in preferences. These changes cannot be captured adequately by a single structural break at the late 1970s, as has been commonly assumed in the literature, and play a non-trivial role in economic performance.","[Nguyen, Anh D.

The findings highlight how flexible scheduling has serious consequences for workers and causes insecurity. This provides managers with a powerful and unaccountable mechanism for securing control. The benefits for managers of using flexible scheduling to secure control are shown to be its ambiguity and flexibility. Moreover, flexible scheduling creates an environment where workers must continually strive to maintain managers' favour. Little evidence is found to suggest that this control is aided by work games obscuring workplace relations. Flexible scheduling does, however, enable misrecognition of workplace relations due to the schedule gifts which it entails. Schedule gifts act to bind workers to managers' interests through feelings of gratitude and moral obligation.","[Wood, Alex J.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England",University of Oxford,"Wood, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England.",alex.wood@oii.ox.ac.uk,,"Wood, Alex/0000-0003-0569-7145","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I017011/1, ES/I901957/1]; ESRC [ES/I901957/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was supported by funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (grant numbers ES/I017011/1 and ES/I901957/1).,,40,35,41,1,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It argues that the post-Soviet region shares a cynical and geopolitically driven view of the exercise of global power. Yet Russia has sometimes deployed its resources to advance short-term ideological objectives, whereas Central Asian foreign policy is pragmatic and opportunistic. The Ukraine crisis threatened to coerce the Central Asian states into conformity with Russia's interests; ironically, their dependence on Russia has enabled their freedom of action in foreign policy, within limits. The essay highlights the ways that geography enables and constrains the execution of foreign policy, and considers the ambiguous role ideology plays in the formulation of national interests and the prospects for international cooperation.","[Radnitz, Scott] Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Radnitz, Scott] Univ Washington, Herbert J Ellison Ctr Russian East European & Cen, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Radnitz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.;Radnitz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Herbert J Ellison Ctr Russian East European & Cen, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",srad@uw.edu,,,,,,,71,2,2,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,NOV 26,2018,70.0,10,,,SI,,1597,1611,,10.1080/09668136.2018.1536781,0.0,,,15,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,HG0NV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000454643300004,0

This paper compares the current critique of the notion of Bayesian rationality, proposed by Itzhak Gilboa, with Daniel Ellsberg's classic critique of Savage's understanding of rationality.

A positive stance towards a certain travel mode increases the probability that people will choose this mode for a particular trip. However, not a lot of studies have analysed whether people actually choose their preferred travel mode. In this paper we will look at whether respondents with a preference for car use, public transport use, cycling and walking will actually use these modes. Furthermore, we also analyse whether respondents who use their preferred travel mode (i.e., consonant travellers) are more satisfied with their trips compared to respondents travelling with a non-preferred travel mode (i.e., dissonant travellers). Results from this study, analysing leisure trips of 1656 respondents from the city of Ghent (Belgium), indicate that about half of the respondents chooses a non-preferred travel mode and that dissonant travellers can be mainly found within public transport users and least within cyclists, partly due to relatively low levels of public transport attitudes and high levels of cycling attitudes. Furthermore, travel mode dissonance seems to have an important impact on travel satisfaction. Consonant travellers have above average travel satisfaction levels, independent of the used travel mode, while dissonant travellers (except dissonant pedestrians) have below average travel satisfaction levels. This suggests that using a preferred travel mode has at least an equally important impact on travel satisfaction than the chosen travel mode itself.","[De Vos, Jonas] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"De Vos, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281 S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",jonas.devos@ugent.be,"De Vos, Jonas/AAJ-1298-2021","De Vos, Jonas/0000-0003-4919-2157",Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO) [12F2519N],Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)(FWO),"The author would like to thank the five anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions, making it possible to improve this article.

We provide evidence consistent with the model using a series of reduced form tests on data from 2005-2010. We then simulate installing bulk electricity storage on the US electric grid. We find that lower natural gas prices generally reduce the market gains and non-market costs of storage. However, direct non-market costs are still positive which means that there is no argument for subsidizing storage to mitigate pollution given the current mix of generating technologies; arguments in favor of bulk storage R&D subsidies ride on public good aspects of technology and dynamic investment incentives for intermittent renewables.","[Holladay, J.

The findings indicate that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among sectoral natural gas demand, sectoral income and various fuel prices. The results also indicate that most price elasticities are smaller relative to developed countries; the effect of fuel prices on natural gas demand is partly offset by the government regulation. In the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, China's natural gas demand will reach 340 bcm and 528 bcm and its foreign dependence will reach 27.9% and 43.2% in 2020 and 2030, respectively.

The land allocation model based on the theory of the multiproduct firm allows for jointness in production, and it is extended to handle non-allocable inputs. Specifically, the model is used to analyze whether the Food Security Act of 1985, known as the 1985 Farm Bill, increased flexibility in land allocation decisions by comparing responsiveness of land allocation among the crops, before and after the passage of the 1885 Farm Bill, to changes in total land availability and changes in crop output prices. The results confirm that a structural change in land allocation dynamics took place after the passage of the 1985 Farm Bill. We show that more crops (wheat and soybeans, in particular) become more acreage responsive to the changes in total land available for production after 1985. For example, the results indicate that competition for acreage between corn and wheat is associated with the implementation of the 1985 Farm Bill. The results provide evidence that the onset of the increased acreage allocation flexibility by farmers originated in the policies of the 1985 Farm Bill. The study also demonstrates that a policy targeting a particular crop will inadvertently affect production of other crops. This study quantifies these indirect effects on the five major crops grown in the USA.","[Vorotnikova, Ekaterina] Univ Idaho, Agr Econ Dept, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Asci, Serhat] Calif State Univ Fresno, Agr Business Dept, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Seale, James L., Jr.] Univ Florida, Food & Resource Econ Dept, Gainesville, FL USA",Idaho; University of Idaho; California State University System; California State University Fresno; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Vorotnikova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Idaho, Agr Econ Dept, 875 Perimeter Dr,MS 2334, Moscow, ID 83844 USA.",evorotnikova@uidaho.edu,"Asci, Serhat/AAE-9353-2020","Asci, Serhat/0000-0003-1259-729X",,,,,55,0,0,2,11,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In equilibrium, a gender pay gap creates an excess supply of desirable husbands and women marry early to increase their chance of being matched with an ideal partner, which results in a gender age gap on the marriage market.

However, network externalities are no isolated phenomena. They are based on competing standards in a comprehensive network of technology lines that are based on one another and remain to various degrees interoperable or compatible. As some evidence from the ICT sector inparticular shows, compatibility and tying or bundling of standards may be employed as strategic tools. The present paper investigates the economic role of tied standards for the dynamics of competition between standards. A replicator model operating on an aggregated level is complemented by an agent-based simulation with explicit representation of the network structure among users. A variety of effects are studied, including the role of initial usage share, manipulation of compatibility, expansion of vendors into other segments, as well as the network structure and central or peripheral positioning of agents. The agent-based model contrasts a complete network and a regular ring network with asymmetric network structures derived from Barabasi and Albert's preferential attachment mechanism and triadic closure.","[Heinrich, Torsten] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Math Inst, INET, Walton Well Rd,Eagle House, Oxford OX2 6ED, England; [Heinrich, Torsten] Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Hochschulring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Oxford; University of Bremen,"Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Math Inst, INET, Walton Well Rd,Eagle House, Oxford OX2 6ED, England.;Heinrich, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Inst & Innovat Econ IINO, Hochschulring 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",torsten.heinrich@uni-bremen.de,,"Heinrich, Torsten/0000-0001-8873-0806",,,,,40,5,5,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paper shows how to rationalise, under utilitarianism, the generalised entropies as ethical indices. In this framework a generalised entropy index is consistent with the principle of transfers if and only if the underlying utility function is increasing. This unconventional interpretation explains the strange behaviour of the generalised entropies for some values of the inequality aversion parameter, as identified by Shorrocks (Econometrica 48:613-625, 1980). In that case, the underlying utility function is convex. Then, it provides a solution to escape the so-called Hansson-Sen paradox (Hansson in Foundational problems in the special sciences. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, 1977; Sen in Personal income distribution. North-Holland, Amsterdam, pp 81-94, 1978) that affects the standard ethical indices and which corresponds to a counterintuitive increase in inequality as a result of a concave transformation of the utility function.

After briefly describing each crisis, I turn to the ways in which they intersect and the role of institutions in solving the crises. There are two central themes in the paper. The first is that the three crises intersect and feed on one another. The second is that, while institutions can often help, they are not panaceas. Existing scholarship on the EU often implies that the EU operates far from its institutional frontier and that substantial improvements in welfare are just around the corner if only we get our institutions right'. But institutional fixes do not exist for all problems.

Using quarterly bilateral Canadian-US data, we find such an interest rate rule to have little explanatory power for the early part of our sample starting in the mid-1980s, but to become more suitable to explain interest rate dynamics from the mid-1990s onwards. Whereas the exchange rate turns out to be the major determinant of the policy rate in the 1980s, its importance declines throughout the 1990s and 2000s, although it continues to be influential even towards the end of the sample period ending in 2015Q2. We also find interest rate shocks to have become more effective in influencing the macroeconomy over time, indicating that the BoC has continually gained monetary policy credibility. We associate this development with the BoC successively de-emphasizing the role of the exchange rate in informing interest rate decisions, thereby alleviating the potential monetary policy conflict between targeting the exchange rate and maintaining the price stability goal.","[Dybowski, T.

Whereas the life expectancies of gold and bronze medalists do not differ significantly, life expectancy of silver medalists is about 2.4 and 3.9 years less than these former, respectively. These findings are readily explainable by insights from behavioral economics, psychology, and human biology, which suggest that (perceived) dissatisfactory competition outcomes may adversely affect health. Competition outcomes that affect socioeconomic status (SES) could, therefore, play an important causal role in the positive SES-health gradient among the general population. (C) 2018 The Author.

The methodology employs a time-varying vector autoregression framework. The primary result is that despite having no evidence of time-variation within the propagation mechanism of Malaysian monetary policy the average contribution of a monetary policy shock to the variability of each macroeconomic variable: real GDP, inflation and the nominal effective exchange rate, differs between the two crises. This finding suggests that despite the propagation mechanism being relatively constant, Malaysia's monetary policy transmission mechanism evolves over time. We believe that the main mechanism driving this evolution is the time-variation in the variance-covariance matrix of the shocks of the model, not the coefficients. We also find some evidence that the implementation of capital controls reduced the influenceability of monetary policy on the Malaysian economy.","[Poon, Aubrey] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25A, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Poon, A (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Econ, HW Arndt Bldg 25A, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",aubrey.poon@anu.edu.au,,,Economic Society of Australia via the 2015 Peter Kenyon Memorial Postgraduate Scholarship,Economic Society of Australia via the 2015 Peter Kenyon Memorial Postgraduate Scholarship,"The author would like to acknowledge financial support by The Economic Society of Australia via the 2015 Peter Kenyon Memorial Postgraduate Scholarship.

Explanatory variables are drawn from an extensive literature survey and reflect a range of environmental and operational causal factors. Adverse weather has the largest impact on expected delay, followed by congestion during the metroplex peak. Airport operations peaks matter if they occur at times when the metroplex is busy. Other significant causal factors include surface congestion and arrivals from congested domestic hubs. The impact of the latter appears to be driven by the proportion of domestic traffic. The complex causal factors of delays suggest that regardless of the empirical approach, airport specificities are important in reducing delays.","[Lall, Ashish] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Lall, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",ashish.lall@nus.edu.sg,,"Lall, Ashish/0000-0002-9881-463X","Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore","Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore)","I thank the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore for a research grant.",,51,3,3,0,16,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

We measure efficiency by extending a cost-minimization model that treats the total amount of energy services produced as latent or unobserved due to technological differences in household consumption. The empirical strategy consists of applying latent class modeling to cost frontier analysis, which helps to identify heterogeneous subsets of units that require the fewest energy resources. Our estimates of efficient units form an empirical cost frontier of best practices within each subset.

Relying on a panel estimation of a gravity model incorporating cultural proximity parameters, we evidence the existence of a significant surge in the impact of the different components of cultural proximity during economic recession. The trade resilience among countries sharing a cultural bond is not a pure composition effect as it also appears within product categories. To understand this unexpected effect, we discuss different mechanisms that emphasise the potential mitigating influence of cultural proximity on some determinants of the trade collapse, namely the uncertainty shock, the increased moral hazard and the emergence of ethnocentric preferences.","[Carrere, Celine] Univ Geneva, FERDI, Geneva, Switzerland; [Carrere, Celine] CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland; [Masood, Maria] Univ Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Carrère, C (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, FERDI, Geneva, Switzerland.;Carrère, C (通讯作者)，CEPR, Geneva, Switzerland.",,,,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; Fondation de Famille Sandoz under the Sandoz Family Foundation - Monique de Meuron Programme for Academic Promotion,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government; Fondation de Famille Sandoz under the Sandoz Family Foundation - Monique de Meuron Programme for Academic Promotion,The authors are very grateful to Marcelo Olarreaga and Robert Staiger for their helpful comments.

Does economic growth follow the extension of HSR as a result of improved accessibility? This study investigates the impact of HSR on the economic geography of China. We find that HSR has improved the accessibility (as measured by weighted average travel time) of Chinese cities by 12.11% at the national level from 2009 to 2013. However, the accessibility benefit of HSR is not distributed evenly over space. Cities in the wealthy eastern region and with HSR access enjoy higher accessibility benefit compared with cities in the hinterland and without direct HSR access. Using a difference-in-differences analysis and an instrumental variable strategy to address the non-random placement of HSR stations, we also find that on average, HSR cities have experienced a significant increase in fixed asset investment after the inauguration of HSR service, which could stimulate future economic growth. The treatment effect of HSR on investment varies with city size. Second-tier cities with relatively large population bases benefit more from HSR in attracting investment compared with small cities and mega cities, which could experience marginal or negative investment growth.","[Diao, Mi] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Diao, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore.",rstdm@nus.edu.sg,"Diao, Mi/H-8615-2013","Diao, Mi/0000-0002-0389-4199",,,,,30,141,150,16,208,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

This distorts relative prices of alternative commuting modes and produces inefficiencies in the transport market. To mitigate this price distortion, parking cash-out has been suggested as an effective and efficient policy to reduce single occupancy car commuting trips. By rewarding the abandonment of car parking use rather than penalizing continued parking, parking cash-out makes commuters sensitive to the opportunity cost of workplace parking while, at the same time, circumventing the opposition usually associated with the imposition of transport user fees However, practical experiences are rare and only few studies investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of this policy option. This paper empirically tests the effects of parking cash-out on modal choice by performing a two-stage mode choice experiment among commuters in Germany. The first stage collects revealed commuting behavior data. The second stage proposes cash-out scenarios and observes stated mode choice behavior. The joint treatment of regular travel costs and cash outs allows comparing the traditional car travel demand cost elasticity and the parking cash-out elasticity. Results indicate that regardless of model specifications, parking cash-out has a negative and significant effect on the private car choice probability. This bears important implications for future transport policies.","[Evangelinos, Christos] IUBH Int Univ, Dept Aviat Management, Bad Honnef, Germany; [Tscharaktschiew, Stefan] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Traff Sci Friedrich List, Inst Transport & Econ, Dresden, Germany; [Marcucci, Edoardo] Molde Univ Coll, Dept Logist, Molde, Norway; [Gatta, Valerio] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Polit Sci, Rome, Italy",Technische Universitat Dresden; Molde University College; Roma Tre University,"Evangelinos, C (通讯作者)，IUBH Int Univ, Dept Aviat Management, Bad Honnef, Germany.",c.evangelinos@iubh.de; stefan.tscharaktschiew@tu-dresden.de; edoardo.marcucci@himolde.no; valerio.gatta@uniroma3.it,"MArcucci, Edoardo/AAP-5143-2021; Evangelinos, Christos/AAM-4500-2021; marcucci, edoardo/AAJ-6539-2020","marcucci, edoardo/0000-0002-9813-3973; Gatta, Valerio/0000-0003-1631-1797; Tscharaktschiew, Stefan/0000-0002-4697-3858; Evangelinos, Christos/0000-0002-2451-7544",,,,,70,26,26,4,39,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0965-8564,,,TRANSPORT RES A-POL,Transp.

While ethnic networks do not seem to have played a role in inter-republic trade during the Soviet Union, we find a positive and significant effect of ethnic networks on trade in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Examining neighborhood-level effects of traffic congestion on job access,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Congestion; Job accessibility; Urban form; Travel speed,ACCESSIBILITY; TRANSPORTATION; TRAVEL,"Traffic congestion powerfully influences urban transportation policy, particularly in regional planning where transportation projects are often prioritized and funded based on expected congestion relief benefits. Congestion is universally unpopular, and it is a short, intuitive leap from frustration with traffic to the belief that congestion is a major drag on connectivity to jobs and other opportunities and, in turn, economic vitality. While much work has focused on evaluating and relieving bottlenecks and project-level traffic delays, relatively little research has quantified the precise role of congestion in limiting access to destinations more broadly, with access defined here in terms of the travel time needed to reach potential destinations. Accordingly, this study (1) captures the precise trade-offs between peak-hour travel speed and job accessibility, and (2) estimates the greatest level of accessibility benefits that congestion relief could be expected to achieve. Using two different measures of employment access for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area, we find that travel speeds play a surprisingly small role in determining the time it takes to access job sites. One's location vis-a-vis these job sites, by contrast, plays a much larger role in determining access. In other words, the most densely developed places typically offer the highest levels of access, despite typically higher levels of congestion. We also compare these rush hour job access metrics for the Bay Area with hypothetical congestion-free peak hour conditions and find that such a dramatic transformation would result in only modest increases in employment accessibility in much of the Bay Area. Although some housing-rich, job-poor suburbs would benefit disproportionately from the complete absence of peak-hour traffic, we conclude that (1) while congestion does impede regional accessibility, it does so to a far smaller degree than is commonly thought, and (2) while dense development is associated with slower adjacent peak-hour travel speeds, capping development and limiting densities in order to maintain or increase travel speeds may have deeply counterproductive effects on overall accessibility in regions.","[Thomas, Trevor; Taylor, Brian D.] UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Inst Transportat Studies, 3320 Sch Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Mondschein, Andrew] Univ Virginia, Sch Architecture, Dept Urban & Environm Planning, 413 Campbell Hall,POB 400122, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Osman, Taner] UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Lewis Ctr Reg Policy Studies, 3250 Sch Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Virginia; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Taylor, BD (通讯作者)，UCLA, Luskin Sch Publ Affairs, Inst Transportat Studies, 3320 Sch Publ Affairs Bldg, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",tdthoma5@ucla.edu; mondschein@virginia.edu; tanerosman@ucla.edu; btaylor@ucla.edu,,"Mondschein, Andrew/0000-0002-8454-0463",John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation; University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation,John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation; University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation,"This research was generously supported by both the John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation and the University of California Center on Economic Competitiveness in Transportation, and the authors are grateful for this support.

Our analytical narrative traces this problem-solution-new problem pattern through four eras in which a common-pool dilemma is addressed by a private-good solution (1850-1880), a club-good solution (1880-1910) and a public-good solution (1910-1950) before returning to a private-good solution in the last 1950-1990 era. Actions, like the dates just given, were not always exact or effective, as the process was shaped by changing social norms regarding the distribution of costs and benefits from improved water services. This Dutch history is unique, but its insights can help improve drinking water services elsewhere.","[Zetland, David; Colenbrander, Bene] Leiden Univ Coll, Anna van Buerenplein 301, NL-2595 DG The Hague, Netherlands",,"Zetland, D (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ Coll, Anna van Buerenplein 301, NL-2595 DG The Hague, Netherlands.",d.j.zetland@luc.leidenuniv.nl,,"Zetland, David/0000-0002-7401-4443",,,,,70,5,6,1,6,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2382-624X,2382-6258,,WATER ECON POLICY,Water Econ.
