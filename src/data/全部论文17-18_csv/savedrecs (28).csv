Among the various aspects of institutions, ideology and the legal system are two important ones. Chongqing Municipality, a province-level region in China, experienced such a combination with a unique leader from late 2007 to early 2012. This paper investigates, via the Synthetic Control Method, the economic performance of Chongqing in the last 13 years. In particular, it discusses the impact of the red ideology movements and legal intervention undertaken by Bo Xilai. The results reveal that although his economic policies promoted the Chongqing economy, the Maoist political policies advocated by Bo partially undermined its economic growth in the short run.","[Zhou, Yang] West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"Zhou, Y (通讯作者)，West Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",ygzhou@mix.wvu.edu,,"Zhou, Yang/0000-0002-4537-9857",Joshua Hall,Joshua Hall,"I would like to thank two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and advice.

Empirical evidence from a sentiment-augmented TGARCH model demonstrates that there is an asymmetric property for all markets. The estimated coefficient of country-specific consumer confidence index used as a proxy for investor sentiment is statistically significant and negative for France and Germany, but statistically significant and positive for Ireland alone. The results provide evidence that in France and Germany, stock market volatility is sensitive to negative shock in investor sentiment, supporting the existence of the leverage effect; in Ireland, however, no such sensitivity exists. The results of this study should be of a particular interest for both domestic and international investors, academic researchers and policymakers in terms of international portfolio diversification. Investors can potentially improve their portfolio performance by considering investor sentiment, while policymakers can take steps to stabilize investor sentiment, thereby reducing stock market volatility and uncertainty.","[Aydogan, Berna] Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Sakarya Cad 156, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Ekonomi Universitesi,"Aydogan, B (通讯作者)，Izmir Univ Econ, Dept Int Trade & Finance, Sakarya Cad 156, TR-35330 Izmir, Turkey.",berna.okan@ieu.edu.tr,"Aydoğan, Berna/IYJ-8881-2023",,,,,,36,12,14,3,27,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

Institutions that facilitate the availability of credit information and contract enforcement mitigate refinancing risk and therefore growth volatility associated with short-term financing.

Expectations are updated through social dynamics and, with heterogeneity, not all firms choose to operate, putting downward pressure on realized inflation. Our model rationalizes why countries stuck at the zero lower bound have had a hard time increasing inflation without being aggressive. The same model also predicts that announcing an abrupt target to disinflate will cause inflation to undershoot the target, whereas announcing gradual targets will not.

We study whether this foreclosure-propensity affects lenders' securitization decision ex-ante. Due to the higher foreclosure probability, the value of a mortgage should be more sensitive to foreclosure costs if it is securitized. Comparing loans made in the same metropolitan area but under different foreclosure laws, we find that lenders are less likely to securitize mortgages in states with higher foreclosure costs, as measured by laws requiring judicial foreclosure. Two additional results are consistent with the proposed channel. First, the effect increases for loans with higher expected default rates and disappears for mortgage-like loans not subject to these laws. Second, the effect of judicial requirements increases for loans with higher expected default rates, consistent with differences in loss given default driving the results. Borrowers in states without judicial requirements also get riskier loans. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By using monthly customs data from France, we decompose exports into different extensive and intensive margins including two novel margins: the number of months the firms exported (frequency) and the average export value per month. We establish four empirical patterns. First, firms export less to markets with higher demand volatility. Second, this effect is mainly explained by the frequency margin. Third, volatility affects the frequency margin through two channels: indirectly through lower trade volume and directly through logistics re-optimization. In particular, our results suggest that firms send less frequent, larger shipments to more uncertain markets conditional on total exports. Fourth, the effect of demand volatility is magnified on markets with longer time-to-ship. We propose that these observations are in line with simple stochastic inventory management approaches.","[Bekes, Gabor; Murakozy, Balazs] HAS, Inst Econ, CERS, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Bekes, Gabor] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary; [Bekes, Gabor] CEPR, London, England; [Fontagne, Lionel] Univ Paris 01, PSE, Paris, France; [Fontagne, Lionel; Vicard, Vincent] CEPII, Paris, France; [Vicard, Vincent] Banque France, Paris, France",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Central European University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Békés, G (通讯作者)，HAS, Inst Econ, CERS, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.;Békés, G (通讯作者)，Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary.;Békés, G (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",bekes.gabor@mta.krtk.hu,"Murakozy, Balazs/AAH-8844-2021","Murakozy, Balazs/0000-0002-7666-428X; Vicard, Vincent/0000-0003-2847-1456; FONTAGNE, Lionel/0000-0002-6450-3593; Bekes, Gabor/0000-0002-6331-4408","European Firms in a Global Economy: Internal policies for external competitiveness (EFIGE); European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme [225551]; MTA Firms, Strategy and Performance Momentum Grant; MTA Bolyai Grant; Banque de France","European Firms in a Global Economy: Internal policies for external competitiveness (EFIGE); European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); MTA Firms, Strategy and Performance Momentum Grant; MTA Bolyai Grant; Banque de France","We thank Zsuzsa Holler and Boldizsar Juhasz for excellent research assistance provided.

These findings are stronger in settings in which adverse selection is acute and muted when the bank lacks experience with an exposure. Our results offer novel evidence on how bank characteristics are related to the type of financial information they use and support theoretical predictions suggesting portfolio concentration reveals a bank's relative expertise.

We 'conceptualize government elites in any post-conflict situation as rent-seeking agents who need to ensure the support of their key constituencies to remain in power. Power-sharing institutions especially cabinet-level, executive power-sharing institutions systematically shape these rent-seeking motives. Power-sharing cabinets create political coalitions dominated by small circles of government and rebel elites with direct access to state resources and low levels of loyalty toward the government leader. Also, the provisional nature of many power-sharing institutions increases rent seeking incentives: facing a limited time horizon in office, rent-seeking elites within the power-sharing coalition are likely to capture as many rents as possible before they have to leave office. Thus, post-conflict countries with power-sharing institutions should exhibit higher aggregated levels of rent-seeking measured as the level of corruption in a country. In a statistical analysis of all post-conflict situations during 1996-2010, we find that power-sharing cabinets substantively increase corruption in post-conflict countries and that this effect is stronger in the presence of natural resource rents. These findings add quantitative evidence to the debate about drivers of post conflict corruption. Moreover, they highlight a trade-off between short-term stability and long-term negative effects of corruption for post-conflict political and economic development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

On average, women experienced higher job losses than their male colleagues within the same firm. However, the aggregate adverse effect of such differential treatment was more than offset by women being disproportionately employed in firms hit relatively less hard by the crisis.

But people and firms should be able to learn from their experience of unusual weather and adjust their expectations about the climate distribution accordingly. The efficiency of this learning process gives an upper bound on the rate at which adaptation can occur and is therefore important in determining the adjustment costs associated with climate change. Learning about climate change requires people to infer the state of a changing probability distribution (climate) given annual draws from that distribution (weather). If the climate is stationary, it can be inferred from the distribution of historic weather observations, but if it is changing, the inference problem is more challenging. This paper first develops different learning models, including an efficient hierarchical Bayesian model in which the observer learns whether the climate is changing and, if it is, the functional form that describes that change. I contrast this with a less efficient but simpler learning model in which observers react to past changes but are unable to anticipate future changes. I propose a general metric of learning costs based on the average, discounted squared difference between beliefs and the true climate state and use climate model output to calculate this metric for two emissions scenarios, finding substantial relative differences between learning models and scenarios but small absolute values. Geographic differences arise from spatial patterns of warming rates and natural weather variability (noise). Finally, I present results from an experimental game simulating the adaptation decision, which suggests that people are able to learn about a trending climate and respond proactively.","[Moore, Frances C.] Univ Calif Davis, Environm Sci & Policy, 2140 Wickson Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Moore, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Environm Sci & Policy, 2140 Wickson Hall,One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",fmoore@ucdavis.edu,,,Neukermans Family Foundation,Neukermans Family Foundation,The author thanks the Neukermans Family Foundation for support of this research.

Using the panel data of the Nepal Living Standard Measurement Survey (NLSS), the poverty rate in 1995-96 was estimated to be about 40%, while in 2003-04 it was estimated at roughly 30%. Political instability has prevented the development of industry and threatened the food security of poor people, but scholarship on the factors contributing to food security is incomplete; while the determinants of food security have been mentioned in past research, prior studies have analyzed cross-sectional data and thus could not have omitted heterogeneity bias. This paper analyzes the change in agricultural productivity in real terms and the impact on household food security by using the panel data of NLSS in 1995-96 and 2003-04. This analysis reveals that growth is observed in real agricultural productivity in spite of land segmentation; the growth in agricultural productivity in real terms has a positive impact on household food security; and the lower a farmer's income becomes, the more positive its impact on food security. Therefore, advancements in agricultural productivity play a critical role in promoting food security at the individual and household levels.","[Morioka, Masako] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr Agr & Resource Econ, Lab Agr & Rural Dev, Kita Ku, Kita9 Nishi9, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Kondo, Takumi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Div Fundamental AgrSci Res, Agr Econ,Dev Econ,Kita Ku, Kita9 Nishi9, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University,"Morioka, M (通讯作者)，Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr Agr & Resource Econ, Lab Agr & Rural Dev, Kita Ku, Kita9 Nishi9, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.",masako@agecon.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"KONDO, Takumi/HPE-7657-2023","Morioka, Masako/0000-0003-3112-8616",[26450326]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26450326] Funding Source: KAKEN,"; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) Number 26450326.,,24,4,6,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

As research methodology we develop a Project Scorecard that is derived from the Balanced Scorecard and the EFQM model. This is used to connect the strategic decision making process to the operational level of a project in terms of objectives and expectations, by determining a proper set of parameters that can measure each element's impact on the project overall success. Our research focuses on two main parameters, staff and project maturity. Testing this tool is done by reviewing a sum of human resources documents and various employee surveys.

This study explores the coalitional politics in China's transition from foreign direct investment (FDI) attraction to domestic technology upgrading, which created winners and losers in the local allocation of government resources. Drawing on comparative case studies, semi-structured interviews and newly compiled data at the city level, the study finds that the varied levels of government support for domestic upgrading are shaped by coalitions for or against the transition. The major obstacle for bureaucrats within a city government to garner resources for domestic technology does not directly depend on the overall level of FDI. Rather, it comes from the vested interest of international commerce bureaucrats. These bureaucrats are more likely to form a cohesive coalition when the export share of foreign firms is large. At the same time, such a coalition is more likely to gain political influence when industrial sales are concentrated in large firms. The direction and magnitude of foreign capital influence, therefore, is channeled and manifested through local bureaucratic coalitions. This study sheds light on the politics of implementing development policies in an era in which globalization has cultivated fragmented interests within the local bureaucracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

(2013). This scenario is plausible when insiders are motivated to exploit their information advantage and discretionarily alter non-mandatory disclosure strategy. Conditional on higher insider trading profit, we uncover a positive relation between the firm-specific earnings transparency and crash risk. In addition, the above relation is more pronounced with respect to selling and profitable insider transactions. Overall, we demonstrate a potential dark side of high earnings explanatory power on stock returns, conditional on higher likelihood of non-earnings information hoarding. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Adopting a two-state Markov switching model, we find that, while illiquid stocks are affected more by economic conditions than liquid ones are during recessions, the differences in expected returns are relatively small during expansions. Therefore, the expected illiquidity premium displays strong state-dependent variations that are countercyclical. We show that the state of a high illiquidity premium is closely associated with periods of real economic recessions, market declines, and high volatility, which coincides with major events of liquidity dry-up and high liquidity commonality.","[Jang, Jeewon] Chosun Univ, Coll Business, Gwangju, South Korea; [Kang, Jangkoo] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Business, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Changjun] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Coll Business, Seoul, South Korea",Chosun University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Jang, J (通讯作者)，Chosun Univ, Coll Business, Gwangju, South Korea.",,"Kang, Jangkoo/AAI-9765-2020; Kang, Jangkoo/C-1591-2011","Jang, Jeewon/0000-0002-2691-7111",Chosun University,Chosun University,"The authors thank Bernard Dumas (the editor) and the two anonymous referees for valuable comments to improve the article greatly.

In this paper, we experimentally investigate whether the implementation of gender quotas in tournaments entail negative spillover effects on subsequent team performance and selection into teams. In three different team environments, we find that the presence of a gender quota does not harm performance and cooperation within teams, and does not weaken people's willingness to work in teams. Our results, thus, provide further evidence that gender quotas can have the desired effect of promoting women without harming efficiency. We further find that while women significantly base their decision to work in teams on their ability as well as the specific team environment, men are largely insensitive to these factors.

The major contribution of this paper is: to explore both micro- and macro-level factors which determine female labour force participation rate (LFPR); to examine the U shape female LFPR, by examining the likely income and substitution effects of the real wage increase, to identify the sub-sectors within manufacturing and service sectors that could create jobs for new female job aspirants and those older women displaced from agriculture in recent years; and thus to understand the conditions under which female LFPR could be raised. Using both macro-level and household survey (NSS) data, we find that the recent fillip in the process of structural transformation has pushed a large number of females out of agriculture. The growing mechanization in agriculture and rising capital intensity in manufacturing sectors together have limited the opportunity for females because of their low education and skill and due to other cultural constraints. We also found that the rise in real wages in rural areas and the consequent improvement in the standard of living has produced a strong negative income effect which outweighs the positive substitution effect and as a result female LFPR has declined substantially. However, with the massive increase in female enrollment in secondary and higher levels of education, it could be expected that the substitution effect of the increase in real wage would become stronger if appropriate measures are taken by the government, which are suggested.

We examine this question in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents and endogenous credit constraints based on Kiyotaki (1998). We show that there is a hump-shaped relationship between the degree of financial frictions and the amplification of unexpected productivity shocks. This nonmonotonic relation is due to the fall in financial frictions having two opposite effects on the response of output. One effect is the reallocation of productive inputs between agent types, which, while active, increases with the fall in financial frictions. The other effect is the change in the demand of inputs, which decreases with the fall in financial frictions. At low levels of financial development, the reallocation effect dominates and a fall in financial frictions increases the amplification of productivity shocks. In contrast, at higher levels of financial development, a fall in financial frictions decreases the shock amplification because the reallocation effect disappears while the effect on the demand of inputs is still present.","[Pinheiro, Tiago] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London, England; [Rivadeneyra, Francisco] Bank Canada, Res, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Teignier, Marc] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain",City University London; Bank of Canada; University of Barcelona,"Pinheiro, T (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London, England.",tiago.pinheiro@city.ac.uk; riva@bankofcanada.ca; marc.teignier@ub.edu,,,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-36719]; Generalitat of Catalonia [SGR2014-493],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Generalitat of Catalonia,"Marc Teignier acknowledges financial support from Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, Grant ECO2012-36719, and from Generalitat of Catalonia, Grant SGR2014-493.

While the notion that capabilities influence strategy dates back to the work of Andrews (1971, The Concept of Corporate Strategy, Irwin: Homewood), attempts to formalize a capabilities-based approach to strategy only began to take shape in the past 20 years. In particular, the publication of Teece and Pisano (1994, Industrial and Corporate Change, 3(3), 537-556), Teece et al. (1997, Strategic Management Journal, 3, 509-533), and Eisenhardt and Martin (2000, Strategic Management Journal, 21, 1105-1121) works on dynamic capabilities triggered a flood of debate and discussion on the topic. Unfortunately, the literature on dynamic capabilities has become mired in endless debates about definitions and has engaged in an elusive search for properties that make organizations adaptable. This article argues that the research program on dynamic capabilities needs to be reset around the fundamental strategic problem facing firms: how to identify and select capabilities that lead to competitive advantage. To this end, the article develops a framework that attempts to connect firms' capability search strategies with their strategies in product markets. It frames firms' capability search strategies as choices among different types of capability enhancing investments. The key distinguishing feature of capabilities in this framework is their degree of fungibility: capabilities span a continuum ranging from highly general-purpose (e.g., quality management) to highly market-specific (e.g., knowing how to manufacture an airplane wing). To illustrate the potential of the framework to shed new light on traditional strategy questions, the article applies the framework to explore some unexplained features of Penrosian diversification strategies. The article concludes by suggesting a research agenda for dynamic capabilities.","[Pisano, Gary P.] Harvard Sch Business, Soldiers Field, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Pisano, GP (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Soldiers Field, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",gpisano@hbs.edu,,,Harvard Business School Division of Faculty Research and Development,Harvard Business School Division of Faculty Research and Development,"The author would like to thank Pamela Adams, Felix Arndt, Giada di Stefano, Giovanni Dosi, Pankaj Ghemawat, Shane Greenstein, Michael Jacobides, Franco Malerba, Lamar Pierce, David Teece, Michael Tushman, Eric Van der Steen, Sidney Winter, and two anonymous referees for many helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article.

In this paper we examine one such spatially concentrated effort in Oslo, Norway, to test whether the program has succeeded in making the targeted neighborhoods more attractive as measured by house prices. The Oslo ABI is an interesting case as it distinguishes itself by its extensive emphasis on improving the social fabric of distressed neighborhoods. Place-based policies generate spatial discontinuities in program implementation. We exploit this in a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference approach, enabling a systematic pre/post comparison of house prices in treatment and control areas. We find that in two target areas there is a significant rise in housing prices, while in one target area there is no significant effect. Finally, one area experiences significant negative effects. Hence, the results are mixed which is not inconsistent with the existing literature. The estimated coefficients are remarkably stable across different model specifications, and the spatial error model also produces similar results. Moreover, the empirical findings of the paper are subject to several robustness checks, which mainly support our conclusions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Two Ricardian models are estimated: (1) a traditional Ricardian model of the impact of climate change on annual farm NR and (2) a structural Ricardian model that first estimates the number of growing seasons and then the net revenue per season. The traditional model reveals annual NR is sensitive to autumn and summer climate variables. The seasonal effects offset each other so that uniform marginal effects are insignificant. Future climate scenarios likely harm Sri Lanka but could either benefit or harm Indonesia depending on the climate scenario. The structural Ricardian model suggests climate change will reduce the net revenue of three-season farms and increase the revenue of one-season farms causing farmers to switch from three-season farming to one-season farming. Expected losses by 2100 for the region range from -10% to -18%.

Further analyses show that the relationship between gender-diversity and continuous disclosure is non-linear. Moreover, it requires more than one female director to have any significant effect on continuous disclosure, which is consistent with the critical mass theory.

We show that policies blocking foreign acquisitions to protect the domestic industry can be counterproductive. Foreign acquisition can increase domestic owners' investment in growth industries by reducing their financial restrictions. This calls for a financial efficiency defence in merger law.

We find that compared to non-industry specialists, advisors specializing in the target industry help acquirers garner higher announcement returns. However, there is no significant difference in acquirer returns between advisors specializing in the acquirer industry and non-industry specialists. The choice of a specialist advisor in the target industry benefits acquirers most when there is significant information asymmetry surrounding the targets. Moreover, the bulk of value creation comes from small- to medium-sized financial advisors, rather than large, top-tier investment banks.

Retained earnings have a net positive impact on firm value in the presence of growth options, high external financing costs and low default risk. High levels of retained earnings enhance debt capacity but have a negative effect on equity value due to the likelihood of losing accumulated cash balances in case of default, unless offset by high external financing costs. Opposite directional effects of retained earnings on equity and debt create a U-shaped relation with firm value.

In developing these results we show that these three well known propositions in economics also imply a new view of the business cycle, one where the business cycle is described in terms of the dispersion of an ex-ante probability distribution. The policy implication of this analysis is that bank regulation should go further than the Volcker rule or the Vickers commission proposal by restricting bank investments to currency and deposit accounts on the central bank. Non bank financial institutions should then carry out the financial intermediation function now carried out by banks. The paper proposes that post office banking perhaps augmented with blockchain technology sometime in the future is one way to implement the transition from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking. While little academic work has been done on full reserve banking in the aftermath of the Great Crisis, it is interesting to note that it is part of banking reform proposals now (July 2016) before the parliament in Iceland and a special national referendum in Switzerland.

These model features induce variations in the cyclical properties of inflation and the riskiness of bonds. The estimation identifies inflation as procyclical from the late 1990s, when the economy shifted toward aggressive monetary policy and experienced procyclical macroeconomics shocks. Since bonds hedge stock market risks when inflation is procylical, the stock-bond return correlation turned negative in the late 1990s. The risks of encountering countercyclical inflation in the future could lead to an upward-sloping yield curve, like in the data.","[Song, Dongho] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Song, DH (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Maloney Hall 382,140 Commonwealth Ave, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA.",dongho.song@bc.edu,"Song, Dongho/GXA-0139-2022",,Samsung Scholarship,Samsung Scholarship(Samsung),"I am immensely grateful to Francis Diebold, Frank Schorfheide, Ivan Shaliastovich, and Amir Yaron for their invaluable guidance in writing this paper.

This study examines one such relationship between the better known and most talked about climate anomaly, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the international prices of wheat, one of the most produced and consumed grain cereals in the world. The ENSO price relationship, moreover, is assumed to be characterized by nonlinear dynamics, because of the known asymmetric nature of ENSO cycles, as well as that of wheat prices. This study applies a vector smooth transition autoregressive (VSTAR) modeling framework to monthly spot prices of wheat from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada, and Argentina, as well as the sea surface temperature anomalies from the Nino3.4 region, which serves as a proxy for the ENSO variable. Results show that, overall, wheat prices tend to increase after La Nina events, and decrease after El Nino events. The regime-dependent dynamics are apparent with more amplified price responses after La Nina shocks, and with more persistent price responses during the La Nina conditions. This is consistent with the economics of storage, wherein shocks related to expected supply and demand are known to have a more pronounced effect in a low-inventory regime. Findings of this study have strong implications for development economics, as they point to an additional channel of adversity due to the ENSO-related climate shocks. Moreover, the ENSO-induced price fluctuations are likely to affect the dynamics of international food and cash programs during extreme episodes of this climate anomaly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using aggregated cross-country firm-level data covering 43 mostly developing economies, this paper estimates the marginal importance of the impact of various intermediate input trade cost barriers, namely tariffs, non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and services barriers, on firms' export behavior. In a cross-sectoral setting, this paper takes the firm's export performance in goods as a central focus to study the effects of these different trade barriers through the exporting firm's choice of use of intermediate inputs. The results show that the most significant trade barriers on inputs that impede export performance in developing countries are mainly NTBs and restrictions of services.","[van der Marel, Erik] ECIPE, Ave Arts 40, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium",,"van der Marel, E (通讯作者)，ECIPE, Ave Arts 40, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium.",erik.vandermarel@ecipe.org,,,,,,,39,2,2,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

This paper investigates two of the main potential channels childhood health and schooling outcomes through which the Eritrean Ethiopian war may have long-term economic impacts. Using unique child-level panel data from Ethiopia, identification is based on a difference-in-difference approach, using two points in time at which older and younger children have the same average age and controlling for observable household and child-level time-variant characteristics. The paper contributes to an empirical literature that relies predominantly on cross-sectional comparisons of child cohorts born before and after the war in war-affected and unaffected regions. The results show that war-exposed children have a one-third of a standard deviation lower height-for-age z-score and a 12-percentage point higher incidence of childhood stunting. In addition, exposed children are less likely to be enrolled in school, complete fewer grades (given enrollment), and are more likely to exhibit reading problems (given enrollment). While analyzing the exact mechanisms is challenging, suggestive evidence indicates that child health reduces child education, in particular the probability of child enrollment at school. These are disconcerting findings, as early-life outcomes can have lasting impacts during adulthood. Future research that focuses on mechanisms through which war affects children may improve the design of appropriate policies that aim to target and support children confronted with war.

Refugees in one of the three camps received food aid in kind, while in the other two camps they were given cash via cell phones provided by the UN World Food Programme. We find that refugee economies arise inside each camp, and the structure of these economies reflects the economic context around the camps. Despite undergoing forced migration and often living in destitute conditions, refugees actively interact with host country economies. Interactions with the host country result in a divergence of refugee households' income from the assistance they receive. A shift from in-kind to cash aid appears to increase refugee welfare while strengthening market linkages between camp and host economies. This finding is potentially important for refugee policies as well as for other types of development assistance, as donors find themselves under pressure to shift from in-kind to cash aid.

This paper revisits this proposition in a model with borrower moral hazard in which banks' NPL ratios depend endogenously on their loan pricing. In relatively uncompetitive loan markets, less-fierce competition for deposits (i.e., lower deposit rates) leads to lower loan rates and, thus, safer loans. In more-competitive markets, the opposite can occur: As banks' deposit-repayment burdens decline, they become less eager to risk-shift; this softens competition for risky loans, leading to higher loan rates and, ultimately, riskier loans. Overall, the model predicts a hump-shaped relationship between banks' pricing power in deposit markets and their NPL ratios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the promise and potential of cash transfers to empower women, the evidence supporting this outcome is mixed. In addition, there is little evidence from programs at scale in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of the Government of Zambia's Child Grant Program, a poverty-targeted, unconditional transfer given to mothers or primary caregivers of young children aged zero to five. The quantitative component was a four-year longitudinal clustered-randomized control trial in three rural districts, and the qualitative component was a one-time data collection involving in-depth interviews with women and their partners stratified on marital status and program participation. Our study found that women in beneficiary households were making more sole or joint decisions (across five out of nine domains); however, impacts translated into relatively modest increases in the number of decision domains a woman is involved in, on average by 0.34 (or a 6% increase over a baseline mean of 5.3). Qualitatively, we found that changes in intrahousehold relationships were limited by entrenched gender norms, which indicate men as heads of household and primary decision makers. However, women's narratives showed the transfer increased financial empowerment as they were able to retain control over transfers for household investment and savings for emergencies. We highlight methodological challenges in using intrahousehold decision making as the primary indicator to measure empowerment. Results show potential for unconditional cash transfer programs to improve the financial and intrahousehold status of female beneficiaries, however it is likely additional design components are need for transformational change.

Dispensaries are controversial as many believe they contribute to local crime. To assess this claim, we analyze the short-term mass closing of hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles. Contrary to popular wisdom, we find an immediate increase in crime around dispensaries ordered to close relative to those allowed to remain open. The increase is specific to the type of crime most plausibly deterred by bystanders, and is correlated with neighborhood walkability. We find a similar pattern of results for temporary restaurant closures due to health code violations. A likely common mechanism is that eyes upon the street deter some types of crime.

While migrants to small cities do not exhibit selection of any type, migrants to big cities are positively selected in terms of education, occupational skills, and individual productivity as proxied by their pre-migration position in the local earnings distribution. However, not everyone benefits equally from big cities and this leads to a second round of sorting. Returnees are not only ex-ante less productive than permanent migrants, but are also those who, following the first move, have least boosted up their earnings in big cities. Low realized earnings and unemployment affect return decisions of workers who moved to big cities at younger ages in particular, suggesting that older migrants may face less uncertainty upon moving to big cities.

We find that industrial sectors reliant on access to external finance tend to concentrate in regions with well-developed financial markets. Both foreign direct investment (FDI) and alternative financing channels are shown to play significant roles in shaping patterns of industrial specialization in China. In contrast, proxies for formal financial markets, for example, the banking system and capital markets, have few effects on regional industrial agglomeration. This result remains robust to instrumental variable estimation, alternative model specifications, and controlling for other traditional determinants of regional specialization.","[He, Qing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [He, Qing] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xue, Chang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Chenqi] NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10003 USA",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Chinese University of Hong Kong; New York University,"He, Q (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.;He, Q (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"He, Qing/AFO-6994-2022","He, Qing/0000-0002-6782-099X",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402181]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [13XNJ003],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,"We are grateful for the insightful comments of anonymous referees, Thorsten Beck, Iikka Korhonen, Laura Solanko, and the participants in the Second International Workshop of Regional Urban and Spatial Economics in China, the 2013 annual conference of the Chinese Economists Society (CES), the China Finance Review International Conference, and the 2014 Finnish Economic Association Annual Meeting.

In the early days of REDD+, such costs for tropical smallholders were believed to be quite low, but this has increasingly been questioned. A decade after the concept was proposed, direct payments to forest stakeholders remain rare, while concerns about safeguarding livelihoods are increasing. Households facing restrictions on forest-based activities will have to be compensated, yet evidence on actual costs to households, their distribution, and implications for efficiency and equity is limited. We estimate smallholder opportunity costs of REDD+ in 17 sites in six countries across the tropics. We use household data collected from multiple sites in multiple countries using a uniform methodology. We find that opportunity costs per tCO(2) emissions from deforestation are less than the social costs of tCO(2) emissions ($36) in 16 of the 17 sites; in only six of the sites, however, are opportunity costs lower than the 2015 voluntary market price for tCO(2) ($3.30). While opportunity costs per tCO(2) are of interest from an efficiency perspective, it is opportunity costs per household that are relevant for safeguarding local peoples' income. We calculate opportunity costs per household and examine how these costs differ for households of different income groups within each site. We find that poorer households face lower opportunity costs from deforestation and forest degradation in all sites. In a system of direct conditional payments with no transactions costs to households, poorer households would earn the highest rents from a system of fiat payments. Our findings highlight that heterogeneity and asymmetrical distribution of opportunity costs within and between communities bear important consequences on both equity and efficiency of REDD+ initiatives.

We compare quadratic voting to majority voting from two ethical perspectives: the perspective of utilitarianism and that of democratic theory. From a utilitarian standpoint, the comparison is ambiguous: if voter preferences are independent of wealth, then quadratic voting outperforms majority voting, but if voter preferences are polarized by wealth, then majority voting may be superior. From the standpoint of democratic theory, we argue that assessments in terms of efficiency are too narrow. Voting institutions and political institutions more generally face a legitimacy requirement. We argue that in the presence of inequalities of wealth, any vote buying mechanism, including quadratic voting, will have a difficult time meeting this requirement.","[Laurence, Ben] Univ Chicago, Dept Philosophy, 1115 E 58th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sher, Itai] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Chicago; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Sher, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",benlaurence@uchicago.edu; itaisher@gmail.com,"Laurence, Ben/ABH-3500-2020",,,,,,22,6,6,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2017,172.0,1-2,,,SI,,195,222,,10.1007/s11127-017-0413-4,0.0,,,28,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,EY2EV,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000403782200009,0

It is argued in such work that walking may be a critical factor, but the frequency of such interactions is generally unknown. For children, these community connections may increase independent travel and contribute to their well-being. Previous research out of Japan found that walking was indeed more likely to result in children seeing people in general and seeing a known person. However, it is not clear whether that is a culturally anecdotal finding, or whether similar findings would occur in different cultural and transportation contexts. Reasons why it may be anecdotal include: in most cases, all elementary school children walk to school in Japan; many trips occur at a local level and are conducted by non-motorized modes in Japan; greeting others (aisatsu) is a cultural value in Japan. This study examines whether one's transport mode relates to having incidental social interaction during their trips for children aged 10-11 in Canada (177), Japan (178), and Sweden (144). Further to previous work, the research carried out here asked the children what type of interaction occurred (spoke, waved, no interaction, or other) which would relate to building or maintaining community connections. The findings demonstrate that the results are internationally applicable and that most incidental social interactions result in a verbal communication in all three countries.","[Waygood, E. O.

This article reviews the strengths and weaknesses of such models. We argue that panel models are ideal for assessing climate impacts on agriculture because they use group fixed effects to absorb all time-invariant variation and thus rely on weather deviations from the mean that are random and exogenous. Using this random and exogenous source of variation is crucial to identifying a causal relationship between agricultural outcomes and weather. In addition, the large number of observations offered by a panel data set allows the identification of a nonlinear response function, which is an important step in modeling the effects of climate change, as the response can be highly nonlinear. Despite these strengths of panel models, they may still suffer from omitted variable biases of time-varying variables, such as pollution shocks, which are correlated with the weather shocks. Moreover, because group fixed effects absorb a lot of the signal in the weather variables, the signal:noise ratio might decrease. Thus researchers should be careful when constructing the weather variables in order to avoid having noise in the data that causes downward biases in the coefficients.","[Blanc, Elodie] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 400 Main St,E19-411D, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Schlenker, Wolfram] Columbia Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, 420 W 118th St,Room 1430A, New York, NY 10027 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Columbia University,"Blanc, E (通讯作者)，MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 400 Main St,E19-411D, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",eblanc@mit.edu; wolfram.schlenker@columbia.edu,,,,,,,47,94,103,3,44,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-6816,1750-6824,,REV ENV ECON POLICY,Rev.

We assess the validity of this assumption over an eight-year time frame in adolescence and young adulthood using nationally representative panel data from Australia. Our study shows that unconditional mean-level changes in personality traits are small-with the exception of conscientiousness which increases by 0.38 SD-because most individuals do not change their scores in a statistically reliable way during adolescence and young adulthood, or changes occur in equal proportions in opposite directions. Controlling for systematic panel attrition and multiple hypothesis testing, we demonstrate that personality traits do not systematically respond to the majority of common one-off family-, income-, and health-related shocks. However, a small number of life events-marriage, family members detained in jail, leaving the workforce and long-term health problems-are associated with subsequent changes in personality. In particular, youth who experience long-term health problems including bodily pain increase their external locus of control by 0.5-0.9 SD, an economically meaningful change when expressed in terms of hourly wage penalty.

In addition, we introduce a reminder condition that reminds investors about their selling plan if a limit is hit. Results show that the automatic selling device treatment significantly reduces the DEs, but the reminder treatment does not. Thus, the opportunity to ex ante commit to automatically selling at a loss causally reduces the disposition effect.","[Fischbacher, Urs] Univ Konstanz, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Fischbacher, Urs; Hoffmann, Gerson] Thurgau Inst Econ, Constance, Germany; [Schudy, Simeon] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany",University of Konstanz; University of Munich,"Fischbacher, U (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Univ Str 10, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",urs.fischbacher@uni-konstanz.de,,"Schudy, Simeon/0000-0002-4409-0576",,,,,39,50,56,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

This study applies an accessibility approach to investigate for most municipalities in ten countries in mainland West Europe if foreign transport supply is lagging behind, and if population growth in these municipalities has been affected by the limits that national borders have imposed on market access. To do so, data describing historical population changes and road networks between 1961 and 2011 have been used. The results show that in the study area, cross-border transport accessibility was not at a disadvantage in 1961 and has since then grown even more than domestic accessibility. However, municipal population growth has depended almost exclusively on domestic market access. Processes of economic international integration in the study area are found to coincide with the growth of cross-border accessibility, but do not have a clear coincidence with the effects of cross-border accessibility on population growth.","[Jacobs-Crisioni, Chris] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Growth & Innovat, Terr Dev Unit, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Koomen, Eric] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Jacobs-Crisioni, C (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate Growth & Innovat, Terr Dev Unit, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",chris.jacobs-crisioni@ec.europa.eu; e.koomen@vu.nl,,"Jacobs-Crisioni, Chris/0000-0001-6225-4813; Koomen, Eric/0000-0002-0676-1252",AESUS project in the VerDuS programme Urban Regions in the Delta of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) [438-11-014],AESUS project in the VerDuS programme Urban Regions in the Delta of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),"Before his death in 2013, Piet Rietveld provided many useful thoughts and comments that helped form an early version of this manuscript.

The SCE is an example of a growing trend observed in Latin America, where labor activation components have been increasingly included into cash transfers programs to support beneficiaries in finding more stable income opportunities. Despite this growing trend, not enough is known regarding the effectiveness of these components, especially on job quality. In this context, this paper sheds light on whether the provision of a comprehensive package of active labor market measures contributes to a successful labor market integration of cash transfers beneficiaries. Taking advantage of the panel structure of the Permanent Household Survey and exploiting the time variation in the assignment of the program as identification strategy, we apply difference-in-difference estimators to measure the impact on a number of labor market indicators. We find that the program affects positively the job quality of participants by increasing the probability of having a formal job and raising hourly wages. Moreover, the intervention is associated with a lower probability of having a low-paid job and working an excessive number of hours. These effects are, however, not homogeneous across all groups of participants. While the program is more successful among the younger beneficiaries, it does not contribute to an improvement in the labor market conditions of female beneficiaries, who in fact are the majority of SCE participants. Our results suggest that reducing dependency on monetary transfers through programs, such as the SCE, that are rich in activation components is beneficial for participants' labor market trajectories and therefore, it constitutes a satisfactory exit strategy to more universal cash transfer programs.

One effect of this is a change in the spatial distribution of accessibility, which may lead to people or businesses finding themselves temporally in areas where accessibility values are lower than either desired or required. This paper studies changes in automobile accessibility over the course of the day, as caused by congestion of the road network in eight metropolitan areas of the European Union: London, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Barcelona, Rome, Hamburg and Milan. The study was carried out using millions of data points on real speeds on segments of the road networks gathered over the course of two years from TomTom (R) devices, which provided for the incorporation of a dynamic perspective of accessibility. In each of the areas studied, the different impacts of congestion on automobile accessibility can be observed from differences in the distribution of opportunities and the provision of infrastructures, as well as from differences in culture and customs. Despite these differences, all cities experience two peaks with a lower value during the morning and afternoon. However, results show differences in the intensity and form of the effects of congestion on accessibility in these metropolitan areas. London, Paris and Rome are the cities where congestion has the greatest impact on automobile accessibility, while the Spanish cities are hardly affected by it.","[Moya-Gomez, Borja; Carlos Garcia-Palomares, Juan] Univ Complutense Madrid, Transport Infrastruct & Terr Res Grp T GIS, Dept Human Geog, Fac Geog & Hist, C Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Moya-Gómez, B (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Transport Infrastruct & Terr Res Grp T GIS, Dept Human Geog, Fac Geog & Hist, C Prof Aranguren S-N, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",bmoyagomez@ucm.es; jcgarcia@ghis.ucm.es,"Moya-Gómez, Borja/K-2780-2015; Palomares, Juan Carlos García/J-1310-2016","Moya-Gómez, Borja/0000-0002-0520-039X; Palomares, Juan Carlos García/0000-0002-8759-6809",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness as part of the SPILLTRANS [TRA2011-27095]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of DynAccess [TRA2015-65283-R]; ICT Theme of the European Union's Seventh Framework Program as part of INSIGHT [GA 611307],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness as part of the SPILLTRANS; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of DynAccess(European Union (EU)); ICT Theme of the European Union's Seventh Framework Program as part of INSIGHT,"The authors would like to thank for funding this research the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness as part of the SPILLTRANS, (TRA2011-27095) project, the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of DynAccess (TRA2015-65283-R) project, and the ICT Theme of the European Union's Seventh Framework Program as part of INSIGHT (GA 611307) project.

Surrender can be explained rationally if it constitutes the last resort providing liquidity in the event of an urgent need of cash. Yet we find clear evidence in German panel data that for more than half of all surrendered contracts investors had cheaper options available to provide the required liquidity. This finding demonstrates that there must be other factors influencing this important life decision. We provide a behavioral explanation, focusing on the role of individual decision heuristics, financial literacy, and financial advice. In particular, we show that financial literacy and financial advice can mitigate the behavioral temptation to lapse, while the tendency to rely on heuristics increases lapse probability.

We focused on the dynamic relationship between births, marriages, and economic indicators, using time-series data covering the period 1960-2014. Our empirical analysis was based on impulse response functions and forecast error variance decomposition in the framework of vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Our main results showed that birth rate and marriage rate positively responded to income and employment shocks, with the estimated responses being sizable, especially for the birth rate. Income effects and status-shifts effects (proxied by private consumption) influenced the birth rate and marriage rate in opposite ways. The unemployment rate produced strong negative effects on births, while marriage rate responses were substantially lower. Innovation accounting showed that a large proportion of the h-step forecast error variance of birth and marriage rate was accounted for by innovations (shocks) in the economic indicator variables for long-term horizons. The ongoing Greek economic crisis has contributed to the (negative) responses of births and marriages to income and employment shocks. Responses to the unemployment rate were still large when excluding the crisis years or when removing crisis effects on the series' long-run component (trend).","[Salamaliki, Paraskevi K.] Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Patras 26504, Greece",University of Patras,"Salamaliki, PK (通讯作者)，Univ Patras, Dept Econ, Univ Campus, Patras 26504, Greece.",paraskevi.salamaliki@upatras.gr,,,,,,,44,2,2,1,17,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

The intra-firm spillovers increase when conglomerates have excess cash and when managers have more influence over its distribution, but decline in the presence of strong governance. These spillovers are associated with weaker performance and lower firm value.

We attempt to test the hypothesis that an increase in fund risk actually increases the net flows of equity funds, which is a basic assumption of risk shifting. We find that a change in fund risk has a positive and convex relationship with the fund's net flows. The effect of risk changes on net flows is a natural consequence of its effects on inflows and outflows. This paper's empirical results are robust to return frequency, fund age, and fund size.

A mixed qualitative-quantitative research design was employed using equal samples of 30 and, subsequently, of 800 individuals from Romania and South Africa. Based on a comprehensive literature review on satisfaction and its constructs and on Generation Y, a model for explaining satisfaction was built and tested in Romania and South Africa on the two designated age layers using logistic regression.

Our new identification approach constructs firm-level shareholder distraction measures, by exploiting exogenous shocks to unrelated parts of institutional shareholders' portfolios. Firms with distracted shareholders are more likely to announce diversifying, value-destroying, acquisitions. They are also more likely to grant opportunistically timed CEO stock options, more likely to cut dividends, and less likely to fire their CEO for bad performance. Firms with distracted shareholders have abnormally low stock returns. Combined, these patterns are consistent with a model in which the unrelated shock shifts investor attention, leading to a temporary loosening of monitoring constraints.","[Kempf, Elisabeth] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Manconi, Alberto; Spalt, Oliver] Tilburg Univ, POB 90163, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Manconi, Alberto] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",University of Chicago; Tilburg University; Bocconi University,"Spalt, O (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, POB 90163, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",o.g.spalt@uvt.nl,"Kempf, Elisabeth/HKN-0558-2023","MANCONI, Alberto/0000-0002-8254-4241",,,,,55,113,135,18,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

My results indicate that price elasticities for exports and imports hardly satisfy the Marshall-Lerner condition in either of the two regimes.

Whether or not institutional change occurs depends on the incentives and capacities of political actors. This article argues that the legal environment is one factor influencing incentives for institutional change. Three case studies of land governance in Southeast Asia's palm oil industry illustrate three types of legal environment rule-by-law legalism, legal pluralism and lawlessness, or routinized illegality. The cases show that the legal environment shapes modes of resistance to property reallocations in the palm oil industry. Rule-by-law legalism supports legalized modes of resistance through the court system. In contrast, legal pluralism and lawlessness favor the use of political strategies to contest property reallocations. The mode of resistance in turn determines whether actors acquiring property have incentives to gain legal cover, or whether investing in political resources is more rewarding. Although the effectiveness of resistance is largely determined by the distribution of political resources, the mode of resistance helps explain whether there is demand for property rights institutions that offer generalized legal certainty in property protection. Path-dependence arising from the legal environment therefore influences the direction of institutional change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study worldwide which empirically investigates citizens' preferences for the spatial distribution of benefits accruing from a transport investment plan. We conducted two Stated Choice experiments: one involving an investment plan for travel time savings, the other involving an investment plan for traffic safety. Our results show that in the context of travel time savings, a vast majority of citizens has a strong preference for spatial equality. When the investment program involves traffic safety improvements, the share of citizens that has a preference for spatial equality is considerably smaller. Specifically, using a Latent class discrete choice analysis we identified distinct segments. The first segment has a very strong preference for the investment program having the largest total reduction in traffic deaths; the second segment assigns a substantial value to an equal distribution of reductions of traffic deaths across the Netherlands. Highly educated citizens are found to have a relatively strong preference for spatial equality as compared to low educated citizens. Contrary to our expectations, explanatory variables such as political orientation, income, car ownership and region of residence do not appear to associate with citizens' preferences for spatial equality.

On the basis of panel data of 630 companies for 2008-2014, which is after the completion of China's split-share structure reform, an entity fixed-effects model is used to study the effect of qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) shareholdings on the operating performance of Chinese non-financial transnational corporations. The results show that the QFII shareholdings ratio and shareholdings checks and balances degree are significantly positively correlated with return on equity and total assets turnover, but they have no significant correlation with asset liability ratio and sales growth rate. The evidence therefore suggests that the higher the QFII shareholdings ratio is, the higher the enthusiasm is for QFII shares participating in corporate governance, and the better the general corporate operating performance.

The model exhibits inflexibilities for workers and entrepreneurs, which arise due to complementarities in production. In addition, it allows for volatile value of leisure to make flexibility in hours desirable. Differences in occupation-specific flexibility, disciplined with the observed patterns in hours (level, persistence, dispersion) and income (persistence, dispersion), can explain relatively low income levels of entrepreneurs in the US and the occupation-specific distributions of working hours and income. Policy relevance of the model features is discussed using experiments of workweek restrictions and income taxation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

On the technical front, we generalize the dynamic delta hedging strategy developed by Cairns (2011) to incorporate the situation when population basis risk exists. On the economic front, we discuss the potential financial benefits of an index-based hedge over a bespoke risk transfer. By considering data from a large group of national populations, we find evidence supporting the diversifiability of population basis risk. We further propose a customized surplus swapexecuted between a hedger and reinsurerto utilize the diversifiability. As standardized instruments demand less illiquidity premium, a combination of a dynamic index-based hedge and the proposed customized surplus swap may possibly be a more economical (and equally effective) alternative to a bespoke risk transfer.","[Zhou, Kenneth Q.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Li, Johnny Siu-Hang] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Risk Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Zhou, KQ (通讯作者)，Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",kenneth.zhou@uwaterloo.ca; shli@uwaterloo.ca,,"Zhou, Kenneth/0000-0002-6809-5208",Global Risk Institute; Society of Actuaries Center of Actuarial Excellence Programme; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-356050-2013],Global Risk Institute; Society of Actuaries Center of Actuarial Excellence Programme; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"Kenneth Q.

Employing a de facto measurement of these restrictions for a sample of 111 Exchange rates countries from 1980 to 2010, we show that the impact of government ideology on a country's Impossible trinity position in this trilemma is highly context dependent: we find that its impact on exchange rate stability and monetary independence varies between developed and developing countries. We also show that the impact of government ideology on these two trilemma components is contingent on the stance of the respective economy's business cycle. Left-leaning governments seem to favor exchange rate stability over monetary independence in case of a negative output gap; suggesting a reversal of their commonly assumed partisan preferences in economically tight times.","[Beckmann, Joscha; Ademmer, Esther; Schweickert, Rainer] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Beckmann, Joscha] Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany; [Belke, Ansgar] Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Ruhr University Bochum; University of Duisburg Essen,"Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.;Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Ruhr Univ Bochum, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.;Beckmann, J (通讯作者)，Chair Int Econ, Fac Econ, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",joscha.beckmann@ifw-kiel.de,"Beckmann, Joscha/J-4234-2019",,,,,,17,12,12,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

The combination scheme takes into account not only the portfolio objective function but also the portfolio characteristics in order to define the mixing weights. Three important advantages are that i) it does not require a proxy for the latent conditional covariance matrix, ii) it does not require optimization of the combination weights, and iii) can be calibrated in order to adjust the influence of the best performing models. Empirical application involving a data set with 50 assets over a 10-year time span shows that the proposed economic-based combinations of multivariate volatility forecasts leads to mean-variance portfolios with higher risk-adjusted performance in terms of Sharpe ratio as well as to minimum variance portfolios with lower risk on an out-of-sample basis with respect to a number of benchmark specifications.","[Caldeira, Joao F.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Moura, Guilherme V.; Santos, Andre A.

Parties shape the selection of politicians by manipulating information about the quality of their candidates. An increase in the rewards from public offices leads to two opposing effects on the average quality of politicians. The first is a selection effect, whereby more skilled citizens enter politics, leading to an increase in average quality. The second is a manipulation effect, as parties have the incentive to further manipulate information to increase the probability of election for their unskilled candidates, from whom they can extract higher rents in the form of service duties. We find that the second effect dominates when (i) parties' costs of manipulating information are sufficiently low; (ii) even in the absence of manipulation, the quality of information available to citizens about candidates is sufficiently poor; and (iii) the net gains from becoming a politician for unskilled citizens are sufficiently larger than those for skilled citizens.

This was known as the Right to Buy (RTB) policy. Although this internationally unique policy was the largest source of public privatization revenue in the UK and raised home ownership as a share of housing tenure by around 15%, the policy has been little analyzed by economists. We investigate the equilibrium housing policy of the public authority in terms of quality and quantity of publicly-provided housing both in the absence and presence of a RTB policy. We find that RTB can improve the aggregate welfare of low-income households only if the council housing quality is sufficiently low such that middle-wealth households have no incentive to exercise RTB.

Two economies are compared. In the first economy, there is perfect risk sharing, i.e., individuals can credibly commit on a set of transfers that will remove ex-post inequalities in consumption. In the second economy, no risk sharing takes place. By referring to the literature on background risks, I determine some conditions in terms of change in risk aversion and prudence, which guarantee an increase in self-protection under inefficient risk sharing. Generally speaking, if self-protection reduces the risk of inequality, the investment tends to rise when either the probability of a catastrophic event and/or the risk of inequality are sufficiently low. If self-protection increases the risk of inequality, the investment tends to rise when both the probabilities of aggregate loss and the increase in the risk of inequality are sufficiently small.","[Ferranna, Maddalena] Princeton Univ, Univ Ctr Human Values, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Ferranna, Maddalena] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University,"Ferranna, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Univ Ctr Human Values, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Ferranna, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",ferranna@princeton.edu,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,1,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

In this paper, we investigate which mode of collaboration (joint research, contract research, consulting, in-licensing, or informal contacts) is more likely to be initiated and managed by firm employees versus by university scientists. Moreover, we are interested in the differences between small and large firms to see whether initiation and management are affected by firm size. Using a sample of 833 German manufacturing firms, our results indicate that university scientists typically start collaborations with industry, while firm employees would take over the management of projects. Results vary markedly between small and large firms, with university scientists having somewhat higher difficulties initiating collaborations with large firms than with small firms.","[Goel, Rajeev K.] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61761 USA; [Goktepe-Hulten, Devrim] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Lund, Sweden; [Grimpe, Christoph] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Illinois State University; Lund University; Copenhagen Business School,"Grimpe, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Innovat & Org Econ, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",rkgoel@ilstu.edu; devrim.goktepe-hulten@fek.lu.se; cg.ino@cbs.dk,"Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023","Grimpe, Christoph/0000-0002-7644-2054; Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196; Goktepe-Hulten, Devrim/0000-0001-5050-175X",,,,,72,37,41,4,84,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

In that period, municipalities followed either majoritarian or proportional (PR) systems, depending on the population size. The article provides evidence that the PR system results in smaller municipalities' own revenue, larger intergovernmental transfers and, consequently, greater vertical fiscal imbalance. It is demonstrated that the reduction in own revenue under the PR system is arguably driven by lower accountability of policy-makers, which leads to lower effort of policy-makers in stimulating local labour markets and entrepreneurship. An increase in intergovernmental grants, in turn, can be explained by a larger share of incumbents affiliated with national political parties.","[Kantorowicz, Jarosiaw] Leiden Univ, Inst Secur & Global Affairs, POB 132282501 EE, The Hague, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Kantorowicz, J (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Inst Secur & Global Affairs, POB 132282501 EE, The Hague, Netherlands.",j.j.kantorowicz@fgga.leidenuniv.nl,,"Kantorowicz, Jaroslaw/0000-0002-1186-5427",,,,,81,8,9,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

The level of competitiveness among companies in this sector is very high. To retain their position or even speed up the growth, market players continuously use takeovers as one of the major tools embedded in their strategies. Nevertheless, despite this fact, the concentration level on this market has stayed relatively stable for the last two decades. Furthermore, it is also confirmed in the literature that such transactions usually tend to deteriorate value for the buyers and their shareholders. Based on the sample of 127 deals taking place between 1998 and 2011, this study uses a quantitative analysis to evaluate the impact of takeovers on acquirers. It covers event and accounting studies. Depending on the time window used in this study, the results show either lack of statistically significant effect of acquisition on buyers or that such impact is negative. These conclusions are in line with the existing literature findings.","[Raciborski, Michal] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Management, Fac Microecon, Aleja Niepodleglosci 10, PL-60101 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Raciborski, M (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Management, Fac Microecon, Aleja Niepodleglosci 10, PL-60101 Poznan, Poland.",michal.raciborski@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,0,1,1,8,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

I compare these indices to Working's formula for 21 futures contracts, including commodity, financial, cash-settled and physical delivery contracts. I apply these indices to investigate the relationship between speculation and volatility of the NYMEX's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures contract, over 1986 through 2015, while controlling for market fundamental risk.

The findings show that: I) cross-licensing cannot necessarily enhance the degree of collusion, and further harms the consumer surplus and social welfare under quantity competition; II) when the rivals have the participated motivation to license, the outcomes of licensing games depend on the magnitude of innovation, the degree of differentiation on production cost and quality between the enterprises. With a small non-drastic innovation, only cost-reducing/quality-improving licensing occurs if there is a small/large cost difference and small quality difference. However, cross-licensing upon quality-cost does occur if small cost difference and large quality difference. Once with a major non-drastic or drastic innovation, only quality-improving licensing occurs regardless of production cost or product quality difference; III) in contrast that quality-improving technology could help increase the willing-to-pay by consumers with no drop on population, the enterprise that holds cost-reducing technology with drastic innovation could make zero production of the rival of expel it before/after licensing contract; IV) the cross-licensing parties with incomplete bargaining power happen to have the consistent aims to increase industry profit, which promotes the industry a virtuous cycle; V) government would rather support the post-outcome of cross-licensing than courage the ex-ante formation of R & D cooperation.","[Zhao, Dan] Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Dan] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antal Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China",Henan University of Science & Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhao, D (通讯作者)，Henan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Management, Luoyang 471023, Peoples R China.",zhaodan911@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71472121, 71672071]; Doctoral research start-up fund of HAUST [4019/13480023]; Humanity and Social Science nurturing foundation of HAUST",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Doctoral research start-up fund of HAUST; Humanity and Social Science nurturing foundation of HAUST,"I am very grateful to the editor and the anonymous referees for their insightful comments that have significantly improved this paper, and thank seminar participants at Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University for their helpful comments.

The research objective is to give to organizations a model of innovation management system as part of an integrated management system. Defining the model of innovation management system is based on the four perspectives of the balanced scorecard tool, namely: financial perspective, learning and development, internal processes and customers. In the process of defining the model several steps were taken, such as: literature review, data collection from the enterprise level through a questionnaire, analysis and correlation of data and finally the proposed model has been operationalized. In order to have a working model that can be easily adopted by any interested company, the research was deepen to the organizational processes, identifying nine processes specific for innovation that exist in an organization. Each of the nine processes have been operationalized using a SIPOC model (Suppliers - Inputs - Process - Outputs - Customers). The system for managing innovation may therefore have a positive influence on the ability and awareness of enterprises in innovation actions, and by defining this model the research conducted in this article helps to improve the efficiency of innovation, with direct implications in business performance.","[Maier, Dorin; Maier, Andreea] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Sven-Joachim, Irmer; Fortmuller, Astrid] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Technical University of Cluj Napoca; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Maier, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",,"Maier, Dorin/C-1931-2015; Dorin, Maier/S-3377-2019; Maier, Andreea/AAB-9967-2020","Maier, Dorin/0000-0002-3888-2251; Dorin, Maier/0000-0002-3888-2251;",,,,,16,26,29,0,44,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2017,19.0,44,,,,,302,314,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EN1CB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395746900019,0

Using a record of monthly credit rating migration data on all U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities rated by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch between 1985 and 2012 (154,600 tranches), our results provide empirical evidence that rating agencies put more effort in rating and outlook revisions when tranches have assigned multiple ratings. Furthermore, we see that in the case of multiple ratings, agencies do a better job in discriminating tranches with respect to default risk. On the downside, we observe a shift in collateral towards senior tranches and incentives for issuers to engage in rating shopping activities, but find no evidence that rating agencies exploit such behavior to attract more rating business. Our results contribute to the literature on information production of credit ratings and extend the perspective to the monitoring period after issuance.

The author first derives a gravity model from a firm-heterogeneity model of trade, then measures product quality as the residual of the gravity model. In estimating the gravity model, the author employs the two-step procedure of Helpman et al. (Q J Econ 123(2):441-487, 2008) to correct for biases caused by selection in trade and firm heterogeneity. When aggregated into the country level, the used overall quality metrics do not systematically differ from Hallak and Schott's (Q J Econ 126(1):417-474, 2011). In line with existing literature, sectoral quality estimates are found positively correlated with sectoral unit prices as well as countries' income per capita. And the quality gap between rich and poor countries is more pronounced in capital- and skill-intensive sectors. In addition, the autor finds beta- and sigma-convergence in sectoral product quality across countries.","[Tian, Xian-Liang] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, 217 Jianshan St, Dalian 116025, Liaoning Provin, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Tian, XL (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, 217 Jianshan St, Dalian 116025, Liaoning Provin, Peoples R China.",xianliangtian@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Based on the recovery information over a long horizon from 1986 to 2012, we find that an obligor-varying linear factor model presents significant improvements in explaining the variations of recovery rates with a remarkably high intra-class correlation being observed. It emphasizes that the inclusion of an obligor-varying random effect term has effectively explained the unobservable firm level information shared by instruments of the same issuer and thus results in an improvement of predictive accuracy of recovery rates. The empirical results show that the latent economic cyclical effects have been well represented by firm level heterogeneity, and strong evidence is presented for the normal distributional assumption of the recovery rates. Finally, we demonstrate the choice of recovery rate models may influence portfolio risk with the obligor-varying factor model generating a more right clustered loss distribution than other regression methods on the aggregated portfolio.

In the article we want to put attention on the most problematic region of Slovakia in terms of municipalities' size. Identification of the areas affected the most is the primary goal of the article. Through the analysis of the region and its districts we want to emphasise the undesirable state of those municipalities that do not provide services in the scope as it is stated in the Municipal Act 1990. Results clearly show the poor conditions in the small municipalities in the region of Kogice. The vast majority of the municipalities under 250 do not have central sewerage system, gas supplies etc. Besides that, they do not provide school services, health services, do not have the basic civic amenities. This is greatly associated with low local budget. All the problematic districts have some characteristics in common, these are: high long-term unemployment, low economic production, ageing population, low number of people in pre-productive a productive age etc.","[Brix, Richard; Svikruha, Martin] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Social Sci, Bucianska 4-A, Trnava 91701, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Brix, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius Trnava, Fac Social Sci, Bucianska 4-A, Trnava 91701, Slovakia.",richard.brix@ucm.sk; martin.svikruha@ucm.sk,,"Brix, Richard/0000-0002-4097-442X",,,,,16,1,1,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

If the participant's degree of risk aversion increases and both charges yield the same expected terminal wealth, then the charge on balance improves with respect to the charge on flow when performing comparisons that examine the ratio between the resulting expected utilities of terminal wealth. When this methodology is applied to the Peruvian Private Pension System, empirical results demonstrate that the aforementioned result also holds for arbitrary charges on flow and balance and that the effect of DoC on these comparisons is nearly negligible for most of the assessed scenarios.","[Chavez-Bedoya, Luis] Esan Grad Sch Business, Dept Finance, Lima, Peru",Universidad ESAN,"Chavez-Bedoya, L (通讯作者)，Esan Grad Sch Business, Dept Finance, Lima, Peru.",lchavezbedoya@esan.edu.pe,,,,,,,62,5,5,0,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Moreover, in many regions of the European continent the population is aging at a fast pace, and a shortage of qualified work force that has not been common in the last ten to fifteen years can now be observed. Younger employees tend to leave the organizations they get hired by before celebrating four years since their employment date, yet many do not even stay with a company for one full year. This behavior puts tremendous pressure on the human resources specialists and on the human resources budgets, as the costs related to recruiting new employees and the costs of employee training increase. Human resources management has become perhaps more provocative than before, as working with a team that does not have time to mature due to personnel changes might create disruption of the workflow. The generation Y, which would soon become dominant in the labor market, is known to have some particularities that might influence in a negative way the already difficult situation that more and more employers face.

We find that Congressional votes, both from the House and Senate, are related to increases in state economic freedom, and that the result is generally statistically and economically significant, and robust to inclusion of a variety of socioeconomic control variables.","[Crowley, George R.; Dove, John A.; Sutter, Daniel] Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA",Troy University System; Troy University,"Crowley, GR (通讯作者)，Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, Econ, Troy, AL 36082 USA.",grcrowley@troy.edu; jadove@troy.edu; dsutter@troy.edu,,,Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University; Templeton Foundation,Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University; Templeton Foundation,The authors thank the Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University and the Templeton Foundation for financial support.,,26,4,4,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

First, using the method of the minimum spanning tree for each period, we calculate the selected graph characteristics, which are then compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test, depending on the market regime. The market regime is calculated based on the logarithmic return of the DJIA index.

The results of trade analyses confirmed that the level of the export competitiveness was different in the individual EU member states and that it had also been changed during the monitored period. However, the original hypothesis about the level of export productivity was not confirmed. The results of the DEA analysis pointed more to economic convergence in the trade area between the new and old EU member states than to export productivity. The development of the EU trade was influenced by globalisation processes accompanied by trade liberalisation, but also the EU integration process.","[Fojtikova, Lenka; Stanickova, Michaela] Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ekon Fak, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Fojtíková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ekon Fak, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",lenka.fojtikova@vsb.cz; michaela.stanickova@vsb.cz,"Stanickova, Michaela/ABE-6334-2020; Fojtikova, Lenka/JCD-8885-2023; Fojtikova, Lenka/A-1044-2017","Stanickova, Michaela/0000-0001-6210-2377; Fojtikova, Lenka/0000-0002-1544-2421",,,,,41,20,20,0,15,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The analysis brings to the forefront the relationship between the main allies in the pharmaceutical supply chain (supplier-distributor-drugstore). Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry had an upward progress in the recent years. Pharmaceutical companies have kept their loyalty to consumers' needs and invested huge amounts of money in the research and development field. In Romania, one of the main regulatory measures refers to imposing maximum limit prices lists for prescription pharma products, called CaNaMed report (The national catalog of prices for human use medicines issued by medical prescription). The report is issued three times a year, and it shows maximum limit prices for suppliers, distributors, and drugstores. Ever since the introduction of regulations on the pharma market, suppliers have tended to channel their efforts on their main activity object. Consumers could benefit from the regulation for prescription pharma products this could be a coercive measure for suppliers. The final consumer's access to pharma products remains essential and R&D should keep pace with the consumer's needs. Huge budgets are annually allocated for more advanced and innovative products; these high amounts can lead to bad debts for the pharma companies. The channels of the product distribution terminals within a commercial chain are passed from one firm to another in accordance with their proper specialization. Pharma companies could benefit in many ways from transferring certain tasks' costs to other specialized companies. However, the Romanian pharmaceutical market remains a booming industry, being full of opportunities and attractiveness for foreign suppliers. Furthermore, the dismissal of the clawback tax could greatly stimulate research and development in Romania, taking into consideration that this tax affects the suppliers' budgets. As a conclusion related to the drugs consumption value in 2016, the total value decreased from one quarter to another. The increases in RON were generated by increasing prices and not by the quantities of consumed units. Regionally speaking, Romania has been and will remain a long-term challenging business and an attractive market for foreign pharma suppliers, allowing them to juggle costs more easily on Romania's territory compared to their home market.","[Giurea, Ana-Maria; Lolea, Iulian-Cornel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010371, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Giurea, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010371, Romania.",ana.giurea@yahoo.com; lolea.iulian@gmail.com,,,,,,,9,1,1,0,0,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,537,549,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800041,0

The fact would not present a problem if household incomes grew in the same rate. However, as our outcomes show, the number of households where the share of expenditures on housing exceeds 30% or even 40% of their disposable incomes has grown. We can also interpret this fact from the increases of expenditures on social benefits provided to these households in the Czech Republic with the aim to support them in covering excessive housing expenditure (CZK 12 billion in 2014). The paper focuses on a specific group of elderly households. We would like to find an answer to the question what the extent to which these households have become a new vulnerable group is. On the basis of the EU-SILC data we have identified that the housing expenditures of 31% of these households (2014) exceed 30% of their disposable incomes; their number grew by more than 50% in the studied period 2005-2014.

The authors use regression models for testing several hypothesis regarding the relation between selection methods and the factors such as company's size, age, business area, job complexity or the number of required skills, and the amount of required training. The authors found that the more skills are required for a job position, the higher the degree of use of personnel selection methods by the companies. Moreover, the authors observe that business area influence the degree of use of selection methods. In particular, construction companies use phone interviews more intensive than companies of other business areas do. Financial companies use lie detector more frequently than others do; manufacturing companies - biographical methods and reference checks. Finally, large companies use more phone interviews, personality test, questionnaire and lie detector compared to small companies.

The Slovak government recognized the potential of start-ups and the creative economy only recently (2013), but the global trend has been anticipated by the private and non-profit sector a couple years earlier. Not surprisingly, the first major co-working spaces with a support to young innovative businesses emerged in the capital city of Bratislava in 2010. In the East Slovak city of Kosice the first activities appeared only in 2013, in the premises of the Technical University. So far still young start-up ecosystems have emerged on different foundations.

I report findings of a study of many of these regulations, in which a variety of methods were used to estimate the associated nominal rates of protection. These findings were then used to estimate effective rates of protection (ERPs) across 140 tradable-goods sectors in the Indonesian economy in early 2015, taking into account also the effects of the most-favoured-nation and preferential-import tariff schedules, anti-dumping and safeguard duties, export levies, duty drawbacks and exemptions, domestic sub-sidies, and excise taxes. I find that the magnitude and dispersion of ERPs were higher in 2015 than in early 2008, for which a similar study was previously conducted, and that much of the variability was related to quantitative trade restrictions. In particular, the regulations examined boosted a measure of the cost of living by 7.6% in 2015, compared with 2.5% in 2008. Regulasi non-tarif untuk impor dan ekspor telah berkembang di Indonesia sejak 2011. Penulis menampilkan beberapa temuan atas berbagai regulasi tersebut, dimana sejumlah metode digunakan untuk menghitung tingkat proteksi nominal (nominal rates of protection, NRPs). Temuan-temuan ini kemudian digunakan sebagai dasar untuk mengestimasi tingkat proteksi efektif (effective rates of protection, ERPs) dari 140 sektor barang dagang di Indonesia pada awal 2015, dengan juga mempertimbangkan dampak tarif preferensial dan tarif MFN (most favoured nation) serta bea antidumping dan perlindungan (anti-dumping and safeguard duties), pungutan ekspor, pembebasan bea dan pengecualian, subsidi domestik, dan cukai. Penulis menemukan bahwa besaran dan sebaran ERPs lebih tinggi pada tahun 2015 dibandingkan dengan awal 2008, saat penelitian serupa dilakukan. Perbedaan ini banyak terkait dengan restriksi perdagangan kuantitatif. Secara khusus, peraturan-peraturan yang dibahas dalam studi ini terbukti menaikkan biaya hidup sebanyak 7,6% pada tahun 2015 dibandingkan dengan 2,5% pada tahun 2008.","[Marks, Stephen V.] Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pomona College,"Marks, SV (通讯作者)，Pomona Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",,,,,,,,17,13,13,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Due to the special input and output variables selection and the construction of the Corporate Distress Frontier, the proposed procedure is very different from the conventional use of DEA. The proposed two-step procedure results into the identification of three zones of corporate financial health with different stage of corporate distress risk.

The aim of the paper is to understand the factors affecting agricultural productivity, as their interaction is key to improving competitiveness of South Asian economies. Indicators such as total agricultural production, arable land, rural population growth, fertilizer and pesticide application, and use of agricultural equipment and credit, were assessed using simple linear regression and modified total factor productivity analyses.

This research is aimed at exploring the differences between exporting and non-exporting enterprises in Latvia from several aspects, i.e., export opportunities; productivity; opportunities of fundraising; innovativeness. The research is based on SKDS survey data on a random sample of 800 medium-sized Latvian enterprises and their economic performance in 2015. A mean-comparison test is used to find a statistically significant difference in the mean values of various characteristics of exporting and non-exporting enterprises. The analysis shows that directly exporting enterprises differ from the non-exporting enterprises in several characteristics: directly exporting enterprises have on average a higher turnover, employ higher number of employees, pay higher salaries, and display higher productivity, experience higher growth of number of employees and wage growth. In addition, exporting enterprises are managed by the leaders with the higher education level. Exporting enterprises tend to be more innovative. The major barrier to exporting turned to be the fierce price competition in the foreign market. The major barriers to start exporting is the fierce price competition in the foreign market, the initial cost of exporting and the difficulties in finding information on the foreign markets.","[Pluta, Anna] Balt Int Ctr Econ Policy Studies, Riga, Latvia",,"Pluta, A (通讯作者)，Balt Int Ctr Econ Policy Studies, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,427,439,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400043,0

Very few studies that examined how FDI impacts the regional productivity of the host nations have shown mixed results. The evidence is still scarce and little is known about how the regional penetration of FDI affects the regional productivity performance. The trajectory of regional productivity growth in India has been a subject of scrutiny and intense debates and remains less systematically investigated. The purpose of this paper is to fill this lacuna by investigating the effect of FDI spillover on regional productivity in Indian states. Design/methodology/approach - Using data supplied by the Central Statistical Organization, National Statistical Organization, National Sample Survey Office, and National Accounts Statistics, Government of India at the Indian Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, first, the study employs stochastic frontier model to explore the extent to which FDI spillover contributes to the regional productivity from panel data of 28 Indian states over 1993-2013. Second, the study examines the roles of absorptive ability and technology gap on productivity effect of FDI. Third, by adopting SFA, we measure productivity growth of Indian states in terms of Malmquist productivity index. Fourth, India's development is imbalanced. To analyze the imbalance due to skewed distribution of FDI among Indian states, Indian states are divided into three regions, and the spillover effects of FDI on TFP in these regions are explored. Findings - The results on the effects of FDI spillover on regional productivity in India using stochastic frontier and panel data from 28 states over 1993-2013 show that R&D, technology import, human capital, and various specifications of FDI have a significant impact on the regional productivity in India except technology gap. Study does not find support for the resource curse hypothesis in Indian states. Productivity growth for India using the Malmquist TFP index based on the stochastic frontier shows positive impact. The TFP growth in the three regions of India is turned to be differently attributed by the FDI spillover. Originality/value - Little is known about how the regional penetration of FDI affects the regional productivity performance. This research aims to fill this lacuna by investigating the effect of FDI spillover on regional productivity in Indian states which has been a subject of scrutiny and intense debates.","[Ramasamy, Murugesan; Murugesan, Poovendhan] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Humanities, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India; [Dhanapal, Dominic] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Perak, Malaysia",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli; Universiti Teknologi Petronas,"Ramasamy, M (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Technol, Dept Humanities, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India.",rmurugan@nitt.edu,,"Murugesan, Ramasamy/0000-0003-1098-0957",,,,,40,10,10,1,33,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We concentrated on the impact of transparency on efficiency of electronic reverse auctions. To prove the efficiency of costs of electronic reverse auctions we analysed empirical data. On the base of electronic purchases from certain Slovak company results show that increasing transparency in a certain way can lead to a lower purchasing price and therefore higher savings for a buyer. We also analysed the influence of number of participants on savings. We found out that increasing competition does not always lead to higher savings and it is important to define optimal number of suppliers for securing the most efficient purchasing price.,"[Senderakova, Lenka] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Senderáková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Banking & Investment, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",lenka.senderakova@tuke.sk,,,Scientific Grant Agency VEGA of Slovak Republic [1/0807/16],Scientific Grant Agency VEGA of Slovak Republic,"This work was supported by Scientific Grant Agency VEGA of Slovak Republic within the grant 1/0807/16 The Efficiency of Digital Single Market Development determined by the changes in transparency level, information asymmetry and socio-economic characteristics of market subjects.",,32,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,698,705,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700071,0

The study sample was made up of 60 undergraduate students attending the accounting principles classes at Palestine Technical University. We applied the structural equation model to identify the factors that may motivate these students to share their knowledge via social network, specifically Facebook, for educational purposes. The results show that altruism and knowledge self-efficacy are the main factors that influence students to share their knowledge while trust and reputation are not motivators for students to share knowledge via social media. In addition, the result of this study reports that knowledge sharing via social networks has a strong impact on students' academic performance. The factors affecting students' knowledge sharing can differ between different people and context, therefore, future research could examine the differences in social networks participation based on gender, age, education level or subject.

It uses a two-step method of comprehensive evaluation by calculating weights with coefficient of variation to evaluate innovation ability of 31 Provinces, and uses the factorial analysis method to conduct the correlation analysis for the 31 Provinces innovation ability from the endogenous function and explicit performance. Then a two-dimensional cluster analysis is conducted on this basis. Based on the results, suggestions for regional innovation ability to complete three changes are proposed. The first is to change from the theory of upward research focused on basic theories to the downward research focused on application development. The second is an organizational change from the individual decentralized innovation system to integrated systematic innovation system.

Thus, the recent fall in commodity prices raised concerns about sustainability and systemic risks. Using a global sample (2003-2015) we measure how corporate bonds react to the underlying commodity price. On average a 10% change in the commodity moves yields-to-maturity by only 15 basis points. This is just a tenth of the sensitivity of stocks returns. Nonetheless, bond sensitivity to commodities is significantly stronger for smaller, leveraged and less profitable firms. Also for short maturity bonds. The type of commodity price change matters too. Sensitivity to price drops is at least five times stronger than to increases. Transitory price changes matter for shorter maturities and leveraged firms. In contrast, longer maturities react more to permanent commodity variations. When firms use hedging derivatives, bonds are less sensitive to all price variations. Hedging mitigates the amplification of commodity shocks, as in Shiller (2008). In conclusion, while debt finance deteriorated with the commodity bust, it hardly dried-up. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A study of efficiency shows the estimator can provide major improvements, both asymptotically and in finite samples. Next, two empirical applications illustrate the usefulness of our estimator. The first shows how it can be used to obtain volatility estimates in the presence of zeros, that is, inliers, since ARMA-based log-GARCH estimators enable a practical and straightforward solution to the inlier problem-even when the zero-generating process is non-stationary. Our study shows volatility estimates can be substantially underestimated if zeros are not handled appropriately. In our second empirical application, we show how our estimator can readily be used to model high-order volatility dynamics where one or more squared error autocorrelations are negative, a characteristic that is not compatible with ordinary (i.e., non-exponential) GARCH models.","[Francq, Christian] CREST, Malakoff, France; [Francq, Christian] Univ Lille, Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Sucarrat, Genaro] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Nydalsveien 37, Oslo, Norway",Universite de Lille; BI Norwegian Business School,"Sucarrat, G (通讯作者)，BI Norwegian Business Sch, Nydalsveien 37, Oslo, Norway.",genaro.sucarrat@bi.no,,"Christian, Francq/0000-0003-1528-8652",labex ECODEC; Agence National de la Recherche (ANR) via the Project MultiRisk [ANR-16-CE26-0015-02],labex ECODEC; Agence National de la Recherche (ANR) via the Project MultiRisk(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We are grateful to the Editor, Associate Editor, two anonymous reviewers, and conference participants at the CFE 2013 (London) and CEF 2014 (Oslo) for useful comments and suggestions.

Compared with the results in the US where rights offerings are unpopular, open offers as one of the common rights offerings in HK also have high wealth transfers from nonparticipating to participating shareholders and low shareholder participation. High wealth transfers and low shareholder participation are thus not the main causes of the infrequent use of rights offerings in the US. High expected wealth transfers will lead to more negative announcement returns, but this adverse effect is weaker when there is a large shareholder take-up. This study for the first time finds that three main protective instruments could reduce the wealth transfers: (i) the better underwriter certification provided by the largest shareholders, (ii) the adoption of oversubscription privilege, and (iii) the avoidance of the CEO-chairman position simultaneously held by the largest shareholders.","[Lee, Chin-Chong] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Jalan Broga, Semenyih 43500, Selangor Darul, Malaysia; [Poon, Wai-Ching] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Business, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia",University of Nottingham Malaysia; Monash University; Monash University Sunway,"Poon, WC (通讯作者)，Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Business, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway 46150, Selangor, Malaysia.",ken.lee@nottingham.edu.my; poon.wai.ching@monash.edu,"Poon, Wai Ching/HPE-5402-2023",,,,,,59,3,3,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1815-5669,,,J CONTEMP ACCOUNT EC,J.

E.",,,Investigating intra-household interactions between individuals' time and space constraints,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Intra-household; Activity space; Travel time frontier; Confidence ellipse,TRAVEL-TIME; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; VARIABILITY; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR; DIARY,"The activity space of an individual is defined as the activity-travel environment which a traveller is using for his or her activities (Axhausen et al., 2002). It is limited by this individual's ability and resources, such as available time for travel as well as his or her anchor points. However, most existing studies have focused on single individual activity space, ignoring the fact that individuals' activities often interact with that of his or her family members'. In this paper a multivariate model is proposed where the correlation between travel time of fathers and mothers, and the correlation between the activity space and travel time are modelled explicitly. The estimated correlations from these joint distributions provide insights into both the intra-household interactions in daily travel and the intrinsic relationships of the hidden limits in the dimensions of space and time. The travel time limits are modelled using a stochastic frontier model component, which can estimate an unobserved upper or lower limit for travel time expenditure. This limit usually refers to the maximum travel time budget or minimum travel time need, which denotes the maximum or minimum amount of travel time that an individual is willing or able to allocate per day. The concept of the confidence ellipse is used as a measure of activity space constructed from the multi-day travel diary data. It is hypothesised that the unobserved travel time limits and activity space sizes of fathers and mothers are correlated with each other, due to a similar spatial knowledge and accessibility to various facilities. The daily variations in the travel time expenditure of parents are also assumed to be correlated because of daily household task allocation and joint household travel. Data collected from a three-week household travel diary in the Bandung Metropolitan Area in Indonesia are used for estimation in this study. The estimated frontier model component shows that neither parent has reached their maximum travel time budget and/or minimum travel time need that they inherently must spend. Compared with other attributes, the perceived accessibility attributes play the most important role in influencing the activity space limits. For households with fully employed fathers, a trade-off mechanism is found in travel time expenditure between parents, which is likely due to the redistribution of household tasks. On the other hand, for households with fathers who are not fully employed, a complementary effect is found, arising from the joint travel among household members. The travel time budget and activity space limits of fathers are positively correlated with those of mothers. These findings call for the formulation of transport policies that consider the household as a unit, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia, to fulfil the mobility needs of different market segments, e.g., households with fully employed fathers and those with fathers who are not fully employed.","[Liu, Chengxi] Swedish Rd & Transport Res Inst, Div Traff Anal & Logist, Teknikringen 10, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Susilo, Yusak O.] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Urban Planning & Environm, Integrated Transport Res Lab, Teknikringen 10, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Dharmowijoyo, Dimas B.

When the variable annuity contains a long-term guarantee, this lapse-and-reentry strategy allows the policyholder to potentially increase the value of the embedded guarantee. We show that for a return-of-premium death benefit guarantee this is frequently optimal, which has severe repercussions for pricing. We analyze various policy features that may help mitigate the incentive to lapse and compare them regarding the insurer's average expense payments and their posttax utility to the policyholder. We find that a ratchet-type guarantee and a state-dependent fee structure best mitigate the lapse-and-reentry problem, outperforming the typical surrender schedule. Further, when accounting for proper tax treatment, the policyholder prefers a variable annuity with either of these three policy features over a comparable stock investment.","[Moenig, Thorsten] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, 1801 Liacouras Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Zhu, Nan] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, Risk Management Dept, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Moenig, T (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Risk Insurance & Healthcare Management, 1801 Liacouras Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",moenig@temple.edu; nanzhu@psu.edu,"Moenig, Thorsten/R-9821-2019","Zhu, Nan/0000-0003-2617-575X",University of St. Thomas; Illinois State University,University of St. Thomas; Illinois State University,"We are indebted to two anonymous referees whose suggestions have led to a much improved article.

We employ Fourth All India Census of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 2006-2007 data to empirically verify this relationship. We conduct an econometric analysis of loan outcomes by the caste affiliation of the firm owner and observe that firms owned by socially disadvantaged groups have a lower probability of obtaining formal credit even after controlling for differences in creditworthiness and other factors. Our results also show that discrimination by formal credit institutions extends to the amount of the loan sanctioned. These results thus suggest that affirmative action programs in India have not had much impact on credit market access for socially marginalized entrepreneurs, and policymakers should address this concern by introducing special programs and regulatory incentives to encourage banks and others to increase their lending toward these disadvantaged groups.","[Raj, Rajesh S.

Numerical simulations indicate that an emissions trading system covering the power and industry sectors in all countries that made unconditional pledges could reduce the associated mitigation costs by more than 72 percent.

Does a danger of sudden resource depletion encourage random acts of violence? There are concerns that climate change will escalate conflicts over, and the scarcity of, renewable resources, which are already under threat or in a state of decline. However, we know surprisingly little about the impact of uncertainty on intergroup conflict over resources. In this paper, we present experimental evidence from a mixed design experiment with two-between-group factors: (1) the presence (or absence) of shocks that can destroy a part of resources; and (2) the availability of intergroup conflict.We find that random shocks encourage resource conservation within groups. The positive impact of resource uncertainty on resource conservation disappears in the presence of conflict. It seems that subjects protect themselves from resource exhaustion in the presence of shocks by engaging in conflict and taking resources from the out-group instead of reducing extraction. In general, conflict promotes intragroup cooperation, but this is conditional on the outcomes of past conflicts. In particular, groups harvest more after wins, and only reduce extraction after losing resources in conflict.","[Safarzynska, Karolina] Warsaw Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-02241 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Safarzynska, K (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ, Fac Econ Sci, Dluga 44-50, PL-02241 Warsaw, Poland.",ksafarzynska@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Safarzynska, Karolina/AAZ-9772-2020","Safarzynska, Karolina/0000-0001-5507-9287; Safarzynska, Karolina/0000-0001-8924-2038",National Science Center [UMO-2013/08/S/HS4/00254],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",We would like to thank Rupert Sausgruber and James Tremewan for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Design/methodology/approach The authors studied 11,381 firms from 17 industries in six Latin American countries based on the data collected up to 2015. Since the data are nested in two levels (level 1: firms; level 2: cross-classification of industries and countries), the authors use a cross-classified multilevel model. The significant variability in all levels of analysis confirms the option for the multilevel model. Findings Differences in industries account for the largest proportion of variance (77.2 percent). This finding indicates that industry-level characteristics should be explored in the sales growth literature (it seems to the authors that they were neglected). This finding also calls attention to the roles of policy-makers in facilitating firm growth. The final model indicates that the considered variables explain approximately 55 percent of the differences in real annual sales growth in the same industry and country after having accounted for the impacts of the differences in firms. After accounting for the impacts of the differences in firms' and countries' characteristics, 43 percent of the variation in average real annual sales growth is due to differences in industries. The obtained results indicate that while firms from countries with higher GDP growth and more effective corporate boards present higher real annual sales growth, firms that operate in commodity producer industries have worse performance in this indicator. With respect to firm's characteristics, larger firms (contradicting Gibrat's law) and exporters grew less. Some results could be explained by the decrease in commodities' prices and global purchases between 2012 and 2015. Originality/value The paper fills some gaps in the firm growth literature by testing Gibrat's law in non-developed countries (not yet done, to the best of the authors' knowledge) and exploring variables other than size in the explanation of firm growth (rarely used, to the best of the authors' knowledge). Moreover, the adopted model correctly estimated the origin of the variability in firm growth in its natural cross-classified distinct levels.","[Lopes Favero, Luiz Paulo; dos Santos, Marco Aurelio; Brunaldi, Eduardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Serra, Ricardo Goulart] INSPER, FECAP, Dept Business Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Serra, Ricardo Goulart] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Insper; Centro Universitario Alvares Penteado; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Fávero, LPL (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Business & Accounting, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",lpfavero@usp.br,"Fávero, Luiz Paulo/C-6034-2016; dos Santos, Marco Aurélio/HGE-0865-2022; dos Santos, Marco Aurélio/AAE-3585-2020; Brunaldi, Eduardo/AAN-8423-2021","dos Santos, Marco Aurélio/0000-0001-6838-9372; dos Santos, Marco Aurélio/0000-0001-6838-9372; Brunaldi, Eduardo/0000-0002-2941-9476; Serra, Ricardo Goulart/0000-0003-0962-1500",,,,,113,6,6,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The relationship between the inflows of FDI (IFDI) and absorptive capacity (AC) has been under-researched in the peripheral transition countries like Ukraine. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the appropriateness of the Ukrainian economy's AC to attract IFDI and facilitate economic growth with a particular focus on AC factors, such as the potential of human resources to absorb innovation and benefit from research and development (R&D) expenditure. Design/methodology/approach This study presents a thoughtful research design: there is an analysis of the AC framework for justification and selection factors that allows a measurement of the potential of Ukraine's AC to attract and exploit IFDI. The study uses data from 25 regions in Ukraine for the 1996-2015 period. To estimate the effects of IFDI on Ukrainian economic growth, a Cobb-Douglas production function is used. As an appropriate instrumentation technique for dynamic panel data, the Generalised Method of Moments is used to provide unbiased and efficient estimates of the results. The application of the interactive term in this study allows the authors to indicate the existence of complementarities between IFDI and human capital, in particular with higher education, that afford opportunity to absorb new technologies and benefit from IFDI. Findings The resulting model indicates that R&D expenditure benefited very significantly in evolving country's innovation system due to economic growth. Physical and human capital has not been used effectively in Ukraine to facilitate economic growth and attract IFDI. The number of patents is not significant in all of the regression models. Moreover, IFDI in Ukraine for the 1996-2015 period did not significantly impact on economic growth. However, the AC of human capital, in particular those with a higher education, is relatively relevant to benefit from IFDI. Practical implications The findings have important implications for governmental policy, which should be based on improving the business climate, a strategy for digital development, innovation, migration, institutional and regional policies aimed at the achievement of country's sustainable economic growth. The government should increase R&D expenditure as an important factor of gross domestic product growth and introduce grants, loans and other financial supports for encouraging students to continue university education. Originality/value The originality and value of this paper is empirical and methodological. The empirical results of this study enable a conclusion about the appropriate level of the country's absorptive capability required to benefit from IFDI. The paper also contributes to the existing academic debate and proves that despite the well-established theoretical framework for the IFDI-AC economic impact context, a new theorisation is needed to explore the full complexity of the country's explicit relationship between AC and IFDI. Future research should be focussed on examining not only groups of countries but also distinctly the country's explicit relationship between AC and IFDI with the particular attention for the under-researched countries: the peripheral transition economies to discover new research niches for theory building. This study presents an original methodological approach with a careful justification of the theoretical framework for hypothesis development, an appropriate sample and an original application of seminal research methods based on the Cobb-Douglas production function. This study proves that the interactive term, which allows indication of the existence of complementarities between IFDI and other variables, is appropriate for measuring AC in countries with smaller amounts of IFDI.","[Shevelova, Svitlana] Coll Da Vinci, Dept Coaching & Management, Poznan, Poland; [Plaskon, Svitlana] Ternopil Natl Econ Univ, Dept Appl Math, Ternopol, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; West Ukrainian National University,"Shevelova, S (通讯作者)，Coll Da Vinci, Dept Coaching & Management, Poznan, Poland.",shevelova.s@gmail.com; plasksvit@gmail.com,"Plaskon, Svitlana A/H-4991-2017",,,,,,94,3,4,5,30,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We also find a partial support for the hysteresis hypothesis in UK imports from India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. We find that hysteresis can be both country- and commodity-dependent, which is largely consistent with previous empirical studies.

This approach is innovative in so far as it examines the effects of allowing two-round impacts to differ in our settings of dynamic volatility with time varying jump intensity because the world economic situation differs during periods of large-scale asset purchases. Utilizing the daily futures price of the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, the empirical findings show that U.S. large-scale asset purchases have significant asymmetric effects on the volatility of the Canadian dollar futures market. Two kinds of asymmetry are observed. Firstly, the impact of large-scale asset purchases is smaller in the first round of the large-scale asset purchases than in the second round. Secondly, an expansionary policy causes higher volatility in the Canadian dollar futures market than does a contractionary policy due to a signal of high liquidity.","[Chang, Jui-Chuan Della] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, 580 Sinmin Rd, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan; [Chang, Kuang-Liang] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 580 Sinmin Rd, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan",National Chiayi University; National Chiayi University,"Chang, KL (通讯作者)，Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 580 Sinmin Rd, Chiayi 60054, Taiwan.",jccdella@mail.ncyu.edu.tw; klchang@mail.ncyu.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 105-2410-H-415-002],"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Kuang-Liang Chang acknowledges financial support from Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 105-2410-H-415-002).

Moreover, the competition between companies is becoming fiercer and fiercer, so the differentiation of products and services has gradually turned into a real necessity. In this context, design thinking is one of the elements that is currently drawing new directions, often being associated with the innovation process and the gain of competitive advantages. Recent studies show that design principles applied at a strategic level, especially in the field of innovation, significantly increase its success rate. Design thinking focuses on obtaining solutions and is action-oriented, providing all the necessary premises in order to discover new market needs and, moreover, to satisfy them. Another extremely important element in the current global context is brand, which gives the main points of differentiation for offers existing on the market. A correct and efficient management of the brand supports the creation of strong emotional relationships with consumers, bringing competitive advantages, especially by increasing their loyalty. As a result, brand management is an area of particular interest, and design thinking, together with innovation, can successfully support its specific actions, bringing with them the benefits of creativity, that translate into defining new concepts for attracting consumers and their trust. This article addresses aspects of design and design thinking, as elements that support a successful brand management, taking the tourism domain, which is currently the world's fastest growing industry, as a case study. The authors sought to study the connection between design, design thinking and brand management by correlating two studies, one of them conducted among consumers and the other one, among economic agents. Thus, questionnaires were addressed to consumers in order to identify their perception on design and design thinking, but also to economic agents in order to determine their actions in this regard. The way design and design thinking influences customers' consumption behavior represents a starting point for building brand management strategies, indicating either the need to enhance their use or, on the contrary, the lack of need for design.","[Pamfilie, Rodica; Croitoru, Adina-Gabriela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Croitoru, AG (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",adina_gc@yahoo.com,,"Pamfilie, Rodica/0000-0001-9847-4551",,,,,22,3,4,8,54,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,1029,1039,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/1029,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700014,0

Multiple-treatment-effects model and external validity of adoption impacts of mechanization among Nepalese smallholders,REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INSIGHTS; RETURNS; ASIA,"The future of smallholders in developing countries is becoming increasingly uncertain in the face of rising farm wages. The custom-hiring of tractors, in which tractor owners provide non-owner farmers with land preparation and transport services for fees, has spread among smallholders in Asia, including Nepal. However, estimating the adoption impacts of agricultural mechanization by smallholders is complex as we must also take into account smallholders' options to exit farming. We investigate this issue by applying multinomial logit inverse-probability weighting and sample selection panel data methods to data on smallholders in lowland Nepal. Our results are generally consistent with the hypothesis that smallholders who are likely to benefit more from adopting tractors are also more likely to exit farming. Where smallholders are less likely to exit farming, the use of tractors through custom-hiring may help smallholders on average to earn greater total and agricultural incomes. However, where they are more likely to exit farming, the ability of custom-hired tractors to sustain smallholder farming systems may become weaker. The results also offer insights into how the external validity of technology adoption impact evaluation may be affected in some settings.","[Takeshima, Hiroyuki] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Takeshima, H (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",H.takeshima@cgiar.org,"Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAO-3212-2021; Takeshima, Hiroyuki/AAN-6611-2021","Takeshima, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-1761-408X",,,,,37,4,5,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

The difference in average return between the quintile of stocks with low exposure versus high exposure to oil volatility is significant at 0.66% per month, and oil volatility risk carries a significant risk premium of -0.60% per month. We also find that increases in oil price uncertainty predict tightening funding constraints of financial intermediaries suggesting a link between oil volatility risk and the stock market.

The policy used social pressures and punishments to incentivize tobacco users to no longer consume tobacco on campus. The policy had three distinct periods (Pre-Promotion, Post-Promotion, and Post-Policy). Social pressures and punishments were introduced during the Post-Promotion and Post-Policy periods, respectively. Changes in cigarette consumption were inferred by counting the number of cigarette butts found at various locations on campus. A statistically significant decrease in the number of cigarette butts was observed during the Post-Promotion period. After the initial drop, tobacco use remained constant for the remainder of the period. An additional decrease was observed once punishments were introduced in the third period However, the number of cigarette butts observed on campus remained significantly above zero. Further research is needed to understand how smokers substitute across time, location, and tobacco products after the implementation of similar policies.","[Clemons, Kaytlynn] WinShape Camps, Atlanta, GA 30349 USA; [Johnson, David B.] Univ Cent Missouri, Dept Econ Finance & Mkt, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA; [Kiger, Amy] Univ Cent Missouri, Violence & Subst Abuse Prevent, 102 Admin, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA; [Putnam, Janice] Univ Cent Missouri, 304f Admin, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA",University Central Missouri; University Central Missouri; University Central Missouri,"Clemons, K (通讯作者)，WinShape Camps, Atlanta, GA 30349 USA.",kclemons@ucmo.edu; djohnson@ucmo.edu; kiger@ucmo.edu; putnam@ucmo.edu,,,,,,,25,5,5,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Even though poverty today remains predominantly a rural phenomenon, there is a need to better understand the landscape of poverty in urban areas. Drawing on small-area estimation methods we estimate welfare outcomes at the level of individual towns and cities in Vietnam, including even the smallest towns. Such estimates could not be produced using national sample surveys alone. Results show an inverse relationship between poverty and city size in Vietnam, with the urban poor being disproportionately concentrated in small towns and cities. This relationship is robust to the location of the poverty line as well as to alternative city-size definitions. Interestingly, our evidence of a clear gradient between absolute poverty and city size is not replicated for subjective welfare, measured by self-reported food sufficiency. The absolute poverty-city size gradient does, however, accord with the observation of striking variation in service availability across cities of different size in Vietnam. Small town residents are typically confronted with far lower per-capita availability of basic services than are large city dwellers. The results suggest that policymakers concerned to tackle urban poverty in Vietnam should not neglect attending to smaller towns. Addressing inequalities in access to key basic services across the entire urban population may represent one means to this end. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses points of interest (POIs) to estimate employment locations, and implements a gravity-based model to estimate interzonal commuting patterns in central Shanghai, China. The results reveal a busy corridor in the west of the central city, especially during the morning peak hours. This pattern corresponds well with reported real-time traffic conditions in Shanghai.

We examine this question in the context of Finnish biotechnology industry by analyzing the survival of all dedicated biotechnology firms in the period of 1978-2008. We argue and show that the success and survival of firms are not necessarily driven by similar determinants. Specifically, we find that while the role of different types of alliances, focused market scope as well as legitimacy of the industry seem to be important both in ensuring survival and enhancing successful performance, determinants related to sources of financing, clustering, and patenting show differences in terms of how they relate on survival and success.","[Pajunen, Kalle; Jarvinen, Joonas] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Pajunen, K (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla 40014, Finland.",kalle.pajunen@jyu.fi; joonas.jaervinen@mondigroup.com,"Pajunen, Kalle/AAG-6769-2019","Pajunen, Kalle/0000-0002-3913-7894",,,,,63,2,3,0,51,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the spatial networks of two contemporary cruise companies operating in the Mediterranean, using complex network analysis that has been extensively applied to other shipping sectors, such as to the container liner shipping, but not, in a comprehensive context, in the cruise industry. The complex network analysis applied in this paper provides insights about the operational and geographical dynamics of the ports participating in the Mediterranean cruise network, which can help the cruise companies and the port authorities to comprehend and to measure their competitive position in the network. The overall approach develops a novel classification of ports according to their integration in the cruise network, an optimized modularity segmentation of the Mediterranean market by considering both operational and geographical aspects of this network, and an in-depth efficiency comparison between the spatial networks of the cruise companies.","[Tsiotas, Dimitrios; Niavis, Spyros] Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos 38334, Volos, Greece; [Sdrolias, Labros] Technol Educ Inst Thessaly, Dept Business Adm, Nea Ktiria 41110, Larissa, Greece",University of Thessaly,"Tsiotas, D (通讯作者)，Univ Thessaly, Dept Planning & Reg Dev, Volos 38334, Volos, Greece.",tsiotas@uth.gr; spniavis@uth.gr; lsdrolias@teilar.gr,"Tsiotas, Dimitrios/AGR-5910-2022; Niavis, Spyros/AEB-9538-2022","Tsiotas, Dimitrios/0000-0003-3510-8823; Niavis, Spyros/0000-0001-9210-9190",,,,,55,17,17,3,45,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Considering the S&P 500 firms, we find a strong home country concentration of US. trademark ownership. Our results suggest that offshore ownership of trademarks is mainly motivated by foreign activities rather than tax considerations. An analysis of the location choice reveals a significant negative impact of host-country taxes but only if controlled foreign-company legislation does not apply. Companies active in industries that are known for producing mobile income tend to hold more trademarks offshore. In particular, trademarks of software firms and drugmakers are overrepresented in tax havens.

From a policy perspective, it is important to know whether inherent, largely unchangeable attributes are responsible or if institutional and economic attributes are at work. Accounting for model uncertainty, we use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to analyze a comprehensive list of 36 potential corruption determinants across 123 countries (covering 87 percent of the world population). The BMA methodology sorts through all 68,719,476,736 possible model combinations (2(36)) in order to carve out the robust correlates. We then take a step toward alleviating endogeneity concerns in an Instrumental Variable BMA framework. Our results indicate that cultural factors are largely irrelevant, whereas particular economic and institutional characteristics matter. The rule of law emerges as the most persistent predictor with a posterior inclusion probability (PIP) in the true model of 1.00, whereas we find strong evidence for government effectiveness (PIP of 0.88), urbanization (0.85), and the share of women in parliament (0.80) as meaningful determinants of lower corruption levels. In developing countries, the extent of primary schooling enters as a powerful factor with a PIP of 1.00. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To assess the conventional view that assets uniformly improve childhood development through wealth effects, we use three waves of panel data from Tanzania and test whether different types of assets have differential effects on children's educational outcomes. Our results indicate that household durables and housing quality have positive effects, but agricultural assets have adverse effects on children's highest grade completed and exam performances. We use a Hausman-Taylor instrumental variable (HTIV) panel data estimator to identify the effects of both time-varying and time-invariant endogenous variables. We find that the negative effect of agricultural assets is driven by large agricultural equipment and livestock ownership and the negative effect is more pronounced among rural children, poor children, and children from farming households, presumably due to the higher opportunity cost of schooling.

Using the data for 184 countries from 1970 to 2010 and bias-corrected estimators, this study tests the effect of sanction imposition on foreign investment. I find that the effect of sanctions on foreign investment indeed changes over time, depending on sanction costs, primary sanction imposer, and decade. High-cost sanctions lead to a significant decrease in FDI in the short run, although they do not have a long-run effect. In many sanctions episodes in the 1990s, FDI has been negatively affected in the short run, although this effect has partially dissipated in the long run. Sanctions episodes from other decades, on average, did not have a significant effect on foreign investment.","[Mirkina, Irina] Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Box 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Mirkina, I (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Box 7080, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",i.mirkina@gmail.com,"Mirkina, Irina/H-7067-2019; Mirkina, Irina/AAY-8049-2020","Mirkina, Irina/0000-0003-2858-4987",Swedish Institute,Swedish Institute,"The author would like to thank Andreas Bergh, Christian Bjornskov, Dennis Coates, Jerg Gutmann, Arye L.

Using a dynamic two-country computable general-equilibrium model with integrated capital markets, the results indicate a faint growth stimulus of the reform and a negative effect on domestic welfare. In fact, the reform increased the double taxation of equity-financed corporate investment, thereby impeding firms' investment.

Using an original county-level dataset from Maoist China, we demonstrate a strong and robust negative relationship exists between the scale of repression of intellectuals in the Anti-Rightist Campaign (ARC) in 1957-58 and economic productivity decades later. This fall in economic output is caused by the loss of already scarce human capital resulting from the violent political campaign. Until at least 2000, significant and robust negative correlations exist between the percentage of victims in a county and its populations' level of educational achievement and economic performance. By demonstrating the negative relationship between the state's purposeful destruction of human capital for political reasons and long-run economic growth, we are able to add China to a growing body of research on the long-run deleterious effects of state-sponsored political repression against intellectuals. Using China's ARC as an example, this study is the first to use quantitative methods to demonstrate the often-overlooked long-term negative economic effects of political repression under authoritarian regimes.

Drawing on insights from literature on financialization of the firm, the paper examines how intensified shareholder value pressures shaped strategy at major platinum mining companies during the long commodities boom of the 2000s and subsequent slump from 2009. The paper argues that financialization exacerbates the already intense cyclical volatility of the extractive industries. Efforts to fulfil narratives of shareholder value delivery during the boom manifested in large dividend distribution, gearing of balance sheets and aggressive outlays on capacity expansion and mergers and acquisition activity to demonstrate to the market an ambitious pipeline of growth projects. The result was financial fragility and excess capacity which has exacerbated the impact of the slump in subsequent years with severe social consequences. Distributional contest between management and organized labour has intensified as management has sought to restore internationally competitive rates of return on capital. The paper argues financialization of the firm in mining creates particularly acute distributional contestation and instability, due to the contradictions between the powerful abstractive tendencies of financialized capitalism and the social embeddedness of mining as a landed industry.

We find that firm outcomes are measured less precisely when chance plays a large role in these outcomes. Further, this precision is determined through the choice of shares outstanding. This has several novel implications. Nominal stock prices can remain constant over time, and firms with unpredictable cash flows should have more shares and lower stock price levels, all else equal.

Our empirical analysis is based on a novel panel data set of 177 Western European banks observed from 2008 to 2015, in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. We find that IRB banks were able to curb the increase in credit risk driven by the macroeconomic slowdown better than banks under the standardized approach. This suggests that the introduction of the internal ratings based approach by Basel II has promoted the adoption of stronger risk management practices among banks, as meant by the regulators.

Agro-industrial projects linked to climate change goals are reshaping both social and ecological dynamics, by altering patterns of access to land and water resources as well as the nature of the resources themselves. Using a landscape perspective, we investigate these social and ecological changes occurring across space and time. Drawing on data from community researchers, field visits, interviews and secondary sources, we examine two kinds of connections between climate change responses and resource conflicts in the Greater Aural: 1) demand for biofuels as a driver of flex crop expansion; and 2) the construction of irrigation infrastructure as a climate change adaptation strategy. Findings include that some impacts of flex crop expansion and irrigation systems are local and immediate, for example when villagers lose land, plantation workers are not paid, and cassava processing pollutes local water supplies. Other impacts are transferred to different locations or deferred to the future, for example when changes in water quality and quantity affect those living downstream, or when soil degraded by cassava production becomes unproductive for future generations. We conclude that climate change strategies are now deeply entangled with resource conflicts in the Greater Aural region. Adopting a landscape perspective and working directly with community researchers opens new pathways for identifying not only site-specific, but also cumulative and shifting impacts of climate change strategies and their relationship to resource conflicts.

An analysis of 74 countries over the 2001-2016 period shows that sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads decrease with government effectiveness, particularly in countries exhibiting severe default risk, high indebtedness, and poor economic conditions. We formulate a theoretical explanation for these findings using a structural model in which governments adjust default and debt policies based on their abilities to collect and use fiscal revenues. The theory posits that more effective governments have less incentive to default and thus benefit from narrower credit spreads, although they may choose higher indebtedness levels.

Specifically, we examine how these two motives may play different roles depending on whether a third party is a group or an individual. In a one-shot prisoner's dilemma game with third-party punishment, we find that groups are more likely to punish when the penalty embeds deterrence rather than mere retribution. By contrast, when individual third parties make punishment decisions, they appear to give little weight to the deterrent effect of the punishment. In general, groups are less likely than individuals to impose punishment, even though the punishment is costless for third parties. However, decision-makers in the prisoner's dilemma game do not distinguish between an individual third party and a group third party.","[Tan, Fangfang] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Dept Publ Econ, Munich, Germany; [Xiao, Erte] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",Max Planck Society; Monash University,"Tan, FF (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Dept Publ Econ, Munich, Germany.",fangfang.tan@tax.mpg.de; Erte.xiao@monash.edu,,"Xiao, Erte/0000-0002-3920-7979",,,,,75,10,14,9,78,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

We exploit a quasi-natural experiment that holds constant the information event across firms but varies the availability of a major news outlet in local markets. We find that firms subject to the threat of slanted coverage suppress the release of negative information before the event and release it subsequently. Our results are consistent with theory on the active role firms can play in managing their reputational capital through anticipatory actions to avoid negative media coverage. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, inexperience and poor funding can significantly inhibit challenger success. We expand this list of potential shortcomings by arguing that ideological congruence with a constituency may be another factor in explaining challenger defeat. Using ideology measures derived from campaign contributions, we find that unsuccessful challengers in the U.S. House are generally more extreme than those who win, but ideological extremity is not a disadvantage to those seeking to represent an extreme constituency. More importantly, our existing political institutions may actually serve to mitigate the already high levels of partisan polarization in Congress.","[Carson, Jamie L.] Univ Georgia, 180 Baldwin Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Williamson, Ryan D.] Amer Polit Sci Assoc, 1527 New Hampshire Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Williamson, RD (通讯作者)，Amer Polit Sci Assoc, 1527 New Hampshire Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",carson@uga.edu; rdwilliamson2011@gmail.com,"Carson, Jamie/AAE-7820-2020; Williamson, Ryan/AAW-5974-2020","Williamson, Ryan/0000-0001-5235-0967",,,,,43,8,9,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2018,176.0,1-2,,,SI,,175,192,,10.1007/s11127-017-0492-2,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GM8GF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000438459400010,0

These entities played a key role in the institutional architecture of the apartheid regime, ensuring the domination of white commercial farmers over the sector. Within the framework of the deregulation of the economy and the agricultural sector, such entities faced transformations of modern capitalism, especially the growing power of financial actors and markets. Although white commercial farmers still largely retain these inherited structures, these companies are presently being targeted more and more by private takeovers and/or private equity deals. Based on two specific empirical examples of private equity deals affecting South African grain cooperatives, this paper describes this financialization process in practice, in particular by analysing the interaction between financial and agricultural actors and the alliances on the ground that determine its success. In doing so, it details the different trajectories of these (former) cooperatives, highlighting the resilience, mutation, and extinction of commercial agriculture in South Africa.","[Ducastel, Antoine] CIRAD UMR ART Dev, TA C-113-15,73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France; [Anseeuw, Ward] CIRAD UMR ART Dev & Int Land Coalit, Via Paolo di Dono 44, Rome, Italy",CIRAD; CIRAD,"Ducastel, A (通讯作者)，CIRAD UMR ART Dev, TA C-113-15,73 Rue Jean Francois Breton, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France.",antoine.ducastel@cirad.fr,,"Ducastel, Antoine/0000-0001-6343-5173",,,,,47,8,8,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We classify firms into Metro and Rural firms based on their headquarter locations. Using a sample of 11,537 firm-year observations from 1997 to 2013, we find that Metro firm busy directors significantly enhance firm performance and are associated with lower default risk, lower cash effective tax rate, lower real earnings management, and more efficient assets utilization. We further show busy independent directors enhance firm performance after the 2007-2008 financial crisis, but not in the early years after SOX. Interestingly, the results indicate that SOX compromises the effectiveness of busy inside directors in Metro firms in the post-SOX period. The location effect is robust across multiple model specifications and various measures of director busyness and Metro firms. We conclude that firm location affects the effectiveness of busy directors and Metro firms benefit more from directors with multiple directorships.","[James, Hui Liang] Univ Texas Tyler, Coll Business & Technol, BUS 135A,3900 Univ Blvd, Tyler, TX 75799 USA; [Wang, Hongxia] Ashland Univ, Dauch Coll Business & Econ, 401 Coll Ave, Ashland, OH 44805 USA; [Xie, Yamin] Harvard Univ, SCANCOR Weatherhead Partnership, Weatherhead Ctr Int Affairs, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xie, Yamin] Hanken Sch Econ, Wallenberg Ctr Financial Res, Arkadiankatu 22,POB 479, Helsinki 00100, Finland",University of Texas System; University of Texas at Tyler; University System of Ohio; Ashland University; Harvard University; Hanken School of Economics,"James, HL (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Tyler, Coll Business & Technol, BUS 135A,3900 Univ Blvd, Tyler, TX 75799 USA.",hjames@uttyler.edu; hwang2@ashland.edu; yamin_xie@fas.harmrd.edu,"James, Hui Liang/AGD-5525-2022","James, Hui Liang/0000-0002-3787-7346; Xie, Yamin/0000-0001-5237-4045",Foundation for Economic Education (Liikesivistysrahasto) in Finland,Foundation for Economic Education (Liikesivistysrahasto) in Finland,"We thank the editor (Hamid Beladi), two anonymous referees, Melissa Frye, Lindsay Baran, and the session participants at the 2017 Southern Finance Association Annual Meeting for their helpful comments.

Without changes in the premium, lower risk-free rates reduce the risk taking of all funds.

As a consequence of 'transfer dependency', subcentral governments can expect to be bailed out by the central government and therefore tend to accumulate higher levels of debt. We test this conjecture with data from Austrian municipalities. In fiscal terms, Austria is a highly centralized federation in which tax autonomy at the municipal level is rather weak. Our identification strategy is based on a discontinuity caused by the unique regulation of population weights in the tax-sharing agreement between central government and the municipalities. Our results indicate that, in line with theoretical expectations, municipalities with higher revenue dependency are responsible for higher net borrowing per capita. The size of the additional borrowing effect equals to about 5% of average municipal debt. We also find that almost one half of the observed discontinuity works through an investment channel.","[Turyna, Monika Koeppl] Agenda Austria, Schottengasse 1-3, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Pitlik, Hans] Austrian Inst Econ Res, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria",,"Turyna, MK (通讯作者)，Agenda Austria, Schottengasse 1-3, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",monika.koeppl-turyna@agenda-austria.at; hans.pitlik@wifo.ac.at,"Koeppl-Turyna, Monika/Z-2663-2019","Koeppl-Turyna, Monika/0000-0002-4717-7060; Pitlik, Hans/0000-0001-8124-1110",,,,,59,15,17,3,13,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

Our findings demonstrate that economic inequality has an enduring influence on attitudes. Consistent with the economic self-interest thesis, preferences for equality are strongest among those in working-class occupations. Moreover, independent of one's own social class, one's father's social class has a similar enduring impact on attitudes later in life. These relationships are relatively similar across the 20 societies we explore. Still, significant differences in attitudes can be explained by national economic context. We find a strong positive relationship between national-level inequality and opinions on how much inequality there ought to be in the income distribution.

Considering a threshold partial adjustment modelling approach, the results document that real exchange rate depreciations exert a stronger positive effect on poverty through remittances. The results are expected to be of substantial importance in the case of emerging and developing countries in designing exchange rate and inflation policies that affect the poverty levels of their population through the mechanism of remittances.

These gains are associated with a fall in average default probability of 15.6%, and statistically weak and economically marginal increases in expected asset risk. Over the same event window, identical measures for other large insurance firms show no significant changes in equity returns or implied asset risk, but an increase in default probability of 27%. These results suggest that G-SII investors still perceive a net gain from TBTF protection, despite new compliance requirements and costs. Our evidence also suggests that these gains are driven primarily from reductions in default probability, as results are consistent with investor expectations that the new regulatory regime will limit moral hazard effects from the guaranty.

This research uses a quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of the Pay for Permit policy, an environmental tax that has been imposed on water pollution emissions in Lake Tai Basin, Jiangsu, China, since 2009. A plant-level panel dataset from 2007 to 2010 is used for both difference-in-differences and difference-in-difference-in-differences analyses to compare the pollution discharge, pollution abatement, and pollution generation of policy participants and control groups. The results indicate that treated plants reduce their emissions by about 40 percent after two years of the policy implementation. Thus, the policy generated approximately a 7 percent decrease in the industrial chemical oxygen demand emission in the entire Lake Tai Basin based on the emission level of 2007. Pollution is primarily reduced via end-of-pipe abatement instead of cleaner production. Our results show the effectiveness of environmental taxes in controlling industrial pollution, and indicate that the tax may not motivate the adoption of innovative techniques in the short term.","[He, Pan] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Sch Environm, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Pan] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 Samuel J LeFrak Hall,7251 Preinkert Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Zhang, Bing] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Sch Environm, Sch Govt, Room 228,163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Nanjing University,"He, P (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Sch Environm, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;He, P (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, 2181 Samuel J LeFrak Hall,7251 Preinkert Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",hepannju@gmail.com; zhangb@nju.edu.cn,"ZHU, BIN/IYJ-3847-2023","He, Pan/0000-0003-1088-6290","National Science Foundation of China [71322303, 71433007]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank Matthew Potoski (UCSB) and Junjie Zhang (Duke University) for valuable suggestions throughout the analysis and editing process of this paper.

In contrast to the majority of related studies, we consider these preferences in a more holistic way by grouping residents into clusters. The kind of inner-city neighbourhood we studied particularly attracts families and couples who are affluent and have high levels of car ownership. However, a comparison of residents' mode choice with that of the general population of inner and outer Berlin shows that this kind of inner-city neighbourhood encourages even those households who are known to prefer driving to use modes other than the car. Moreover, we found variety in mode use which could be traced to the variation in reasons for residential choice (as an outcome of residential and travel preferences). This underlines the fact that preferences have a strong effect on travel behaviour, even in a homogeneous neighbourhood. Overall, the study suggests that new inner-city development neighbourhoods with a variety of housing types provide opportunities for sustainable daily mobility. At the same time the study area could have been better adapted to the various preferences of its future residents - for example, by reducing the number of parking spaces to further stimulate use of sustainable modes of transport.","[Jarass, Julia] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Transport Res, Rutherfordstr 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany; [Scheiner, Joachim] TU Dortmund Univ, Fac Spatial Planning, Dept Transport Planning, August Schmidt Str 10, D-44227 Dortmund, Germany",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Dortmund University of Technology,"Jarass, J (通讯作者)，German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Transport Res, Rutherfordstr 2, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",julia.jarass@dlr.de; joachim.scheiner@tu-dortmund.de,,"Scheiner, Joachim/0000-0002-6157-437X",,,,,50,16,17,1,21,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This paper analyses household survey data and hydrological riverine flood and drought data for 52 countries to find out whether poor people are disproportionally exposed to floods and droughts, and how this exposure may change in a future climate. We find that poor people are often disproportionally exposed to droughts and floods, particularly in urban areas. This pattern does not change significantly under future climate scenarios, although the absolute number of people potentially exposed to floods or droughts can increase or decrease significantly, depending on the scenario and region. In particular, many countries in Africa show a disproportionally high exposure of poor people to floods and droughts.

Combining socioeconomic data from about 8,000 smallholder households across the tropics with gridded precipitation and temperature data, we find that households have the highest crop income at 21 degrees C temperature and 2,000 mm precipitation. Forest incomes increase on both sides of this agricultural maximum. We further find indications that crop income declines in response to weather shocks while forest income increases, suggesting that households may cope by reallocating inputs from agriculture to forests. Forest production may thus be less sensitive than crop production to climatic fluctuations, gaining comparative advantage in extreme climates and under weather anomalies. This suggests that well-managed forests might help poor rural households to cope with and adapt to future climate change.","[Wunder, Sven] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Lima, Peru; [Noack, Frederik] Univ British Columbia, Fac Land & Food Syst, Food & Resource Econ Grp, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Angelsen, Arild] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Sch Econ & Business, As, Norway",CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); University of British Columbia; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Wunder, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Lima, Peru.",swunder@cgiar.org,"Wunder, Sven/ABE-7773-2020","Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Angelsen, Arild/0000-0002-6037-6849",,,,,53,20,20,1,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

We test three hypotheses about predictors of CCT program participation in indigenous societies in Bolivia, focusing on attributes of the household (ethnicity), parents (modern human capital), and children (age, sex). We model whether children receive a transfer from Bolivia's CCT program (Bono Juancito Pinto), using data from 811 school-age children and nine ethnic groups. Children from the group least exposed to Westerners (Tsimane') are 18-22 percentage points less likely to participate in the program than children from other lowland ethnic groups. Parental modern human capital and child sex do not predict participation. We discuss possible mechanisms underlying the findings and conclude that the Tsimane's current lower returns to schooling are the most likely explanation. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

However, much is still unknown about their effects. This article empirically analyses the effectiveness of several practices of human resource management, which are responsible according to those international institutions, in relation to three well-known dimensions of employees' wellbeing at work: job stress, job satisfaction and trust in management. The empirical analysis is conducted for the case of Catalonia using information from the Quality of Work Life Survey for 2007. The results show that, in general, higher job quality increases employees' wellbeing at work, but some practices are more effective than others for each specific wellbeing dimension. It is also noteworthy that some practices, such as job security and good environmental working conditions, seem to positively affect all domains of employees' wellbeing at work. (C) 2017 AEDEM.

The analysis uses a unique panel data set constructed for the purpose of this paper. It contains district inequality measures based on household income reported in six waves of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Sri Lanka during the period between 1990 and 2013, data on disaster affected population and other economic and social indicators. Employing a panel fixed effects estimator, we find that contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly and substantially decrease inequality in per adult equivalent household income as measured by the Theil index. Findings are robust across various inequality metrics, sub-samples and alternative estimators such as Ordinary Least Squares and System GMM. However, natural disasters do not affect household expenditure inequality. Either households behave as if they have a permanent income or all households reduce their expenditure proportionately irrespective of their income level in responding to natural disasters. Natural disasters decrease non-seasonal agricultural and non-agricultural income inequality but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality. Income of richer households is mainly derived from nonagricultural sources such as manufacturing and business activities and non-seasonal agricultural activities. Poorer households have a higher share of agricultural income. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Keerthiratne, Subhani; Tol, Richard S.

The empirical evidence suggests that investor sentiment has a positive impact on price volatility and the bid-ask spread on both the spot and futures markets, which induces higher arbitrage risk and trading costs during high sentiment periods. Consequently, during high sentiment periods, informed traders become less willing to leverage their information advantages on the futures market, which diminishes the futures markets' leading informational role and contributions to price discovery.

An important explanatory factor in the homicide rate is the association between socioeconomic variables and left political parties in state governments. The results provide empirical evidence that the WP's control of the government increased the homicide rate more than the other political parties. This suggests that increasing the number of years of WP occupation of the presidency leads to a more pronounced increase in the homicide rate, compared with other political parties. Although the observed trend indicates increased rates of homicide, more substantial growth was observed in almost all states under WP rule during the period 2003 to 2011, contributing to a higher overall level of violence in Brazil.","[Loureiro, Paulo R.

We apply a difference-in-difference method to analyse the impacts from the increased accessibility. The findings indicate growth in housing prices, population, commuting and employment on the islands. The growth rates of these variables depend on the case characteristics. Urban cases appear to promote larger growth on the island.

We address that issue using an equilibrium sorting model (ESM) calibrated, by way of example, to the circumstances of a road infrastructure project in the English town of Polegate. Previous ESM research has tended to assume that all households rent property from a fixed property stock. The narrative that arises from those models concerns environmental gentrification, wherein access to environmentally improved locations is appropriated by the relatively wealthy through their ability to out-compete the less wealthy in the rental property market. Our research shows that to be only part of a much more complex story. We develop a model that extends the sophistication with which ESMs replicate property market dynamics, allowing for households to choose whether to rent or purchase their home and introducing greater realism into housing supply responses to changing market conditions. Our research shows that property markets redistribute welfare gains across the population in complex ways in which tenure choice and housing supply constraints play central roles.","[Binner, Amy; Day, Brett] Univ Exeter, Sch Social Sci & Int Studies, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Binner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Social Sci & Int Studies, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",a.r.binner@exeter.ac.uk; brett.day@exeter.ac.uk,,"Binner, Amy/0000-0003-3235-0585; Day, Brett/0000-0001-7519-5672",ESRC [ES/G018618/1]; Department of Transport [ES/G018618/1]; ESRC through the Social and Environmental Economic Research (SEER) project [RES-060-25-0063],ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Department of Transport; ESRC through the Social and Environmental Economic Research (SEER) project(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This paper has been produced as part of a studentship jointly funded by the ESRC and Department of Transport (Ref ES/G018618/1).

Using a large panel data set of Italian corporations for the period 2000-2010, we first estimate firms' yearly productivity by removing the output contribution of the labor and capital inputs aggregates. We use different approaches aimed at solving input simultaneity, including a version of Ackerberg et al.'s ( 2015), control function approach, that also accounts for firm fixed effects. We then match the productivity estimates with rich information on the firms' use of part-time work obtained from survey data for the years 2005, 2007, and 2010 and estimate the impact of part-time work on productivity. We find that a 10% increase in the share of part-timers reduces productivity by 1.45%. The results suggest that this harmful effect stems from horizontal rather than vertical part-time arrangements. We also find that firms declaring to use part-time work to accommodate workers' requests suffer the most. Moreover, we show that the so-called flexible and elasticclauses are successful in cushioning the negative impact associated with part-time work.","[Devicienti, Francesco; Grinza, Elena; Vannoni, Davide] Univ Turin, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Corso Unione Sovietica 218, I-10134 Turin, Italy; [Devicienti, Francesco; Vannoni, Davide] Coll Carlo Alberto, Piazza Vincenzo Arbarello 8, I-10122 Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Grinza, E (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ Math & Stat, Corso Unione Sovietica 218, I-10134 Turin, Italy.",francesco.devicienti@unito.it; elena.grinza@unito.it; davide.vannoni@unito.it,"Devicienti, Francesco/HTP-9783-2023","GRINZA, ELENA/0000-0002-8978-634X",,,,,31,22,23,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

For this to happen three crucial parameters must be set in an appropriate way: the notional interest rate, the adjustment rate and the annuity conversion factor. I show that there exist two main approaches to implement a stable system. The first uses period-specific annuitization and indexation rates that correct for labor force increases, which are only due to rises in the retirement age which are necessary to neutralize' the increase in life expectancy. The second approach uses cohort-specific annuitization and indexation rates that are larger than in a stationary situation. This is due to the fact that a continuously increasing life expectancy leads to higher internal rates of return that can be passed on via the indexation.","[Knell, Markus] Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Studies Div, Otto Wagner Pl 3,POB 61, A-1011 Vienna, Austria",Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB),"Knell, M (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Nationalbank, Econ Studies Div, Otto Wagner Pl 3,POB 61, A-1011 Vienna, Austria.",markus.knell@oenb.at,,"Knell, Markus/0000-0003-1620-1651",,,,,32,10,10,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

I develop separate models in which the spending in question consists of (i) a nonexcludable good, (ii) a distributive consumption good, (iii) infrastructure spending and (iv) a transfer payment. A supermajority rule has no effect on spending for nonexcludable goods and ambiguous effects on spending for distributive projects and infrastructure spending. An increased supermajority requirement does unambiguously reduce transfer spending. I also relate the supermajority rule to the law of 1/n. If the Coase Theorem holds and a minimum winning coalition forms, an increase in the number of districts n has precisely the same effect on overall expenditure as a decrease in the supermajority requirement. Thus, the ambiguous spending effects stemming from supermajority rule carry over into this version of the law of 1/n.","[Pecorino, Paul] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Pecorino, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Box 870224, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",ppecorin@cba.ua.edu,"Pecorino, Paul/AAA-9292-2019","Pecorino, Paul/0000-0002-7659-7873",,,,,28,4,5,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,APR,2018,175.0,1-2,,,,,19,36,,10.1007/s11127-018-0512-x,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GA6QA,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000428457000002,0

The Human Rights Commission and later Council (UNHRCC) are internationally legitimized tools where member states shame repressive regimes for human rights violations in public resolutions. We argue that these resolutions can influence foreign investors in two main ways: (1) They signal that a state is an outcast, unable to secure alliances within the UN human rights bodies that protect it from being publicly shamed, with negative consequences for investment attractiveness ('outcast' effect). (2) They signal that a state is one of the most rogue, severe human rights violators because voting members of the UNHRCC may be aware of many human rights violations, but they pass resolutions only in the harshest cases ('bottleneck' effect). Any MNC associated with such a country risks severe reputational damage. Results from a panel data analysis of 165 countries (1977-2013) confirm that UNHRCC condemnations deter FDI. This effect is amplified by media reporting of human rights abuse, and stronger and more robust than a bad human rights record of a state itself. NGO shaming and milder UNHRCC sanctions (which do not reach resolution stage) have less strong effects, although the result on NGO shaming is to be seen with caution due to a reduced sample size.

The results provide evidence that off-farm employment reduces both time spent on irrigation in terms of total hours of irrigation and the amount of groundwater pumped. However, these effects have not resulted in losses of crop production. In fact, water productivity measured as output value produced per m(3) of groundwater pumped is higher among households with off-farm employment. These seemingly contradictory findings are explained by the increased use of water-saving technologies such as furrow irrigation, underground pipes and/or lined canals. These technologies reduce seepage losses during the conveyance of groundwater as well as during irrigation of the fields. As a result, less groundwater needs to be pumped to achieve the same level of groundwater irrigation application rate in the field.","[Yin, Ning] Hunan Agr Univ, Econ Coll, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qiuqiong] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Wang, Yumeng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hunan Agricultural University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Renmin University of China,"Wang, YM (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wymmyw@ruc.edu.cn,"huang, qiuqiong/A-8130-2009","Huang, Qiuqiong/0000-0002-3354-5213; Wang, Yumeng/0000-0001-8936-2304",,,,,48,8,10,3,24,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Our results are robust to different samples of cities, control groups, time spans, as well as omitting New York City or small towns. To identify this relationship we exploit the legislative granting of corporate bank charters and argue that lobbying introduced enough exogenous variation in bank location choices that the location of banks in this period was different from what it would have been under a system of free entry based on entrepreneurial expectations of a towns' future population. Using a generalized difference-in-difference approach, we show that towns that petition for and received a bank between 1821 and 1835 saw their population increase more rapidly than those that petitioned for and did not receive a bank. Because urbanization and modernization were correlated in the nineteenth century, these results are broadly consistent with the finance-growth nexus identified elsewhere in the economics and economic history literatures.","[Bodenhorn, Howard] Clemson Univ, Clemson, SC 29631 USA; [Bodenhorn, Howard] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Cuberes, David] Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",Clemson University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Clark University,"Cuberes, D (通讯作者)，Clark Univ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",dcuberes@clarku.edu,,,John Simon Guggenheim Foundation,John Simon Guggenheim Foundation,"We thank the Editor and several anonymous referees for their useful comments.

We develop an intergenerational model which shows that a two-tier higher education characterised by a division between elite and standard universities can be a key factor in generating permanent social stratification, social immobility and self-reproduction of the 'elite'. In our approach, low mobility at the top is essentially explained by the differences in quality and in selection between elite and standard universities. A key result is that the wider the quality gap and the difference in per-student expenditures between elite and standard universities, the less social mobility. This is because a larger quality gap reinforces the weight of family backgrounds at the expense of personal ability. Our simulations show that this impact can be large.

If the wage income inequality improves (deteriorates) in period 1 it worsens (ameliorates) in period 2 under the same sufficient conditions.

Finally, some composite policy recommendations have been suggested so that the relative wages always move in favor of the poorer section of the working population.","[Chaudhuri, Sarbajit] Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, 56A BT Rd, Kolkata 700050, India; [Ghosh, Arnab] KN Coll, Dept Econ, Dt Murshidabad, W Bengal, India; [Banerjee, Dibyendu] Serampore Coll, Dept Econ, Dt Hooghly, W Bengal, India",University of Calcutta,"Chaudhuri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calcutta, Dept Econ, 56A BT Rd, Kolkata 700050, India.",sarbajitch@yahoo.com; arnab_ghosh15@yahoo.com; dib_banerjee123@yahoo.com,"CHAUDHURI, Sarbajit/AAE-6343-2019","Chaudhuri, Sarbajit/0000-0003-1471-0460",,,,,48,18,20,2,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We find that the effects crucially depend on whether the CP's entry is constrained by the Internet service provider's network capacity. If the capacity is relatively large, the prioritization reduces the investment as CP's investment and prioritization form substitutes. With limited capacity, however, they become complements and the prioritization can facilitate the entry of congestion-sensitive content. Our analysis suggests that the optimal policy may call for potentially asymmetric regulations across mobile and fixed networks.","[Choi, Jay Pil] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Choi, Jay Pil] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Jeon, Doh-Shin] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Kim, Byung-Cheol] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",Michigan State University; Yonsei University; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Choi, JP (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;Choi, JP (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",choijay@msu.edu; dohshin.jeon@gmail.com; byung-cheol.kim@ua.edu,,,NET Institute; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A2A01022389],"NET Institute; Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","We thank Marc Bourreau, Jane Choi, Ben Hermalin, Jeroen Hinloopen, Joshua Gans, Vahagn Jerbashian, Bruno Jullien, Martin Peitz, Wilfried Sand-Zantman, Glenn Woroch, and seminar participants at various conferences and university seminars for helpful comments.

After the period of high growth, these banks have a lower return on assets and increase their loan loss reserves. The poorer performance of fast-growing banks is not explained by merger activity.

We empirically analyze 52,126 Phase I SBIR/STTR awards granted by 11 Federal agencies (2001-2011). We find a positive association between agency workforce diversity and Phase II funding for Phase I grantees, but minority and women technology entrepreneurs are less likely to receive this funding than their non-minority and male counterparts. Agencies valuing workforce ethnic diversity or leveraging gender homophily positively influence the likelihood of women technology entrepreneurs obtaining Phase II funding.

The most-common supporting argument is that private development contributes a wide variety of benefits to the locality. In contrast, a counter-argument exists that inadequate public oversight, together with profit maximization motives, leads to overreliance on takings by private entities. Utilizing a dataset of 259 taking projects for large industrial complexes in Korea, we show that private takings are more likely to result in irregularities such as cancellation than public takings.

We have used a panel-data quantile regression with a data set for 57 countries for the years 2005, 2008, and 2011 to estimate the distributional impacts of microcredits on two poverty indices. Results reveal not only that microfinance significantly reduces the incidence and depth of poverty, but also that this effect differs across the different poverty levels (quantiles). The effect of microcredit on poverty reduction is slightly larger among countries where the incidence and depth of poverty are the highest, suggesting that microcredit reaches and benefits even the poorest individuals.","[Lacalle-Calderon, Maricruz] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Dev, Sch Business & Econ, Carretera Colmenar,Km 16, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Perez-Trujillo, Manuel] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile; [Neira, Isabel] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Quantitat Econ, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Catolica del Norte; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Lacalle-Calderon, M (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Dev, Sch Business & Econ, Carretera Colmenar,Km 16, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",maicu.lacalle@uam.es,"Lacalle-Calderon, Maricruz/ABE-7071-2021; Neira, Isabel/AAI-7701-2020; Perez-Trujillo, Manuel/HJI-9281-2023","Lacalle-Calderon, Maricruz/0000-0001-6662-4527; Neira Gomez, Isabel/0000-0003-0619-5964",,,,,37,17,17,2,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-1533,1746-1049,,DEV ECON,Dev.

I find that covariance-based asset pricing models imply that the alpha is proportional to the residual risk of the traded factor. Empirical estimation of the price of the residual risk suggests that the q-factor model of Hou et al. (2015) subsumes the roles of not only the value and momentum factors but also the investment and profitability factors of Fama and French (2015). However, the Fama-French (2015) model fails to subsume the roles of the momentum factor and the factors in the q-factor model. The momentum factor, along with the profitability factor in the Fama-French (2015) or Novy-Marx (2013) model does not subsume the role of the profitability factor in the q-factor model.

With 50-state, 1970-2013 panel data on state government finance and disaster damage, we estimate disaster impacts on revenue, expenditure, debt issuance, and federal-state transfers. We find that following a disaster, states increase program expenditure and receive more federal transfers. Disasters have limited impact on total tax revenues but amplify fluctuations in sales, income, and property tax revenues. Our findings suggest that disaster-induced additional spending is largely financed through federal transfers, which include not only disaster relief funds but also non-disaster-related public welfare assistance.","[Miao, Qing] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Publ Policy, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Hou, Yilin] Syracuse Univ, Maxwell Sch, Ctr Policy Res, Syracuse, NY USA; [Abrigo, Michael] Philippine Inst Dev Studies, Manila, Philippines",Rochester Institute of Technology; Syracuse University,"Miao, Q (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Publ Policy, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",qxmgla@rit.edu; yihou@maxwell.syr.edu; mabrigo@mail.pids.gov.ph,"Abrigo, Michael R.M./GZH-2928-2022",,,,,,65,28,37,1,13,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We do this using a four-step process with focus on Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to measure its efficiency. Our analysis show that lower volatility was found in short-term for countries that experienced fast paced economic growth. This increase in volatility is supported by a decrease in efficiency for the short-term, while market integration rose during periods of crises, which represent higher volatility. Hence, a tripartite relationship between our parameters is observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We find that an increase in bank monitoring incentives significantly reduce the sensitivity of CEO wealth to stock return volatility (Vega). The results are more profound when bank lenders are more powerful and reputable and have a prior lending relationship with the borrowing firms. Additionally, Vega decreases after financial covenant violations and increases when bank lenders have offsetting equity stakes in borrowing firms. The reduction in Vega due to bank monitoring has some real effects on borrowing firms' corporate policies. These results together suggest banks have a unique role in monitoring and shaping CEO incentives to mitigate the risk-shifting incentives of firm managers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluate the impact of RSBY on RSBY beneficiary households' (average treatment impact on treated, ATT) utilization of health services, per capita out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure, and per patient OOP expenditure on major morbidities. To address the issue of non -randomness in enrollment into the scheme, we exploit the longitudinal aspect of a large nationally representative household survey data to implement difference-indifferences with matching. We find that RSBY beneficiary households are more likely to report and receive treatment for long-term morbidity in rural areas: however. the differences in reporting and treatment of long-term morbidity is not statistically significant in urban areas. We do not find strong evidence that the RSBY reduced per person OOP expenditure for RSBY beneficiary households in both rural and urban areas. Conditional on having received medical treatment, we find that RSBY beneficiary patient spend less on medicine in rural areas but no statistically significant impact in urban areas. We also conduct a placebo experiment to support the parallel trend assumption of DID. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate that precautionary capital needs for the entire financial sector reached $2 trillion during the crisis. We also investigate the long-standing observation that equity volatility asymmetrically responds to positive and negative news.

The documented predictability holds for annual and multi-annual horizons and works both in- and out-of-sample, providing strong evidence that expected returns in stock markets are time varying.

In a continuously improving food labelling regulation environment consumer studies regarding the baby food labelling are very limited. Present article has an exploratory nature and aims to find specific patterns of baby food buying behaviour and labelling preference in Romania and Hungary, and also to reveal the behavioural similarities and differences between the two countries. To meet this aim, a questionnaire-based quantitative research was designed. The sample consists of 993 mothers (590 from Hungary and 403 from Romania) with small children. Results show that there is a difference between Romanian and Hungarian mothers regarding the baby food buying habits. The profile of the mothers buying jarred baby food can be characterised by living in towns, with one or two children, and the propensity to give jarred baby food to their child is growing with their age. The mothers agree that the labels contain tiny, unreadable letters, disordered information, unknown expressions and bad translation. The Hungarian mothers pay more attention to the indication of allergen and to the ingredients list. The most important information cluster they seek on a label is related to product ingredients, the second is related to usage of baby food and the least important are the label design elements. The paper provides insightful results for the producers and policy-makers to improve the baby food label quality to help consumers to make better, healthier and safer food choices for their children.","[Hajdu, Noemi; Liptak, Katalin] Univ Miskolc, Miskolc, Hungary; [Saplacan, Zsuzsa] Babes Bolyai Univ, Cluj Napoca, Romania",University of Miskolc; Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Lipták, K (通讯作者)，Univ Miskolc, Miskolc, Hungary.",liptak.katalin@uni-miskolc.hu,"Liptak, Katalin/ITV-5086-2023; Liptak, Katalin/ACU-5475-2022; Săplăcan, Zsuzsa/AEC-4971-2022","Liptak, Katalin/0000-0001-6714-0858; Liptak, Katalin/0000-0001-6714-0858; Hajdu, Noemi/0000-0002-9288-6907",,,,,47,5,5,0,5,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2018,20.0,47,,,,,62,83,,,,,,22,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FZ8BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000427829800005,0

The model sheds light on leverage cycles. During periods absent disasters: equity premia decrease; credit spreads decrease; expected loss-given-default increases; and leverage ratios increase. Time-since-prior-disaster is the key model conditioning variable. In response to a disaster, risk premia increase while firms sharply reduce labor, capital and leverage, with response size increasing in time-since-prior-disasters. Firms with high bankruptcy costs are most responsive to the time-since-disaster variable. Disaster responses are more pronounced than in an otherwise equivalent economy featuring observed disaster risk. Empirical tests of novel corporate finance predictions are conducted.

A security's expected return is decomposed into its carry, an ex-ante and model-free characteristic, and its expected price appreciation. Carry predicts returns cross-sectionally and in time series for a host of different asset classes, including global equities, global bonds, commodities, US Treasuries, credit, and options. Carry is not explained by known predictors of returns from these asset classes, and it captures many of these predictors, providing a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models with varying risk premia, in which carry strategies are commonly exposed to global recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explains carry's premium.

Consistent with our hypothesis, we find larger downward adjustments in the audits immediately before stock-financed acquisitions. Further analysis of regulatory sanctions suggests the downward adjustments are in fact warranted, rather than auditors being overly conservative.

In this paper, we discuss four policy scenarios that explore two overarching issues: (1) the effects of a carbon tax under alternative assumptions about the use of the resulting revenue, and (2) the effects of a system of import charges on carbon-intensive goods (border carbon adjustments or BCAs). Consistent with earlier studies, we find that the carbon tax raises considerable revenue and reduces CO2 emissions significantly relative to baseline, no matter how the revenue is used. Gross annual revenue from the carbon tax with lump sum rebating and no BCA begins at $110 billion in 2020 and rises gradually to $170 billion in 2040. By 2040, annual CO2 emissions fall from 5.5 billion metric tons (BMT) under the baseline to 2.4 BMT, a decline of 3.1 BMT, or 57%. Cumulative emissions over 2020 to 2040 fall by 48 BMT. Also consistent with earlier studies, we find that the carbon tax has very small overall impacts on gross domestic product (GDP), wages, employment, and consumption. Different uses of the revenue from the carbon tax result in slightly different levels and compositions of GDP across consumption, investment and net exports. Overall, using carbon tax revenue to reduce the capital income tax rate results in better macroeconomic outcomes than using the revenue for lump sum transfers. Counter to their purported purpose of protecting U.S. trade strength, for a given revenue policy, BCAs tend to produce lower net exports than the carbon taxes alone. This is generally because the BCAs raise the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, thus lowering exports more than they lower imports. This is consistent with standard results in the international trade literature on the effects of import tariffs and export subsidies on real exchange rates, a result that is often overlooked in the discussion of domestic carbon policy. In a finding new to the literature, our results show that BCAs can have strikingly different effects depending on the use of the revenue. Under a lump sum rebate, BCAs exacerbate the impact of the carbon tax by lowering domestic output further than it would fall under the carbon tax alone. Under a capital tax swap, however, BCAs have a moderating effect: they reduce the impact of the tax on most industries.","[McKibbin, Warwick J.; Liu, Weifeng] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [McKibbin, Warwick J.; Morris, Adele C.; Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wilcoxen, Peter J.] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA",Australian National University; Brookings Institution; Syracuse University,"Morris, AC (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",amorris@brookings.edu,"McKibbin, Warwick J/A-4919-2008","McKibbin, Warwick J/0000-0002-1604-1021; Liu, Weifeng/0000-0001-9466-3558",Alex C.

The development of resource tenure interventions that promote sustainable management practices has been challenged by the difficulties of determining how contextual factors affect environmental outcomes given the complexity of socio-ecological systems. Realist synthesis is a promising evidence review technique for identifying the mechanisms that influence policy intervention outcomes in complex systems. Through a combination of inductive and deductive analysis of the links between context, mechanisms, and outcomes, realist synthesis can help clarify when, how, where, and why property regime interventions are likely to result in positive environmental outcomes. Our study revealed the importance of disaggregating property regimes into sub-categories, rather than treating them as homogenous categories, More importantly, use of a realist synthesis approach allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which three mechanisms perceptions of legitimacy, perceptions of the likelihood of benefits, and perceptions of enforcement capacity interact under different socio-ecological contexts to trigger behavioral changes that affect environmental conditions. The approach revealed the multi-faceted and interactive nature of perceptions of legitimacy, in which legal legitimacy, social acceptability, and ecological credibility combined to create robust legitimacy. The existence of robust legitimacy in turn appeared to be an important contributor to the success of regulatory systems reliant on voluntary compliance. Our study contributes to the field of natural resources governance by demonstrating the utility of a systematic review method which has received little attention by property scholars but which has promise to clarify understanding of how complex systems work. Our study also highlights that achieving long-term sustainability requires paying greater attention to the mechanisms that support or undermine people's willingness to voluntarily engage in conservation behaviors.

Many of these abstract away from the effects of kinship on incentives for public goods provision, though. Here, a simple model is devised that illustrates how genetic relatedness changes the incentive structure of that paradigmatic game which is conventionally used to model and experimentally investigate collective action problems: the linear public goods game. Using recent anthropological data sets on relatedness in contemporary hunter-gatherer and horticulturalist societies the parameters of the model are estimated. It turns out that the kinship patterns observed in these societies substantially reduce the negative effect of increasing group size on incentives for public goods provision. It is suggested, therefore, that renewed attention should be given to inclusive fitness theory in the context of public goods provision also in sizable groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This Distance to Compliance portfolio describes an implementable strategy and incorporates the interactions of all Basel III ratios. We derive the portfolio in a microeconomic banking model in which the board decides on the regulatory target levels and bears the responsibility in case the bank fails to meet the regulatory requirements in a stress situation. We apply our framework to two hypothetical banks and find that they achieve compliance by growth strategies without cutting lending. We corroborate that shareholders choose different compliance strategies than managers, emphasizing the importance of setting managers' incentives carefully. We compare our results to findings from impact studies that are not model-based and do not consider the interactions of the Basel III ratios. We observe that the synergies of LCR and NSFR are the most pronounced ones but of secondary order in absolute magnitude. This means that measuring Distance to Compliance on a ratio-by-ratio basis omitting synergies, as often done by regulators, does not introduce a major bias. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 1560 articles published from 2010 to 2015 were scrutinized. The findings revealed that research is bipartite between technological and research domains, with Big Data publications not clearly aligning cutting edge techniques toward Marketing benefits.

Cooperative is a form of business built on the concept of mutual cooperation. The government supports the existence of cooperatives in Indonesia in the form of providing tax incentives. This is what makes cooperatives different from other corporate taxpayers and used as objects in this study. This study aims at examining the influence of cooperative taxpayers' trust and the power of the tax authorities on cooperatives taxpayer compliance. The research method used is quantitative method. Data collection technique used is survey letters from 132 respondents. The mail survey was conducted by sending a letter to the cooperative incorporated in the Indonesian Cooperative Council (DEKOPIN). The research analysis uses Multiple Linear Regression. The results showed that there was an influence between cooperative taxpayer trust and the power of tax authorities to cooperatives taxpayer compliance.","[Andyarini, Kus Tri] Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekon Indonesia, Dept Accounting, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Subroto, Bambang; Subekti, Imam; Rosidi, Rosidi] Univ Brawijaya, Dept Econ & Business, Malang, Jawa Timur, Indonesia",Brawijaya University,"Andyarini, KT (通讯作者)，Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekon Indonesia, Dept Accounting, Jakarta, Indonesia.",kus3andyarini@yahoo.co.id; subekti@ub.ac.id,"ROSIDI, ROSIDI/AAD-5550-2021",,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-675-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,73.0,,,,,,230,233,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM7PB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000468277500050,0

Mainstream theory of consumption, though it is aware of this effect, for its focus primarily on the aggregate consumption, it doesn't pay much attention to this. However, if it is possible toaccurately describe and quantify this so-called relative income effect, it will mean a relevant contribution to the explanation of individual consumption patterns or consumption of income categories. The aim of this work is to find, describe and precisely quantify the impact of relative income on the average propensity to consume on the example of Czech households. To achieve this goal, we use a regression estimation of the dynamic panel using GMM, where the individual panels are set as income categories of households. The results achieved unambiguously confirm the validity of the initial assumption about the existence of functional dependence of the propensity to consume on the relative income and thus it fully supports the idea of interdependent concept of utility and consumption.","[Badura, Ondrej] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Badura, O (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ondrej.badura@vsb.cz,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The text includes the results of analysis of the situation of informal caregivers in the Czech Republic executed by the Fund for Further Education of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic (MLSA) dating from 2014 and also comments on the measures accepted by the MLSA, which are intended to resolve the most common difficulties faced by caregivers. In the survey informal caregivers state that the most serious effects are loss of leisure time, mental exhaustion and restrictions to their social life. The majority of caregivers stated that they find it difficult to make ends meet on their monthly income. Only a quarter of caregivers retained their full-time job. Compared to original expectations in many spheres the changes presented and promoted by the MLSA do not support informal care as much as was originally expected. The proposed changes partially counterbalance the disinterest of the state in informal caregivers during previous years, however, the most important issue - a long-term strategy - is nowhere in sight.","[Barak, Vladimir; Krebs, Vojtech] Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Barák, V (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",vladimir.barak@vse.cz; krebs@vse.cz,,,Internal grant competition of the University of Economics in Prague Social housing 2015 - 2025: economic-political recommendations [F5/66/2016 (IG504046)],Internal grant competition of the University of Economics in Prague Social housing 2015 - 2025: economic-political recommendations,This paper originated with the support of a grant from the Internal grant competition of the University of Economics in Prague Social housing 2015 - 2025: economic-political recommendations.

Although entrepreneurship education has consequently been integrated into the new engineering degrees, is this enough to boost entrepreneurship among engineers and on what does their level of entrepreneurship depend? This research work aims to analyze the impact of entrepreneurial motivations on entrepreneurial intentions among future engineers and identify the role than entrepreneurship education plays in the development of the engineers' entrepreneurship. The results indicate that the need for independence is the key factor in the entrepreneurial intent of future engineers and confirm the positive contribution that entrepreneurship education has on their entrepreneurial intentions.

This research was conducted using a set of questionnaire to 190 married couples, whereby five Likert-scale questionnaires used as an instrument to gather the data.

While public companies have already been thoroughly examined, it is still necessary to broaden the knowledge about the impact of accounting quality on access to finance of private enterprises. For that reason, the analysis conducted in our article covers the discussion on the impact of tax law on accounting, and as a result on sources of finance - capital structure and bank loan. We investigate the influence of book-tax conformity on maturity of the bank debt of private companies in Poland. In our article we attempt to answer the following research questions: whether the accounting quality plays a role in the access to finance of private enterprises and impacts the loan covenants, i.e. maturity of financing with bank debt? Whether the reduction of asymmetrical information thanks to the higher accounting quality, enables lending for longer period? To answer this questions we verify if enterprises with higher accounting quality (lower discretional accruals and higher book-tax differential (lower book-tax conformity)) obtain finance with higher maturity of the bank debt. We find that due to delivering higher quality financial information to lenders, enterprises obtain bank loans for a longer period. While in the case of book-tax conformity, our predictions are true only for profitable enterprises. Moreover, more risky enterprises prefer to use funding for longer periods to secure benefits from increase in their sale thanks to growth opportunity.","[Bialek-Jaworska, Anna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland; [Wojtowicz, Piotr] Univ Cracow, Fac Management Econ, Krakow, Poland",University of Warsaw; Jagiellonian University,"Bialek-Jaworska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",abialek@wne.uw.edu.pl; wojtowip@uek.krakow.pl,"Wójtowicz, Piotr/GLU-9609-2022; Białek-Jaworska, Anna/B-9059-2017","Wójtowicz, Piotr/0000-0001-5054-9964; Białek-Jaworska, Anna/0000-0003-4520-8916",,,,,41,0,0,0,2,ANGLO-AMER UNIV,PRAHA 1,"LETENSKA 5, PRAHA 1, 118 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-906585-7-8,,,,2018,,,,,,,318,331,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM3BI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000461826900028,0

We estimate that at least 60% of the decline in leasing reflects a liquidity crunch linked to retroactive application of the fee in a time of low natural gas prices. We also observe limited pass-through of the fee to resource owners. Firms could not change the terms of leases signed before the fee, and only half of the fee was passed through in new leases, primarily through a lower royalty rate.","[Black, Katie Jo] Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, 311 Ascension Hall, Gambier, OH 43022 USA; [McCoy, Shawn J.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, 4505 S Maryland Pkwy,Box 6005, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Weber, Jeremy G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3804 WWPH,230 South Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Weber, Jeremy G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 3804 WWPH,230 South Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",University System of Ohio; Kenyon College; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Las Vegas; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Black, KJ (通讯作者)，Kenyon Coll, Dept Econ, 311 Ascension Hall, Gambier, OH 43022 USA.",blackk@kenyon.edu; shawn.mccoy@unlv.edu; j.weber@pitt.edu,,,,,,,61,12,13,2,20,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

These benefits run through various channels such as better access to powered equipment or higher business association membership; but not better access to credit.","[Boly, Amadou] African Dev Bank AfDB, Macroecon Policy Forecasting & Res Dept, 6 Ave Joseph Anoma,01 BP 1387, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",African Development Bank Group (AfDB),"Boly, A (通讯作者)，African Dev Bank AfDB, Macroecon Policy Forecasting & Res Dept, 6 Ave Joseph Anoma,01 BP 1387, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire.",a.boly@afdb.org,,,,,,,31,20,20,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The 2013 collapse of Rana Plaza revealed worker safety and other social issues in RMG factories in Bangladesh, showing that formal, top-down approaches to these problems, including corporate codes-of-conduct and reforms in Bangladeshi labor laws, have little effect. Supply chain sustainability is a key issue for business, government and civil society. Satisfactory theoretical approaches to promoting social sustainability in supply chains are lacking. A case study using qualitative document analysis identifies the key institutional factors related to social sustainability in the Bangladeshi RMG industry, with a modified version of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework as an analytical frame. Key elements of other frameworks for social sustainability are discussed in terms of how well the IAD framework captures those concepts, and how employing the IAD could enhance supply chain analysis.","[Carlson, Laura A.; Bitsch, Vera] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Econ Hort & Landscaping, Alte Akad 16, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Carlson, LA (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Chair Econ Hort & Landscaping, Alte Akad 16, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",laura.carlson@tum.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG); Technical University of Munich; German Federal Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Technical University of Munich; German Federal Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Technical University of Munich within the Open Access Publishing Funding Programme.

With a particular focus on US equity options, I review the historical development of this powerful concept, practical details of fitting an RND to options market prices, and the many ways in which investigators have tried to distill true expectations and risk premia from observed RNDs.

A new but actively growing literature is now emerging at their intersection. I review this literature and argue that shadow banking in China is not fundamentally different from the textbook definition of shadow banking, namely credit intermediation with maturity mismatch that is structured to avoid regulation. I emphasize maturity mismatch because that is what creates run risk and makes any shadow banking system inherently fragile. I explain how the rise of shadow banking in China can be traced back to stricter liquidity regulation, how shadow banking has changed the financial landscape in China, and what the current state of the industry is. Interactions between shadow banking and the rest of the economy have some characteristics that reflect China's unique politico-economic structure, but this is because the rest of the economy has these characteristics, not because there is something fundamentally different about the forces behind shadow banking in China.","[Hachem, Kinda] Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA; [Hachem, Kinda] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Virginia; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Hachem, K (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Darden Sch Business, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA.;Hachem, K (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,61,23,23,6,90,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4810-6,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

In comparison with traditional market risk factor, our findings are in favor of VaR and ES factor as it significantly affects the cross-sectional of excess stock returns and fulfills the criteria of risk aversion.","[Haque, Abdul] COMSAT Inst Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan; [Nasir, Adeel] Univ Punjab, Jhelum Campus, Lahore, Pakistan",COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI); University of Punjab,"Haque, A (通讯作者)，COMSAT Inst Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan.",,"Nasir, Adeel/W-2023-2017; Nasir, Adeel/AAM-3544-2020","Nasir, Adeel/0000-0002-4065-3159;",,,,,31,1,1,0,2,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,51,62,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.004,0.0,,,12,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200004,0

For equity market development, we find mixed results regarding the effect of ADRs that are consistent with previous research. We also find some support that creditor rights have a positive influence on equity market development. For credit market development, we distinguish between credit provided by deposit-taking banks and that provided by non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). Bank credit is mainly determined by creditor rights, whereas non-bank credit is mainly determined by anti-director rights. Results from ADRs and creditor rights suggest that NBFIs are more concerned with rights that protect investors from insider expropriation and are less concerned with rights that protect creditors when a firm is bankrupt.

The profitability of the beef industry remains under pressure due to various external factors. Previous research has shown that many factors influence feedlot performance and profitability. It is, however, very difficult to judge an animal's inherit feedlot performance before it enters the feedlot. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the animal traits of Santa Gertrudis bulls and the feedlot profitability of these bulls. Analysed traits included the sheath score, capacity score and build score as high scores for these traits are believed to be associated with better feedlot performance. The data for this study was collected from 48 Santa Gertrudis bull calves. The profitability of feeding cattle was expressed as the Total Margin (TM) and Feed Margin (FM). Given the nature of the dependant variables, Ordinary Least Squared regressions were used for the analyses with TM and FM as dependent variables. Results show that although both models were significant, the sheath score was the only individual trait that proved to be significantly correlated with both TM and FM. Sheath score proved to be negatively correlated with TM and FM while it was expected, through popular belief, to be positively correlated. This implies that animals with lower sheath scores, thus with sheaths closer to their bodies, perform better in the feedlot and may affect the TM and FM positively. The magnitude of this trait still remains under question and further research is required.","[Lombard, W. A.; Mare, F.

Investor sentiment, as measured by the informational tone of stock market reports from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News outlets, is compared across 2 classification dictionaries: the Harvard General Inquirer IV-4 dictionary and the financial context-specific dictionary of Loughran and McDonald [2011]. Empirical analyses find a negative relationship between measures of investor pessimism and real stock returns. However, this relationship is strongest and statistically significant only for the context-specific measures. The results suggest that investor sentiment based on contextualized information is able to explain medium- to longer-term swings in aggregate stock prices. This, in turn, implies that investor interpretation of stock market information may not unfold in mechanical ways.","[Mangee, Nicholas] Georgia Southern Univ, Savannah, GA USA",,"Mangee, N (通讯作者)，Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Coll Business, Hawes Hall Room 208G,11935 Abercorn St, Savannah, GA 31419 USA.",nicholas.mangee@armstrong.edu,,,Institute of New Economic Thinking,Institute of New Economic Thinking,The Institute of New Economic Thinking supported this research.,,43,6,7,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The thesis we will defend is that today GNH is the more appropriate indicator for measuring of the national economies. The main and most popular macroeconomic indicator of the national accounts system in the world is GDP. GDP is accepted standard for measuring and managing the size of an economy. It is based on simple accounting and can be calculated using output, expenditure, or income figures. By all three methods, the goal is to measure the final result of the economic activity of each economy. The idea of GDP today, however, can be criticized. This basic measure has a number of constraints, and the question is whether there is an alternative to it? It is sought in the balance between material well-being, spiritual, emotional and cultural needs of individuals and society. Such an alternative is GNH - an indicator that measures the collective happiness and well-being of a population. GNH is distinguishable from GDP by valuing collective happiness as the goal of governance, by emphasizing harmony with nature and traditional values as expressed in several areas of happiness such as psychological wellbeing, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance and others and pillars of GNH as sustainable and equitable socio-economic development, environmental conservation, preservation and promotion of culture, good governance. The tasks of this research are related firstly to the presentation of GDP and GNH in their essence and secondly, to finding the advantages and disadvantages of using GDP and GNH as main measures in the economy.","[Marikina, Maria] Univ Natl & World Econ, Dept Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of National & World Economics - Bulgaria,"Marikina, M (通讯作者)，Univ Natl & World Econ, Dept Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria.",mmarikina@unwe.eu,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,12,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2018,,,,,,,188,193,,,,,,6,Development Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Development Studies; Business & Economics,BM5GU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000464906000020,0

The evidence on the referendum uniformly finds that requiring voter approval for new spending (or new debt) results in lower spending (or lower debt). The initiative process is associated with lower spending and taxes in American states and Swiss cantons, but with higher spending in cities.

Policies are more likely to be congruent with majority opinion in states with the initiative process than states without the initiative, suggesting that direct democracy allows the majority to counteract the power of special interests in policy making.","[Matsusaka, John G.] Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA",University of Southern California,"Matsusaka, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",matsusak@usc.edu,,,USC,USC,"I am grateful for helpful feedback from Zareh Asatryan, Lars Feld, Christina Gathmann, Rod Kiewiet, Jeffrey Lax, Nolan McCarty, David Primo, Christoph Schaltegger, Stefan Voigt, and anonymous referees.

While many ports have moved out of city locations, partly facilitated by intermodal corridors, some ports remain in city locations, many retaining a large share-of distribution activity in or near the port. This paper will consider distribution challenges arising from the port-city dynamic in relation to the port-inland distribution axis, in particular the role of port and city planners and decision makers in managing this process. The case analysis is based on the Port of Gothenburg, the largest port in Scandinavia. Findings suggest that the majority of influencing factors are marginally in favour of siting distribution facilities inland rather than near the port, yet city planning and national sentiment continue to incentivise development near the port. There are two conclusions for the port-centric city. First, it needs to coordinate its logistics from a regional perspective, determine what activities belong near the port and not compete with inland locations for what is better located there. Second, port-centric logistics needs to be better aligned with an urban freight transport and city logistics perspective.","[Monios, Jason] Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle, F-13009 Marseille, France; [Monios, Jason; Bergqvist, Rickard; Woxenius, Johan] Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, POB 610, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Kedge Business School; University of Gothenburg,"Bergqvist, R (通讯作者)，Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Business Adm, POB 610, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",rickard.bergqvist@handels.gu.se,"Woxenius, Johan/A-7765-2016; Monios, Jason/U-4532-2018","Woxenius, Johan/0000-0002-3657-196X;",,,,,53,43,46,11,87,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

This definition allows for an analysis of the contradictions between national development objectives and personal aspirations in the lives of research-protagonists, and through this provides important insights into the nature of the Eritrean state.

For these reasons, agriculture and food-related issues have always played an important role in trade negotiations. In June 2013, the European Commission (EC) launched negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), an agreement that aims to remove barriers to trade and investment between the EU and the US. However, important political responsiveness, regulatory regimes heterogeneity in particular agri-food safety standards are still existing. Furthermore, the EU Member States are fairly heterogeneous as regards the relative importance of agri-food trade for their economies. The agri-food industries are of particular strategic interest for many governments. Changes in the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and thus the Euro-Mediterranean zone have direct implications for farmers, consumer protection and for the animal welfare. The research question was, if the EU Mediterranean countries will benefit from the TTIP and what effects would the TTIP have on the CAP, agri-food quality standards and food safety? The present article attempts to investigate whether the TTIP negotiations and the CAP instruments and their adjustments improve the prospects that the Euro-Mediterranean regions can be food secure in the future and a sustainable development is possible as well as to ensure food safety.","[Pietrzyck, Katja; Petersen, Brigitte] Univ Bonn, Int FoodNetCtr, Bonn, Germany; [Driouech, Noureddin] CIHEAM Mediterranean Agron Inst Bari, Valenzano, Italy",University of Bonn; CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI,"Pietrzyck, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Int FoodNetCtr, Bonn, Germany.",katja.pietrzyck@uni-bonn.de; b-petersen@uni-bonn.de; driouech@iamb.it,,"Driouech, Noureddin/0000-0002-8615-0426",,,,,34,0,0,0,3,"INST AGRICULTURAL & FOOD ECONOMICS, NATIONAL RESEARCH INST-IAFE-NRI",WARSZAWA,"UL.

Existence and stability of equilibrium of this system are studied. We show numerically that the model gives chaotic and unpredictable trajectories as a consequence of change in the information parameter, but in our case there are also stable trajectories for each value of the information parameter. To provide some numerical evidence for the chaotic behavior of the system we present various numerical results including bifurcation diagrams, strange attractors, Lyapunov numbers and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.","[Sarafopoulos, Georges; Papadopoulos, Kosmas] Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Komotini 69100, Greece",Democritus University of Thrace,"Sarafopoulos, G (通讯作者)，Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Econ, Komotini 69100, Greece.",gsarafop@econ.duth.gr,,"SARAFOPOULOS, GEORGES/0000-0002-6984-6659",,,,,24,2,2,0,1,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,131,144,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3534,0.0,,,14,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000008,0

The results, using the QQ approach, show asymmetric negative association between credit and markets for all industries and that the link depends on both the sign and size of the stock market shocks (i.e., bullish or bearish conditions in the CDS and/or stock markets). The sensitivity of CDS returns to stock markets shocks is higher in the extreme quantiles. Using the nonparametric causality-in-quantile tests, we find evidence of causality-in-mean from stock to CDS only for the Financial (in average and upper quantiles), Consumer Services and Oil & Gas sectors (only for the middle quantile i.e., 0.5). In addition, the causality-in-mean from the CDS to stock markets is only found for the Financial and Telecommunication sectors in the extreme lower quantiles.

While numerous rigorous impact evaluations have shown that they have been successful in increasing school enrollment and attendance, the evidence on learning achievement is still mixed, and there are no studies that analyze the effect on school placement. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that the Programme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH), Jamaica's CCT program, contributes to breaking the intergenerational poverty cycle by placing its urban beneficiaries on a higher educational trajectory. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that PATH urban male beneficiaries who sat the Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) over the period 2010-14 performed better on the test (scoring 22.48 points, or 5.1%, higher than non-beneficiaries); consequently, they were placed in better secondary schools (7.2 percentiles higher in a national school ranking based on preprogram GSAT scores). In contrast, we find no significant impact on aspirations or on any outcome indicators for urban girls. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in the literature to take a comprehensive look at the impacts of a CCT program on educational aspirations, school performance, and placement.

This study provides insight into the attributes of TFSA participants. I use data from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for general participation trends and the 2012 Survey of Financial Security (SFS) to examine the socio-economic characteristics of participants and their contributions. Examining data from the CRA, I find that the majority of tax-filing Canadians did not participate in the TFSA program by 2013, with age and income level affecting participation and contribution decisions. Evidence from the SFS data corroborates that obtained from the CRA data. I find that households with children or households headed by individuals with less than postsecondary education are less likely to participate. In addition, I find that households with higher net worth are more likely to participate and contribute more. Consequently, I conclude that TFSAs are likely to have an economically significant distributional impact, making them less attractive on distributional grounds.","[Al Zaman, Ashraf] St Marys Univ, Sobey Sch Business, Dept Finance Informat Syst & Management Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"Al Zaman, A (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Sobey Sch Business, Dept Finance Informat Syst & Management Sci, Halifax, NS, Canada.",,,,"Department of Finance, Information Systems & Management Science at Sobey School of Business","Department of Finance, Information Systems & Management Science at Sobey School of Business","I thank the Department of Finance, Information Systems & Management Science at Sobey School of Business for its research support and participants at the departmental seminar series and the Annual Conference of Canadian Economics Association 2016 for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Individuals are more likely to file and to report their taxes when they believe that other individuals are also filing and reporting their taxes; conversely, when individuals believe that others are cheating on their taxes, they may well become cheaters themselves. We use experimental methods to test the role of such information about peer effects on compliance behaviour. In one treatment setting, we inform individuals about the frequency that their neighbours submit a tax return. In a second treatment setting, we inform them about the number of their neighbours who are audited, together with the penalties that they pay. In both cases, we examine the impact of information on filing behaviour and also on subsequent reporting behaviour. We find that providing information on whether one's neighbours are filing returns and/or reporting income has a statistically significant and economically large impact on individual filing and reporting decisions. However, this neighbour' information does not always improve compliance, depending on the exact content of the information.","[Alm, James] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Bloomquist, Kim M.] US Internal Revenue Serv, Taxpayer Advocate Serv, Washington, DC USA; [McKee, Michael] Appalachian State Univ, Walker Coll Business, Boone, NC 28608 USA",Tulane University; University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University,"Alm, J (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",jalm@tulane.edu; kim.bloomquist@irs.gov; mckeemj@appstate.edu,,,Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [TIRNO-07-P-00683],Internal Revenue Service (IRS),"This research was partially funded by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (TIRNO-07-P-00683).

We elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for organic/non-organic and local/non-local wines with increasing levels of information on the impact of agricultural practices at both global and local scales. The analysis shows that there is a significant organic premium associated with both local and non-local wines. This organic premium significantly increases with information and significantly decreases with the distance between the consumer's home and the vineyard. Based on the econometric predictions of the WTP, we show that a per-unit tax on non-organic wines or a standard imposing organic practices increases welfare through the internalization of the attributes revealed by the experiment.","[Ay, Jean-Sauveur] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, AgroSup Dijon, INRA, UMR 1041,CESAER, 25 Bd Petitjean, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Chakir, Raja; Marette, Stephan] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRA, UMR Econ Publ, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",INRAE; Institut Agro; AgroSup Dijon; AgroParisTech; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Ay, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, AgroSup Dijon, INRA, UMR 1041,CESAER, 25 Bd Petitjean, F-21000 Dijon, France.",jsay@dijon.inra.fr; raja.chakir@agroparistech.fr; stephan.marette@agroparistech.fr,"CHAKIR, RAJA/X-1414-2019; Ay, Jean-sauveur jsay/F-9868-2018","CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0002-6980-0343; CHAKIR, RAJA/0000-0003-3821-092X",European Commission Seventh Framework Programme in the frame of RURAGRI ERA-NET [235175 TRUSTEE (ANR-13-RURA-0001-01)],European Commission Seventh Framework Programme in the frame of RURAGRI ERA-NET(European Union (EU)),"We thank Fabienne Bouillot, Christophe Martin and Victorien Marette for their help in the experimental lab in Dijon.

The dampening effect of elections on IPO activity is stronger for firms with more concentrated businesses in their home states, firms that are more dependent on government contracts (particularly state contracts), and harder-to-value firms.

The positive association is attenuated in firms with fewer financial constraints, only weakly affected by firm governance, and not affected by investment opportunities or controlling shareholder type. The results highlight the fact that firms disgorge cash to compensate shareholders for trading restrictions and conclude that dividends persist when firms have easier access to external financing.

This question was addressed using household data from the panel study of income dynamics (PSID) and a quarterly MSA level house price index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, controlling for local labor market conditions. House price shocks were calculated as the cumulative sum of residuals of a second order autoregressive model from the previous four years. Results showed that positive house price shocks stabilized marriage for all couples. A one standard deviation increase in the house price shock decreased the risk of divorce in the following year by about 13-18%. The results were driven by the younger cohort of households in the PSID, those with lower educational attainment, and those with relatively low family income. The findings are discussed in the context of theories on changes in marital surplus, and changes in the transaction costs surrounding divorce.","[Klein, Jennifer] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Klein, J (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",jennifer.klein@colorado.edu,,"Klein, Jennifer/0000-0001-8332-4147","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,52,10,15,0,19,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Because of the suspected simultaneity between profit levels, the choice to be copreneurial and relationship satisfaction, a multivariate recursive probit is used to test for endogeneity between these variables. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that spouses self-select into a copreneurial business structure depending on the level of satisfaction they feel in their interpersonal relationships.

Some empirical evidence shows that child labor tends to increase as land holding increases, or there is an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between the probability of putting children to work and land holding. This paper shows that the relationship between use of children as laborers and land holding is nuanced. Child labor generally decreases as per capita land holding increases, but there can be an upward bump in the relationship between child labor and landholding near the middle of the range of land per capita. The bump can be explained theoretically by the relationship between the marginal productivity of a child worker on the farm and the marginal value placed on his/her education at different levels of wealth. This pattern is repeated in three surveys conducted in Zimbabwe, in 2001,2007-8, and 2010-11. From the perspective of policy making, the policy maker should be alerted that the programs to promote school retention should not necessarily focus only on the poorest households in rural areas. There is a high probability that middle-wealth households put their children to work, and this probability may change by some other factors such as gender of child and agro-ecological conditions.

I apply a median preserving spread to a marriage search model and then empirically analyze the theoretical hypothesis for cross-gender marriage behaviors using extensive individual Japanese data from the Employment Status Survey. The theoretical and empirical results show that both genders' wage inequalities in the lower tail have positive and statistically significant effects on increasing the probability of unmarried people across both genders. Female wage inequality in the upper tail also has a significant positive effect on the probability of unmarried men. On the other hand, an increase in male unemployment rates have positive and significant effects on the probability of unmarried women, even after controlling with wage inequality indices. In addition, the median wage for women has a significant and negative effect on the probability of unmarried men. These results highlight the policies to increase wages in the lower income class for both genders and to address unemployment for men in order to raise marriage rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This study assesses the total impact of these policy shifts and technological changes on U.S. commercial banks' short-run and long-run substitution elasticities. An endogenous-break test divides the sample into a pre-crisis period and a (post-) crisis period. During the former period, banks' inputs tend to be inelastic substitutes. After the onset of the crisis, particularly the long-run substitutability of most input factors decreases to even lower levels due to changes in both cost technology and economic conditions. At the same time, banks' response to input price changes becomes more sluggish. Hence, especially after the onset of the crisis, banks have little flexibility regarding input factor usage and are thus sensitive to input price changes from a cost perspective.

Valuable observations are made on how the clusters should be researched in order to improve their performance which would result in economic growth both on regional and national scale. Clusters' performance is complicated to evaluate as the measures of the aspects that must be calculated differ and the most appropriate solution to formalize these aspects should be found. Different multi-criteria evaluation methods are suggested by scholars for a quantitative evaluation of performance of a certain phenomenon. This study attempts to present the clusters' performance evaluation by applying the multi-criteria SAW method. Seven clusters from Lithuania and Latvia were examined to serve the purpose of this study. The multi-criteria analysis could be used as a method in further evaluation of clusters' performance for it is comprehensible, easy to apply, helpful in the data evaluation of different measures and it provides adequate results, which is very important in a quantitative analysis. The results suggest that processes are very important in clusters' performance evaluation for clusters which show good results with processes, stay in high positions, whereas clusters which are keeping behind with processes show worse results in their performance. The study still needs to be supplemented by more clusters to obtain specific information and to elaborate on more specific clusters' performance evaluation methods.","[Tvaronaviciene, Manuela; Razminiene, Kristina] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Tvaronaviciene, M (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",manuela.tvaronaviciene@vgtu.lt; kristina.razminiene@vgtu.lt,"Razminiene, Kristina/JHT-8938-2023; Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/GVT-4155-2022; /I-3713-2019","Tvaronaviciene, Manuela/0000-0002-9667-3730; /0000-0002-9667-3730; Razminiene, Kristina/0000-0003-2190-1898",,,,,59,47,47,2,22,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Four terrorism indicators are used namely: domestic, transnational, unclear, and total terrorism. Ten bundled and unbundled governance indicators are also employed namely: political governance (consisting of political stability and voice and accountability), economic governance (encompassing government effectiveness and regulation quality); institutional governance (entailing corruption-control and the rule of law), and general governance. The governance indicators are bundled by means of principal component analysis. The empirical evidence is based on Generalized Method of Moments. Three key findings are established. First, all selected terrorism dynamics negatively affect political governance and its constituents. Second, evidence of a negative relationship is sparingly apparent in economic governance and its components. Third, no proof was confirmed in relation to the impact of terrorism and institutional governance with its elements. Fourth, compared with domestic terrorism, transnational terrorism more negatively and significantly affects political, economic, and general governances. Policy implications are discussed.

The focus is on the impact of sick leave rules. Five parameters of the sickness benefit system are taken into account: the requirement to produce a doctor's certificate on the first day of absence, the length of the qualifying period, the existence of a waiting period before receipt of benefits, the compensation level, and the duration of benefits. Employees' absence behaviors are analyzed using multilevel logistic regressions. The results show that cross-country differences in the probability of absence are partly attributable to differences in sick leave legislation. The most significant factor is whether employers are required to continue paying full wages in case of illness. As expected, the propensity to be absent is significantly higher in countries where this rule applies.","[Chaupain-Guillot, Sabine] Univ Lorraine, Econ, Nancy, France; [Chaupain-Guillot, Sabine; Guillot, Olivier] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Strasbourg, France; [Chaupain-Guillot, Sabine; Guillot, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine,"Guillot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Strasbourg, France.;Guillot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, Nancy, France.",Sabine.Chaupain@univ-lorraine.fr; Olivier.Guillot@univ-lorraine.fr,,,,,,,45,5,5,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

First, it proposes a general appraisal of optimal switching problems related to energy transition showing: (1) the possibility of a catastrophe due to accumulation of pollution; and (2) technological regimes with the adoption of renewable energy. Second, it numerically shows that for given baseline parameter values, the most profitable energy transition path may correspond to the one in which the economy starts using both resources, crosses the pollution threshold by losing a part of its capital, and never adopts only clean energy. Third, it extends the model to allow for additional investment in energy saving technologies. We then find that this additional investment favours full transition to the sole use of renewable energy. It is then profitable to take advantage of these synergies by jointly promoting deployment of clean energy and providing incentives for investment in energy saving technologies.","[Dato, Prudence] Univ Savoie, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue,BP 80439, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France",Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Dato, P (通讯作者)，Univ Savoie, IREGE, 4 Chemin Bellevue,BP 80439, F-74944 Annecy Le Vieux, France.",prudence.dato@univ-savoie.fr,,,,,,,47,7,7,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that while positive mispricing is associated with hedgers' net short and speculators' net long positions, negative mispricing is related to hedgers' net long and speculators' net short positions. This relationship is stable for speculators across the pre and post-2004 periods; however, it is dominant for hedgers particularly during the pre 2004 period. Contrary to the popular belief, our analysis finds no evidence that speculators are responsible for irrational movements in futures prices by enlarging the size of mispricing. Furthermore, a high magnitude of hedgers' net positions signals the convergence of mispricing. We also found that according to a recent new disaggregation for trader positions, asset managers tend to delay the convergence of mispricing and hedge funds help shrink the size of mispricing. However, these relationships are not stronger than those implies by the hedger/speculator classification. These findings support the view that speculators' positions are informative about the direction of index futures mispricing, while hedgers' positions determine the convergence of mispricing.

In the model, the sentiment equilibrium prices have a number proportion-weighted average structure among heterogeneous investors, and idiosyncratic sentiments can have a significant impact on the equilibrium price at the aggregate level because the demand function is nonlinear in the sentiment. Moreover, we also find that even if the individual sentiment affects the demand in a linear way, the sentiment may still has a significant effect on the equilibrium price in the aggregate due to the fluctuation of the number distribution of investors. The model could offer a partial explanation to the financial anomaly of overreaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Most of the evidence stems from evaluating the impact of extreme prenatal deprivations due to atypical events such as droughts or floods. However, less is known about the magnitude of effects due to more normal variations in food availability. This study estimates the impact of prenatal exposure to seasonal food scarcity on the evolution of childhood health for a cohort of Ethiopian children born in 2001-02. A novel measure of seasonal exposure was constructed based on reported months of relative food scarcity in the local community collected shortly after birth. While exposure was found to have little effect on child height at age one, a larger and statistically significant negative impact emerges by age eight and strengthens by age twelve. Effects in early childhood also appear to be latent from the view of parents with little evidence of remedial investments in exposed children after birth. We conclude that mild prenatal nutritional deprivations could have significant impacts on long-term health and well-being even if effects are small or unobserved in early childhood. This implies caution against the common use of birth and early-life outcomes as the sole evaluation tools for mild prenatal insults or interventions. Overall, results highlight that in addition to the effects of severe famine conditions identified in many studies, more typical variation in prenatal food availability can have lasting impacts on health in the developing world.

Structural changes toward larger and more diversified banks may have left some segments of credit markets - those depending on investment in 'soft' information - under-served. These trends accelerated following the Financial Crisis. At the same time, bank lending to small businesses, which typically can only supply soft information, has been slow to recover from the Crisis. These trends are worrying because entry of focused banks, the normal market mechanism to counteract such a trend, has been absent since the Crisis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

While research exists on the effect of social information on decision making, there is less work on how ranked comparisons with our peers influence our behavior. This paper outlines a field experiment conducted with 3896 households in Castro Valley, California, which uses household mailers with various forms of social information and peer rank messaging to motivate water conservation. The experiment tests the effect of a visible peer rank on water use, and how the competitive framing of rank information influences behavioral response. The results show that households with relatively low or high water use in the pre-treatment period responded differently to how rank information was framed. I find that a neutrally-framed peer rank caused a small boomerang effect (i.e., an increase in average water use) for low water use households, but this effect was eliminated by competitive framing. At the same time, a competitively-framed peer rank demotivated high water use households, increasing their average water use over the full period of the experiment. This result is supported by evidence that the competitive frame on rank information increased water use for households who ranked last in the peer group - a detrimental last place effect from competitively-framed rankings.

This paper's evidence suggests that contributions influence politicians: In the absence of an underwriter auction, underpricing increases with the chosen underwriter's contributions relative to others. Moreover, the difference in the fees charged by contributing underwriters and those charged by non-contributing underwriters is 2.9%.

Analyzing the Role of National and Local Governments and Producers' Strategies,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Geographical Indications; Indonesia; Vietnam; public intervention; agricultural modernization; governance,INDICATIONS GIS; DECENTRALIZATION; TERROIR; QUALITY,"This paper investigates the way Geographical Indications (GIs) are implemented by national and local governments in Indonesia and Vietnam. The two States are active at all stages of GI development, from the selection of the products candidates for GI registration to the supervision of the GI implementation. Thanks to the involvement of national experts from public agencies in the establishment of the Codes of Practices (CoP), they are able to push for the substitution of traditional local techniques with good practices (i.e., mostly those recommended by research centers worldwide). Thus, they put GIs at the service of agricultural modernization when GIs apply more conventionally to specific products based on traditional know-how. However, the implementation of the CoPs and thus the achievement of this objective of modernization depend on the perceived interest of producers in the whole GI dynamic. Indeed, the cases studied in Indonesia and Vietnam highlight the variable level of participation of local producers in the GI. In the four studied cases, the CoPs are mainly based on expert knowledge which differs from the actual practices of farmers and processors. Moreover, GIs are implemented in order to create or reinforce reputations rather than legally protecting preexisting ones. For these two reasons, producers' motivation to invest in GI certification is weak, which makes difficult the necessary collective involvement. In both countries, the involvement of local governments in GI construction and management modifies the situation. Thanks to their knowledge of local situations and stakes, they are more likely than national experts to identify the most strategic supply chains at local level, enable participatory approaches in GI construction and facilitate the involvement of local producers in the GI managing group. But if competences have been given to local governments in the Indonesian and Vietnamese legal frameworks, the distribution of roles between central and provincial governments in GIs are not clearly enough specified. The nature and the importance of local public intervention differ from one case to another. Finally, this paper recognizes the legitimacy of State intervention in GI development, at least as long as producers' awareness of GIs is still low. However, this State intervention should not only let enough space for producers in GI governance, but also design a frame for arousing their interest and adhesion and for facilitating their collective involvement. That may be facilitated by a concrete and clearly established decentralization of competences in national policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the most common type of job accessibility measure employed in planning practice, the cumulative opportunity measure, considers job supply but overlooks competition for jobs. Therefore, the cumulative opportunity measure may not fully capture workers' access to job opportunity. In this paper, we examine four accessibility measures, two of which account for spatial competition and the other two do not, using the Los Angeles metropolitan area as a case study. We find that measures of competitive accessibility have stronger associations with employment than non-competitive accessibility measures. We examine the relationship between residential accessibility and employment for four separate levels of educational attainment, and we find that competitive measures are especially pertinent for population segments with lower educational attainment. Therefore, we recommend competitive accessibility measures to assess the employment opportunity more accurately.","[Merlin, Louis A.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, 777 Glades Rd,Bldg SO 44 Room 284, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Hu, Lingqian] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Merlin, LA (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Sch Urban & Reg Planning, 777 Glades Rd,Bldg SO 44 Room 284, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",lmerlin@fau.edu; hul@uwm.edu,"Hu, Ivy/L-3119-2019","Hu, Ivy/0000-0002-5687-0764; Merlin, Louis/0000-0002-9267-5712",,,,,75,49,61,0,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

California has led the growth in DG solar in the United States. I use 2007 to early 2014 residential data from Pacific Gas & Electricthe utility with the largest number of residential solar customers in the United Statesto examine the full range of private incentives for installing residential solar, from direct rebates and tax credits to indirect incentives that result from the residential tariff design and the crediting of solar production under net energy metering. I then study the income distribution of solar adopters and how that has changed over time. I find the skew to wealthy households adopting solar is still significant but began to lessen after 2011. Adoption continued to be dominated by the heaviest electricity-consuming households, probably because the steeply tiered tariff structure greatly increased the private value of solar to such customers while reducing the incentive for consumers who are below median consumption. In fact, the financial incentive for those who actually adopted solar over the sample period may have been due nearly as much to California's tiered tariff structure as to the 30% federal tax credit. The California experience suggests that rate design can greatly influence the economic incentives for residential solar adoption and which customers receive those benefits.","[Borenstein, Severin] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Business Econ & Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Borenstein, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Business Econ & Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",severinborenstein@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,19,106,123,3,39,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

We show that foreign investors underinvest in firms with higher level of founder ownership, since these firms are more vulnerable to information problems and expropriation risk. This effect is particularly stronger when founder ownership exceeds a threshold beyond which founders hold effective control on firms. We exhibit that information problems are the main cause of the relation between foreign investments and founder ownership. This is because the relationship is more pronounced in case of business group firms and firms that are engaged in more earnings management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In these models, candidate predictors are typically subject to some common components. In this paper we propose a new method for robustly estimating the approximate factor models and use it in risk assessments. We consider a class of approximate factor models in which the candidate predictors are additionally subject to idiosyncratic large uncommon components such as jumps or outliers. By assuming that occurrences of the uncommon components are rare, we develop an estimation procedure to simultaneously disentangle and estimate the common and uncommon components. We then use the proposed method to investigate whether risks from the latent factors are priced for expected returns of Fama and French 100 size and book-to-market ratio portfolios. We find that while the risk from the common factor is priced for the 100 portfolios, the risks from the idiosyncratic factors are not. However, we find that model uncertainty risks of the idiosyncratic factors are priced, suggesting that with effective diversifications, only the predictable idiosyncratic risks can be reduced, but the unpredictable ones may still exist. We also illustrate how the proposed method can be adopted on evaluating value at risk (VaR) and find it can delivery comparable results as the conventional methods on VaR evaluations.

While in some cases the binding function is known, in general it is not, and therefore indirect inference is called for. The approach is appealing when we consider state space models which feature stochastic volatility (SV), or other non-Gaussian and nonlinear settings where Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods require computationally demanding approximate filters. The SV feature is particularly relevant when considering high frequency financial series. In addition, we propose a filtering scheme which relies on a combination of reprojection methods and nowcasting MIDAS regressions with ARCH models. We assess the efficiency of our indirect inference estimator for the SV model by comparing it with the ML estimator in Monte Carlo simulation experiments. The ML estimate is computed with a simulation-based Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which the smoothing distribution required in the E step is obtained via a particle forward-filtering/backward-smoothing algorithm. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the Indirect Inference procedure is very appealing, as its statistical accuracy is close to that of MLE but the former procedure has clear advantages in terms of computational efficiency. An application to forecasting quarterly GDP growth in the Euro area with monthly macroeconomic indicators illustrates the usefulness of our procedure in empirical analysis.","[Gagliardini, P.] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland; [Gagliardini, P.] Swiss Finance Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ghysels, E.] Univ N Carolina, Gardner Hall,CB 3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Rubin, M.] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Bristol,"Ghysels, E (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Gardner Hall,CB 3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",eghysels@unc.edu,,,,,,,67,6,6,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

The results show that the co-movements and diversification benefits between these markets vary over time and across frequencies. Additionally, the co-movements are intensified in the wake of the recent global financial crisis (GFC) and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis (ESDC). More precisely, the wavelet-based VaR ratio indicates that including a BRIC or a South Asian (particularly Pakistan and Sri Lanka at both the short- and long-term) stock market in a portfolio of the developed stock markets reduces the resulting portfolio's VaR. Specifically, adding China in the medium term to this portfolio reduces risk in the pre- and during both the GFC and ESDC periods. By assigning optimal weights to the different market assets in the portfolio formulation, the analysis thus has implications for international investors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Urban Togo,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,participatory development; unemployment; self-efficacy; gender empowerment; Togo; Sub-Saharan Africa,DETERMINANTS; BANGLADESH; EFFICACY; AUTONOMY; REGION; WOMEN; GAP,"The Participatory Development (PD) approach aims at improving the quality of governance by empowering local populations. Particularly for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), PD is regarded an opportunity to help shift from unjustified centralization to more decentralized forms of governance. Yet, PD projects are frequently fraught with undesired effects of elite capture which critics ascribe to insufficient appreciation of local context. Our study adopts a sequential quantitative qualitative mixed method approach to broaden the empirical foundation needed for context sensitive project design. By exploring the effects of gender and employment on community participation we contribute to narrowing two research gaps: First, political science research on female participation in SSA has mostly focused on participation in national-level processes. Second, while development economics literature has devoted much attention on effects of female employment on intra-household bargaining, it has so far omitted the question what this means for the empowerment of women beyond the household, that is in the public life of their communities. Analyzing original survey data of over 1,300 respondents, collected across four urban municipalities in Togo, we find that unemployment negatively impacts community participation. Specifically, we show that this effect is mainly driven by female unemployment and establish self-efficacy driven by norm perception as the causal link between female employment and participation. Complementing our quantitative findings with data from 98 qualitative interviews, we show that employment constitutes an important psychological resource that enables women to overcome multiple discrimination barriers to community participation. However, this effect is stronger for women in a formal employment situation than for those working in less formalized settings. We conclude that gender-targeted employment interventions can help to increase community participation. We recommend that such efforts should not fixate on the creation of female job opportunities but also seek to strengthen the role of female informal workers in local political processes.

The PVMCA also allows us to identify the channels of external adjustment in capital flows at the province-level: variation in intertemporal prices (domestic and international interest rates, the provincial real exchange rate) and intertemporal variation in quantities (output, investment and government spending). We find that cross-province variation in the importance of these channels is correlated with the importance of private and state-owned enterprises and demographic factors.

The arising results showed that among the selected key internal characteristics of firms, only the impact of profitability and tangibility on financial structure was significantly sensitive to the proportion of domestic/foreign shareholding and that, consistent with capital structure theories, corporate financing decisions in Africa were significantly sensitive to marginal tax policies and the degree of financial system development prevailing in a country.

The impact of the explanatory variables in the model is allowed to differ between men and women to decompose gender differences in financial risk tolerance. The results indicate that gender differences in financial risk tolerance are explained by gender differences in the individual determinants of financial risk tolerance, and that the disparity does not result from gender in and of itself. The individual variables that moderate the relationship between gender and high risk tolerance are income uncertainty and net worth, with income uncertainty moderating the relationship between gender and some risk tolerance.

We find that farms that have been granted in-house certification demonstrate better environmental but not better social conduct than non-certified farms. We find also that the positive relationship between in-house certification and environmental conduct is stronger if the farm sells to a cooperative, and if it is located in an institutionally weak country. Finally, we find that the institutional strength of the farm's home country has a positive influence on its social conduct.

Traditional Ricardian studies at the country and regional levels reveal that net revenue is affected by seasonal climate. A structural Ricardian model of growing season choice reveals climate change will reduce net revenues in the near term by 4-8% and in the long term by 10-18%. The implications of this impact on key sustainable development goals such as poverty reduction is likely to be profound. The study finds that farmers who rely on cultivating in three seasons will be especially hard hit by climate change relative to those that rely only on a single season. The results indicate that farmers will switch from 3 seasons to 1 season per year and reduce some of the losses that they would otherwise sustain. An analysis of crop adaptation finds that farmers will also adjust irrigation, crop choice, and the timing of planting in response to climate change. The livestock adaptation study finds that farmers will move towards livestock as climate warms. Farmers will also shift their choice of species away from large animals and move towards small animals. An analysis of perceptions finds that farmers throughout the region are aware that temperature is rising and they generally perceive that precipitation is falling. Half of the farmers interviewed have begun to take measures such as those reported in this study to adapt to climate change. The overall results suggest that acting on their self-interest, the agriculture sector will undertake a great deal of adaptation on its own. However, measures taken by the government such as providing up-to-date weather reports, extension, irrigation and assistance with new varieties can also be effective.","[Kurukulasuriya, Pradeep] United Nations Dev Program, New York, NY 10017 USA; [Mendelsohn, Robert] Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Mendelsohn, R (通讯作者)，Yale Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",pradeep.kurukulasuriya@undp.org; robert.mendelsohn@yale.edu,"Mendelsohn, Robert/GZA-9112-2022",,,,,,12,4,4,0,25,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

This was achieved on the back of an economic strategy emphasizing public infrastructure investment supported by heterodox macro-financial policies. This paper identifies the drivers of Ethiopia's recent growth episode and examines the extent to which they were typical or unique. It combines country specific information with the results of a cross-country panel regression model. We find that Ethiopia's growth is explained well by factors correlating with growth in a broad range of countries in recent decades, including public infrastructure investment, restrained government consumption, and a conducive external environment. On the other hand, we argue that the policy mix that supported very high levels of public investment in Ethiopia was, to some extent, unique. Interestingly, macroeconomic imbalances due to this heterodox policy mix only moderately held back growth which helps explain why Ethiopia was able to grow so fast in spite of their presence: their negative effects were quantitatively much less important than the positive growth drivers they helped to achieve. The results suggest that getting infrastructure right may outweigh moderate shortcoming in the macro framework at early stages of development. We further relate this country-specific finding to the recent growth literature. (C) 2017 The World Bank. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The environment we explore is one in which a country's lower classes may revolt and appropriate wealth owned by a ruling elite. The elite can avert revolution by incentivizing a potentially productive middle class to sink their human capital into a relatively unproductive bureaucracy. Thus the bureaucracy serves as an institution through which the elite can credibly commit to make transfers to the rest of society, but in the process this reduces economic efficiency. Trade integration alters the relative value of the elite's wealth. This alters the lower classes' incentive to revolt on the one hand and the elite's incentive to subsidize participation in the inefficient bureaucracy on the other. Therefore, the interaction between a country's comparative advantage and an inefficient economic institution determines whether trade integration increases or reduces economic efficiency. The econometric findings support the model's main prediction.","[Zissimos, Ben] Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Streatham Campus, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England; [Stroup, Caleb] Davidson Coll, Dept Econ, Davidson, NC 28035 USA",University of Exeter; Davidson College,"Zissimos, B (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Econ, Sch Business, Streatham Campus, Exeter EX4 4ST, Devon, England.",b.zissimos@exeter.ac.uk,"Stroup, Caleb/ABA-9463-2021","Zissimos, Benjamin/0000-0001-9469-6659",Center for the Americas at Vanderbilt University,Center for the Americas at Vanderbilt University,"This paper was previously circulated under the title Pampered Bureaucracy and Trade Liberalization.

Using property damage as an instrument for lending growth, we find credit in unaffected but connected markets declines by a little less than 50 cents per dollar of additional lending in shocked areas. However, banks shield their core markets because most of the decline comes from loans in areas where banks do not own branches.

We show that the separation theorem remains intact as the firm's optimal output level depends neither on the output price distribution nor on the firm's preferences. Furthermore, the validity of the full-hedging theorem depends on the extent to which the firm is optimistic about the uncertain output price. Notably, we identify a threshold of the firm's optimism level above which it is never optimal for the Firm to full-hedge even when an unbiased hedging opportunity is available. Our results suggest how a firm's optimism level and ambiguity degree affect its production and hedging behavior and provide a novel explanation for why firms in practice shy away from full-hedging.","[Lien, Donald] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, One Univ Circle, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Yu, Chia-Feng (Jeffrey)] Univ Adelaide, Business Sch, 10 Pulteney St, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); University of Adelaide,"Yu, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Business Sch, 10 Pulteney St, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",Don.Lien@utsa.edu; jeffrey.yu@adelaide.edu.au,,,,,,,51,1,2,1,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

This paper focuses on the endogenous establishment of an average-oriented norm which sanctions deviations from average public good contributions. In a laboratory experiment, we analyse whether subjects are willing to implement a punishment and reward scheme at their own expense by applying the theory of non-governmental norm enforcement put forward by Buchholz et al. (J Public Econ Theory 16(6):899-916, 2014). Based on their theory, which omits a central authority but introduces an endogenously determined enforcement mechanism, we implement a two-stage public good game. In the first stage, subjects determine the strength of the sanctioning mechanism on their own. In the second stage, they decide on their personal contributions to the public good based on the established mechanism. In line with comparable pool punishment experiments, we find that subjects are apparently willing to contribute funds in order to establish a norm enforcement mechanism. Groups over-invest in the mechanism, but this over-investment decreases over time. These investments seem to be driven by the subjects' previous individual contributions and partly by a number of strategic considerations, i.e. the previous average contribution made to the public good lowers the investment in the sanctioning mechanism. In the second stage of our experiment, higher norm enforcement parameters tend to lead to higher public good contributions. The earnings with the mechanism are on average higher than without.","[Reif, Christiane; Loeschel, Andreas] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Ruebbelke, Dirk] Tech Univ Bergakad Freiberg, Schlosspl 1, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany; [Loeschel, Andreas] Westfal Wilhelms Univ Munster, Stadtgraben 9, D-48143 Munster, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Technical University Freiberg; University of Munster,"Reif, C (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",reif@zew.de; dirk.ruebbelke@vwl.tu-freiberg.de; loeschel@uni-muenster.de,"Löschel, Andreas/AAG-6699-2020; Rübbelke, Dirk/M-5604-2013","Löschel, Andreas/0000-0002-3366-8053; Rübbelke, Dirk/0000-0002-9934-8570",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 01UN1016A]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [SFB504],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Financial support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ 01UN1016A) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, Grant No. SFB504) for the experimental laboratory University Mannheim is gratefully acknowledged.

However, little has been written on the emergence of local medium and large-scale commercial farmers selling to export companies or controlling their own export marketing arrangements. This article examines Ghanaian commercial farmers producing and exporting fresh pineapples to European markets. This group of pineapple producer-exporters represents a path to capitalist agricultural production that can be conceptualized as capitalism from outside: where capital flows into the countryside, rather than accumulation occurring from above or below within the agrarian economy. The emergence of this form of agrarian capitalism is stimulated by opportunities in new high-value agricultural export markets, but its stabilization depends on country-specific characteristics such as rural social structures, property rights and state support. The article documents the conditions of emergence of this new group of Ghanaian capitalist farmers, the period of destabilization caused by increasing international competition that resulted in a small number of large-scale agribusiness firms surviving, and the challenges that these agribusiness firms faced in stabilizing their capitalist agricultural production.","[Whitfield, Lindsay] Roskilde Univ, Dept Social Sci & Business, Roskilde, Denmark",Roskilde University,"Whitfield, L (通讯作者)，Roskilde Univ, Dept Social Sci & Business, Roskilde, Denmark.",lindsayw@ruc.dk,,,,,,,62,12,12,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Non-spatial Markov chain processes describe the transition of neighbourhoods through levels of ownership with no regard to their neighbourhood context. In reality however, how a neighbourhood transitions to different levels of ownership could be influenced by its neighbourhood context. A spatial Markov chain accounts for this context by estimating transition properties that are conditioned on the surrounding neighbourhood. These spatial Markov chain properties are estimated using a long run census time series from 1971 to 2011 of household vehicle ownership rates in Great Britain. These processes show that there is different behaviour in how neighbourhoods transition between levels of ownership depending on the context of their surrounding neighbours. The general finding is that the spatial Markov process will lead to a greater homogeneity in levels of ownership in each locality, with neighbourhoods surrounded by relatively low ownership neighbourhoods taking longer than a non-spatial Markov process would suggest to transition to higher levels, whilst neighbourhoods of high ownership surrounded by high ownership neighbourhoods take longer to transition to lower levels. This work corroborates Tobler's first law of geography Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things but also provides practical guidance. Firstly, in modelling ownership, spatial effects need to be tested and when present, accounted for in the model formulation. Secondly, in a policy context, the surrounding neighbourhood situation is important, with neighbourhoods having a tendency towards homogeneity of ownership levels. This allows for the effective planning of transport provision for local services. Thirdly, vehicle ownership is often used as a proxy for the social and aspirational nature of an area and these results suggest that these properties will persist for a prolonged period, possibly perpetuating and exacerbating differentials in society.","[Clark, Stephen D.] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Clark, Stephen D.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Data Analyt, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Rey, Sergio] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Spatial Sci, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of Leeds; University of Leeds; University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Clark, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.;Clark, SD (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Data Analyt, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",tra6sdc@leeds.ac.uk; Sergio.Rey@ucr.edu,,"Clark, Stephen/0000-0003-4090-6002; Rey, Sergio/0000-0001-5857-9762","Consumer Data Research Centre, Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011891/1]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1421935] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011891/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Consumer Data Research Centre, Economic and Social Research Council; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","The data sets referred or used in the article were supplied by the Office for National Statistics and National Records Scotland under the terms of the Open Government Licence and UK Government Licensing Framework and are Crown Copyright.

Focusing on the routine-task intensity of establishments, we examine the impact of restructuring in terms of: (1) what type of establishments are closed or newly established; and (2) what type of establishments increase or reduce their employment when a firm becomes multinational. We measure the skill level of each establishment using occupation-level routine-task intensity and occupation composition for each industry. We find that more routine-task intensive establishments have a greater likelihood of exiting the domestic market when the firm becomes multinational. In the case of continuing establishments, less routine-task intensive establishments tend to have a higher employment growth rate when a firm becomes multinational.

There is little compelling evidence that credit constraints, as proxied by income, education or means-tested benefit receipt, inhibit ownership. Failures in landlord-tenant relationships, though, are a key issue: private renters are significantly less likely to have the measures in their homes than other tenure groups. More broadly, it is the characteristics of the dwelling rather than of the occupants which are most strongly related to the presence of the measures. However, relatively few factors are consistently associated with lower ownership rates over time and efficiency measures, suggesting that policies to encourage increased take-up may need to be tailored to the specific measure.","[Leicester, Andrew] Frontier Econ, London, England; [Leicester, Andrew; Stoye, George] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Stoye, George] UCL, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; University College London,"Leicester, A (通讯作者)，Frontier Econ, London, England.",andrew.leicester@frontier-economics.com; g.stoye@ifs.org.uk,"Stoye, George/AAM-2292-2021",,"Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Scottish Government; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) at the Institute for Fiscal Studies [RES-544-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)(Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Scottish Government; ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy (CPP) at the Institute for Fiscal Studies(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This paper was produced as part of the Sustainable Lifestyles Research Group (SLRG) based at the University of Surrey.

Their land appears bleak and dismal to the outsider, and travelling through it makes for rough sledding; but the Econ, through a long period of adaptation, have learned to wrest a living of sorts from it. They are not without some genuine and sometimes even fierce attachment to their ancestral grounds, and their young are brought up to feel contempt for the softer living in the warmer lands of their neighbours, such as the Polscis and the Sociogs. Despite a common genetical heritage, relations with these tribes are strained -the distrust and contempt that the average Econ feels for these neighbours being heartily reciprocated by the latter - and social intercourse with them is inhibited by numerous taboos.

However, the quantification of demand and forecasting hinges on understanding how travel time is perceived and reported. Travel time reporting is typically subject to errors and this paper focuses on the mitigation of their impact on choice models. The aim is to explain the origin of these errors by including elements of travel behaviour (e.g., activities during the trip), which have been shown to significantly affect mode choices and commuting satisfaction. Based on responses from a revealed preferences survey, we estimate a mode choice model that treats travel time as a latent variable and incorporates different sources of data along with information on travel activities. Employing these multiple - sometimes incongruent - sources of information in the choice model appears to be beneficial. Results from comparing a logit model assuming error-free inputs and the integrated hybrid model revealed significant impacts on the generated policy scenarios. The model results also contributed to identifying the main travel activity features that affect travel time reporting, providing indications that can assist in understanding and mitigating the impact of imprecise measurements.","[Varotto, Silvia F.; Longo, Giovanni] Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Ingn & Architettura, Via Valerio 6-4, I-34127 Trieste, Italy; [Glerum, Aurelie; Stathopoulos, Amanda; Bierlaire, Michel] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Transport & Mobil Lab, Stn 18, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Varotto, Silvia F.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Transport & Planning, Stevinweg 1,POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands; [Stathopoulos, Amanda] Northwestern Univ, Inst Technol, McCormick Sch Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",University of Trieste; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Delft University of Technology; Northwestern University,"Varotto, SF (通讯作者)，Univ Trieste, Dipartimento Ingn & Architettura, Via Valerio 6-4, I-34127 Trieste, Italy.;Varotto, SF (通讯作者)，Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, Dept Transport & Planning, Stevinweg 1,POB 5048, NL-2600 GA Delft, Netherlands.",s.f.varotto@tudelft.nl; aurelie.glerum@epfl.ch; a-stathopoulos@northwestern.edu; miche.bierlaire@epfl.ch; giovanni.longo@dia.units.it,"Varotto, Silvia Francesca/AAW-5367-2020; Stathopoulos, Amanda/GWM-4799-2022; Varotto, Silvia F./AAZ-8150-2020; Stathopoulos, Amanda/K-2386-2014","Varotto, Silvia Francesca/0000-0003-4685-6333; Bierlaire, Michel/0000-0002-5275-7692",,,,,64,27,30,1,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our results show that among all live singleton births that occurred during 1990 through 2006, those born to mothers living as far as 20 to 30 miles away downwind from the power plant (which is also an affluent region) during pregnancy are at greater risks of low birth weight (LBW) and very low birth weight (VLBW): the likelihoods of LBW and VLBW could increase approximately by 6.50 and 17.12 percent, respectively. In light of the continual efforts of The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in reducing cross-state air pollution caused by transboundary power plant emissions, our study is aimed at broadening the scope of cross-border pollution impact analysis by taking into account adverse infant health effects of upwind polluters, which can impose disproportionate burdens of health risks on downwind states due to air pollutants transported by wind.","[Yang, Muzhe; Chou, Shin-Yi] Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Taylor St, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Bhatta, Rhea A.] Univ Penn, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, 3700 Hamilton Walk,Richards Bldg,Suite D101, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hsieh, Cheng-I] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, 1,Sect 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",Lehigh University; University of Pennsylvania; National Taiwan University,"Yang, MZ (通讯作者)，Lehigh Univ, Dept Econ, 621 Taylor St, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",muzheyang@lehigh.edu; rbhatta@mail.med.upenn.edu; syc2@lehigh.edu; hsieh@ntu.edu.tw,,"Chou, ShinYi/0000-0003-3871-3527; Yang, Muzhe/0000-0003-4167-0935",,,,,19,20,24,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-8739,1520-6688,,J POLICY ANAL MANAG,J.

To attract and retain them in a region, it is necessary to have a better understanding of their fundamental spatially-related behaviors including residence, workplace, and commute choices. In this study, we depart from a perspective of knowledge typology (analytical-synthetic symbolic knowledge base) to investigate the heterogeneity of knowledge workers' residence, workplace, and commute choices. The case study was conducted in the metropolitan region of Munich. Various types of data are integrated: structural statistical and individually-based web-survey data; individuals' actual choices and their assessment of importance for each criterion; positional and relational data. We find that symbolic Advanced Producer-Services (APS) workers tend to reside in central areas and use public transport or active modes to commute. In contrast, synthetic high-tech workers are found in relatively peripheral areas and depend more on cars to reach their workplaces. The spatially-related choices of analytical high-tech and synthetic-APS workers are positioned in between symbolic APS-workers and synthetic high-tech workers. We reach three conclusions: Firstly, the features of the knowledge base are evident in the spatial choices of knowledge workers. Secondly, there is a consistency of characteristics between interrelated spaces surrounding residence, workplace, as well as along the commute path of knowledge workers. Lastly, while the influence of the knowledge base has to be weighed against socio-demographic factors, different groups of knowledge workers clearly display distinct choices of residential location and commute mode. These conclusions may provide insights for urban planners and policy-makers regarding the attraction and retention of knowledge workers.","[Zhao, Juanjuan; Bentlage, Michael; Thierstein, Alain] Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Raumentwicklung, Arccisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Zhao, JJ (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Munich, Lehrstuhl Raumentwicklung, Arccisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",jj.zhao@tum.de; bentlage@tum.de; Thierstein@tum.de,"Thierstein, Alain/R-7615-2016","Thierstein, Alain/0000-0003-1878-4862",,,,,62,14,17,5,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Empirical ECS estimates are now available, but have not yet been applied in IAMs. We incorporate a new estimate of the ECS distribution conditioned on observed OHU efficiency into two widely used IAMs. The resulting Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimates are much lower than those from models based on simulated ECS parameters.

Performance success, within the MDG framework, is quantified using six different ways proposed in the existing literature, including both absolute and relative performance and deviation from historical transition paths of MDG indicators. The empirical analysis clearly shows that the data gap in performance measurement is a significant predictor of poor MDG performance in terms of any of the six progress measures. Larger the data gap or weaker the performance measurement system, lesser is the probability of MDG performance success. The empirical methodology used in the paper combines a Heckman correction and instrumental variable estimation strategies to simultaneously account for potential endogeneity of the key data gap variable and bias due to sample selection. This result holds true even after controlling for overall national statistical capacity and a variety of socioeconomic factors. The paper underlines the need to strengthen the performance measurement system attached to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper is the first attempt at empirically evaluating the value of data in the context of international development goals and gives empirical evidence for the need to harness the data revolution for sustainable development.

Although this feedback is still imperfectly known, there are enough estimates of its potential strength to now include it in our assessments. In this paper, I present a model of the PCF and integrate this feedback in the DICE Integrated Assessment Model to examine its consequences. I find that doing so increases the SCC by 10-20% in the baseline scenario, but that this impact is much more significant in the case of a damage function which is more reactive to very high temperature changes, and can reach up to 220%. It follows that setting industrial emission targets without taking into account this feedback would lead to excessive atmospheric carbon: I find that it increases the optimal emission control rate by circa 5% points on average over the period 2015-2110 and that this difference becomes much more significant when the constraint of limiting the increase in global mean temperature to +2 degrees C or +1. 5 degrees C is added to the model.","[Kessler, Louise] ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England; [Kessler, Louise] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Kessler, Louise] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Kessler, L (通讯作者)，ESRC Ctr Climate Change Econ & Policy, London, England.;Kessler, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Kessler, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England.",l.kessler@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; UK Economic and Social Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This Research was supported by the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, which is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council.",,58,8,8,3,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2010-0078,2010-0086,,CLIM CHANG ECON,Clim.

This paper estimates a New Keynesian general equilibrium model, which is extended to include a wealth effect from asset price fluctuations to consumption, to assess the quantitative importance of interactions among the stock market, macroeconomic variables, and monetary policy. The paper relaxes the assumption of rational expectations and assumes that economic agents learn over time and form near-rational expectations from their perceived model of the economy. The stock market, therefore, affects the economy through two channels: through a traditional wealth effect and through its impact on agents' expectations. Monetary policy decisions also affect and are potentially affected by the stock market. The empirical results show that the direct wealth effect is modest, but asset price fluctuations have important effects on future output expectations. Through this expectational channel, shocks in the stock market can account for a large, but varying, portion of output fluctuations.","[Milani, Fabio] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92717 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Milani, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.",fmilani@uci.edu,,,,,,,62,8,8,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

An exploratory analysis of the data shows a minor reduction (20%) in spatial interaction in public educational spending after IDEB disclosure compared with the spatial correlation before disclosure of the index. Our main results explore a discontinuity around the cutoff of 30 students enrolled in the grade under assessment after IDEB disclosure. The estimates suggest that the spatial autocorrelation and, thus, yardstick competition is reduced by 52%. Falsification and robustness tests were performed and suggest that we can claim causality around small bandwidths of the cutoff. This finding suggests that the public release of information may decrease the importance of neighbors' information on voters' decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis identifies people who escaped poverty and those who fell into it over the period 2005-12. Using panel data from the India Human Development Survey for 2005 and 2012, we find that the risks of marginalized communities such as Dalits and Adivasis of falling into or remaining in poverty were higher than those for more privileged groups. Some, but not all of these higher risks are explained by educational, financial, and social disadvantages of these groups in 2005.

We expect banks from high uncertainty avoidance and power distance societies to perform relatively better during the recent financial crisis. On the other hand, banks in individualistic (collectivist) societies are likely to perform worse (better) during the crisis. Using an international sample of 3438 banks from 48 countries, we find support for our main conjectures. Specifically, we establish that uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and power distance have a first order impact on bank performance during the crisis.

By tailoring the goods to the preferences of smaller groups, the reforms aim to ensure that the resulting supply of public goods matches local demands. We analyze if local politicians tasked with supplying public goods in a developing country respond to citizens' preferences. We ask two questions: First, faced with demands for increased spending on a particular type of public good, will politicians increase the overall spending on public goods or keep it constant while reallocating resources between different public goods? Second, if politicians reallocate resources rather than increase overall spending, which public good will receive additional funds at the expense of another good? We examine these questions using sub-national spending and preference data in Nigerian districts. Our empirical strategy accounts for interdependency between spending areas as increased spending in one area can be offset by decreasing expenditures elsewhere. We find that local politicians reallocate resources across education, health, infrastructure, and agricultural support to match the preference profile of citizens across these goods but do not increase overall spending for public goods.

However, empirical analysis of the effect these factors have on entrepreneurial activity across nations remains ambiguous. This study proposes that the cultural context of nations moderates the effect of these factors. Consistent with this argument, it investigates the role of individualism-collectivism in moderating the effect of political freedom, corruption, and education on entrepreneurial activity across nations. Macro-level data on 84 nations is obtained from multiple reliable sources and used to test the hypotheses. Results support the theorized arguments and suggest that individualism positively moderates the effect of political freedom, negatively moderates the effect of corruption, and positively moderates the effect of education, on the rate of entrepreneurial activity across nations.","[Dheer, Ratan J.

Our main focus is on the variability of temporary/permanent workers wage gap and on the role of institutions (labor market deregulation, union density, and wage coordination) in shaping the gap across education groups and along the wage distribution. Results, obtained by means of OLS and quantile regression methods, confirm that holding a temporary position corresponds to a statistically significant negative wage gap with respect to permanent jobs, especially for low-paid jobs and tertiary educated workers. The impact of institutional settings on the wage gap varies remarkably across education groups and wage levels, and strongly depends on the macroeconomic conditions. Labor market deregulation and weaker minimum wage provisions reduce the wage gap; this could be related to the fact the these institutional features reduce the duality on the labor market, triggering a downward convergence of permanent wages toward the lowest level of the temporary employed, especially in the context of labor reallocation and declining wages typical of recession. Stronger wage setting institutions, on the contrary, seem to reinforce duality in the labor market, although to different extents depending on the group of workers and on the part of the wage distribution concerned.

By bridging together the economic and management literature, it estimates the impact of demand-pull and technology-push, along with the effect of being either a parent, subsidiary or associate company, on the probability of introducing product and process innovation. Using data from the community innovation survey on spanish food manufacturing firms, the econometric results show that demand-pull affects the probability of achieving product innovation while technology-push the probability of both product and process innovation. In regards to integration ties, associate companies are associated to higher probability of achieving process innovation because of the knowledge spillover from the parent company.

Using high-frequency data we document cross-market liquidity dynamics, demonstrating that entrant markets need to trade (not only quote) in order to improve liquidity, and that endogenous liquidity suppliers increase their usage of the alternate market when queues on the incumbent exchange are long and quoted spreads are constrained by the minimum tick size, consistent with queue-jumping order duplication.","[Aitken, Michael] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Grad Sch Management, N Ryde, NSW, Australia; [Chen, Haoming] Univ New South Wales, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Foley, Sean] Univ Sydney, Fac Business, Finance Discipline, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Foley, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Finance Discipline, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sean.foley@sydney.edu.au,,"Foley, Sean/0000-0002-8696-653X; Aitken, Michael/0000-0002-2693-9409",CMCRC,CMCRC,"The internet appendix that accompanies this paper may be found at: https://goo.gl/aCv26Y.

We show that the evidence of week-day effect in mean and conditional volatility is sensitive to the choice of the underlying distribution. Our results are not limited to the classic setting of examining week-day effect but also extend to settings that account for conditional and unconditional market risk. We extend our analysis to wandering week-day effect, and find that it also varies with the error distributional assumptions. Moreover, we document that the 2008 financial crisis lessened the week-day effect in the mean but at the same time magnified such effect in the conditional volatility. Our findings are robust to the presence of outliers, to different model specifications, and to the presence of structural breaks. Our study suggests that empirical regularity in financial series may be econometrically fragile in the sense of Leamer (1985). It also corroborates the calls that followed the recent financial crisis about the hazard of using models that are based on unrealistic assumptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

From 1987 through 1990, districts experienced a safety net regime where the reversion was at least the previous year's nominal spending.

Over the period 2007-2010, Italian firms moved (on average) towards more complex forms of internationalization. Empirical analysis finds that these upward changes are related with positive effects on firms' (labour) productivity, also in a period characterized by the 2009 trade collapse.

However, in the year after loan origination market power positively affects firm performance, but only if it is not too high. Our estimates thus suggest that bank market power can facilitate access to credit by poorly performing firms, yet at the same time also boosts the performance of the firms that obtain credit.","[Delis, Manthos D.] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England; [Kokas, Sotirios] Univ Essex, Colchester, Essex, England; [Ongena, Steven] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Surrey; University of Essex; University of Zurich,"Delis, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England.",,,"Ongena, Steven/0000-0002-8381-0062",,,,,36,34,36,0,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The findings establish job loss both as a key life course transition motivating residential mobility and long-distance migration in Canada and as a trigger event that initiates entry into high-deprivation areas.","[Denier, Nicole] Colby Coll, Dept Sociol, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Colby College,"Denier, N (通讯作者)，Colby Coll, Dept Sociol, Waterville, ME 04901 USA.",,,"Denier, Nicole/0000-0001-8905-1899",Quebec Inter University Centre for Social Statistics (QICSS); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Statistics Canada; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture; Quebec universities,Quebec Inter University Centre for Social Statistics (QICSS); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Statistics Canada; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture; Quebec universities,"I thank Michael R.

Officials in countries throughout the developing world have similar views about their own intergovernmental frameworks. In Indonesia, perverse incentives are thought to negatively influence a wide range of local government fiscal behaviours, including as regards own-source revenues, spending and savings. An empirical analysis of the local government response to transfers, however, offers only mixed support for the existence and strength of the presumed incentives. Overall, the findings in this paper highlight the benefits to central governments of rigorously examining assumed perverse incentives in their intergovernmental frameworks before embarking on attempts to expunge them.","[Lewis, Blane D.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Smoke, Paul] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Australian National University; New York University,"Lewis, BD (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",blane.lewis@anu.edu.au; paul.smoke@nyu.edu,"Smoke, Paul/A-7724-2008",,,,,,82,25,30,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-5671,1475-5890,,FISC STUD,Fisc.

Exploiting variation of membership across banks in a corporate debt restructuring programme (CDR) sponsored by the central bank in India, this paper finds that the banks that made use of regulatory forbearance (RF) on the restructured corporate loans could increase their stability significantly due to the extension of low provisioning on restructured loans. However, the positive effect of RF diminishes at higher levels of market power, highlighting that member banks with higher market power tend to originate riskier assets (as reflected in their risk-weighted assets) under the auspices of this programme.

Initially deriving from historical research on Western Europe, this process is expected to unfold slowly over time. This study tests the claim that more extensive revenue collection has long-lasting and positive consequences for government quality in a developmental setting. Using fiscal records from British colonies, results from cross-colony/country regression analyses reveal that higher colonial income-adjusted revenue levels during the early twentieth century can be linked to higher government quality today. This relationship is substantial and robust to several specifications of both colonial revenue and modern day government quality, and remains significant under control for a range of rivaling explanations. The results support the notion that the current institutional success of former colonies can be traced back to the extent of historical revenue extraction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical evidence supports the notion of goals increasing performance; however the evidence on how attainability of goals affects performance is mixed. This paper tests whether efforts increase, improving performance as the goals become more attainable. We are employing a unique set of publicly available marathon data from 1970 to 2015 to directly analyze the effect of goal attainability on performance. With the probable goal of qualifying for the Boston Marathon, we test if runners increase their effort, and consequently improve their performance if they enter a new age group and as a result have a more attainable goal. We find that runners who enter a new age group perform better than the runners whose qualifying time did not change. This effect is seen with runners in younger age groups, but not found in the results of runners in more advanced years. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Because of their supposed superiority in knowledge and experience, project management consultants have an ultimate responsibility for the proper implementing of the project. Therefore, quality management in consulting organizations should focus on critical success factors. As there is no consensus yet regarding the most important aspects of the consulting activity on which depend the achievement of the project aims, there is scope for further investigating this subject. Here, the case of a project management consulting organization involved in large infrastructure projects in Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine and Serbia is analyzed. Data collected through a questionnaire-based survey among international consultants and support personnel suggest that factors related to leadership style and communication skills are more closely tied to the success of the project than more technical aspects. The results constitute an empirical evidence of main success factors for specialized consulting services in project management and can be useful in improving business and project performance and achieving business excellence.","[Ceptureanu, Eduard-Gabriel; Ceptureanu, Sebastian-Ion; Luchian, Cristian-Eugen; Luchian, Iuliana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ceptureanu, SI (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",eduard.ceptureanu@man.ase.ro,"Ceptureanu, Sebastian Ion/J-6069-2015; Ceptureanu, Eduard Gabriel/A-2879-2017","Ceptureanu, Sebastian Ion/0000-0001-8849-7960; Ceptureanu, Eduard Gabriel/0000-0003-2328-4328",,,,,50,14,15,0,49,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2017,19.0,44,,,,,215,230,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EN1CB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395746900014,0

Another important conclusion is that there is a unidirectional causal relationship from the economic growth towards FDI, more precisely the influence of FDI on economic growth does not have a systematic, anticipatory nature. These results were achieved in the condition that, in the analyzed period, the net inflows of FDI were influenced by the lack of certainty on the sustainable re-launching of the economic growth both domestically and internationally, the segmentation of the financial market, the domestic structural reforms.","[Enache, Calcedonia] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania; [Merino, Fernando] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest; University of Murcia,"Enache, C (通讯作者)，Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med, Bucharest, Romania.",calcedoniaenache@yahoo.com,"Enache, Calcedonia/AAL-9393-2021; Merino, Fernando/C-3234-2012","Merino, Fernando/0000-0002-4426-6623; Enache, Calcedonia/0000-0001-7069-6662",,,,,50,3,3,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2017,19.0,44,,,,,275,287,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EN1CB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000395746900017,0

The results based on this model, which captures how land allocation responds to changes in temperature and precipitation, are introduced as elasticities in the CGE model to offset the demand curve for land among 13 different land uses in 27 regions of Brazil. The simulations are based on climate data from a benchmark period (1975-2005) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate projection scenarios for the periods 2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099.

The monthly data of CPI was taken from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, from August 2001 to July 2011 (with 2000-01 base) for 92 composite commodities with 12 sub-groups. We employed the Granger causality testing approach for the evaluation of any possible influence of one indicator to another. In this scenario, it is viable to state that there is a presence of causality and bidirectional feedback between the variables or the two variables are independent. The major issue is to identify a suitable statistical method that enables us to analyze the association among the variables. The findings of this study demonstrated that there is a probable relationship between inflation (DPt) and both un-weighted measures of price variability (VPt and SPt) for the whole items that have been considered for the analysis.

J,"Monios, J",,,,"Monios, Jason",,,Cascading feeder vessels and the rationalisation of small container ports,JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Container ports; Shipping lines; Carriers; Vessels; Feeders; Short sea shipping (SSS),PERIPHERALITY; EVOLUTION; SEAPORTS; SYSTEM; HUB,"Small container ports rely on feeder services from hub ports to provide access to unitised trade flows for their hinterlands. They generally possess limited water depth and handling facilities, as investments required to handle larger vessels are not justified by their low container throughput. This paper questions the future of small ports due to larger vessels cascading down as a result of ever-larger vessels on the major trade lanes. The paper uses vessel call data to identify all world ports currently served by sub-1000 TEU vessels. Data on the dimensions of the vessel fleet and order book are analysed in conjunction with accessibility constraints at these small ports. Results show that with 15% of the sub-1000 TEU fleet currently laid up and very few on order, larger feeders with deeper drafts seem certain to serve at least some of these routes. But with 90 container ports (21%) having berth depth of less than 9.1 m and the need to accommodate design drafts of at least 8.7 m, larger vessels will threaten the viability of these ports unless they commit significant investment. A geographical analysis is also conducted, mapping the distribution of small ports across the globe and classifying coastal, estuary, river and island locations, as well as identifying clusters of small ports that could in future be served by second-tier hubs, such as Southeast Asia and the Baltic Sea. Findings suggest that, just as container ports at the larger end of the scale were rationalised as flows concentrated at major hubs, several drivers exist for the same process to occur at small ports. Consequently, the paper asks how small ports and local shippers will cope, whether such ports lose their connections entirely, if local shippers must pay for an additional handling cost to tranship a second time from large feeder to small feeder, or whether they rely on overland transport links.

This model captures both the correlation between spatially distinct alternatives based on the relative distance between them and the heteroskedasticity of the errors of the alternative as a function of their reldtive distance to the decision maker. The SWEC model is applied for the estimation of models of transit station choice for P-and-R as well as kiss and ride (dropped off at transit station) transit commuters in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). The kiss and ride model has particular relevance due to its ability to capture household tradeoffs made by both the driver and the passenger. The tradeoffs are captured by utilizing the subsequent trip made by the driver in the utility function specification. The proposed model structure provides additional insights into how station choice occurs for such complex trips. Finally, the application of the SWEC model for both choice contexts provides a fundamental improvement over conventional approaches, as it is able to capture non-proportional substitution patterns and heteroskedasticity inherent with spatial choices.

IFRS uses a fair value accounting basis that provides a different perspective from previous standards based on historical cost. The use of fair value is considered to make the financial statements more transparent. Excess fair value accounting for historical cost has been accepted by the public which includes professional accountants and standard makers in various countries. Nevertheless, the fair value accounting of the historical cost is predominantly based on countries with efficient market conditions with good financial reporting environment. Indonesia is one of the developing countries that decided to converge IFRS with its main concept of fair value accounting as a commitment to enter G20 member countries. In 2011 all the necessary infrastructure in the context of convergence to IFRS is already at the completion stage. In 2012 began to be implemented in stages. In 2015 the adaptation process has entered the second period. However, there is still little research to reveal the extent to which the implementation of IFRS convergence in the process of preparing the company's financial statements and its impact on its financial statements. Therefore, in this research will reveal the level of convergence of IFRS primarily the concept of fair value accounting for financial instruments (as contained in PSAK 50, 55 and 60) in practice primarily in banking sector companies. This research is a descriptive qualitative research with triangulation technique. The results show that PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk has implemented IFRS converged PSAK for financial instruments (PSAK 50, 55, and 60) in accordance with the adaptation stage. Even companies have volunteered to make early adoptions before the effective date is enacted. In the comparative analysis of financial statements presented from 2009 to 2015, it was found that the application of IFRS converged IFRS has a positive impact on users of financial statements because the information presented is complete and informative so that no mistakes are expected in the process of making economic decisions.","[Astuti, Elly; Sulistyowati, Nur Wahyuning] Pendidikan Akuntansi Univ PGRI Madiun, Madiun, Indonesia",,"Astuti, E (通讯作者)，Pendidikan Akuntansi Univ PGRI Madiun, Madiun, Indonesia.",elly2191@gmail.com,"Astuti, Elly/ABC-8757-2020","Astuti, Elly/0000-0002-5360-1577",,,,,25,0,0,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-410-1,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,40.0,,,,,,97,108,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI9IB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000416100900008,0

The calculations were carried out based on three scenarios. The first scenario describes the real current situation, when the health insurance company reimburses the performances related to the senile cataract treatment including a monofocal artificial intraocular lens (IOL), and the patient pays for all the materials in the case he/she requires a multifocal or toric IOL. The second scenario analyses the situation, when there was the category of so-called nadstandard (better care than the standard one) in the Czech healthcare system. In this case, the health insurance company reimburses the performances related to the senile cataract treatment including the sum equivalent to the price of a monofocal IOL as the cheapest option. The patient pays the price difference between the implanted toric or multifocal lens and an equivalent monofocal lens. The third scenario describes the situation corresponding to the judicial interpretation of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, when the health insurance company reimburses only the performances related to the senile cataract treatment including a monofocal IOL, and if a patient requires a multifocal or toric IOL, he/she pays for the whole operation including the materials himself/herself. The study covered a cohort of 200 patients with senile cataract in the age of 65 and over. Data were collected from four cataract surgery performing clinics in 2014. Patients' costs were obtained through a patient questionnaire asking the direct (out-of-pocket) expenses associated with the cataract surgery. Direct costs of the senile cataract surgery from the perspective of public health insurance were CZK 24,900 (about EUR 907) per person (one eye). Patient's direct costs were lower for monofocal lenses than for multifocal ones. Patients' costs for an IOL and the related treatment reached up to CZK 35,000 (about EUR 1,275), out of pocket expenses after the treatment averaged out at CZK 4,450 (about EUR 162). The most cost-effective option from the patients' perspective is the monofocal IOL, however, the patients would spend a higher sum of money for the eyeglasses after the operation. Nevertheless, it is still less than the material costs in the case of a multifocal IOL, which, moreover, is not suitable for all patients. Thus, the monofocal IOL appears to be the best option from the point of view of cost effectiveness both from the perspective of public health insurance and from the patient's perspective.","[Bartak, Miroslav] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Social Work, Pasteurova 40096, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic; [Masopustova, Ilona; Rogalewicz, Vladimir] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn CzechHTA, Kladno, Czech Republic; [Lamblova, Klara] Inst Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment iHETA, Manesova 881-27, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic; [Masopustova, Ilona] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Polit Studies, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Rogalewicz, Vladimir] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Biomed Engn, Dept Biomed Technol CzechHTA, Nam Sitna 3105, Kladno 27201, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne; Czech Technical University Prague; Charles University Prague; Czech Technical University Prague,"Barták, M (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Social Work, Pasteurova 40096, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic.",miroslav.bartak@ujep.cz; ilona.masopustova@fsv.cuni.cz; ilona.masopustova@fsv.cuni.cz; rogalewicz@fbmi.cvut.cz,"Rogalewicz, Vladimír/H-6246-2011; Barták, Miroslav/N-9249-2017","Rogalewicz, Vladimír/0000-0001-5432-4148;",,,,,15,1,1,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2906-2,,,,2017,,,,,,,70,79,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO1YB,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000503056700007,0

Using a unique cross-country micro-level loan data set containing loan-to-value ratios for different assets, we find that loan-to-values of loans collateralized with movable assets are lower in countries with weak collateral laws, relative to immovable assets, and that lending is biased toward the use of immovable assets. Using sector-level data, we find that weak movable collateral laws create distortions in the allocation of resources that favor immovable-based production and investment. An analysis of Slovakia's collateral law reform confirms our findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This could lead to a number of policy alternatives in countries where regulation and business have been mainly leaning to one of these types of securities. Examining the use of CB and MBS in the U.S. and Europe, we find that the two often seem to be used for different purposes. Banks are more likely to use CB when they have liquidity needs while MBS are associated with risk management and agency problems. Introducing MBS to markets where only CB are common or CB to markets where only MBS are common could have large effects.","[Carbo-Valverde, Santiago] Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Carbo-Valverde, Santiago] CUNEF, Madrid, Spain; [Carbo-Valverde, Santiago; Rodriguez-Fernandez, Francisco] Funcas, Madrid, Spain; [Rosen, Richard J.] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Econ Res Dept, Chicago, IL USA; [Rodriguez-Fernandez, Francisco] Univ Granada, Dept Econ, Granada, Spain",Bangor University; CUNEF Universidad; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; University of Granada,"Carbó-Valverde, S (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.;Carbó-Valverde, S (通讯作者)，CUNEF, Madrid, Spain.;Carbó-Valverde, S (通讯作者)，Funcas, Madrid, Spain.",s.carbo-valverde@bangor.ac.uk,"; Rodriguez Fernandez, Francisco/C-6949-2019","Carbo Valverde, Santiago/0000-0001-5357-599X; Rodriguez Fernandez, Francisco/0000-0003-3676-9156","Funcas; MICINN-FEDER [ECO2014-59584-P, ECO2015-67656-P]; Junta de Andalucia; [P12-SEJ-2463]",Funcas; MICINN-FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia);,"This work was financially supported from Funcas, MICINN-FEDER ECO2014-59584-P and ECO2015-67656-P, and Junta de Andalucia and P12-SEJ-2463 (Excellence Groups).",,15,7,7,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

Off-balance sheet activities items are important in the region. However, the models excluding OBS perform better than the models including it. Country environmental variables are the key determinants of profit efficiency; bank-specific variables determine cost efficiency with country variables influencing technology. Cost inefficiency correlates negatively with bank size, and positively with risk, liquidity and capitalization. The cost function shifts down with financial depth and the concentration of deposits, and up as the economy grows and urbanization increases. Evidence on overall convergence is mix, depending on methodology. However, convergence is achieved for both types of efficiency within two sub-groups of countries (club convergence).

One agent thinks the data are stationary, the other thinks the data are nonstationary. A policymaker combines forecasts from the two models using a recursive Bayesian model averaging procedure. The actual (but unknown) price process depends on the policymaker's forecasts. The authors find that if the policymaker has complete faith in the stationary model, then beliefs and outcomes converge to the stationary rational expectations equilibrium. However, even a grain of doubt about stationarity will cause beliefs to settle on the nonstationary model, where prices experience large self-confirming deviations away from the stationary equilibrium. The authors show that it would take centuries of data before agents were able to detect their model misspecifications.","[Cho, In-Koo] Univ Illinois, Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Cho, In-Koo] Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Cho, In-Koo] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA; [Kasa, Kenneth] Simon Fraser Univ, Econ, Burnaby, BC, Canada",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Hanyang University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Simon Fraser University,"Cho, IK (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Econ, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Cho, IK (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Seoul, South Korea.;Cho, IK (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors thank two anonymous reviewers from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for several useful comments and suggestions and the National Science Foundation for financial support.

MSMEs are reporting increasing interest in professional business advice, but only a small share of MSME owners is using consultancy services. This paper analyzes the consultancy market sector for MSMEs in Croatia, with a special focus on differences in the perspectives - gaps and overlaps of the supply (consultancy companies) and the demand side (MSME owners) of the market. The main objectives of the study are to identify and analyze determinants that influence consultancy market for MSMEs in Croatia, through opinions and views of the owners of MSMEs, from one side, and consultants as service providers, on the other side (mirroring perspective). The empirical evidence in this paper is provided through secondary research and primary research - a survey conducted among 303 MSME owners and 60 providers of consultancy services for MSMEs. The main findings of this study enable segmentation of the users of consultancy services for MSMEs and identification of market niche for MSME consultants. Based on the research results, recommendations for better understanding of MSME owners as clients of consultancy services are created, especially those related to improving marketing and service development strategies. The results of this study and recommendations can be used by a wide network of advisory service providers for MSMEs (e.g. accountants, lawyers, IT consultants) for improving the quality of service and identification of market niches.","[Delic, Anamarija; Alpeza, Mirela] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Delic, A (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ, Osijek, Croatia.",adelic@efos.hr; malpeza@efos.hr,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,1,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,507,521,,,,,,15,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900031,0

Secessionist regions are described and compared with the same-status regions in their country. We discuss the differences in the fiscal autonomy degree in the secessionist and non-secessionist regions and the evolution of the fiscal autonomy in European regions. The relationship between secessionist party support and fiscal autonomy is monitored. We have found out, that the new after-secessionist state would be viable from the demographical as well as economic point of view. The secessionist regions show higher degree of the fiscal as well as complex autonomy and their autonomy was increasing in the last three decays. There is very close relationship between the degree of democracy and degree of fiscal autonomy. Furthermore, we discovered that if the region once reached the certain degree of the fiscal autonomy, it is less keen on supporting the real secession.","[Fischer, Jakub] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lipovska, Hana; Sedova, Jindriska] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ amAdministrat, Brno, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Masaryk University Brno,"Fischer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",fischerj@vse.cz; lipovska@mailo.muni.cz; jsedova@econ.muni.cz,"Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012","Fischer, Jakub/0000-0003-4658-1974",Masaryk University [MUNI/A/0915/2015],Masaryk University,"This work was supported by the project of No. MUNI/A/0915/2015 funded by the Masaryk University and with the contribution of long-term institutional support of research activities by the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.",,21,3,3,0,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-1239,,978-80-210-8448-3,CURR TREND PUB SECT,,,2017,,,,,,,140,147,,,,,,8,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BH7FG,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000402427100017,0

Therefore behavioral aspects of decision making on online auctions are in the center of interest in this chapter. Allegro platform is the key transaction website in Poland. The scope of this marketplace and its recognition mean that it is a perfect place to conduct field experiments in the context of online auctions. The chapter focuses on experiments in the context of online auctions carried out in real conditions on Allegro platform. The background for field experiments is presented in general, followed by an extensive discussion on the determinants of field experiments online.

Film induced tourism means that tourists visit places that were portrayed in a movie, on video or on television, either before or after its production, attracted to the place's portrayal. In short, it is about a firsthand seeing of sights that were seen before on screen. It also means the business of attracting as high numbers as possible of tourists to those places through images. When combining television and cinema screens, film is considered today's most powerful visual medium and art form, with a global reach unprecedented in human history. The simultaneous increase in international tourism has produced special types of film and media, and relationships with tourism. These types and relationships cover areas such as types of film and media induced tourism, types of film tourists, activities and methods of marketing and promotion, actual effects of film productions on tourism, and other consequences of film and media induced tourism. The research therefore addresses and questions the several and complex layers of positive or negative influences, benefits and disadvantages from the specific media form of film on global tourism. It turns out that the strands of this web of relationships and effects go both ways, and requires considerable insight and sensitivity on behalf of travelers, destinations, and filmmakers. For the future, this means that the technological development of media forms, increasing traveler sophistication and demands, and a continuously rising awareness of global issues and challenges for the tourism industry, promises further aspects of future research in this area. Therefore, the paper adds to the body of knowledge that connects media research with social consequences.to put high demands on, yet likewise to benefit the here analyzed stakeholders and forms of travel.","[Gunesch, Konrad] Amer Univ Emirates, Coll Media & Mass Commun, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Gunesch, K (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Emirates, Coll Media & Mass Commun, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",konradgunesch@hotmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,7,22,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

While the main motive behind legalization has been economic stimulation and tourism development, those are not automatically achieved by casino development. However, improved gaming facilities can boost tourism, which in turn benefits the gaming industry, which then can benefit an entire area. Different models of furthering this relationship have been developed. Both the tourism and the gambling industry haven taken note of various models and are developing them according to the special Asia and Pacific situation. Especially Macao's and Singapore's concepts are increasingly adopted for casino tourism destinations in several Asian countries, starting with the legalization of gaming, continuing with integrating the gaming industry with other tourist industries such as conventions and exhibitions, and finally offering comprehensive tourist packages and destinations. The type of tourist using these increased and improved offers is also shifting from an individual and largely gambling-focused traveler to one who is also business or leisure-oriented. Reacting to these trends, the hotel industry increasingly builds and develops integrated, all-inclusive and family-friendly resorts and amenities. Yet this development relates to gaming-related issues that concern the whole Asia-Pacific region. Of special interest for banking and finance are governmental legalizing or franchising licenses for gaming and construction of casinos, in relation to prin ions gaming prohibitions or monopolies. Examples are Asian and Pacific countries opening their gaming industry to international investors, internationalizing and distributing concessions to foreign investment companies, or increasing both casino and tourist income while maintaining financial independence from the gaming sector.","[Gunesch, Konrad] Amer Univ Emirates, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",,"Gunesch, K (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Emirates, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

We overcome infrequency and opacity of accounting disclosures, which obscure their economic usefulness and the accurate measurements of MMs, by resorting to implied MMs, computed as stock return sensitivities to interest rate changes. We find that implied MMs are positively associated with trading volume, and that the role of returns in this relationship is minimal or null.","[Iarovyi, Mark] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Bar Yosef, Sasson] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; [Venezia, Itzhak] Tel Aviv Yaffo Acad Coll, Tel Aviv, Israel",Bocconi University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Iarovyi, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",,,,,,,,70,0,0,1,1,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87927-32-8,,,,2017,,,,,,,117,144,,10.20472/EFC.2017.007.007,0.0,,,28,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ6MP,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000426854900007,0

On the other hand, female entrepreneurs are no less likely to be financially included in the informal financial markets than their male counterparts.

Overall, our review suggests that at least the direction of the short-run and long-run growth effects can be predicted with a reasonable degree of certainty, but there is disagreement with respect to the magnitude.

This dearth of literature is especially surprising because income inequality and in-migration into urban centres of growth are two issues that many developing economies are faced with and tackling these issues effectively involves understanding the interactions between these two related phenomena. This study is therefore a first attempt to analyse the impact of internal in-migration on receiving areas and is placed in the context of South Africa. Based on a conceptual analysis, the study argues that in-migration into the formal sector of the receiving areas will in general reduce inequality while in-migration into the informal or unemployed sector increases inequality. Using individual panel data the study further tests empirically at the district level the impact of in-migration and finds that rising urban inequality in urban areas can be attributed at least in part to rural-urban migration. This works through both the wage as well as employment channel. The employment channel can be said to have a stronger impact than the wage channel as indicated by the coefficients estimated through our system GMM regression analysis.","[Kollamparambil, Umakrishnan] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Kollamparambil, U (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.",uma.kollamparambil@wits.ac.za,"Kollamparambil, Umakrishnan/ABB-1918-2021","Kollamparambil, Umakrishnan/0000-0002-6201-1923",Economic Research Southern Africa,Economic Research Southern Africa,"The author wishes to thank the reviewers for their insightful comments and Emmanuel Ayifah for the excellent research assistance.

We distinguish between studies that concentrate on specific problems of the organic sector and studies that compare conventional and organic farms. Organic farms can on average improve their efficiency by 21%-points (SFA) and 27%-points (DEA). In comparing efficiency and productivity of organic with conventional farms sample selection is a major challenge, since the organic farms have a different farm-structure and are often represented by a relatively small number of observations. In studies taking into account selectivity problems organic farms are on average 4%-points less efficient than conventional farms. In four of five studies, organic farms are less productive than conventional farms and productivity is for about 20%-points lower than on conventional farms, which fits the results of yield comparisons. Efficiency influences the decision to convert to organic farming, but it is an empirical question, whether this influence is positive or negative. The impact of subsidies on farm level efficiency is found to be negative in most studies. Organic farms show the same or a higher degree of efficiency if environmental variables are taken into account.","[Lakner, Sebastian] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Breustedt, Gunnar] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",University of Gottingen; University of Kiel,"Lakner, S (通讯作者)，Georg August Univ Gottingen, Dept Agrarokon & Rurale Entwicklung, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",slakner@gwdg.de,"Lakner, Sebastian/AAF-2585-2019","Lakner, Sebastian/0000-0002-5122-8924",,,,,105,12,13,3,33,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

It verifies the hypothesis that the share of unemployed persons affects the number of detected crimes in the Moravian-Silesian Region. The influence of the unemployment rate is verified within six basic types of detected offenses, total detected crime and selected criminal offenses. The hypothesis was verified by a correlation analysis of the data in the Moravian-Silesian Region in the period 2007-2016. A medium correlation coefficient was found in Moral acts and a very high correlation coefficient in Other Criminal Offenses. These two categories were subsequently assigned to a following investigation from a viewpoint of selected offenses. In the categories of moral offenses, a weak correlation coefficient has been demonstrated in three offenses, middle correlation coefficient in one offense, and very high correlation coefficient was also proven in one offense. In the categories of Other Criminal Offenses, there was a low correlation coefficient in one offense, middle correlation coefficient in one offense, and for one offense the correlation coefficient was very high.","[Lenert, David] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Lenert, D (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",david.lenert@vsb.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

The significance of this study lies in the fact that positive psychological capital should be an issue of concern to leaders of public organizations in Egypt due to the increasing deterioration in public employees' job performance and productivity, which is reflected in the poor quality of services rendered to citizens and their dissatisfaction with many public services offered by these organizations. The research question will then focus on what is the impact of psychological capital on public employees in Egypt? The analysis of this study was drawn from different academic literature and in-depth interviews with three senior employees and leaders in different public organizations.

The analysis was made for rural and urban-rural communes in Poland. The statistical data from the Local Data Bank of the Central Statistical Office were applied. A set of indicators of sustainable development was defined. Using methods of multidimensional comparative analysis the synthetic indicators of economic, social and environmental development were determined. The measure of cohesion was used to assess the sustainability level of communes. It enabled dividing communes into five groups: very low, low, medium, high and very high level of sustainability. The results show that there are pronounced differences in Polish rural and semi-urban communes regarding their level of sustainable development. The largest number of municipalities was in the low level sustainable development class. It was found that the economic aspect may be a barrier in shaping of sustainable development of communes.","[Mikula, Aneta] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Mikula, A (通讯作者)，Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Warsaw, Poland.",aneta_mikula@sggw.pl,"Mikuła, Aneta/ABF-0024-2022","Mikuła, Aneta/0000-0001-7129-6898",,,,,9,1,1,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,226,232,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400030,0

The consequence of the failure of these problems is the population migration, especially the younger groups and ones with high education. Although there are different models of solving social problems, Croatian institution rarely recognize and support them, and it seems that they rarely fully understand their actions. This paper puts a special emphasis on two models: social entrepreneurship and franchising. Social entrepreneurship represents an innovative approach to the use of business principles for solving social problems (not exclusive for profit generation). As a new paradigm in business that emphasizes the mobilization of ideas, capacities and resources for the purpose of sustainable social development, social entrepreneurship is the answer to the needs of society that the competent institution is most often unable to solve due to its bureaucracy, slowness and inflexibility. On the other hand, franchising represents an increasingly popular way to launch new business ventures and/or business expansion. By using a proven business model and a well-known name, it is easier to enter the market and reduce the risk of a possible failure. The main purpose of this paper is to present the model that many countries have recognized as an innovative business concept which is aimed at two sides: the desire to launch a business venture and the ability to make a significant contribution to improving the quality of life in the community. In the first part, the paper gives an insight into the theoretical framework of the concept of social franchise, its characteristics, and the difference in relation to a social enterprise. The second part presents some of the world's best examples of good social franchise practice and gives an overview of the possibilities of introducing a social franchise into Croatia. Attention will be given to the recommendations and implications for further research due to the author's conviction that this new social business model has the potential to influence real social values.","[Peric, Julia; Erceg, Aleksandar] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Peric, J (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",julia.peric@efos.hr; aleksandar.erceg@efos.hr,"Perić, Julia/AAC-3447-2022; Erceg, Aleksandar/I-8071-2019","Perić, Julia/0000-0001-8031-7435; Erceg, Aleksandar/0000-0002-1141-1919",,,,,26,2,2,0,9,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,726,741,,,,,,16,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900046,0

To support the continued growth of organics, greater emphasis should be put on farmers' markets and supply chain special projects. This calls for increasing the accuracy of organic market data collection. The analysis of people's behavior helps us understand social, cultural and environmental issues surrounding customers' activities at farmers' markets. This paper's objective is to identify motives that lead consumers with smart phones to use hashtags when posting photos related to farmer's markets on the social network Instagram. Data were obtained using two methods. The first method was a structured interview with 136 users of the social network Instagram who created posts in relation to farmers' markets. The second was an analysis of 1,000 photos on Instagram where four evaluators (each 250 images) created the categories that define the content of hashtags in relation to their contributions to farmers' markets. Based on the semistructured interviews, it was possible to identify four basic motivations for people's use of hashtags: (1) Expression of feelings, emotions and characteristics of the place and the products actually captured in the photo; (2) Expression of feelings, emotions and characteristics of places and products not captured on the photo; (3) To self-promote (show others where I am and what I am doing) and (4) To be seen as popular (using buzzwords,cool hashtags).","[Pilar, Ladislav; Polakova, Jana; Rojik, Stanislav; Ticha, Ivana] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic; [Gresham, George] Jacksonville Univ, Davis Coll Business, Jacksonville, FL USA",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Jacksonville University,"Pilar, L (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",pilarl@pef.czu.cz; polakovaj@pef.czu.cz; ggresha1@ju.edu; rojiks@pef.czu.cz; ticha@pef.czu.cz,"Ticha, Ivana/C-5460-2017; Rojík, Stanislav/D-1663-2017","Ticha, Ivana/0000-0003-4000-1000; Rojík, Stanislav/0000-0002-3506-8799","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) PEF CZU Prague, under Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda [20171033]","Internal Grant Agency (IGA) PEF CZU Prague, under Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda","This article was supported by the Internal Grant Agency (IGA) PEF CZU Prague, under Regionalni znaceni jako konkurencni vyhoda, number 20171033.",,24,10,10,0,3,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,287,292,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400038,0

The banking system in the Czech Republic in the period 2005-2015 has not undergone any crisis. Significant changes in the balance of the Czech National Bank were associated with foreign exchange interventions against the Czech crown. High liquidity determines almost zero demand of banks for loans from the central bank. The Czech National Bank is in the, debtor position in relation to banks. Central banks in the European Monetary Union and the United States are in the opposite position of the creditors. The dramatic growth in bank reserves had no significant inflationary pressures. The main reason is careful supply of bank loans. All this confirms that issuing money into the economy is associated especially with commercial banks' lending to non-bank subjects.

The importance of the ICT sector has grown over time; it is also forecasted that ICT industry's will increase even more in future. ICT sector's development in Latvia demonstrates its capacity in growing number of companies, its share in GDP, the number of employees, and number of specialists. But by closer look the research results indicate that Latvia has lower share of ICT specialists in total employment in year 2015: 2.2% comparing to 3.5% in EU average (Europe Commission, 2017). Also, the ICT sector export in % of total service exports in Latvia is only 24.3% in year 2015 that is lower than the average in EU countries (36.5%). The study examines correlations and the Granger-causality between several ICT sector's indicators and GDP per capita growth rate in EU. Results show positive correlation between relative share of ICT specialists in employment and ICT sector share in total service export. Thereby it can be stated that the sufficient numbers of skilled ICT specialists will not only influence positively the productivity of companies, but also will generate surplus to GDP. Furthermore, it makes the region more attractive to global companies, who are interested in outsourcing the task. Strong uni-directional Granger-causality from ICT investment to real GDP per capita growth was found already from the first lag, but vice versa relationship is significant only after two lags. Application of panel Granger causality test in vector error correction (VECM) form confirms previously found conclusion both in the short-run and in the long-run.","[Rozite, Kristine; Balina, Signe; Freimane, Rita] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Rozite, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-286-0,,,,2017,,,,,,,511,522,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0YY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393400051,0

Risk assessment involves the adoption of possible losses and planning their financing in support of the investment decision. According to it, tools of risk management include instruments of risk mitigation and risk assessment. To reduce the risk in financial management, it is advisable to use a number of organizational risk management tools in order to influence certain aspects of the enterprise activities.

Post-crisis response strategies should be implemented to restore brand trust and diminish the effect of reputational threat, since these strategies act as critical determinants of the actual impact of the crisis on consumers' evaluations and consequently on repurchase intentions. A categorization of the nature of the crisis, distinguishing between 'performance-related' and 'values-related'-based on a deep understanding of the affected benefits-may serve as a discriminator to select the appropriate response strategy. A contingency-based view suggests that the effectiveness of a crisis response depends on various contingent factors, which may mediate and moderate consumers' post-crisis brand evaluations. Thus, moderators such as brand identification and positive brand reputation (e.g. for CSR activities) may be enhanced and exploited to reduce the level of accommodation of the strategy and to maximize efficiency. The present study aims to elaborate a combined model able to provide mechanisms to anticipate consumers' reactions to a crisis and to propose different approaches for the brand to take in response.","[Tamanini, Chiara] European Master Business Studies, 5 Via Inama, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Wagner, Ralf] Univ Kassel, 1 Monchebergstr, D-34125 Kassel, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Tamanini, C (通讯作者)，European Master Business Studies, 5 Via Inama, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",chiara.tamanini@gmail.com; rwagner@wirtschaft.uni-kassel.de,"Wagner, Ralf/D-1389-2010",,,,,,28,1,1,1,10,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-269-9,STRATEGICA,,,2017,,,,,,,801,812,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BK0ZU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431586800063,0

Findings from the Binary logistic regression model revealed that elements of social capital, namely flow of resources, quality of information, cooperation, trustworthiness and inclusion in decisions are important predictors of enterprise success. Strategies of fostering linking social capital that were recommended in the study include gathering enough information which assist in setting achievable targets, formulating a strategy for resource procuring and delivering, and formulating a standardised system for verifying training material and other information media for simplicity.

Eventually the annual statements of the companies were enhanced and new components appeared which in the 19th century were not shown in detail on debts and liabilities positions, such as: Deferred Expenses/Prepaid Expenses/Expenditures of the Next Periods, Deferred Income/Prepaid Income/Income from the next periods, Accruals/Provisions. The aim of this research is to study and analyze the calculation methods of liquidity ratios, using components of the data taken from the annual statements of the companies, and basing them on the empirical research to modify the calculations of liquidity ratios. The authors of this paper are using international scientific literature and articles to understand the different schools of financial analysis. For the empirical research, to compare the traditional and modified calculation of liquidity ratios, the authors have used the the data from annual financial statements of Latvia's most profitable companies of different industries over a five-year period.

It is shown that the existing Czech system is highly inefficient, lacking horizontal as well as vertical equity, and this is aggravated by increased income volatility. On the other hand, higher income risk in all countries, except Hungary using flat tax, results in less progression than expected, primarily due to the existence of a minimum wage, which effectively serves as insurance, and which the dynamic model captures as a system feedback. This finding may contribute to a reassessment of existing assumptions on the detrimental effect of progressive tax systems on the incentives of individuals to undertake risky decisions, such as investments in human capital.","[Vlachy, Jan] Ceske Vysoke Uceni Tech Praze, Masarykuv Ustav Vyssich Studii, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Vlachy, J (通讯作者)，Ceske Vysoke Uceni Tech Praze, Masarykuv Ustav Vyssich Studii, Prague, Czech Republic.",jan.vlachy@cvut.cz,,"Vlachy, Jan/0000-0002-2270-3247",,,,,55,3,3,0,9,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

His first online live broadcast has attracted 20 million people after he became famous overnight.

We find that Russia followed by South Africa is the net transmitter of shocks within BRICS, implying that the risk arising from these markets may have an adverse impact on others in BRICS. However, China and India exhibit weak connectedness, suggesting that these markets may be useful for hedging and diversification opportunities in BRICS. The networks of pairwise spillover results further confirm this. Among global indices, China appears as highly interconnected with the USA. USA is the strongest transmitter of shocks to BRIGS bond indices. The panel data results further confirm the significant determinants of net directional spillover. Thus, we can conclude that BRICS is a heterogeneous asset class even in the case of the bond market. India and China are the markets to look for better risk management strategies.

We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14-16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders. A quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We examine associations between BRT station level demand and built environment attributes for 120 stations in seven Latin American cities. Using direct ridership models, we study whether underlying built environment factors identified using factor analysis and the package of these factors embodied in station types identified using cluster analysis were associated with higher ridership. Of the nine factors identified, those describing compactness with dominant multifamily residential uses and stations with public and institutional land uses along the corridor were positively associated with ridership, while factors describing single-family residential development away from the CBD were negatively associated with ridership. Thirteen station types were identified, of which six were associated with BRT ridership. Relevant station types for ridership included those with a high mixture of land uses, the presence of institutional uses and public facilities, major transfer nodes in peripheral areas, and stations with a strong pedestrian environment. Taken together, our findings suggest that the mix and dominance of various land uses around the stop, the location of BRT stations relative to the CBD, the developable land around the station, and the integration of the station to the urban fabric are important characteristics that determine BRT ridership. These insights will help substantiate the case for prioritizing-built environment changes as a means to build more prosperous and sustainable mass transit systems.","[Erik Vergel-Tovar, C.] Univ Rosario, Programa Gest & Desarrollo Urbanos, Fac Ciencia Polit Gobierno & Relac Int, Bogota, Colombia; [Rodriguez, Daniel A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept City & Reg Planning, Inst Transportat Studies, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Universidad del Rosario; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Vergel-Tovar, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Rosario, Programa Gest & Desarrollo Urbanos, Fac Ciencia Polit Gobierno & Relac Int, Bogota, Colombia.",erik.vergel@urosario.edu.co; danrod@berkeley.edu,"Vergel-Tovar, C.

Besides incorporating conventional fundamental factors, such as earnings growth, leverage, dividend yield, stock return and volatility, SRI funds adjust portfolio weights by considering companies' relative ESG performance. This holds for all categories of passively and actively managed funds, while for active funds ESG scores have a higher economic impact for value rather than growth funds. The timing of inclusion of companies in active SRI funds or their exclusion is driven primarily by fundamentals rather than by ESG performance. We find that both active SRI and matched conventional funds integrate ESG information as well as financial criteria in their investment decisions, but SRI portfolios exhibit higher average sustain ability scores. Finally, we posit that SRI screening criteria effectively guide investment decisions, positive screening resulting in higher active portfolio weights of best performers in a corresponding ESG pillar.

Improved understanding of warehouse rental market segmentation enables warehouse owners to effectively formulate marketing strategies and warehouse renters to reduce search costs. Previous studies either assumed a priori submarkets or used cluster analysis to delineate submarkets based entirely on the similarity of rental prices. However, such approaches have limitations in addressing associations between warehouse rents and their determinants because of the potential spatial autocorrelation and multicollinearity in warehouse rent data sets. In the present study, we address the gap in the literature by introducing a method known as Bayesian spatial profile regression for warehouse rental submarket segmentation. This approach allows us to assess meaningful relationships between warehouse rents and their determinants as a unique profile for each sub market, while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in warehouse rents and multicollinearity among their determinants. In a case study, we demonstrated an application of spatial profile regression to a warehouse rent data set for the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) of South Korea and identified two submarkets: high-rent and low-rent groups. The high-rent group was strongly associated with proximity to the urban center in Seoul and Incheon Port, higher floor area ratio, relatively older building age, higher land price, transportation, and automated warehousing services. The associations for the low-rent group were the opposite of the high-rent group and featured proximity to industrial complexes away from the urban center. The results reflected the highly polarized segmentation of the warehouse rental market in the SMA.","[Lim, Hyunwoo; Park, Minyoung] Inha Univ, Asia Pacific Sch Logist, Incheon, South Korea; [Yoo, Eun-Hye] SUNY Buffalo, Dept Geog, Buffalo, NY USA",Inha University; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Park, M (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Asia Pacific Sch Logist, Incheon, South Korea.",hwlim@inha.ac.kr; eunhye@buffalo.edu; mypark@inha.ac.kr,,,,,,,37,7,8,2,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our generalized q model informs us to use corporate credit-risk information to predict investments when empirical measurement issues of Tobin's average q are significant (e.g., equity is much more likely to be mis-priced than debt), as in Philippon (2009). We find, consistent with our theory, that credit spreads and bond q have significant predictive powers on micro-level and aggregate investments corroborating the recent empirical work of Gilchrist and Zakrajgek (2012). We also show that the quantitative effects of the stochastic interest rates and capital illiquidity on investment, Tobin's average q, the duration and user cost of capital, and the value of growth opportunities are substantial.

If this nonrandom selection process is replaced by a process that randomly assigns eligible applicants to receive the intervention or not, the types of individuals served by the program-and thus its average impact on program participants-could be affected. To estimate the impact of discretionary programs for the individuals that they normally serve, we propose an experimental design called Preferred Applicant Random Assignment (PARA). Prior to random assignment, program staff would identify their  preferred applicants, those that they would have chosen to serve. All eligible applicants are randomly assigned, but the probability of assignment to the program is set higher for preferred applicants than for the remaining applicants. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the method, the cost in terms of increased sample size requirements, and the benefit in terms of improved generalizability to the population normally served by the program.

Using panel data of Chinese provinces, we then estimate using various methodologies the effect of anticorruption on growth, finding a negative impact. We also find that the detrimental effect upon growth results from lowering physical investment during the anticorruption campaigns.

This paper tests by empirical analyses if in the European Union countries, the gross domestic product in tourism reacts to the situations of crisis caused by the terrorist attacks and by the waves of refugees. The techniques used are sigma and beta convergence tests, combined with the deterministic sensitivity analysis. The sample consists of 26 European Union countries studied between 2000-2015 and 2000-2016, according to the available data. The results prove the prevalence of divergence, explicable by the existence of some countries, in the structure of the groups analysed, which have different contributions of gross domestic product in tourism to their overall economic growth. At the same time, a higher reaction of gross domestic product in tourism per capita is identified under the influence of the number of terrorism victims, compared to the incidence of the variation of the number of refugees. However, it cannot be stated that the two phenome n a lead to the general tendency of decrease of the gross domestic product in tourism per capita. On the contrary, there are occasional regressions of this indicator, which can be correlated only subsidiary with the crisis situations caused by terrorism and the waves of refugees.","[Butnaru, Gina Ionela; Mironiuc, Marilena; Huian, Carmen] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania; [Haller, Alina Petronela] Romanian Acad, Branch Iasi, ICES, Gh Zane, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Butnaru, GI (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",gina.butnaru@uaic.ro,"Butnaru, Gina Ionela/AAD-4799-2021; Huian, Maria Carmen/AAK-1157-2020; Marilena, Mironiuc M/I-2298-2014; Haller, Alina/P-2459-2019","Butnaru, Gina Ionela/0000-0001-9306-0405; Huian, Maria Carmen/0000-0002-4446-0805; Haller, Alina/0000-0002-2069-9889; Marilena, Mironiuc/0000-0002-8496-3888",,,,,47,5,5,1,13,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2018,20.0,,,,12,,885,904,,10.24818/EA/2018/S12/885,0.0,,,20,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GY5HR,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448604700005,0

To this end, we employ the right-tailed unit root test, the smooth-break and the momentum threshold autoregressive (MTAR) unit root tests, respectively, under considerations that the government debt might contain bubble component and structural breaks. Among the main results, it is found that the debt-to-GDP ratios are mildly explosive based on the right-tailed unit root test. The results of the smooth-break unit root tests and the MTAR approach echo the results of the traditional unit root test, indicating that the debt to-GDP ratios are not sustained. Generally speaking, the empirical evidences of this study indicate that the government debts of these advanced countries might not be sustainable, implying that the governments of these countries are required to balance their budgets intertemporally by setting the current value of the debts equal to the discounted sum of expected future surpluses.","[Chen, Shyh-Wei] Tunghai Univ, Dept Int Business, 1727,Sec 4,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Wu, An-Chi] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Tunghai University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, SW (通讯作者)，Tunghai Univ, Dept Int Business, 1727,Sec 4,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.",schen@thu.edu.tw; angeljur@econ.sinica.edu.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 106-2410-H-029-007],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank the editor, Professor Hamid Beladi, and two anonymous referees of this journal for helpful comments and suggestions.

Using a dataset of 64 countries over the period 1970-2009, our study shows that the adoption of a DIS is associated with a 2.0-4.7 percentage points higher likelihood of banking crises (the direct effect), while it is associated with a 10.1-11.1 percentage points lower likelihood of non-banking financial crises (the spillover effect). Since the spillover effect is larger than the direct effect, a DIS actually increases overall financial stability. Additionally, we analyze the mechanisms through which a DIS affects financial crises. First, we highlight the existence of the implicit guarantee and examine its interaction with an explicit DIS. Second, we investigate the substitution effect between banking crises and non-banking crises. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This asymmetric effect suggests that hedgers pay more attention to reductions rather than increases in the rebalancing horizons and hedging strategies at short rather than long rebalancing horizons.

J,"Datzberger, S",,,,"Datzberger, Simone",,,Why education is not helping the poor. Findings from Uganda,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Education; Poverty alleviation; Assimilation; Transformation; Uganda,JUSTICE,"Education emerged as a nearly uncontested development strategy to tackle several forms of social, political, economic and geographic inequalities in low- and middle-income countries. When it comes to the case of Uganda, the country represents a striking paradox. Significant investments and policy reforms in education (such as Universal Primary and Secondary Education) since 1997, did not translate into the expected results with regards to poverty reduction through human capital investment. Progress in poverty alleviation is not only stagnant but the role of education therein can be described as 'modest' at best. Against this backdrop, this article assesses the following research question: Why did Uganda's investments and policy reforms in education not uplift the poor? In examining the issue, this article introduces a theoretical framework that contrasts assimilative with transformative approaches in poverty alleviation through education. A rigorous review of Uganda's education sector plans revealed that current strategies to reduce poverty revolve around a strong assimilation-based development agenda, thereby focusing on three main areas of intervention: (a) increased access to education and retention; (b) improved quality of education; and (c) employment generation through education. The article finds that these assimilative approaches do not have an impact on the political, economic and social structures that cause poverty in the first place. Hence, it concludes that assimilative models in education are highly dependent on transformative approaches. Concretely, change cannot emerge only at the very grassroots level, i.e. through educating society at large, but also has to arise from the systemic level, i.e. government institutions at the local, national and global levels. Methodologically, the analysis draws on qualitative data that was collected in the course of two extensive field research stays in 2015 and 2017. In addition, quantitative data in the form of statistical abstracts inform the analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Brander and Taylor propose two scenarios: trade liberalization may fuel the overuse of renewable resources in countries that allow open access to the resource, or, alternatively, it may dampen such overuse in unregulated harvesting countries. Based on panel data from the Sea Around Us project on fish stock collapse and overuse in national EEZs, I test these competing theoretical predictions. Using fixed effects and system-GMM estimation, I find that the effect of openness on the level of overuse of fish species depends on the relative level of governance. Most specifications suggest that opening trade reduces fish stock collapse and overuse in countries with lax governance, while it does not significantly affect overexploitation in countries that exhibit high levels of governance.","[Erhardt, Tobias] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Erhardt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",tobias.erhardt@unibas.ch,,,,,,,32,24,24,7,67,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

A model-free analysis reveals that crude oil variance risk behaves fundamentally different from variance risk in equity markets. Most importantly, a skewness swap is no valid hedge for a variance swap and investors fear large price jumps in both directions. A model-based assessment confirms this and reveals that while stochastic volatility is important to capture the statistical properties such as volatility clusters and time-varying variance swap rates, only jump risk seems to be priced with a premium. Empirical evidence from a pricing and hedging exercise confirms these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nudges use psychology to steer people toward or away from making particular choices by designing choice architectures that frame or highlight options in particular ways. What has been missing from debates on nudging is a systematic consideration of the environments in which they are embedded. We argue that a detailed examination of the wider environment in which the policy issue is situated is essential for designing, implementing, and evaluating policy-making tools, nudge-like or otherwise. Successful policy making requires a good fit between intervention and the environment, otherwise we risk miscasting policy issues and designing futile interventions. Using real-world cases, we characterize the role of the environment in different policy problems and present a basic taxonomy for policy makers to identify critical factors in the environment beyond the confines of the choice architecture.","[Meder, Bjoern] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Max Planck Res Grp iSearch, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Fleischhut, Nadine] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rat, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Osman, Magda] Queen Mary Univ London, Biol & Expt Psychol Ctr, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England",Max Planck Society; Max Planck Society; University of London; Queen Mary University London,"Osman, M (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Biol & Expt Psychol Ctr, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",m.osman@qmul.ac.uk,"Meder, Björn/AAH-6958-2020","Meder, Björn/0000-0002-9326-400X; osman, magda/0000-0003-1480-6657",,,,,85,17,20,5,55,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0167-4870,1872-7719,,J ECON PSYCHOL,J.

This important claim has been completely forgotten by his followers of the political Marxist tradition, who since then have developed his views on the origins of capitalism. Building on the specialist literature, this article revisits the question of the Catalan transition through the prism of political Marxism and teases out its implications. In particular, it argues that the Catalan case illustrates the centrality of agency and subjectivity in the process of capitalist change. Contrary to Brenner's claim, this paper will argue that pre-capitalist social property relations persisted in agriculture throughout the period of transition. Instead, the region's capitalist breakthrough was prompted by sociocultural struggles in its 18th-century proto-industry.","[Zacares, Javier Moreno] Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Zacarés, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Social Sci Bldg, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",j.moreno-zacares@warwick.ac.uk,,"Moreno Zacares, Javier/0000-0001-5918-3081",,,,,55,10,10,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The model analyses investment decisions based on portfolio holdings and measures the value added from different sources of performance such as past return strategies, security selection, market timing and passive timing. The model was tested for a sample of mutual funds. Empirical results show that security selection is the main contributor to fund performance regardless of the sample period considered or the asset pricing model used. The evidence of timing ability is mixed with low significance. Nevertheless there are noticeable differences between the timing ability of the best and worst performing funds, especially in crisis periods. Analysing the relationship between mutual fund performance (and its different components) and fund characteristics, we find that top funds are significantly smaller and more concentrated than other funds. Finally, we also examine the persistence in the performance and in its components finding evidence of positive persistence in past return strategies and picking skills although this persistence is not shown in the overall performance.","[Andreu, Laura; Luis Sarto, Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Accounting & Finance, Zaragoza, Spain; [Carlos Matallin-Saez, Juan] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finance & Accounting, E-12080 Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Zaragoza; Universitat Jaume I,"Matallín-Sáez, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Finance & Accounting, E-12080 Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",matallin@uji.es,"Matallín-Sáez, Juan Carlos/ISB-0396-2023; , LAURA/K-5620-2017",", LAURA/0000-0003-3661-5448",Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-45568-R]; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2014-55221-P],Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),This study is part of the research projects ECO2013-45568-R supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion and ECO2014-55221-P supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad.,,50,11,11,3,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

I suggest that similarity between buyers and sellers (at the time they bought) may be used to measure a part of match quality, which is correlated with buyer characteristics. If observable characteristics of a buyer are correlated with the buyer's preferences for housing, successive owners of houses should share characteristics. A buyer could be expected to have higher match quality if similar to the previous buyer. I use a simple matching model to show this mechanism, and test this prediction using unique data with information on two generations of buyers. Buyers who resemble past buyers are paying more, also when a large number of observable housing, buyer and seller characteristics are controlled for. This supports the use of buyer similarity as a proxy for match quality.

We find that the vertical rent curve is non-monotonic with respect to floor level. Specifically, residential bidders pay a 1.5 to 3.5% ground floor premium. For the remaining vertical locations, the slope of the vertical rent curve is positive with respect to floor level. Our analysis shows that the ground floor premium is indeed a valuation of access similar to the valuation of access to the Central Business District (CBD) in a monocentric setting. Based on the cities in our sample, the ground floor premium is roughly equivalent to moving between 250-450m closer to the CBD. The positive slope of the vertical rent curve, with respect to floor level, is predominately explained by amenities (e.g. views) that compensate residents for the lack of easy access to the street. Furthermore, our analysis provides evidence of an equilibrium relationship between rental prices and proximity to initially high-priced areas that is consistent with rental price spillovers. More precisely, dwellings at higher vertical locations exhibit stronger rental price growth if they are located closer to an initially expensive neighborhood compared to dwellings on lower floor levels.","[Danton, Jayson] Swiss Natl Bank, Financial Stabil, CH-3001 Bern, Switzerland; [Himbert, Alexander] Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss National Bank (SNB); University of Lausanne,"Himbert, A (通讯作者)，Univ Lausanne, Fac Business & Econ HEC Lausanne, Dept Econ, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",jaysonmarc.danton@snb.ch; alexander.himbert@unil.ch,,,,,,,27,10,12,1,6,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

Voters with a non-residential registration have to travel great distances in order to cast their ballots compared to voters with a residential registration. Our empirical analysis, based on a unique dataset extracted from the French Census database, uses a selection model to estimate the probability of voting of an individual voter with a non-residential electoral registration and assesses the impact of the distance to the voting municipality on this probability. The analysis shows that distance and in fine the cost of voting have a highly significant impact on electoral turnout: at the median distance (22 km), a 1% increase in distance induces a reduction of 0.01% in turnout in the first round of the 2012 French presidential election and 0.007% in the second round. Moreover, the impact of distance is non-linear: an increase in distance for voters with a short distance to travel is more detrimental to turnout than the same increase for voters who travel great distances. The results are robust to several checks, ranging from analyzing other elections to changes in the estimation method. This analysis provides new insights in the issue of voting cost and its impact on electoral turnout.","[Fauvelle-Aymar, Christine] Univ Tours, IRJI, Tours, France; [Francois, Abel] Univ Lille, LEM UMR 9221, Lille, France",Universite de Tours; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lille,"Fauvelle-Aymar, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tours, IRJI, Tours, France.",christine.fauvelle-aymar@univ-tours.fr; abel.francois@univ-lille1.fr,,"Fauvelle-Aymar, Christine/0000-0001-8898-9607",,,,,52,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2018,176.0,3-4,,,,,405,440,,10.1007/s11127-018-0561-1,0.0,,,36,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,GQ5ZF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000441775600004,0

Our main objective is to gain insight into the co-movement between those CDSs and WTI and the other control variables, which reflect the health of the economy. The partial wavelet and the multi-wavelet coherence are applied to the available CDS data. The findings show strong evidence of partial wavelet coherence at the medium and low frequencies (time horizons) between the three sector CDS, and that there is a strong short-term co-movements between the CDS spreads and their control variables at high frequencies (short horizons). The multivariate wavelet analysis shows that the three CDS spreads are generally highly correlated over time and frequency bands. In addition, we uncover some differences between the co-movements of the three CDSs with each other and in their relationships with the control variables through time and frequency. Furthermore, the strength of the partial and multiple wavelet co-movements varies through time and frequency and does not subside after the Great Recession ended and during the ensuing slow recovery that started in the second half of 2009. These results are useful for forecasting sector CDS spreads and establishing their interrelationship with global US financial and oil markets' factors.","[Hkiri, Besma] Univ Jeddah, Coll Business, Dept Finance & Insurance, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat] Drexel Univ, Lebow Coll Business, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hammoudeh, Shawkat; Shahbaz, Muhammad] Montpellier Business Sch, Energy & Sustainable Dev CESD, Montpellier, France; [Aloui, Chaker] King Saud Univ, Coll Business Adm, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",University of Jeddah; Drexel University; Montpellier Business School; King Saud University,"Aloui, C (通讯作者)，King Saud Univ, Coll Business Adm, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",bHkiri@uj.edu.sa; hammousm@drexel.edu; cmaloui@ksu.edu.sa; sarafrazees@yahoo.com,"Aloui, Chaker/T-8129-2018; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAS-6190-2021; Shahbaz, Muhammad/AAD-9038-2019","Shahbaz, Muhammad/0000-0003-2391-6997; HKIRI, Besma/0000-0002-0747-8483",Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University [RGP-211],Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University(King Saud University),The authors are grateful to the Editors Professors Hamid Beladi and C.R.

A similar regulation has been in place in New Zealand since 2010. We introduce the stable funding requirement (SFR) into an open-economy DSGE model featuring a banking sector with richly-specified liabilities, and estimate the model for New Zealand. We then evaluate the impact of the new prudential instrument on monetary policy trade-offs. A higher steady-state SFR level amplifies the effects of shocks to the spread on long-term bond financing in the banking sector, adding to macroeconomic volatility conditional on these shocks. However, the SFR plays a passive role in the transmission of all other shocks to the real economy. Hence in the overall picture, the monetary policy trade-off between inflation stabilisation and output stabilisation, is only slightly worsened by the SFR. We note that the trade-off can be improved when monetary policy responds systematically to credit growth. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the problem of heterogeneous firms minimizing the cost of intertemporal emission control in the presence of stochastic future pollution standards and emission permits that are tradable across firms and through time. A firm can invest in clean capital (an improved pollution abatement technology) to reduce its abatement cost. We consider two possibilities: that investment is reversible or irreversible. Uncertainty is captured within a two period model: only the current period cap is known. We show that if banking is positive and marginal abatement costs are sufficiently convex, there will be more abatement and investment in clean technology under uncertainty than there would be under certainty and no banking. These results are at odds with the common belief that uncertainty on future environmental policy is a barrier to investment in clean capital. Moreover, under uncertainty and irreversibility, we find that there are cases where banking enables firms to invest more in clean capital.","[Pommeret, Aude] City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Schubert, Katheline] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Pommeret, Aude] IREGE Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Annecy, France",City University of Hong Kong; Paris School of Economics; Universite Savoie Mont Blanc,"Schubert, K (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",schubert@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,18,6,9,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Among the factors explaining the location of FDI, regional trade agreements (RTAs) can be relevant for emerging markets, as they can promote economic integration and increase the attractiveness of the region for foreign investors. This paper investigates the impact of South-South trade agreements on the FDI decision of multinationals, where the Agadir, mercado comun del sur (MERCOSUR), and ASEAN free trade area (AFTA) agreements are considered. Three panels of countries are defined, where the members joined a specific agreement or not. Non-Gulf Arab states are compared to better performing regions in Latin America and Southern and Eastern Asia. The analysis provides evidence that openness to foreign trade and financial markets are among the main catalysts to attract FDI, provided that business-friendly institutions exist in the host country. Other variables, like the size of the industrial sector, urbanization rates, and external debt appear to be important in some cases. The integration of China into the world economy is a specific trigger for FDI to Asian destinations. Since RTAs influence the market size by reducing barriers to trade, their impact operates via GDP growth and openness. Gains from the agreement are striking for Latin America and Asia, but not for Arab states. To attract more FDI. business-friendly institutional reforms and mechanisms to support new firm foundation should be implemented in this region.","[Cherif, Mondher] Univ Reims, Reims, France; [Dreger, Christian] DIW, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Dreger, C (通讯作者)，DIW, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",cdreger@diw.de,"Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020",,,,,,43,8,10,3,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

There are many reasons for Europe to want to make the transition to a more Entrepreneurial Society. And for decades now, policy makers are trying to bring that transition about with variations on the educate, deregulate and finance approach to entrepreneurship. We argue that more fundamental reforms are required to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem and bring about this transition. We then discuss the 12 contributions that pertain to five different facets of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The first two papers address the most fundamental institutional foundations of the ecosystem. The next three papers discuss the (lack of) access to knowledge and incentives to start innovative entrepreneurial ventures. That is followed by three papers that focus on the institutions that (fail to) channel financial resources to such ventures and two papers that analyze the relevance of labor market institutions.

Vast research endeavors have been carried out to understand the antecedents, barriers, and facilitators of the industry. However, the focus has been rather limited and accounted almost exclusively for formal features of institutional environments, leaving the informal dimensions unexplored. This paper tries to close that gap. Based on longitudinal country-level data on 18 European countries, we first explore if the usual suspects, mostly embodied in reformable formal institutions, do play a role in the European context. We also investigate if informal institutions, and in particular social capital, may exert a prominent effect. In this respect, we found that the impact of social capital on VC activity is indeed indirect, through determining those structural formal institutions which in turn significantly affect VC activity. These findings contribute to the literature on VC and inform European policy makers on the most promising channels for creating a prosperous institutional environment for the financing of innovative start-ups.","[Grilli, Luca; Mrkajic, Boris; Latifi, Gresa] Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via R Lambiuschini 4b, I-20156 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Grilli, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Via R Lambiuschini 4b, I-20156 Milan, Italy.",luca.grilli@polimi.it,"Grilli, Luca/K-6348-2017",,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [649378]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649378] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(Horizon 2020); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 649378 (FIRES project).

While substantial differences between individuals have been documented, the sources of this heterogeneity are not well understood. To contribute to this issue we conduct an incentivized field study with pre-school children. We assess the children's willingness to compete and relate the inclinations to ambitions and preferences of their parents. Parents' ambitions concerning their children's success in professional life predict their children's competitiveness. In particular, children of highly ambitious parents tend to enter competition even if their chances to win are low. High ambitions are related to a relatively low socioeconomic background.","[Khadjavi, Menusch] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Khadjavi, Menusch] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Nicklisch, Andreas] Hsch Tech & Wirtschaft Chur, Chur, Switzerland; [Nicklisch, Andreas] Res Unit Need Justice & Distribut Procedure, Hamburg, Germany; [Nicklisch, Andreas] Res Unit Need Justice & Distribut Procedure, Vienna, Austria; [Nicklisch, Andreas] Res Unit Need Justice & Distribut Procedure, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Nicklisch, A (通讯作者)，HTW Chur, Ctr Econ Policy Res, Comercialstr 20, CH-7000 Chur, Switzerland.",Andreas.Nicklisch@hrwchur.ch,,"Khadjavi, Menusch/0000-0002-8152-3369; Nicklisch, Andreas/0009-0000-3351-3863",German Research Foundation [Ni 1610/1-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [100019E_178317/1]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [100019E_178317] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),We gratefully acknowledge the many useful comments provided by participants at several conferences as well as the editor Lionel Page and two anonymous referees.

Methodological populism in the Bangladesh health and education sectors,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Participation; Policy process; Populism; Ethnography; Development management; Bangladesh; Health; Education,,"Policy makers are frequently characterized as being out of touch with the communities they serve. But closing the gap between policy makers and people is not straightforward, since distancing effects are produced by a combination of geography, politics and knowledge. This article analyses the case of an experimental initiative in Bangladesh known as the reality check that attempted to influence policy makers in the health and education sectors by providing them with people-centered data gathered at community level. The case is analyzed as an example of methodological populism that combined participatory and ethnographic approaches, and as one that challenged current managerialist cultures of what can be considered as acceptable evidence for policy. The case highlights tensions between participation, populism and policy that are potentially productive but constrained by three sets of factors: (i) contestations over the status of popular knowledge, (ii) the need for critical policy spaces within policy processes in which policy makers can engage with such knowledge, and (iii) the disruptive temporalities within policy processes that tend to inhibit learning. Drawing on the guarded hopefulness of meta-modernist theory, the paper concludes that if more attention can be paid to such issues, initiatives informed by methodological populism such as the reality check could be further built upon in ways that may contribute to the humanization or peopling of policy processes.

Using survey and field experiment data, we find that certification resulted in reduced harvesting, and the effect was larger for households who are more risk averse and exhibited distorted probability weighting. In contrast, loss averse households increased harvesting after certification.

Speculative-grade firms frequently refinance their corporate bonds early to extend maturity, particularly under accommodating credit supply conditions, leading to a procyclical maturity structure. In contrast, investment-grade firms do not manage their maturity in the same manner. I exploit the protection period of callable bonds to show that the maturity extension is not driven by unobservable confounding factors. The evidence is consistent with speculative-grade firms dynamically managing maturity to mitigate refinancing risk.","[Xu, Qiping] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Xu, QP (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business 223, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",qxu1@nd.edu,,,"Deutsche Bank; Bradley Foundation; John and Serena Liew Fellowship Fund at the Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, University of Chicago Booth School of Business","Deutsche Bank; Bradley Foundation; John and Serena Liew Fellowship Fund at the Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance, University of Chicago Booth School of Business","I thank my advisors Douglas Diamond, Zhiguo He, Anil Kashyap, Gregor Matvos, and Amir Sufi for their invaluable input and the editor, Philip Strahan, for insightful comments.

We study the effect of financing on property prices. We show that properties can transact at prices well above their collateral values. Therefore, the commonly used loan-to-value (LTV) ratio suffers a bias that can significantly understate credit risk. This bias is exacerbated when mortgages are originated with longer terms, at higher LTV ratios, or when sellers possess stronger bargaining power. Furthermore, this bias is larger under aggressive lending products, e.g. interest-only loans and mortgages allowing negative amortization. Our simulation results suggest that many mortgages originated at the peak of the housing bubble are, in fact, under water at origination. In particular, the loan amount of a 30-year mortgage at a 95% LTV can be 15% greater than the collateral value of the property, suggesting the mortgage is already deep under water at origination. These findings call into questions underwriting and risk control practices in mortgages and other collateralized debts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The model highlights the source of debate over whether countries should use the global or domestic SCC for regulatory impact analysis. I identify conditions under which a country's decision to internalize the global SCC is individually rational. I show that obtaining international consensus on a uniform value to internalize will be more challenging than often appreciated. I introduce the notion of a preferred SCC to reflect each country's preference conditional on a true value of the global SCC and a distribution of the domestic SCCs among countries. While all countries have a preferred SCC greater than their domestic SCC, a country's preferred SCC can be greater than or less than the global SCC. How these preferences translate into agreement depends on institutional arrangements for collective decision making, for which I provide empirical evidence based on various decision rules.","[Kotchen, Matthew J.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kotchen, Matthew J.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kotchen, MJ (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Kotchen, MJ (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",matthew.kotchen@yale.edu,,,,,,,36,30,33,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

This method is based on intraday data and can easily be used to conduct a short-run analysis of volatility spillovers. This new approach consists of three steps: first, the removal of intraday periodicity, then, the estimation of intraday volatility, and, finally, the calculation of volatility spillovers. We use the IVSI approach to examine the influence of the Brexit vote on volatility spillovers among five major European stock markets. Empirical results show no apparent changes in the connectedness of these markets, in a sample period after the vote that is three months long. But when the period is reduced to one month, the volatility spillovers in these markets clearly increase, with a changed spillover mechanism. Further dynamic studies indicate that after the vote the volatility spillovers increase in the first month and then decrease in the second month. More interestingly and unexpectedly, on the first trading day after the Brexit vote, the volatility spillover among these European markets largely diminishes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We employ matching techniques combined with flexible difference-in-differences fixed effects panel data models on data from the British Household PanelSurvey. The joint use of matching with fixed effects specifications allows building more comparable treatment and control groups, producing less model-dependent results and accounting for individual-level unobserved heterogeneity. We find that public smoking bans appear to have a statistically significant short-term positive impact on the well-being of married individuals, especially among women with dependent children. These effects appear to be robust to alternative specifications and placebo tests and are discussed in the light of the economic theory and recent evidence.","[Yang, Miaoqing] RAND Europe, Cambridge, England; [Zucchelli, Eugenio] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England",RAND Corporation; RAND Europe; Lancaster University,"Yang, MQ (通讯作者)，RAND Europe, Cambridge, England.",,"Zucchelli, Eugenio/Z-4871-2019","Zucchelli, Eugenio/0000-0003-3883-5006; Yang, Miaoqing/0000-0001-7975-374X",,,,,64,3,4,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

I develop a two-sector stochastic general equilibrium model with financial intermediation and real estate collateral to assess the impact of financial conditions and land prices on aggregate fluctuations.I estimate the model with Bayesian methods using a novel data set that includes U.S.macro and financial variables during the period 1975-2010. The results from the estimated model show that financial conditions have a sizable effect on the variability of investment spending, while productivity shocks are the mam source of consumption fluctuations.Specifically, on the macro side, (1) financial shocks explain about three quarters of investment spending variability and one third of the variance in hours worked.On the financial side, (2) financial shocks explain most of the variability in land prices, credit spread, and aggregate net worth of the financial sector.The model also accounts for observed unconditional moments of macro and financial variables. Our quantitative results are suggestive of the impact of diverse sources of financial instability, and as such relevant for macro prudential policy analysis.","[Yepez, Carlos A.] Univ Manitoba, Econ Dept, Rm 501 Fletcher Argue, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada",University of Manitoba,"Yépez, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Econ Dept, Rm 501 Fletcher Argue, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V5, Canada.",carlos.yepez@umanitoba.ca,"Yepez, Carlos/AFK-8475-2022","Yepez, Carlos/0000-0001-5851-8986",,,,,25,5,5,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

The contributions of the paper to the literature are threefold. First, a general framework of employment growth is estimated by using a dataset made of 879 large international firms observed for the period 2002-2010 and localized in three economic areas: USA, Japan and Europe. Second, we develop a database merging the firms' data with EPO patents data. In particular, the innovation variable is proxied by the R&D capital stock. Third contribution to the literature is to analyze the extent to which the economic crisis may affect the sensitivity of employment with respect to own innovation but also with respect to outside innovation, the R&D spillovers, in high-tech and low-tech industries. The empirical results suggest some important and significant results. This comparative finding could be the source of relevant industrial policy implications.","[Aldieri, L.] Parthenope Univ, Dept Business & Econ Studies, Via Generale Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Vinci, C.

This paper provides evidence that an important determinant of higher equity volatility among research and development (R&D)-intensive firms is fewer financing constraints on firms' ability to access growth options. I provide evidence for this effect by studying how persistent shocks to the value of firms' tangible assets (real estate) affect their subsequent equity volatility. The analysis addresses concerns about the identification of these balance sheet effects and shows that these effects are consistent with broader patterns on the equity volatility of R&D-intensive firms.,"[Carvalho, Daniel] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; IU Kelley School of Business,"Carvalho, D (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,56,12,14,8,119,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

Using a sample of US bank mergers, we show that persistence in-or variation of-integration decisions depends on two key factors: integration experience and related knowledge codification. Integration experience tends to generate persistence in the integration decision, which is associated with poor deal performance. Moreover, we show that when knowledge codification is low, the persistence caused by integration experience further increases. However, when knowledge codification is sufficiently high, the inertial effect of experience diminishes significantly. Hence, high levels of knowledge codification can weaken the effects of decision inertia, which suggests that as knowledge codification increases, the role of knowledge codification switches from strengthening inertia to promoting learning.","[Castellaneta, Francesco] Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Dept Strategy Entrepreneurship & Econ, 60 Rue Dostoievski,CS 30085, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Valentini, Giovanni] IESE Business Sch, Av Pearson 21, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Zollo, Maurizio] Bocconi Univ, Dept Management & Technol, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",SKEMA Business School; Universite Cote d'Azur; University of Navarra; IESE Business School; Bocconi University,"Castellaneta, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cote Azur GREDEG, SKEMA Business Sch, Dept Strategy Entrepreneurship & Econ, 60 Rue Dostoievski,CS 30085, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.",francesco.castellaneta@ske-ma.edu; GValentini@iese.edu; maurizio.zollo@unibocconi.it,"Zollo, Maurizio/W-5978-2019",,Catolica Lisbon; Giovanni Valentini from the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2015-ECO2015-71173-P],Catolica Lisbon; Giovanni Valentini from the Agencia Estatal de Investigacion (AEI) of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,"We are grateful to editor Fredrik Tell and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and guidance.

Results suggest that the lifecycle of cleared derivatives shifted in the 2000's. Derivatives with low trading volumes moved to modest volumes with increased probability. Prior to that shift, less popular contracts were likely to remain at low volumes or be delisted altogether. This additional resilience from low levels of trading improved the trajectory of trading volumes for the marginal contract, despite the decade's launch of a record number of new contracts and historic abundance of rarely traded contracts. The New York Mercantile Exchange, an exchange that shifted abruptly to electronic trading, provides some evidence that this shift was driven by new technology. We present our analysis as a non-stationary Markov model, estimated using Bayesian methods. This approach offers simple summary statistics to inform the launch of a new derivatives contract, organized in a model that describes the dynamics of the derivatives market as a whole. This facilitates distributional comparisons among historical groups of contracts (e.g. across time, exchange, or product type) as well as simulation of new derivatives emerging over time.","[Cavanaugh, Grant] Nephila Climate, 801 Larkspur Landing Circle, Larkspur, CA 94939 USA; [Penick, Michael] US Commod Futures Trading Commiss, Off Chief Economist, 1155 21st St NW, Washington, DC 20581 USA",,"Cavanaugh, G (通讯作者)，Nephila Climate, 801 Larkspur Landing Circle, Larkspur, CA 94939 USA.",gcavanaugh@nephilaclimate.com; mpenick@cftc.gov,,,,,,,28,0,1,2,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2405-8513,2405-8505,,J COMMOD MARK,J.

Industrial policies typically recommend upgrading' (increasing labour productivity by becoming more skill- and capital-intensive and producing higher valued products) yet firms can and do move up and down the value chain when profitable opportunities arise. This paper uses United Nations Industrial Development Organisation data on remuneration, output and employment to identify recent national development trajectories for the clothing industry. Upgrading trajectories can be pro-labour (have a rising wage share of value added) or pro-capital (a rising profit share). Pro-labour trajectories can deliver rising average wages and employment (e.g. India and China) or higher average wages for fewer workers (e.g. Sri Lanka). Pro-capital trajectories can also deliver higher average wages and employment growth (e.g. Vietnam) or rising wages for fewer workers (e.g. South Africa). Downgrading trajectories are typically associated with falling average wages but can be associated with rising average wages (as in Turkey). The desirability of a particular development trajectory depends on the economic context, especially labour market conditions.

Many policies are in place in different countries and regions to tackle unsustainable trends associated with car travel. A reason for the varying success of the same measure from one country to another might be different car-usage patterns. Using Germany and California as case studies to investigate differences and similarities in car use, we adapted the CUMILE model both for Germany and California in order to generate detailed profiles of car use over one year. Hierarchical cluster analysis subdivided the sample into clusters with similar car-usage characteristics. Then, we compared clusters of cars with similar usage between Germany and California in terms of cluster size, car properties and sociodemographic characteristics of their owners. The same eight car-usage clusters emerged in both study areas-with varying cluster sizes. We descriptively labeled the clusters: standing cars, moderate-range cars, dayto-day cars, workday cars, weekend cruisers, long-distance cars, short-haul cars and all-rounders. A better understanding of car-use patterns throughout a year and the size and characteristics of car-use clusters is beneficial for the identification of policies to make transport systems more sustainable.","[Eisenmann, Christine] KIT, Inst Transport Studies, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Buehler, Ralph] Virginia Tech, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Alexandria, VA USA",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Eisenmann, C (通讯作者)，KIT, Inst Transport Studies, Karlsruhe, Germany.",Christine.Eisenmann@kit.edu; ralphbu@vt.edu,,"Buehler, Ralph/0000-0002-1254-2224; Eisenmann, Christine/0009-0009-7454-2260",Karlsruhe House of Young Scientists (KHYS),Karlsruhe House of Young Scientists (KHYS),The authors are grateful for support from the Karlsruhe House of Young Scientists (KHYS) for providing a research scholarship for a stay of the first author at the research institution of the second author.

I find no short-run effects for female-owned enterprises from either form of capital or the training. However, I find large effects on profits and sales for male-owned enterprises that were offered loans. There is no effect for men from the grants, suggesting repayment requirements increased the likelihood of productive investment.

It also evaluates how three important aspects of the fiscal-exchange trust in government, perceptions of the public good, and level of income-shape the effect of these design features. Based on an original survey experiment focusing on the provision of public safety in Mexico, I find that these design features increase political support for taxation, especially among those with low trust in government and low income.

In this paper, we examine the effect of enrollment in separate elementary and middle schools relative to enrollment in a K-8 school using longitudinal data from an anonymous district in the United States. The choice to enroll in a K-8 or separate elementary and middle schools is potentially endogenous. While previous research has taken steps to address the possible endogeneity when estimating the effects for separate middle schools, previous research has not addressed the possible endogeneity when examining the effect at the elementary level. Without generating an unbiased estimate during the elementary grades, we cannot fully understand the impact of policies that have shifted the grade arrangement of separate elementary and middle schools to K-8 schools. In this paper, we employ a research design that leverages the fact that the anonymous district closed several schools and rezoned their students to other schools with new boundaries. We compare students on the side of the new boundaries who are assigned to a separate middle or elementary school to students on the other side of the new boundaries who are assigned to a K-8 school. When taking into the consideration the effect at the elementary level, our results are much less supportive of a K-8 policy than previous research.","[Hong, Kai] NYU, Robert F Wagnera Grad Sch Publ Serv, 295 Lafayette St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Zimmer, Ron] Univ Kentucky, Martin Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 423 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Engberg, John] RAND Corp, 4570 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",New York University; University of Kentucky; RAND Corporation,"Zimmer, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Martin Sch Publ Policy & Adm, 423 Patterson Off Tower, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",kai.hong@nyu.edu; ron.zimmer@uky.edu; engberg@rand.org,"Hong, Kai/AAA-1631-2022","Hong, Kai/0000-0003-0656-4491",,,,,29,4,13,0,6,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0094-1190,1095-9068,,J URBAN ECON,J.

In particular, this study highlights microeconomic benefits for listed Romanian companies, showing that adopting a greener business model, as in the case of leasing, does not penalize firms economically but it is a catalyst for increasing their performance, both in terms of accountancy-based measures (return on assets and return on sales), but also in terms of the subjective perceptions of investors and financial analysts operating on the capital market (proxied by Tobin's Q and market to book value of equity). Based on 266 observations from companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) during 2013-2016, the study uses regression analysis to show that financial performance is higher for quoted Romanian companies that use leasing and renting and that performance is also directly associated with leasing intensity, i.e. the share of the value of the rights to use leased goods in the total value of property, plant and equipment.","[Ionascu, Ion; Ionascu, Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ionascu, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ion.ionascu@cig.ase.ro,,"IONASCU, Mihaela/0000-0002-4488-4288; IONASCU, Ion/0000-0001-6712-7100",,,,,34,17,17,3,50,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2018,20.0,48,,,,,356,372,,10.24818/EA/2018/48/356,0.0,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,GN9XV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-10,WOS:000439567500009,0

We find that SRMs and risk vulnerability are mutually exclusive, owing to the property of subadditivity: while subadditivity is commonly regarded as the axiomatic cornerstone of SRMs, risk vulnerability, by contrast, prevails if and only if superadditivity holds. The lack of risk vulnerability yields questionable predictions in portfolio problems: SRM-decision makers who split their wealth between a risk free and a risky asset do constantly opt for an increase in the risky investment when their deterministic background wealth is complemented by some additional background risk. The more general setting where background wealth is already random and then becomes more risky is not as clear-cut: Any SRM-decision maker may both increase or decrease the risky investment, depending on the concrete instance of the portfolio problem. However, when random background wealth and the risky asset are jointly normally distributed, SRM-decision makers will again unambiguously increase their risky investment. We further conduct a data analysis and discuss possible implications of the findings for regulatory risk management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), we apply the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory scenarios to evaluate the default of a bank's largest counterparty. We find that indirect effects of this default, through the bank's other counterparties, may be larger than the direct impact on the bank. Further, when taken as a whole, the core banking system has a higher exposure concentration to a single counterparty than does any individual bank holding company. We find that the U.S. banking system's counterparty exposure concentration has risen over the 2013-2015 period. Under the 2015 CCAR this corresponds to a market diversity with just over three counterparties under stress. Our results are the first to evaluate the U.S. credit derivatives market under stress and underscore the importance of a macroprudential perspective on stress testing.

The empirical results show that funding liquidity affects market liquidity, and that the impact of illiquidity contagion between SPYs and E-minis was significant during the subprime mortgage crisis. In particular, the contagion effects between the two markets mediate the impact of funding illiquidity on market liquidity during the credit crunch. Considering the influences of other market factors on price discovery, we suggest that E-mini index futures made less contributions to price discovery during the credit crunch compared to normal periods. The empirical finding emphasizes the importance of the contagion effect between ETF and E-mini futures markets, when they suffer from external shocks.","[Chen, Wei-Peng; Lin, Shu Ling] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Informat & Finance Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lu, Jun] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Business Management, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wu, Chih-Chiang] Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Discipline Finance, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology; National Taipei University of Technology; Yuan Ze University,"Wu, CC (通讯作者)，Yuan Ze Univ, Coll Management, Discipline Finance, 135 Yuan Tung Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.",chihchiang@saturn.yzu.edu.tw,,"Chen, Wei-Peng/0000-0001-8442-4860",Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Chih-Chiang Wu and Wei-Peng Chen gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.,,22,4,6,0,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1062-9408,1879-0860,,N AM J ECON FINANC,N.

In this literature based paper, we illustrate how such an interpretation of access limits the ability of development efforts in the sector to (i) address power inequities mediating access to water services, and; (ii) acknowledge and strengthen wellbeing factors implicated with water services beyond basic health. We argue that maintaining the current interpretation of access limits the ability of development initiatives in the water sector to address pressing issues mediating people's ability to benefit from water services. To address these limitations, we propose a reinterpretation of the goal of securing access in international development frameworks grounded in Ribot and Peluso's (2003) theory of access and Amartya Sen's (1999, 2008, 2013) Capability Approach to human development.

It argues that these state-owned financial institutions have moved into a key position in the recent evolution of the European financial system and economic governance. Since the crisis, policy makers have used them to address the intrinsic volatility and excess liquidity of contemporary financial markets, as well as offset the constraints on public investment imposed by institutionalized fiscal austerity. The paper provides evidence for this claim through an analysis of the emergent policy nexus between the Investment Plan for Europe and the Action Plan on Building a Capital Markets Union. Based on official documents and interview data, it specifically traces the risk-sharing devices for small- and medium-sized enterprise and infrastructure finance set up by development banks within these initiatives. Equipped with public guarantees, they have been instrumental for the promotion of securitization markets and public-private partnerships through increased multilevel collaborations among development banks. The anchor role of such quasi-fiscal state actors in shaping capital markets, the paper concludes, has profound political implications, and therefore warrants further scholarly attention.","[Mertens, Daniel] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Polit Sci, Frankfurt, Germany; [Thiemann, Matthias] Ctr Etud Europeennes, Polit Sci, Paris, France",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Thiemann, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Etud Europeennes, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",matthias.thiemann@sciencespo.fr,,"Mertens, Daniel/0000-0002-2194-8293",,,,,65,45,47,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

To explore the above relationship, we adopt an extended version of the standard Cobb-Douglas output function including indicators of export performance and GVCs. We control for heterogeneity among firms (by country, region, and industry), sample selection, firms' characteristics, and reverse causality. Our empirical outcomes confirm the presence of a positive relationship between participation in international activities and firm performance. They also show that both participation in GVCs and position within GVCs matter.

As the industry export price can be approximated by the industry export unit value, our work provides a rigorous theoretical justification for several empirical studies that use export unit value as a proxy for export quality. We then convert our theoretical model-based structural relationships into a system of equations. Using industry level panel data from China's manufacturing sector, and measuring the industry export quality by the industry export unit value, we find that an increase in foreign presence in China's manufacturing sector contributes to a significant increase in China's export quality. We also distinguish between foreign presence in China originating from the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (HMT) and non-HMT regions. We find that foreign presence in China's manufacturing sector that originates from the HMT region leads to a much larger increase in China's export quality. The main empirical result is found to be robust with respect to alternative measures of foreign presence and aggregate demand.","[Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Shanghai Lixin Univ Accounting & Finance, 2800 Wenxiang Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Sun, Sizhong] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, 1 James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; James Cook University,"Anwar, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, 90 Sippy Downs Dr, Sippy Downs, Qld 4556, Australia.",SAnwar@usc.edu.au; Sizhong.sun@jcu.edu.au,"Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023; Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013","Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309; Sun, Sizhong/0000-0001-8430-915X",,,,,35,47,49,10,99,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We demonstrate that while risk-and non-risk based capital ratios improve bank efficiency and profitability, risk-based capital ratios fail to decrease bank risk. Our results cast doubts on the validity of the weighting methodologies used for calculating risk-based capital ratios and on the efficacy of regulatory monitoring. The ineffectiveness of risk-based capital ratios with regard to bank risk is likely to be exacerbated by the adoption of the new Basel III capital guidelines. While Basel III requires banks to hold higher liquidity ratios along with higher capital ratios, our findings suggest that imposing higher capital ratios may have a negative effect on the efficiency and profitability of highly liquid banks. Our results hold across different subsamples, alternative risk, efficiency, and profitability measures and a battery of estimation techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, less advancement has been observed in the use of self-reported data to capture the short-run disaster-development nexus in least developed countries' with high climatic risks. This self-identification in the questionnaire could be advantageous to capture the disaster impacts on households more precisely when compared to index-based identifications based on geographical exposure. In this paper, we ask: what are the impacts on household income, expenditure, asset, and labor market outcomes of recurrent flooding in Bangladesh? We examine the short-run economic impacts of recurrent flooding on Bangladeshi households surveyed in year 2010. In 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), households answered a set of questions on whether they were affected by flood and its likely impacts. We identify treatment (affected) groups using two measures of disaster risk exposure; the self-reported flood hazard data, and historical rainfall data-based flood risk index. The paper directly compares the impacts of climatic disaster (i.e., recurrent flooding) on economic development. We further examine these impacts by pooling the data for the years' 2000, 2005, and 2010 and compare the results with our benchmark estimations. Overall, we find robust evidence of negative impacts on agricultural income and expenditure. Intriguingly, the self-reported treatment group experienced significant positive impacts on crop income.

Using nationally representative household level data from Nepal, we investigate the links between a household's fertility decisions and variations in their size and composition. We show that the relationship between number of births and household size is positive when the mothers are young, but becomes negative as the mothers grow older. Elderly couples who had fewer children host, on average, more relatives who are outside the immediate family unit. This result sheds light on the heterogeneous relation between the number of children and household size over the life cycle. It also implies that reductions in a household's fertility may have an ambiguous impact on its per capita consumption, which depends on how the household's composition responds to new births and changes over time: in this sample, an old household's per capita consumption is not affected by the number of births. We use the gender of the first-born child to instrument the total number of consecutive children. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

When discussing his bill on the Senate floor and elsewhere, Sherman repeatedly brought up Alger's relationship, which in reality was rather tenuous, with the well-known Diamond Match Company. The point of mentioning Alger was to hurt Alger's future political career and his presidential aspirations in 1892. Sherman was able to pursue his revenge motive by combining it with the broader Republican goals of preserving high tariffs and attacking the trusts. As a result, this paper reinforces previous public choice literature arguing that the 1890 Sherman Act was not passed in the public interest, but instead advanced private interests.","[Newman, Patrick] Florida Southern Coll, 325 North Tennessee Ave 4145, Lakeland, FL 33801 USA",,"Newman, P (通讯作者)，Florida Southern Coll, 325 North Tennessee Ave 4145, Lakeland, FL 33801 USA.",patrick.newm1@gmail.com,,"Newman, Patrick/0000-0002-5000-5358",,,,,54,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,MAR,2018,174.0,3-4,,,,,257,275,,10.1007/s11127-017-0497-x,0.0,,,19,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FW2PM,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000425146200004,0

In this paper, we evaluate this relationship using data drawn from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 2011. We simultaneously estimate the impact of women empowerment and domestic risk factors on domestic violence, and the impact of domestic violence on health consequences. Specifically, an IV ordered probit regression strategy is used, which addresses both the endogenous nature of domestic violence and the ordinal nature of health outcome variables. Our study finds evidence that it is not the autonomous power of women, but a cooperative decision-making environment in a marital relationship that reduces violence. Additionally, education decreases domestic violence and domestic risk factors, including alcohol and multiple unions exacerbate domestic violence. Finally, in terms of adverse health outcomes, we find that domestic violence has a non-linear impact on health injuries. At low levels of violence, the likelihood of injuries is low and injuries are generally not threatening, and as the level of violence increases, it considerably increases the probability of multiple and more serious health injuries.

We use the exchange rate appreciation of the renminbi during 2005-2007 as a natural experiment and exploit its differential impact on Chinese manufacturing firms with different export exposure. The appreciation reduced exports and imposed greater competitive pressure on exporters relative to non-exporters. In response, exporters increased innovation activities more than non-exporters. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find that the research and development expenditure of exporters increased by 11% more than that of non-exporters during the appreciation period, and the new product development of exporters increased by nearly 1.5 times more than that of non-exporters. These results highlight the important role of competition in providing incentives for firm innovation.","[Dai, Mi; Zhao, Chunming] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Yu, Miaojie] Peking Univ, CCER, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Peking University,"Zhao, CM (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Business, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",cmzhao@bnu.edu.cn,"Yu, Miao/HRC-0342-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71603027]; interdisciplinary research project Income Distribution and Labor Market of Beijing Normal University; China's National Natural Science Grant [71625007, 71573006]; China's National Social Science Grant [16AZD003]; China's Ministry of Education Grant [15JJD780001]; National Social Science Foundation of China [14ZDA082]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); interdisciplinary research project Income Distribution and Labor Market of Beijing Normal University; China's National Natural Science Grant; China's National Social Science Grant; China's Ministry of Education Grant; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"We thank David Weinstein, Eric Verhoogen, Meixin Guo, and seminar participants at Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University and Southeast University for helpful comments.

We find that public firms' patents rely more on existing knowledge, are more exploitative, and are less likely in new technology classes, while private firms' patents are broader in scope and more exploratory. We investigate whether these strategies are due to differences in firm information environments, CEO risk preferences, firm life cycles, corporate acquisition policies, or investment horizons between these two groups of firms. Our evidence suggests that the shorter investment horizon associated with public equity markets is a key explanatory factor.","[Gao, Huasheng] Fudan Univ, Fanhai Int Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hsu, Po-Hsuan] Univ Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Kai] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Fudan University; University of Hong Kong; University of British Columbia,"Gao, HS (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Fanhai Int Sch Finance, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",huashenggao@fudan.edu.cn; paulhsu@hku.hk; kai.li@sauder.ubc.ca,"Hsu, Po-Hsuan/ABG-3134-2021; Li, Kai/AAJ-8376-2021; Gao, Huasheng/L-6061-2015; Hsu, Po-Hsuan/F-4455-2011","Li, Kai/0000-0002-3845-3895; Gao, Huasheng/0000-0001-6277-4341; Hsu, Po-Hsuan/0000-0001-6234-8289","Research Grants Council in Hong Kong [17500015]; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC Grant) [435-2013-0023]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1623684] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Research Grants Council in Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC Grant); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We are grateful for helpful comments from an anonymous referee, Andres Almazan, Julian Atanassov, Jan Bena, Thomas Chemmanur, Guoli Chen, Bill Kerr, Tomislav Ladika, Alexander Ljunqgvist, Paul Malatesta (the editor), Gustavo Manso, Ron Masulis, Hernan Ortiz-Molina, Neslihan Ozkan, Ivan Png, Jay Ritter, Morten Sorensen, Xuan Tian, Cheng-Wei Wu, Ting Xu, Yu Yuan, Alminas Zaldokas, seminar participants at Boston University, Harvard Business School, Nanyang Technological University, National Chengchi University, Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, University of Bristol, University of British Columbia, University of Exeter, University of Hong Kong, University of International Business and Economics, University of Oklahoma, and conference participants at the 2013 Conference on the Theories and Practices of Securities and Financial Markets, the 2014 Financial Management Association Asia Pacific Conference, the 2014 International Conference on Corporate Finance and Financial Markets, and the 2014 China International Conference in Finance.

Since the mid-1990s, however, wage inequality has been falling. Since most trade models suggest that output prices can affect factor prices, this paper explores the relationship between output prices and wage inequality. A Salter-Swan trade model with firm heterogeneity driven by variations in the relative price of tradable relative to non-tradable goods can explain the decline in wage inequality. The paper compares this model's predictions with Mexican inequality statistics using data on output prices, census data, and quarterly household survey data. In spite of the model's simplicity, the model's predictions match Mexican variables reasonably well during the years when wage inequality fell.","[Halliday, Timothy] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Econ, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Halliday, Timothy] Univ Hawaii Econ Res Org, Honolulu, HI USA; [Halliday, Timothy; Robertson, Raymond] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Lederman, Daniel] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Robertson, Raymond] Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; IZA Institute Labor Economics; The World Bank; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Bush School of Government & Public Service,"Robertson, R (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Robertson, R (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Bush Sch Govt & Publ Affairs, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",robertson@tamu.edu,"Halliday, Timothy/F-5032-2010","Robertson, Raymond/0000-0002-0989-7673",Regional Studies Program of the Office of the Chief Economist for Latin America; Caribbean of The World Bank Group,Regional Studies Program of the Office of the Chief Economist for Latin America; Caribbean of The World Bank Group,"The authors thank seminar participants at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Tulane University, Texas A&M, and the Authors' Workshop for the World Bank's Latin American and Caribbean Regional Study on Wage Inequality Trends, especially William Cline, Caroline Freund, Joseph Francois, Arvind Subramanian, Rafael Dix-Carneiro, Joana Silva, Julian Messina, and Augusto de la Torre.

Models in the literature often employ risk perceptions as explanatory variables without addressing the potential endogeneity of the perceived risk. We examine the implications of ignoring endogeneity in this context, using an application to both drinking water choices and expenditures and perceived health risks. Our data are from an Internet-based cross-Canada survey that employs a novel interactive risk ladder to elicit mortality risk perceptions relating to water. We employ two fundamentally different methods to assess the impact of risk perceptions on behavior: an analysis of expenditures on alternate water sources and a model of proportional choice of water sources. Results suggest the presence of averting behavior with respect to perceived mortality risks and that the estimated effect of water risks is greater than 3 times higher when using approaches that correct for endogeneity compared to models that do not.","[Lloyd-Smith, Patrick; Schram, Craig; Adamowicz, Wiktor] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Dupont, Diane] Brock Univ, Dept Econ, 500 Glenridge Ave, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada",University of Alberta; Brock University,"Lloyd-Smith, P (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada.",lloydsmi@ualberta.ca,"Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/ABE-4463-2020","Lloyd-Smith, Patrick/0000-0002-0786-0877; Adamowicz, Wiktor/0000-0002-7634-2985",Canadian Water Network,Canadian Water Network,Thanks to Shelby Gerking for comments on an earlier version of this work.

Theories of reference-dependent preferences, such as Prospect Theory, imply that outcomes that are just below or just above a reference point are evaluated differently. Consistent with the Prospect Theory value function, we find that satisfaction as a function of relative performance (the difference between a runner's finishing time goal and her actual finishing time) exhibits loss aversion and diminishing sensitivity in both predictions of and actual experienced satisfaction. However, in contrast to Prospect Theory, we observe that loss aversion is partially driven by a discontinuity or jump at the reference point. In addition, we find that a runner's time goal as well as their previous marathon times simultaneously impact runner satisfaction, providing support for the impact of multiple reference points on satisfaction.","[Markle, Alex] Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, 441 East Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Wu, George; White, Rebecca] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Sackett, Aaron] Univ St Thomas, Opus Coll Business, Mail MCH 316,2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Fordham University; University of Chicago; University of St Thomas Minnesota,"Markle, A (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Gabelli Sch Business, 441 East Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",amarkle@fordham.edu; wu@ChicagoBooth.edu; rebecca.white@ChicagoBooth.edu; sackett@stthomas.edu,"Song, Bohui/HTO-3482-2023; Wu, George/JCE-1302-2023; Sackett, Aaron/S-5517-2019","Paulino Aguiar, Jevanildo/0000-0003-4689-230X",,,,,103,41,44,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

Previous research has intensively utilized the textual analysis of news and other firm-related documents in volatility prediction models. It has been demonstrated that the news may be related to abnormal stock price behavior subsequent to their dissemination. However, previous studies to date have tended to focus on linear regression methods in predicting volatility. Here, we show that non-linear models can be effectively employed to explain the residual variance of the stock price. Moreover, we use meta-learning approach to simulate the decision-making process of various investors. The results suggest that this approach significantly improves the prediction accuracy of abnormal stock return volatility. The fact that the length of news articles is more important than news sentiment in predicting stock return volatility is another important finding. Notably, we show that Rotation forest performs particularly well in terms of both the accuracy of abnormal stock return volatility and the performance on imbalanced volatility data.","[Myskova, Renata; Hajek, Petr; Olej, Vladimir] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Mysková, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",renata.myskova@upce.cz,"Hajek, Petr/JYQ-5812-2024; Myskova, Renata/HLP-5625-2023","Hajek, Petr/0000-0001-5579-1215;",scientific research project of the Czech Sciences Foundation [16-19590S],scientific research project of the Czech Sciences Foundation,This work was supported by the scientific research project of the Czech Sciences Foundation Grant No: 16-19590S.

We show that mark-to-market adjustments on cash flow hedges are inversely related to future cash flows and that investors underestimate the extent of this inverse relation. Our evidence supports the notion that incomplete information on value relevant parameters makes it difficult for investors to accurately predict the effects of current cash flow hedge adjustments on future cash flows. Our results are also consistent with the evidence that investors have limited attention such that information, particularly information that is difficult to discern, is not fully reflected in stock prices.

We document several new facts on product reallocation. First, every quarter around 8 percent of products are reallocated in the economy, and the entry and exit of products are prevalent among different types of firms. Second, most reallocation of products occurs within the boundaries of the firm. The entries and exits of firms only make a small contribution in the overall creation and destruction of products. Third, product reallocation is strongly pro-cyclical and declined by more than 25 percent during the Great Recession. This cyclical pattern is almost entirely explained by a decline in within firm reallocation. Motivated by these facts, we study the causes and consequences of reallocation within incumbent firms. As predicted by Schumpeterian growth theories, the rate of product reallocation strongly depends on the innovation efforts of the firms and has important implications for revenue growth, improvements in products' quality, and productivity dynamics. Our estimates suggest that the decline in product reallocation through these margins has contributed greatly to the slow growth experienced after the Great Recession. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using a theoretical model, we show that considering remittances from one's child as an insurance asset can reverse the usual negative relationship between disease prevalence and educational investment. This prediction confirms the results of an empirical study conducted on data compiled from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) database for 12 sub-Sahara African countries for children aged between 7 and 22-years-old. Using regional HIV prevalence as a measure of health risk, we find that the 'sign of the slope' between health risk and the enrolment of children is not constant. Splitting the data based on expected remittance patterns (for example rural versus urban), we obtain that the effect is most likely driven by household characteristics related to child income appropriation.","[Bourles, Renaud] Ecole Cent Marseille, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Bourles, Renaud; Ventelou, Bruno; Woode, Maame Esi] EHESS, Marseille, France; [Ventelou, Bruno; Woode, Maame Esi] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Ventelou, Bruno; Woode, Maame Esi] INSERM, SESSTIM, UMR 912, Marseille, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Woode, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool Liverpool Sch Trop Med, Pembroke Pl, Liverpool L3 5QA, Merseyside, England.",maame.woode@lstmed.ac.uk,"Bourlès, Renaud/AAJ-3766-2020; Woode, Maame Esi/ABB-1374-2021","Bourlès, Renaud/0000-0001-9537-1258; Woode, Maame Esi/0000-0001-9138-8853",A*MIDEX project SANTEMED - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02],A*MIDEX project SANTEMED - Investissements d'Avenir French Government program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work has been completed thanks to the support of the A*MIDEX project SANTEMED (n ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02) funded by the Investissements d'Avenir French Government program, managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR).",,38,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

It has come to denote a high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty. Following the industrial revolution and subsequent rise of scientific management in the twentieth century, the use of quantitative tools for optimization (e.g., linear programming) became popular first in the military during World War II and later in industry. While useful for short-term closed problems (e.g., production and distribution planning and process control), they were found inadequate for longer term strategic planning where risk and uncertainty prevail. In the latter half of the twentieth century, various qualitative approaches for analyzing the external environment, the industry, and the firm were introduced including SWOT analysis, scenario planning, five forces model, industrial organization model, resource-based model, contingency theory, stakeholder model, balanced scorecard, blue ocean, and sustainability. The early years of the twenty-first century have already been full of perils and uncertainty on many fronts including the global economy, terrorism, and environmental concerns. New rigorous quantitative approaches that build on numerous disciplines including economics, optimization, scenario planning and risk management and advancements in science and technology are needed. Risk-Constrained Optimization (TM) (RCO) is one such approach that warrants further investigation. Rather than seek optimal solutions, RCO seeks to avoid catastrophe and functions more as a filter to locate robust solutions in safe regions by testing them against various kinds of risk.","[Cleaves, Gerard W.] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Management & Entrepreneurship Dept, Teaneck, NJ 07666 USA",Fairleigh Dickinson University,"Cleaves, GW (通讯作者)，Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Management & Entrepreneurship Dept, Teaneck, NJ 07666 USA.",gcleaves@fdu.edu,,,,,,,30,0,0,1,13,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-58589-5; 978-3-319-58588-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,3,13,,10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_1,0.0,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL0QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446372200001,0

Research methods used in the study include the systematic and logical analysis of scientific literature and synthesis.","[Crnjar, Kristina] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Crnjar, K (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management, Primorska 42, Opatija 51000, Croatia.",kcrnjar@fthm.hr,"Črnjar, Kristina/S-9155-2018","Crnjar, Kristina/0000-0002-7137-4232",University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 2/17],University of Rijeka,"This paper has been financially supported by the University of Rijeka, for the project ZP UNIRI 2/17.",,11,3,3,1,2,KNOWLEDGE E,DUBAI,"OFFICE 4402, X2 TOWER, JLT, PO BOX 488239, DUBAI, 00000, U ARAB EMIRATES",2518-668X,,,KNE SOC SCI,,,2018,,,,,,,145,156,,10.18502/kss.v3i10.3535,0.0,,,12,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7SJ,,gold,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455399000009,0

However, no research comprehensively assesses the sensitivity of empirical results in corporate finance to different measures of firm size. This paper fills this hole by providing empirical evidence for a measurement effect in the size effect. In particular, we examine the influences of employing different proxies (total assets, total sales, and market capitalization) of firm size in 20 prominent areas in empirical corporate finance research. We highlight several empirical implications. First, in most areas of corporate finance the coefficients of firm size measures are robust in sign and statistical significance. Second, the coefficients on regressors other than firm size often change sign and significance when different size measures are used. Unfortunately, this suggests that some previous studies are not robust to different firm size proxies. Third, the goodness of fit measured by R-squared also varies with different size measures, suggesting that some measures are more relevant than others in different situations. Fourth, different proxies capture different aspects of firm size, and thus have different implications. Therefore, the choice of size measures needs both theoretical and empirical justification. Finally, our empirical assessment provides guidance to empirical corporate finance researchers who must use firm size measures in their work. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to investigate in a dynamic agrifood market if entrepreneurial orientation enhances innovation adoption and generation and if both of these actions enhance product innovation and, eventually, farm revenues of vegetable fanners in West Java, Indonesia. The findings demonstrate that entrepreneurial orientation enhances innovation adoption and generation, which in turn enhance product innovation. Finally, product innovation enhances farm revenues. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of innovation in facilitating entrepreneurially oriented farmers to perform better when facing a dynamic market. Entrepreneurial orientation enables farmers to innovate by taking risks to anticipate future demand, through either adoption of available innovations or generation of their own innovations, and both options result in new or improved products and eventually enhanced farm revenues.","[Etriya, Etriya; Wubben, Emiel F.

Equipping them to be useful professionals in the future, or even specializing in sustainability-oriented careers, requires raising their awareness of the state of the world in environmental, societal, political, and business terms. A curriculum needs to get them acquainted with what the world needs to reach a more fruitful future, as well as the strategies that the business sector can pursue for that purpose.

The reason is that they over-emphasize the strategic importance of intangibles and ignore that of complementary local assets. Taking complementary local assets into account makes it possible to understand why EMNEs are able to finance their intangible-buying sprees and, often with the help of their governments, to swap market access for technology. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper based on the bundling model (JIBS 2009) and backed by the case histories of four EMNEs. Findings The author shows that EMNEs have much better prospects vis-a-vis established MNEs than generally thought in Western Europe and the USA and that they will become serious competitors. Originality/value This is, as far as the author knows, the first explanation of why EMNEs have the bargaining power and the resources necessary to swap or buy technology from established MNEs.","[Hennart, Jean-Francois] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Hennart, Jean-Francois] Politecnico Milano, Dipartimento Ingn Gest, Milan, Italy",Tilburg University; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Hennart, JF (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tilburg, Netherlands.;Hennart, JF (通讯作者)，Politecnico Milano, Dipartimento Ingn Gest, Milan, Italy.",j.f.hennart@uvt.nl,,"HENNART, JEAN-FRANCOIS MARIE ANDRE'/0000-0001-6737-8620",,,,,56,13,15,3,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Method Coal-workers of a coal conveying workshop of a heat power station were chosen as objectives. The incidence of coal-worker's pneumoconiosis was predicted by logistic non-linear regression model using the concentrations of the respirable coal dust that the workers exposed to and their exposure durations. Furthermore, a practical table of the relationship between the incidence probability of coal-worker's pneumoconiosis and exposure situation was created by using R programming language. Results It was found that if these coal workers exposed to the respirable coal dust of the current concentration for 5 or 10 years, the risk of coal-worker's pneumoconiosis would be between 10(-5) and 10(-6), and for 20 or 30 years, it would be between 10(-3) and 10(-2). Assuming that they exposed to coal dust of this concentration for 30 years, the risk would exceed the acceptable risk level and measures should be taken. Conclusion In this study, a practical quantitative approach was proposed to assess the risk of coal-worker's pneumoconiosis caused by coal dust exposure. Based on the results, it showed that as the risk management target, the concentration and exposure duration should be well controlled to reduce the risk of coal-worker's pneumoconiosis. This method could be applied in evaluations of occupational disease hazard in construction projects and help to control and manage the risk of coal-worker's pneumoconiosis.","[Huang, Deyin; Li, Minyan; Zhang, Qian] Tianjin Bohai Chem Ind Grp Co Ltd, Inst Occupat Hlth, Tianjin 300051, Peoples R China; [Chen, Feiran] Tianjin Med Univ, Tianjin 300070, Peoples R China",Tianjin Medical University,"Huang, DY (通讯作者)，Tianjin Bohai Chem Ind Grp Co Ltd, Inst Occupat Hlth, Tianjin 300051, Peoples R China.",,"Huang, De-Yin/J-3458-2014",,,,,,3,0,0,0,2,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-574-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2018,66.0,,,,,,435,440,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL1SI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000448284700068,0

Several studies worldwide say that a reliable risk management ensures fewer negative surprises, a higher financial stability of the company and provides opportunities for achieving profits. The essence of this article is, based on our empirical research realised in 2017, to assess the financial risks perceived by the owners and managers of the SMEs in Slovakia. Based on the results, we found out the financial risks were considered the second most serious risks that negatively affect the entrepreneurial environment of the SMEs. The selected statistical methods and tools used show that the perceived financial risks do not depend on the company size but they are dependent on the duration of their business in the Slovak conditions. The overall research results emphasise the importance to deal with the entrepreneurial risk assessment in the SMEs not only in Slovakia but also in other countries.","[Hudakova, Maria; Masar, Matej; Buganova, Katarina] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Zilina, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Hudakova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Zilina, Slovakia.",maria.hudakova@fbi.uniza.sk; matej.masar@fbi.uniza.sk; katarina.buganova@fbi.uniza.sk,"Buganova, Katarina/AAD-5278-2020; Masár, Matej/A-6373-2019; Masár, Matej/P-2763-2019; Hudakova, Maria/S-6206-2017","Buganova, Katarina/0000-0002-0596-5229; Masár, Matej/0000-0003-4189-2984; Hudakova, Maria/0000-0002-0756-0962",Scientific Grant Agency: The project VEGA [1/0560/16]; KEGA [030ZU-4/2018],Scientific Grant Agency: The project VEGA; KEGA,Publication of this paper was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency: The project VEGA No. 1/0560/16 - Risk Management of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises in Slovakia as Prevention of Company Crises.

The introduction of these schemes poses serious challenges to smallholders. One such certification scheme is the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which uses certification to increase equitable and sustainable production of palm oil. This study calculates upfront and recurrent costs and monetary benefits of RSPO certification for the Amanah Independent Oil Palm Smallholders Association in Ukui District, Indonesia. Survey and interview data was collected between 2013 and 2015. Results show that upfront costs of certification were 86 euro per hectare. Furthermore, despite generating up to 21% higher revenues from sales, certification created up to an 8% loss of net income per hectare on average per smallholder in the first year after certification, compared to the situation prior to certification. To motivate smallholders for RSPO certification, the economic performance of certified oil palm smallholders should be improved. This can result from further yield increases, a guaranteed premium price or the sales of GreenPalm certificates to provide additional income.","[Hutabarat, Sakti; Slingerland, Maja; Rietberg, Petra] Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Hutabarat, Sakti] Univ Riau, Fac Agr, Dept Agribusiness, Jl HR Soebrantas Km 12 5,Kampus Binawidya, Pekanbaru 28293, Indonesia; [Dries, Liesbeth] Wageningen Univ, Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Universitas Riau; Wageningen University & Research,"Slingerland, M (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Plant Prod Syst, Droevendaalsesteeg 1, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.",maja.slingerland@wur.nl,,"Dries, Liesbeth/0000-0002-1061-1441","interdisciplinary research and education fund (INREF) of Wageningen University, the Netherlands; RSPO","interdisciplinary research and education fund (INREF) of Wageningen University, the Netherlands(Netherlands Government); RSPO","This research was conducted under the SUSPENSE programme funded by the interdisciplinary research and education fund (INREF) of Wageningen University, the Netherlands and the SEnSOR programme funded by RSPO.

Drawing on two theories with some similar and opposing perspectives, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of three components of customer experience (i.e. utilitarian experience, hedonic experience and relational experience) and customers' intention on behavior within the context of the BVN policy implemented by the Nigerian apex bank. Design/methodology/approach Data emerged from one of the most populous districts in south-eastern Nigeria. Participants were recruited by mall-intercept. Out of the 283 participants approached, 246 participated but only 82.9 percent were valid for analysis. After subjecting data to statistical screening to confirm its suitability for parametric statistical analysis and examining data for the potential effects of common method variance as well as sample representativeness, a partial least squares structural equation modelling technique and the Preacher and Hayes bootstrapping procedures were utilized to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings Based on data obtained from Nigerian bank customers, the paper demonstrated that the customer loyalty arising from the implementation of a government policy is determined more by hedonic experience, followed by relational experience and very much less by utilitarian experience. Findings also indicate that the relationship between the components of customer experience and customer loyalty is complementarily mediated by intention to open new account(s). Research limitations/implications Though the theoretical grounding of the paper strongly supports the study design, the authors strongly recommend that future research should examine customer experience-customer behavior models in situations of policy implementation with longitudinal design. Additionally, since intention to open new account(s) is a complementary mediator of the links between the components of customer experience and customer loyalty, there is need for future researchers to integrate other mediators into the conceptual framework that the authors examined in this paper. Practical implications This paper cautions that whilst the research findings play out effectively in situations where the benefits of the introduced policy and the consumers' belief in the good intent of the policy are congruent and customers are susceptible to the manipulations of the social class leading to absence of volitional control; firms should not be deceived into relying too heavily on this kind of loyalty because it is situational and consequently promiscuous. Nevertheless, deploying more resources to seamlessly meet the needs of customers in such situations is counter-productive for service organizations. Social implications Based on the findings, it has come to the fore that consumers will be at the receiving end of a government policy poorly implemented by service organizations. When such policies are rolled out therefore, governments should enforce operational modalities that will forestall potential negative experiences that consumers could possibly encounter. Originality/value By examining the effects of three components of customer experience and intention to open new account(s) on customer loyalty within the context of BVN implementation in an emerging banking sector, the authors contribute to the broad stream of literature that focuses on the effect of customer experience on company bottom-line. The strength of this contribution is based on the premise that this paper draw on the similarities and opposing orientations of two theories to uncover these effects. The authors show that the effects of the three components of customer experience on customer loyalty is different from the results of previous research because of the unique perspective adopted in this paper.","[Izogo, Ernest Emeka] Ebonyi State Univ, Dept Mkt, Abakaliki, Nigeria; [Jayawardhena, Chanaka] Univ Hull, Dept Mkt & Business Strategy, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England; [Kalu, Alexanda Ogbonna Udu] Michael Okpara Univ Agr, Dept Mkt, Umuahia, Nigeria",University of Hull,"Izogo, EE (通讯作者)，Ebonyi State Univ, Dept Mkt, Abakaliki, Nigeria.",ernyemmy@gmail.com,"Izogo, Ernest Emeka/AAP-8713-2020; Jayawardhena, Chanaka/ABC-5225-2020","Izogo, Ernest Emeka/0000-0001-6226-8836; Jayawardhena, Chanaka/0000-0003-0928-9835",,,,,84,5,5,2,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

Using the Tapio decoupling index, Shanghai's decoupling condition of economic growth from pressure on natural resources and the environment is analysed. The study shows that Shanghai's economic development is gradually putting itself out of the pattern of high consumption and heavy pollution, with the weakening but still existing dependence of the economic growth on natural resources and the environment.

However, their analysis was based on the high gasoline prices forecasted at the time; after their analysis, expected gasoline prices fell by 25 percent. We augment the agencies' benefit-cost framework and use recent evidence on behavioral responses to gasoline prices to estimate the effects of low gasoline prices on benefits and costs. Accounting for consumer changes in miles traveled and vehicle choice, we find that the 25 percent reduction in future gasoline prices reduces the value of fuel savings by 22 percent. Because of consumer changes in vehicle choice, lower gasoline prices raise compliance costs by about $0.5 billion per year, or about 9 percent of the total net benefits of the program. Accounting for these responses does not overturn the agencies' initial conclusions that benefits exceed casts.","[Linn, Joshua; Mcconnell, Virginia; Leard, Benjamin] Resources Future RFF, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Resources for the Future,"Linn, J (通讯作者)，Resources Future RFF, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",linn@rff.org,"Linn, Joshua/AAT-6768-2021",,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Evidence on the effects of country health expenditures on longevity is mixed. We evaluate the heterogeneity in country health expenditure effects throughout the life expectancy distribution worldwide during 2006-11 using quantile regression and an assembled dataset on 175 countries that includes both historic as well as recent data on life expectancy. Our goal is to evaluate the effects of health expenditures across quantiles of the country-level life expectancy distribution to understand whether increasing expenditures are associated with changes in longevity disparities between countries. We find significant heterogeneity in expenditure effects on life expectancy. The largest returns from increased spending are at the left margin of the life expectancy distribution. The results suggest that increasing health spending in countries with low life expectancy may have important returns to life expectancy and significantly diminish global inequalities in longevity and development by reducing the spread of the world's life expectancy distribution.

To establish this link between research on experimental asset markets and social psychology the authors use a unique approach that combines a questionnaire designed to assess individuals' degree of extraversion and neuroticism and an experimental asset market to assess individual financial decision making. The dataset combines 364 undergraduate business students' questionnaire responses and their trading behavior in the asset market. The authors find that extraversion and neuroticism significantly influence individuals' behavior in the experimental asset market. Specifically, more extraverted individuals pay higher prices for financial assets and they buy more financial assets when assets are overpriced than less extraverted individuals do. More neurotic individuals hold less risky assets in their financial portfolios than less neurotic individuals do. Although a large part of the explanatory power appears to be driven by gender differences, the authors still find significant impact of extraversion and neuroticism after controlling for gender effects. The study findings suggest that further research on financial markets could benefit from including personality of market participants as a crucial explanatory factor.","[Oehler, Andreas; Wedlich, Florian; Horn, Matthias] Bamberg Univ, Kaerntenstr 7, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany; [Wendt, Stefan] Reykjavik Univ, Reykjavik, Iceland",Otto Friedrich University Bamberg; Reykjavik University,"Oehler, A (通讯作者)，Bamberg Univ, Kaerntenstr 7, D-96045 Bamberg, Germany.",andreas.oehler@uni-bamberg.de,"Wendt, Stefan/ABG-8687-2021; Horn, Matthias/AAT-7153-2021; Oehler, Andreas/GQH-8718-2022","Wendt, Stefan/0000-0002-9192-6989; Horn, Matthias/0000-0002-0032-908X; Oehler, Andreas/0000-0002-2858-3370; Wedlich, Florian/0000-0001-9867-8319",,,,,94,83,89,2,73,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

While the sample was the student of X AP-2 class as experimental class uses the learning cell strategy and the students of X PM-2 class as control class using expository strategy. The result of this study showed that Z testing of pre-test with nominal alpha=0.05, Z(score) = 0.12 and Z(table) = 1.96 hence Z(score) < Z(table). Therefore Ho is accepted and Ha is rejected, it means that there was significant difference of pretest result between the learning cell class and expository class. This result shows there was significant similar competence of both classes before the using of both strategies. The result of the posttest showed that Z(score) 3.21 and Z(table) 1.96 in nominal alpha 0.05 hence Z(score) > Z(table), therefore Ho is rejected and Ha is accepted. These mean that there was significant difference result of economic learning between student using active learning the learning cell strategy and the student using expository strategy. Based on the result of study, it can be concluded that the learning uses both strategy; learning cell and expository, give the same impact in improving student learning. However the learning cell strategy gives bigger impact in students learning outcomes than expository strategy.

The study finds that there is high volatility of real effective exchange rate. It also reveals that real effective exchange rate is negatively and significantly related to economic growth. This finding suggests that exchange rate volatility is harmful to the growth of the Nigerian economy. This study recommends that government should constantly seek to maintain a stable exchange rate, increase its expenditure, particularly capital expenditure and implement sustainable reforms to increase the depth of the financial sector.","[Oloyede, John Adebayo; Fapetu, Oladapo] Ekiti State Univ, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria",,"Oloyede, JA (通讯作者)，Ekiti State Univ, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,INTL INST SOCIAL & ECONOMIC SCI,PRAGUE,"TREBESOVSKA 2038/14, PRAGUE, 193 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",2336-6044,,978-80-87927-53-3,PROC ECON FINAN CONF,,,2018,,,,,,,148,157,,10.20472/EFC.2018.009.011,0.0,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BO2CN,,Bronze,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000505163200011,0

Our findings suggest that irrespective of the dataset and measure used, disability is disproportionally more common among the poor, the elderly and rural areas in the country. Hence, Indonesian policies on poverty reduction, population ageing, and rural development should pay particular attention to how they reach and affect persons with disabilities. Our research further reveals that the gender gap in disability is highly sensitive to measurement issues with different datasets and measures reaching different conclusions about the size and direction of the gap.","[Priebe, Jan] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany; [Priebe, Jan] TNP2K, Jakarta, Indonesia",University of Gottingen,"Priebe, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",jpriebe@uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,44,5,8,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

We show that the value of cash increases as a result of good country-level governance and we provide mixed evidence that good firm-level governance also increases the value of cash. Our analysis also confirms that the payment of dividends adds to the value of cash. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The variety, velocity, veracity, and volume of a typical twentieth-century business data and traditional technology are contrasted against the twenty-first-century business data and innovative technology. The final hypothesis is that big data revolution intertwined with analytics is an innovation that is transforming business. Therefore, there is a need for more businesses to adopt and benefit from big data technology. After close and critical review of big data technology intertwined with analytics, it is argued that a fruitful approach would be the development of a suitable Information Technology and Computer Science academic courses that would reflect big data technology.","[Sheriff, Mohamed K.] Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Adm Sci Dept, Vancouver, BC V6B 2P6, Canada",Fairleigh Dickinson University,"Sheriff, MK (通讯作者)，Fairleigh Dickinson Univ, Adm Sci Dept, Vancouver, BC V6B 2P6, Canada.",msheriff@fdu.edu,,,,,,,19,4,5,1,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-58589-5; 978-3-319-58588-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2018,,,,,,,79,91,,10.1007/978-3-319-58589-5_6,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BL0QR,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000446372200006,0

Through the identification of company clusters with typical sustainable procurement approaches, the paper contributes to the supply chain management literature. A questionnaire is applied to gather data amongst Dutch Food and Beverage companies from which 62 could be used for the analyses (effective response rate 28.9%). Cluster analysis revealed four types of companies with distinctive sustainable procurement relationships: market relationships (arms-length), sustainability leader, one-sided sustainability (interested supplier but less interested buyer), and inconclusive sustainability (buyer and suppliers only made a start). As the implementation of sustainable procurement remains low in practice, insights from this study are important for managers.","[van der Werlf, Suzanne; Trienekens, Jacques; Hagelaar, Geoffrey] Wageningen Univ, Business Management & Org Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Pascucci, Stefano] Univ Exeter, Business Sch, Penryn Campus,G16 SERSF Bldg, Penryn, Cornwall, England",Wageningen University & Research; University of Exeter,"Trienekens, J; Hagelaar, G (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Business Management & Org Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",jacques.trienckens@wur.nl; gcoffrcy.hagelaarr@wur.nl,"trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023",,,,,,81,4,4,4,29,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

The presentation analyses the various systems of risk management tools in the agricultural policy of the EU, the US and the Czech Republic. In the US the support of risk management tools such as the crop and income insurance is the most important part of the policy.

The present study monitored electrical brain responses of participants while they were presented with existing TV and radio adverts with strategic, tactical, or no music. Adverts with strategic music were liked more, found more familiar, and more impactful for radio than TV adverts. The neural correlates of music usage were characterized by the beta- and gamma-band oscillations, especially in the frontal regions, reflecting an enhanced preferential engagement. Further, adverts with strategic music were associated with a larger frontal asymmetry, suggesting for a potentially positive affective response. Furthermore, we observed an increased and sustained neural effect of strategic versus tactical music use in radio adverts.

If a sovereign becomes distressed, the collateral mechanism impairs and banks are suddenly facing significant liquidity calls. Basel III's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) protects banks against unexpected liquidity calls, but currently excludes sovereign distress. Thus, all banks fulfilling the LCR are still exposed to a liquidity risk stemming from distressed sovereign debt and materializing through the collateral channel. Our paper shows that this unaddressed risk can translate into a system-wide liquidity shock. To gauge the potential damage caused by such a shock, we develop a model based on banks' home sovereign exposures and a bundle of simplifying assumptions in which sovereign distress triggers bank distress. Our model describes how deteriorating sovereign collateral can lead to an overall liquidity squeeze and non-compliance with Basel III liquidity standards. As this risk is too material to be neglected, we propose an alternative version of the LCR, LCR+, which includes the liquidity impact of sovereign distress.

Our method remedies the shortcomings of existing methods and has some desirable properties such as time-reversion consistency and sub period additivity. Our decomposition integrates the existing methods of growth-redistribution decomposition and sector-based decomposition, because it allows us to decompose the change in poverty into growth and redistribution components for each group (e.g., regions or sectors) in the economy. Our decomposition works well in cases where only partial data are available for some periods. It is also flexible and can be extended to have the following six components: population shift, within-region redistribution, between-region redistribution, nominal growth, inflation, and methodological change components. The empirical application of the six-way decomposition to the Philippines for the period 1985-2009 shows that important policies for poverty reduction may differ across regions. For example, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao would need growth-enhancing policies, whereas Eastern Visayas would need policies to improve the income distribution. Our decomposition method has a wide applicability and may complement the poverty profile approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In doing so, it is assumed that convergence of the two elicitation approaches is an all or nothing proposition; i.e., the RP and SP data are either consistent with each other or they are not. The purpose of this paper is to propose an alternative framework that allows for possible divergence among individuals in terms the consistency between their RP and SP responses. In particular, we suggest the use of a latent class approach to segment the population into two groups. The first group has RP and SP responses that are internally consistent, while the remaining group exhibits some form of inconsistent preferences. An EM algorithm is employed in an empirical application that draws on the Alberta and Saskatchewan moose hunting data sets used in earlier combined RP and SP exercises. The empirical results suggest that somewhere between one-third and one-half the sample exhibits consistent preferences. We also examine differences in welfare estimates drawn from the two classes.","[Jeon, Hocheol] Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; [Herriges, Joseph A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr,110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Iowa State University; Michigan State University,"Herriges, JA (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Econ, 486 W Circle Dr,110 Marshall Adams Hall, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",jah@msu.edu,,,,,,,30,5,6,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We find that the pricing of the Amihud measure is not attributable to the construction of the return-to-volume ratio intended to capture price impact, but is driven by the trading volume component. Additionally, the high-frequency price impact and spread benchmarks are priced only in January and do not explain the pricing of the trading volume component of the Amihud measure.

The sign asymmetry and size non-linearity are theoretically explained by the multiple bubbles (or periodically collapsing bubbles) and traction costs, respectively. To this end, we adopt the right-tailed unit root test (GSADF), the momentum threshold autoregressive (MTAR) and exponential smooth transition autoregressive (ESTAR) approaches in this study. Among the main results, it is found that the results of the GSADF provide statistically significant evidence for the existence of multiple bubbles of six European countries and Malaysia and Indonesia. Second, the presence of periodically collapsing bubbles is empirically verified by the MTAR test for the Czech. Republic, New Zealand and Portugal, but not for all of the Pacific Rim economies considered in this study. Third, with the exception of Malaysia, the results of the ESTAR-type tests point to the rejection of the null hypothesis of a unit root against the alternative of a globally stationary ESTAR process for all countries.","[Chen, Shyh-Wei] Tunghai Univ, Dept Int Business, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Xie, Zixiong] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Inst Resources Environm & Sustainable Dev, Dept Int Econ & Trade, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Tunghai University; Jinan University,"Xie, ZX (通讯作者)，Dept Int Econ & Trade, 601 Huangpu Ave West, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",shyhwei.chen@gmail.com; txiezixiong@jnu.edu.cn,,,Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 105-2410-H-029-002],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank the editor, Professor Hamid Beladi, and two anonymous referees of this journal for helpful comments and suggestions.

We show that Wei (2015) and Hamilton and Ruta (Environ Resour Econ 42:53-64, 2009) are in fact employing different and mutually exclusive allocation mechanisms for the economy, and this explains the differences between the respective accounting prices. Because accounting prices must be defined subject to the allocation mechanism for the economy, the prices derived in the two papers are equally valid within their respective allocation domains. Further analysis shows that if there is declining marginal product of factors, a 'Hartwick investment rule' for the model economy (set investment just equal to depletion, valued at the accounting price) will lead to declining consumption for the Wei (2015) accounting price, and increasing consumption for the Hamilton and Ruta (2009) accounting price. This result is extended to consider the accounting standards recommended in the UN SEEA (System of environmental-economic accounting 2012: central framework.

A Dynamic Panel Investigation for the OECD Countries,REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE,,,English,Article,,,,,,the energy-growth nexus; renewable energy use; panel cointegration methods; OECD,,"This paper aims to investigate the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth for 34 OECD countries, for the period 1990-2014. Using recent panel data techniques, outcomes show that increases in real GDP have a positive and statistically significant effect on renewable and non-renewable energy consumption (and vice-versa) only in the long run. In the short-run, the impacts differ according to the source of energy (energy coming from renewable or non-renewable sources). They show evidence for a bi-directional causality only between non-renewable energy consumption and GDP growth. The renewable sources are negatively influenced by an increase in the real GDP growth in the OECD sub-samples. Overall, the results validate the feed-back hypothesis in the case of non-renewable sources of energy in both, the short-run and the long-run. Regarding the renewable energy sources, findings validate the conservation hypothesis in the short-run, and the feed-back hypothesis in the long-run. As policy implications, governments should address growth and the expansion of renewable energy sector in a simultaneous way. This is possible by financing R & D investment in promising renewable technologies and related infrastructure networks in order to make renewable energy sources more competitive than fossil fuels, and also by promoting regional cooperation, development for clean-energy efficiency between countries.","[Matei, Iuliana] IESEG Paris, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Matei, Iuliana] Univ Paris 01, Paris, France",IESEG School of Management; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Matei, I (通讯作者)，IESEG Paris, Dept Econ, Paris, France.;Matei, I (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris, France.",i.matei@ieseg.fr,,,,,,,42,22,22,0,7,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

I argue that exports are an important factor to prevent currency crises that has not been frequently analyzed in the existing theoretical literature. Using the third generation model of currency crises, I derive a simple and intuitive formula that captures an economy's structural vulnerability characterized by the elasticity of exports and repayments for foreign currency denominated debt. I graphically show that the possibility of currency crisis equilibrium depends on this structural vulnerability and also analyze how this vulnerability impacts the effectiveness of monetary policy response.

How do citizens in such political systems learn about elections and develop participatory orientations? Civil society organizations can promote political socialization, yet often fail to reach those lowest in resources. This article proposes that churches constitute an often overlooked instance of civil society, one that is highly inclusive and provides frequent opportunities for interaction. Such socialization can be especially important in low-income and low-education neighborhoods, where access to media and political information through everyday social networks is more limited. A case study of a municipal election campaign in a single Brazilian city reveals that exposure to political information in church is common, especially in evangelical churches and in low-education neighborhoods. Even more frequent than partisan discussion is promotion of non-partisan civic norms encouraging citizens to cast informed votes based on non-clientelistic criteria. Those exposed to civic and partisan messages know significantly more about the local campaign and are more likely to turn out. Messages encouraging a conscientious vote boost knowledge most strongly in low-education neighborhoods, helping to equalize political information across the urban environment. This suggests that development professionals take churches seriously as sites of civic education. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The global evaluation of the ATT and the spillover parameters shifts the spotlight from the policy effect on subsidised firms to the global effect of capital subsidy policies on the targeted territory. The empirical evaluation of a policy in Italy mainly directed towards small- and medium-sized firms shows that the impact on investments, turnover and employment is positive and large, but is negative on TFP.

In the recent past, class analysis associated with Marxism has given way to models of individual rational maximization, not least because of the lack of specific findings about the effects of peasant differentiation beyond the dichotomous class conflict between peasants and landlords. Information has replaced asset distribution as the main factor affecting effective governance and service provision. According to these theories, politicians did not deliver less because they were responding to the preferences of the large landowning classes, or because seemingly competitive elections were games of rotating chairs within a single dominant class but, rather, because the voters did not have enough information about the candidates and programmes. I bring the discussion back to peasant differentiation and class endowments using the case of communal action boards in Colombia, showing how the demand for information on candidates and developmental resources matters, but is dependent on class structures. I suggest that different rural groups access, use, and manipulate information with differing aims, and that the rural middle class is a fundamental actor in the demand for public goods.","[Velasquez Ospina, Mauricio] Andes Univ, Sch Govt, Cra 1 18a-12, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Ospina, MV (通讯作者)，Andes Univ, Sch Govt, Cra 1 18a-12, Bogota, Colombia.",mvel@uniandes.edu.co,"Velasquez, Mauricio/AAL-1676-2021",,Colciencias-Colombia,"Colciencias-Colombia(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias)","I am grateful to Barbara Geddes, Ronald Rogowski, Robert Brenner, Francisco Gutierrez, Christopher Cramer, and the editors and three anonymous reviewers for this Journal for their helpful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of the paper.

This connection leads to the construction of an algorithm, called Extended Rearrangement Algorithm (ERA), that makes it possible to approximate sharp VaR bounds.

In this paper we introduce two new risk measures that generalise the Conditional Value at Risk and the Conditional Expected Shortfall in a multiple setting. The proposed risk measures aim to capture extreme tail co-movements among several multivariate connected market participants experiencing contemporaneous distress instances. Analytical expressions for the risk measures are obtained under a parametric model that postulates a joint dynamic evolution of the underlying institutions' losses and gains. We consider a multivariate Student-t version of Markov Switching models as a robust alternative to the usual multivariate Gaussian specification, accounting for heavy tails and time varying non linear correlations. An empirical application to US banks is considered to show that our model based risk measurement framework provides a better characterisation of the dynamic evolution of the overall risk of a financial system and a more complete picture of how the risk spreads among institutions.","[Bernardi, Mauro] Univ Padua, Dept Stat Sci, Padua, Italy; [Bernardi, Mauro] CNR, Ist Applicaz Calcolo Mauro Picone, Rome, Italy; [Maruotti, Antonello] Univ Southampton, Ctr Innovat & Leadership Hlth Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Maruotti, Antonello] Libera Univ Maria SS Assunta, Dipartimento Sci Econ Polit & Lingue Moderne, Rome, Italy; [Petrella, Lea] Sapienza Univ Rome, MEMOTEF Dept, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy",University of Padua; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo Mauro Picone (IAC-CNR); University of Southampton; Universita LUMSA; Sapienza University Rome,"Petrella, L (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, MEMOTEF Dept, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",lea.petrella@uniroma1.it,,"MARUOTTI, Antonello/0000-0001-8377-9950",Italian Ministry of Research PRIN; Multivariate Statistical Methods for Risk Assessment (MISURA); Carlo Giannini Research Fellowship; Centro Interuniversitario di Econometria (CIdE); UniCredit Foundation,"Italian Ministry of Research PRIN(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); Multivariate Statistical Methods for Risk Assessment (MISURA); Carlo Giannini Research Fellowship; Centro Interuniversitario di Econometria (CIdE); UniCredit Foundation","This research is supported by the Italian Ministry of Research PRIN 2013-2015, Multivariate Statistical Methods for Risk Assessment (MISURA), by the Carlo Giannini Research Fellowship, the Centro Interuniversitario di Econometria (CIdE) and UniCredit Foundation.",,76,27,31,3,31,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

Such inflation effects are known as Demand Surge effects. It is important for insurance companies to properly account for these effects when calculating insurance premiums and determining economic capital. We propose an approach to quantifying the Demand Surge effect and present an econometric model for the effect that is based on 192 catastrophe events in the United States.

After contrasting companies along their governance regime, we observe that dictatorship firms, characterized with higher number of governance provisions, are associated with more activist voting by institutional groups: ownership by mutual funds, independent investment advisors and pension funds are significantly related to greater support of shareholder proposals against poison pills. In democratic firms, characterized with lower levels of restrictions on shareholder rights ownership by various shareholder groups is not as highly correlated with support for these proposals, suggesting perhaps that shareholders use other internal channels to voice concerns. In dictatorships, we find that certain shareholders rely on annual meetings to pressure management, and that management is less likely to take action following shareholder votes. Finally, among all institutional shareholders, management seems more likely to respond favorably in the presence of ownership by public pension funds.","[Gine, Mireia] Univ Penn, WRDS, IESE Business Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Moussawi, Rabih; Sedunov, John] Villanova Univ, Finance Dept, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Moussawi, Rabih] Univ Penn, WRDS, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Navarra; IESE Business School; Villanova University; University of Pennsylvania,"Moussawi, R (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Villanova Sch Business, Finance Dept, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",gine@wharton.upenn.edu; Rabih.Moussawi@Villanova.edu; john.sedunov@villanove.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019; Moussawi, Rabih/AAA-2346-2019","Moussawi, Rabih/0000-0002-3657-4087",,,,,69,6,6,0,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0927-5398,1879-1727,,J EMPIR FINANC,J.

This study uses data from the Journeys Home survey, a large national longitudinal survey of disadvantaged Australians who were homeless or at risk of homelessness, to estimate multivariate behavioural Rasch models of the association between homelessness and food insecurity. The Journeys Home survey includes an extensive set of measures of people's circumstances that we include in our models. We also estimate dummy endogenous variable specifications. All our specifications indicate that homelessness is associated with higher (worse) food insecurity for men. We find unconditional associations in the same direction for women, but these become statistically insignificant when we include extensive sets of observed controls in our models or estimate dummy endogenous variable specifications. Finally, we investigate how homelessness is related to food consumption, meal consumption, and food expenditures. Food expenditures are negatively associated with homelessness for men in all our specifications; however, the other food outcomes for men and women do not show consistent, statistically significant associations.

Due to limited data availability, previous meta-analyses of global climate damages potentially suffered from multiple sources of coefficient and standard error bias: duplicate estimates, omitted variables, measurement error, overreliance on published estimates, dependent errors, and heteroskedasticity. To address and test for these biases, we expand on previous datasets to obtain sufficient degrees of freedom to make the necessary model adjustments, including dropping duplicate estimates and including methodological variables. Estimating the relationship between temperature and climate damages using weighted least squares with cluster-robust standard errors, we find strong evidence that duplicate and omitted variable biases flatten the relationship. However, the magnitude of the bias greatly depends on the treatment of speculative high-temperature (> 4 C) damage estimates. Replacing the DICE-2013R damage function with our preferred estimate of the temperature-damage relationship, we find a three- to four-fold increase in the 2015 SCC relative to DICE, depending on the treatment of productivity. When catastrophic impacts are also factored in, the SCC increases by four- to five-fold.","[Howard, Peter H.] NYU, Inst Policy Integr, Sch Law, Wilf Hall,139 MacDougal St,Third Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Sterner, Thomas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",New York University; University of Gothenburg,"Howard, PH (通讯作者)，NYU, Inst Policy Integr, Sch Law, Wilf Hall,139 MacDougal St,Third Floor, New York, NY 10012 USA.",HowardP@mercury.law.nyu.edu; thomas.sterner@economics.gu.se,"Sterner, Thomas/AGZ-2537-2022",,,,,,81,106,110,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Several main findings emerge from the analysis. First, with an inelastic labor supply, a rise in the fraction of patent collateral is beneficial to both innovations and economic growth. Second, when labor supply is inelastic, a rise in either the foreign interest rate or the fraction of borrowed R&D funding is harmful to innovations and economic growth. Third, our numerical results show that the above two findings are robust when labor is supplied elastically. Finally, our numerical results indicate that, regardless of whether labor supply is inelastic or elastic, the government can implement an optimal patent breadth policy to maximize the social welfare level. Our numerical results also point out that this optimal patent breadth will decrease in response to a reduction in the foreign interest rate, a rise in the fraction of the collateral, and a reduction in the fraction of borrowed R&D labor costs.","[Huang, Wei-Chi; Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong; Chen, Ping-Ho] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Sun Yat Sen University; Feng Chia University,"Chen, PH (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",97258503@nccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,42,10,10,3,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

To this end, we employ the recent foreign bank ownership dataset of Claessens and Van Horen ( 2014) and measure performance as profit efficiency using the alternative profit function. Results from the Battese and Coelli ( 1995) stochastic frontier analysis model show that creditor rights exert a positive effect on efficiency that strengthens for foreign banks. On the other hand, information sharing exerts a negative effect on profit efficiency which strengthens for foreign banks. The results for information sharing show some variability across different levels of development of the host economy. Moreover, the transparency of the host economy moderates the effect of creditor rights and information sharing on foreign bank efficiency. We also examine the effect of institutional distance in creditor rights and information sharing between the home and host economy on foreign bank efficiency. The effect of creditor rights institutional distance on foreign bank efficiency is negative, while it turns positive for information sharing. These findings highlight the importance of strong creditor rights for foreign bank performance and are useful for both regulators in host economies and foreign bank managers.

I sell otherwise identical gift cards while varying the MBI and test between truthful bidding and bid shading. Truthful bidding is rejected.

We develop a model in which the manager of a bank determines both debt maturity structure (short-term vs. long-term debt) and asset composition (cash vs. risky assets). To address the incongruence of goals between the bank manager and the bank stakeholders, in our model we assume that the manager receives only a proportion of the bank's profit in her pay schedule. We demonstrate that the optimal choices of the manager regarding debt maturity and asset structure lead to socially inefficient (second-best) outcomes because the manager internalizes only part of the social benefit. We then study the implications of the NSFR requirement on the manager's choices and demonstrate that the NSFR requirement can enhance social welfare and reach an efficient (first-best) outcome, if a sufficiently low weight of short-term debt as available stable funding is required by regulation. Further, we find that under the same conditions the NSFR requirement reduces banks' use of short-term financing and thus increases the probability of banks' survival and profits from the ex ante point of view, while it decreases banks' profits from the ex post point of view, since it reduces the threshold for banks' survival. Our main results have some interesting empirical implications: under certain conditions, the NSFR requirement may reduce both bank failures and banks' observed profits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Local newspapers are expected to monitor local governments' behavior. However, national newspapers could also contribute to local governments' accountability by attracting nationwide attention to a local policy issue. Using the method developed by Snyder and Stromberg (J Polit Econ 118:355-408, 2010), I construct a variable that measures the weighted market share of locally circulated newspapers in an administrative district in Japan. I find that an increase in the market share of local newspapers is associated with a reduction in local public works spending (seen as rents for local interest groups), which indicates an improvement in political accountability. In addition, the accountability effect of local newspapers becomes greater one year after national newspapers focus readers' attentions on the issue of unnecessary public works. This result suggests that national newspapers serve as an agenda setter and complement local newspapers for strengthening local political accountability.","[Yazaki, Yukihiro] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan",Tokyo Metropolitan University,"Yazaki, Y (通讯作者)，Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Sch Business Adm, 1-1 Minami Osawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 1920397, Japan.",y-yazaki@tmu.ac.jp,,,,,,,34,9,11,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2017,172.0,3-4,,,,,311,331,,10.1007/s11127-017-0444-x,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,FD8CQ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000407753200002,0

We expect that the gender-diverse boards, with their efficient monitoring functions, lead to higher stock liquidity that has positive implications for market efficiency. Consistent with the notion, we find, using 944 Australian firms from 2008 to 2013, that boardroom gender diversity is significantly and positively associated with stock liquidity. Our findings are robust to a series of endogeneity checks and to alternative proxies for gender diversity and stock liquidity. Our results reject the assumption of women on the board as 'tokens' and also provide support to critical mass theory. We contribute to the global debate on the need for more women on corporate boards and provide comprehensive and robust evidence that suggests that having women on corporate boards is positively associated with one of the important characteristics of capital market efficiency, stock liquidity.

Various mechanisms for this failure have been examined (e.g., intrinsic motivation, image concerns). We posit that an aversion to being exploited, i.e., being used instrumentally for another's benefit, can also cause incentives to fail. Using an experiment we find that compliance is lower for exploitative principals compared to neutral ones despite using the same contracts. To corroborate our results we show that surveyed exploitation aversion mediates this effect. Our results have implications for the design and implementation of incentives within organizations.

This soon evolved into an important trigger for the increased migration flows from Romania towards the more developed western countries, members of the EU. Not only the opportunity of a free movement of persons - emerged with the integration - but also the existing socio-economic disparities between Romania and the more developed western countries in the EU, led to unidirectional migration flows. Using both static and dynamic panel gravity models, we aim to identify the main determinants of Romanians' migration towards 10 EU member states - Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Spain, and Sweden - for the period 2007-2014. Our empirical findings support the results of other studies performed on different economies. The most important pull factor for Romanians' migration is represented by the economic conditions in the destination countries, proxied by the GDP/capita. Other important pull factors fuelling Romanians' migration refer to the unemployment rate, life expectancy, education spending, and population density. A key role is also played by the existing social networks in the destination countries which are proxied in our model by the lagged migration flows.","[Davidescu, Adriana Ana Maria; Strat, Vasile Alecsandru; Grosu, Raluca Mariana; Zgura, Ion-Daniel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Davidescu, Adriana Ana Maria] Natl Sci Res Inst Labour & Social Protect, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Strat, VA (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",vasile.strat@csie.ase.ro,"Grosu, Raluca Mariana/I-5331-2017; Strat, Vasile A/J-5917-2016; Strat, Vasile/AAS-3578-2021; Zgura, Daniel ion/Q-1685-2016","Grosu, Raluca Mariana/0000-0003-4246-2433; Strat, Vasile/0000-0002-5074-1419; Zgura, Daniel ion/0000-0002-5780-4590",,,,,40,7,8,1,17,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2017,19.0,46,,,,,621,639,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FK9UI,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000413856000002,0

This damage can be mitigated by restricting catch or other activities which can occur in marine areas. However, such management is only effective when restrictions are enforced to ensure compliance. We expect fishers to help enforce restrictions when they have exclusive user rights and can capture the benefits of management. In a number of such cases, however, fisher participation in the enforcement of user rights is absent. In this analysis we used central Chile as a case-study to investigate why some fishers may not participate in enforcement even when they have exclusive territorial user rights for fisheries. We used a best-worst scaling survey to assess why fishers would choose not to participate in enforcement through monitoring their TURF management areas, and what would help to increase their participation. We found that the main reason fishers may not monitor is because they consider government policing of marine areas and punishment of poachers to be ineffective. Increased and timely responsiveness by government when poachers are detected and more stringent penalisation of poachers may lead to greater involvement in enforcement by fishers.","[Davis, Katrina J.; Kragt, Marit E.; Burton, Michael; Schilizzi, Steven; Pannell, David J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, M089,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Davis, Katrina J.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Santiago, Chile; [Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Ctr Conservac Marina, Santiago, Chile; [Gelcich, Stefan] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of Western Australia; University of Queensland; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Davis, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, M089,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.;Davis, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",katrina.davis@uwa.edu.au,"Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011; Davis, Katrina J./J-3229-2014; Pannell, David/B-4476-2008; burton, michael/A-9541-2009","Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817; Davis, Katrina J./0000-0002-6982-9381; Pannell, David/0000-0001-5420-9908; Schilizzi, Steven/0000-0002-4063-074X; burton, michael/0000-0003-4213-4093","Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions; Ministerio de Economia [FB-0002, RC13004, NC-12008]; Lucile Packard Foundation; Walton Family Foundation; Pew Marine Conservation Fellowship Program",Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions(Australian Research Council); Ministerio de Economia(Spanish Government); Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); Walton Family Foundation; Pew Marine Conservation Fellowship Program,"This research was conducted with support from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions.

Under some shock configurations, crises may be less frequent under a pegged exchange rate regime, but the worse performance during a crisis leads the pegged exchange regime to be inferior to the floating regimes. Finally, we show that in the presence of pecuniary externalities in asset prices, there may be a case for a fiscal authority to subsidize capital inflows at a constant rate. But the benefits of capital inflow subsidies are much weaker under pegged exchange rates.","[Devereux, Michael B.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Yu, Changhua] Peking Univ, CCER, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Devereux, Michael B.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Devereux, Michael B.] CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA",University of British Columbia; Peking University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Devereux, MB (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver Sch Econ, Econ, Vancouver, BC, Canada.;Devereux, MB (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Devereux, MB (通讯作者)，CEPR, Washington, DC 20009 USA.",devm@mail.ubc.ca; changhuay@gmail.com,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71303044],Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are grateful to the helpful discussion by Tommaso Monacelli and comments from Maury Obstfeld, Pau Rabanal, Raphael Schoenle, and participants at the conference Exchange Rates and External Adjustment'' organized by Swiss National Bank, International Monetary Fund, and IMF Economic Review, Zurich, June 24-25, 2016.

Using newly digitized records of the infrastructure spending results from three distinct phases of the process (proposal, prioritization, and implementation), I assess the degree to which the resulting geographical distribution of spending allocations targets the poor. I find a poverty-related bias in the distribution of infrastructure projects funded by the program. While results vary across neighborhoods, on average, sub-units with more poor people receive a smaller percentage of funding than would correspond to their share of the general population. Furthermore, although the implementation stage exhibits significant divergence from the decisions made during the more public proposal and prioritization processes, the small group of elected officials in charge of implementation are not to blame for the bias. I find no evidence that deviations from decisions made during public meetings are based on something other than legitimate technical considerations. Instead, the bias originates in the proposal stage, with the poorest sub-units less likely to submit proposals in the first place. I conclude that the literature would benefit from more studies that look at differences across stages of decision-making within a particular process. Whereas contextual differences across settings may be difficult to change over the short-run, identifying procedural differences and points of vulnerability across a single process can help to diagnose problems which have the potential to actually be resolved by policy-makers.

However, asking respondents to introspect on their self-control problems may instead measure their awareness of them, especially in populations with low self-control. We illustrate this with the Ameriks, Caplin, Leahy, and Tyler (2007) survey, which captures self-control problems through the deviation between self-reported ideal and predicted behavior (Expected Deviation, ED). Previous empirical evidence from high income or highly educated populations correlates larger ED with worse outcomes. We theoretically show that the reverse will be true in settings where awareness can play a large role: when self-control is low and costly commitment devices are available. We empirically show that, for residents of a homeless shelter, ED is positively correlated to savings in shelter lock boxes, a costly commitment device. This correlation is stronger for those likely to experience more self-control problems: individuals with past addiction problems.

We allow for the planner to attach different relative weights to the discounted and end-of-planning-horizon costs in order to assess how sustainability concern might affect the optimal level of policy intervention. We show that the optimal environmental policy increases with the degree of sustainability concern, reducing thus the amount of pollution the society is forced to bear. A calibration based on world data supports our conclusions, further highlighting the importance of higher degrees of sustainability concern to achieve greener long run outcomes.

Furthermore, we suggest a way in which the performative view of routines can be linked to the teleological and life cycle modes of change at the level of management and employees, respectively. As a result, we arrive at a view of routines as both inherently changeable and directional and suggest how the combined use of managerial-and employee-level processes makes it possible to gain the benefits associated with each of them, while at the same time mitigating the effects of their shortcomings.","[Lindkvist, Lars; Bengtsson, Marie; Wahlstedt, Linnea] Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Linkoping, Sweden; [Svensson, Dan-Magnus] Ericsson, Stockholm, Sweden",Linkoping University; Ericsson,"Lindkvist, L (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Management & Engn, Linkoping, Sweden.",lars.lindkvist@liu.se; marie.bengtsson@liu.se; dan-magnus.svensson@ericsson.com; linnea.wahlstedt@liu.se,,,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova),Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova)(Vinnova),This paper has benefited greatly from the constructive criticism and suggestions by the editor and three anonymous reviewers.

The empirical findings suggest rejection of full convergence across the EA17 countries' bond yields spreads, and the presence of a certain number of clubs. In particular, three subgroup convergence clubs emerge, with Cyprus, Spain, France, Greece, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Portugal and Slovenia in the first; Belgium, Italy and Malta in the second; and Austria, Finland, Netherlands and Slovakia in the third club. Moreover, there is also evidence that the first two clubs could be merged to form a larger convergence club. The transitional curves indicate that, despite short-run divergences, EU17 sovereign bond yield spreads tend to converge in the long-run, with the exception of those in Greece and Cyprus, indicating the strong attempts of most of the countries under investigation to adopt fiscal policies that eventually contribute to a convergence pattern.

Using a three-state Markov switching model with time-homogeneous vector autoregressive (VAR) coefficients that emerges from a systematic model specification search, we find that unconventional policies may have been generally expected to decrease both corporate yields and spreads. However, even though the sign of the responses is the one desired by policymakers, the size of the estimated effects depends on the assumptions regarding the decline in long-term Treasury yields caused by unconventional policies, on which considerable uncertainty remains. Further tests based on yield spreads and a variable that measures inflation expectations show that, in the crisis regime, unconventional monetary policies do not produce any perverse effects on expected inflation. These results prove robust to adopting a framework that allows VAR coefficients to break, to imposing coefficient restrictions that increase parsimony, and to a range of different ordering schemes that identify shocks in alternative ways.

In this review essay, we provide an assessment of how these books have advanced our understandings of migrant farm labour regimes in local and international perspectives. After presenting a synopsis of each text, we critically reflect on key lessons learned, offer questions that merit further attention, and suggest directions for future research. Our review finds that despite wide differences in geopolitical and legal contexts in which migrant agricultural workers cross borders, live and work, there are remarkable resemblances in the ways in which states use (and abuse) migrant labour. Likewise, there are glaring similarities in the consequent vulnerabilities migrants experience. While each author provides compelling and empirically rich observations based on local fields of study, generally lacking are broader global connections and policy discussions about how the problems raised can be meaningfully addressed. Given the seeming ubiquity of exploitative migrant agricultural worker regimes, the fundamental question left largely unanswered is: Must local' agricultural systems depend on vulnerable imported workers in order to provide affordable food for consumers, or are there workable alternatives to this arrangement?","[McLaughlin, Janet] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Hlth Studies Int Migrat Res Ctr, 73 George St, Brantford, ON, Canada; [Weiler, Anelyse M.] Univ Toronto, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University; University of Toronto,"McLaughlin, J (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Hlth Studies Int Migrat Res Ctr, 73 George St, Brantford, ON, Canada.",jmclaughlin@wlu.ca; anelyse.weiler@mail.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,23,13,17,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Using ethnographic methods and in-depth interviews about this single intense and extreme case, we explore this farmer's commitment and argue that it constitutes what we call the lived experience of food sovereignty'. If food sovereignty is concerned with small-farmer control over decisions about food cultivation, distribution and consumption, we examine this farmer's praxis and explore the obstacles she faces. These include gendered and racialized agrarian questions, land struggles, social reproduction and perceptions of her indigenous crops.

We find that: (1) high liquidity creation (relative to trend) - particularly off-balance sheet liquidity creation - helps predict crises, controlling for other factors; (2) monetary policy has statistically significant, but economically minor effects on liquidity creation by small banks during normal times, and these effects are even weaker during financial crises; (3) monetary policy has very little effects on medium and large bank liquidity creation during both normal times and crises. These findings suggest that authorities may wish to monitor bank liquidity creation closely in order to predict and perhaps lessen the likelihood of financial crises.

Evidence from a new database,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Welfare states; Reform; OECD; Economic institutions,POLITICAL-IDEOLOGY; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; LIBERALIZATION,"Policy advice by the OECD has long been at the heart of academic debates on welfare state reform, with frequent claims questioning the ideological orientation of recommendations. This paper constructs an indicator of perceived reform need for 24 countries, quantifying the policy advice contained in the OECD Economic Surveys around 1985, 1995, and 2005. These recommendations describe a policy consensus that is based on competition, work incentives, monetary reform, fiscal discipline, and labor market reform. Empirically, perceived need for reform is well explained by preceding levels of economic freedom. In particular, countries with more government intervention, lower property rights protection, and more regulation are perceived to have a bigger reform need. In turn, perceived reform need has no explanatory power for subsequent changes in social expenditure and welfare state entitlements. Only in countries with right wing governments, perceived reform need might be followed by marginal reductions in welfare state entitlements, but definitely not in social expenditure.","[Bergh, Andreas] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bergh, Andreas; Dackehag, Margareta] Lund Univ, BOX 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Rode, Martin] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31009, Spain",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Lund University; University of Navarra,"Rode, M (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",andreas.bergh@nek.lu.se; margareta.dackehag@nek.lu.se; martinrode@unav.es,"Bergh, Andreas/E-9962-2018; Bergh, Andreas/AAM-2478-2020; Rode, Martin/T-4775-2017; Rode, Martin/AAK-7286-2020","Bergh, Andreas/0000-0003-2621-6769; Rode, Martin/0000-0002-8795-7838; Rode, Martin/0000-0002-8795-7838",Swedish Research Council; Torsten Soderberg's Foundation,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Torsten Soderberg's Foundation,"We thank Christian Bjornskov, Pavel Brendler, Arye Hillmann, Sanjay Jain, Ina Jakel, Martin Paldam, Apostolis Philippopoulos, Carlos Scartascini, Marcel Smolka, Allan Sorensen, Heinrich Ursprung, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions.

The paper aims to address whether and where there is an accessibility problem between Italian regions, through a comprehensive measure of accessibility covering the entire Italian territory. The measure used in the paper is potential accessibility, with an exponential decay impedance function. Different from similar studies, this one gives a more in-depth definition of impedance parameters due to the availability of a transport model that includes the entire Italian long-distance supply (roads, coaches, long-distance rail services, air services, and ferries). The opportunities at destination are proxied by population, and private and public sector employees. The main outputs are detailed maps of accessibility that are significantly more realistic than using simple infrastructure indicators or single-mode measures.

A meta-analysis is performed on 69 empirical studies on the resource curse, totaling 1,419 estimates. Our findings show that (i) only developing countries suffer from the resource curse although it is soft; (ii) the way natural resources are taken into account is crucial to understand the heterogeneity found in the literature; (iii) the negative impact of the volatility of the terms-of-trade on growth should be qualified.

The evidence shows that environmental regulations can lead to statistically significant adverse effects on trade, employment, plant location, and productivity in the short run, in particular in a well-identified subset of pollution- and energy-intensive sectors, but that these impacts are small relative to general trends in production. At the same time, there is evidence that environmental regulations induce innovation in clean technologies, but the resulting benefits do not appear to be large enough to outweigh the costs of regulations for the regulated entities. As measures to address competitiveness impacts are increasingly incorporated into the design of environmental regulations, future research will be needed to assess the validity and effectiveness of such measures and to ensure they are compatible with the environmental objectives of the policies.","[Dechezlepretre, Antoine; Sato, Misato] London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Dechezlêpretre, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",A.Dechezlepretre@lse.ac.uk; m.sato1@lse.ac.uk,,"Sato, Misato/0000-0002-9978-9595","Global Green Growth Institute; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [308481]; UK Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1, ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010341/1, ES/K006576/1, ES/N016971/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Global Green Growth Institute; Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment; European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)); UK Economic and Social Research Council through the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We would like to thank Milan Brahmbhatt, Raphael Calel, Baran Doda, Damien Dussaux, Carolyn Fischer, Matthieu Glachant, Colin McCormick, and Dimitri Zenghelis for helpful comments on an earlier version of this article.

Access reforms provide more educational opportunities, while quality reforms improve educational effectiveness. This paper investigates empirically the factors affecting the enactment of these two kinds of reforms in public primary and secondary education. By using a novel dataset of U.S. state legislation from 2008 to 2013, we find that both access and quality reforms are more likely in times of bad educational outcomes. Moreover, this is the first study documenting that teachers' union strength correlates positively with access reforms and negatively with quality reforms.

In a second step we explore how the students' political attitudes change as they progress in their academic training. Only studying economics has an unambiguous pro-market influence on political attitudes: by the time of graduation, economics students are some 6.2 percentage points more likely than they were in their initial year of study to agree with free-market policy positions.

Given that increasing income inequality is a major concern and policy issue, this paper examines the impacts of migration and migrants' remittances on income inequality in China's rural minority areas using recent proprietary household data. Treating migrants' remittances as a potential substitute for income, the results reveal that migration significantly boosts income for all ethnic groups, although the returns to ethnic minority households tend to be less than for Han households. Decomposition analyses further reveal that migration increases inequality between ethnic groups despite reducing spatial inequality. These countervailing effects imply that the continual transfer of rural urban migrants will likely lead to spatial convergence despite reinforcing ethnic inequalities in rural minority areas. Importantly, the percentage contribution of ethnic inequality to total inequality is larger than that of spatial inequality across sampled rural locations, thus highlighting the fact that the ethnic dimension is an important, yet often overlooked component of inequality in China.

With regard to the initial recovery of productive assets, households that experienced heavier damage to their assets had recovered to a lesser extent. After one year, recovery had continued, but households whose houses were damaged by the floods experienced a deceleration in the recovery speed. The recovery dynamics suggests the importance of the interaction of productive assets and unproductive, non-liquidatable assets in conflict-ridden situations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The model allows the house supply to vary in the short-run and the banking sector to affect the equilibrium in the housing market, through its effect on housing supply and demand. We show that house prices react mostly to standard drivers such as, disposable income and demographic pressures. Lending conditions also exert a significant impact, especially through their effects on mortgage loans, and consequently on housing demand. Allowing short-run adjustment in house supply implies a weaker response of house prices to a change in monetary policy or in banks' deleveraging process. Finally, we find that since the mid-80s house price developments in Italy have been broadly in line with fundamentals; during the global financial crisis, the worsening in credit supply conditions dampened house price dynamics, partly offsetting the positive stimulus provided by the loosing monetary policy stance.

Social influence is integral to the diffusion of private vehicles which are highly visible and fulfil practical as well as social functions. This paper provides the first meta-analysis of empirical studies which measure the strength of social influence on consumer vehicle choice. A systematic literature review identified 21 studies that examined three types of social influence: interpersonal communication; neighbourhood effect; and conformity with social norms. A random effects meta-analysis found a significant and small to moderate effect of social influence on vehicle choices (r = 0.241, p < 0.001). The overall effect size did not vary significantly between types of social influence nor between types of vehicle (conventional or alternative fuel). However, further analysis using meta regression found that heterogeneity in social influence effect size across studies was explained by differences in countries' cultural receptiveness to normative influence. These findings have important implications for policy and modelling analysis of alternative fuel vehicle adoption, for which diffusion is both a socially and culturally mediated process.","[Pettifor, H.; Wilson, C.] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Axsen, J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Abrahamse, W.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Anable, J.] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9TJ, W Yorkshire, England",University of East Anglia; Simon Fraser University; Victoria University Wellington; University of Leeds,"Pettifor, H (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",h.pettifor@uea.ac.uk; charlie.wilson@uea.ac.uk; jaxsen@gmail.com; wokje.abrahamse@vuw.ac.nz; j.anable@abdn.ac.uk,"Wilson, Charlie/D-4127-2011; Pettifor, Hazel/AAF-6393-2020","Wilson, Charlie/0000-0001-8164-3566; Pettifor, Hazel/0000-0003-3901-2693; Anable, Jillian/0000-0002-4259-1641","European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration [308329]; EPSRC [EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI","European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration(European Union (EU)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","This work was funded by European Union's Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement number 308329.",,98,70,74,4,41,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Our key finding indicates that extreme rainfall-induced flooding exerts two opposing effects on democracy. On one hand, flooding leads to corruption in the chains of emergency relief distribution and other post-disaster assistance, which in turn impels the citizenry to demand more democracy. On the other hand, flooding induces autocratic tendencies in incumbent regimes because efficient post-disaster management with no dissent, chaos or plunder might require government to undertake repressive actions.

Previous research has shown that the unique corporate groupings in Japan known as the keiretsu have relatively low bankruptcy costs, low agency conflicts, low information asymmetry, and low effective taxes. These conditions should mitigate the benefits of reinsurance purchase. This conjecture is tested by examining demand for reinsurance of Japanese non-life insurance companies during 1974-2010. Consistent with the prediction, keiretsu non-life insurers have lower reinsurance purchase than independent non-life insurance companies. The effects of the keiretsu structure also receded when keiretsu groupings' power was weakened after the asset bubble burst and the breakdown of the convoy system in mid 1990s. Consistent with previous studies, Japanese mutual insurers also purchase more reinsurance than stock insurers.","[Yanase, Noriyoshi] Tokyo Keizai Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Limpaphayom, Piman] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Limpaphayom, Piman] Chulalongkorn Univ, Sasin GIBA, Bangkok, Thailand",Tokyo Keizai University; Portland State University; Chulalongkorn University,"Limpaphayom, P (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA.;Limpaphayom, P (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Sasin GIBA, Bangkok, Thailand.",piman@pdx.edu,,,Postal Life Insurance Foundation of Japan,Postal Life Insurance Foundation of Japan,"The authors are indebted to Kenneth Kim, Gene Lai, Soichiro Moridaira, Gregory Niehaus, Hisashi Nakamura, Toshio Serita, Yukihiro Yasuda, Thomas Berry-Stoelzle, S.

Based on this idea, the article aims to determine the nature of inter-correlation between the innovation activity of companies and the level of performance of these, which are the main types of innovation and how they can influence companies' position and how the sector of activity can influence the dimension of the impact of innovation. For achieve these objectives have been analysed empirical studies in various sectors, studies which have highlighted a positive inter-correlation between innovation activity and the performance of companies with significant differences depending on the type of innovation and industry use. The article is completed by an empirical analysis which aims to determine the extent to which performance of companies in the construction sector is sensitive to innovation activity. For the analysis were collected data from 14 companies which developed the specific activities in the construction sector of Europe, were achieve a total of 112 observations. The results obtained by applying a multiple regression model shows a positive correlation relationship between indicators of innovation (R&D expenditures and the value of patents/patents) on the one side and performance indicators (equity, labour productivity and number of employees) on the other side. Another direction of research analysed in this paper is to determine the impact of labour indicators on the level of innovation, in this situation was achieve a positive but insignificant inter-correlation between those indicators.","[Nica, Ana-Maria; Stancu, Ion] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Stancu, Dumitra] Tech Univ Civil Engn Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest (UTCB),"Nica, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",nica.anamaria@yahoo.com,,"Nica, ANA-MARIA/0000-0002-5830-9428",,,,,21,2,5,1,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19.0,45,,,,,509,527,,,,,,19,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404523800013,0

The conceptual framework has profoundly influenced research on natural resource governance, common property, and community resource management. However, currently natural resource governance has changed dramatically, challenging the applicability of the conceptual schema. There are now many more social actors involved in resource management than the local communities at the focus of original analysis. Additionally, resource management increasingly provides access to various kinds of benefits from outside the immediate context, including indirect benefits such as payments for environmental services and results-based payments for REDD+. These changes demand addition of new property rights to the original framework. This paper updates the conceptual schema in reaction to changes in natural resource governance, proposing three specific modifications on the focus of use rights, control rights and authoritative rights to come up with a framework that distinguishes eight types of property rights. We apply the framework to three purposefully selected governance interventions in China and Laos that include the provision of indirect benefits in addition to the direct benefits derived by local people from natural resources. The empirical application shows how contemporary governance changes may not lead to local people's outright dispossession, since they continue to possess direct use rights to natural resources. However, local people may be excluded from control and authoritative rights, which are exercised exclusively by state agencies and international actors. The latter make available indirect benefits to local people, which may or may not translate into use rights in the sense of policy-based entitlements. The empirical insights suggest the possibility of a wider trend of 'com-pensated exclusions' in natural resource governance. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Results from 3776 crop-cutting studies on different crops (cereals, pulses, and oilseeds) revealed that there is a vast spatial variability in case of various soil nutrients across different taluks of Karnataka. Balanced fertilizer application, both in rainfed and irrigated areas, directly influenced crop yields. Yields of cereals, legumes and oilseeds were 3590, 1400, and 2230 kg ha(-1) with improved management practices as compared to 2650, 1030, and 1650 kg ha with conventional farming practices, respectively. Average net income estimated from conventional farming was Rs. 26,290 ha(-1), while it was Rs. 35,540 ha(-1) from improved management practices, which indicated that ICM practices resulted in an additional 35% income. The oilseeds performed better in terms of achieving higher net income and benefit-cost ratio while the cereals and legumes also have shown significant improvement in yield compared to the yields from conventional farming practices. The detailed findings on soil properties, yields of crops, and economics suggested that there is a vast potential for crop productivity improvement through ICM practices across different soil types and rainfall zones of Karnataka, India.

Safety net programs in the United States are designed to dampen economic instability and maintain basic needs for families. Such programs, including TANF, SNAP (food stamps), and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), have been tested during and between recessions of the past 30 years, including the recent 2007-2009 Great Recession. I use matched data in the March Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1980 to 2012 to estimate pre- and post-transfer income instability over the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, as well as across recessions. The results are disaggregated by family structure, race, income, and education. Transfer programs are associated with lowered instability levels and flatter trend growth from 1980 to 2012 among socioeconomically disadvantaged subgroups, while the tax system reduces income instability for families in the top 40th percentile of the income distribution. Although the largest instability reductions occur among the poor, since 1980 the safety net appears less responsive to instability for the bottom income quintile, female-headed families, and black families.

First, we find that firms with strong unions pay their CEOs less. The negative effect is robust to various tests for endogeneity, including cross-sectional variations and a regression discontinuity design. Second, we find that CEO compensation is curbed before union contract negotiations, especially when the compensation is discretionary and the unions have a strong bargaining position. Third, we report that curbing CEO compensation mitigates the chance of a labor strike, thus providing a rationale for firms to pay CEOs less when facing strong unions. The United Auto Workers says it knows it needs to help Detroit's automakers cut labor costs to reduce the gap in production expenses with Asian rivals. But as talks continue on new contracts, the union also is questioning why top executives at the automakers are paid what they are.

An indication of such social mobility could be that personality characteristics have stronger impact than childhood background on economic success. The present study investigated how much of life outcomes (i.e., educational attainment, annual income, and life outcome satisfaction) were accounted for by adult personality traits (the Big Five), when controlled for childhood socio-economic status (SES). The results from a large, representative Swedish sample (N = 5280) showed that personality traits (especially neuroticism) were associated as much as or more than childhood SES to annual income and life outcome satisfaction, whereas childhood SES related more to educational attainment. These results may help facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms behind individual economic success. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the role of education, experience, and availability of 'entrepreneurial capital' in the local neighbourhood varies along the different stages of the entrepreneurial process.

We test the peer group effect hypothesis along differing levels of financially constrained firms as well as differing degrees of industry competition. Using idiosyncratic equity returns as the instrument variable, we use 2-stage least squares regression to identify the influence of peer firms' investment decisions on a firm's own investment policies. Our analyses empirically confirm that there is a peer group effect in making firm investment decisions. More financially constrained firms show greater dependency on peers' investment decisions. Tests of peer sensitivity to the increase in industrial competition, however, displayed a U-shaped quadratic curve, which shows that firms have the lowest peer group effect in medium-competition markets. We claim that imitative behavior in investment is presumably weak in the mid-competition market because firms are yet to be distinguished in this market. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Our findings imply that valuations placed on securities affected by aggregation and suitability frictions should adjust for position size. Such securities include not only agency MBS, but also asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and private-label residential mortgage-backed securities.","[Atanasov, Vladimir; Merrick, John J., Jr.] Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Schuster, Philipp] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany",William & Mary; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,"Atanasov, V (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",,"Atanasov, Vladimir A/N-1806-2014","Merrick, John/0000-0002-5633-8321; Schuster, Philipp/0000-0002-9734-8593","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SCHU 3049/1-1, UH 107/3-1]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Alie Diagne and Ola Persson of the FINRA for providing access to the MBS trade reporting data and valuable insights into the agency MBS market.

Our sample covers the global US. portfolios and Malaysian portfolios with multiple asset classes, as well as the portfolios with a specific asset class in several regions. This study uses the recent mean variance spanning test in multiple regimes, which not only accounts for tail risk but also identifies the source of value added (tangency portfolio or global minimum variance). For intra-asset allocation, our findings tend to show that both Islamic and conventional fund managers of a specific asset class can benefit from conventional and Islamic asset classes, respectively, in several regimes. For inter-asset allocation, conventional institutional investors cannot obtain any value added from Islamic asset classes. On the contrary, the U.S. Islamic institutional investors can expand their tangency portfolio by investing in U.S. TIPSs and REITs, and reduce their global minimum variance by allocating in US. high-yield bonds. Moreover, the Malaysian Islamic institutional investors can obtain risk reduction by investing in conventional bonds only in the high term premium regime. For the remaining asset classes, the opportunity sets are sufficient for Islamic investors to invest complying with Shariah rules.

Although usage increased after Lehman's bankruptcy, most commercial banks avoided the DW and TAF. We also find that the programs were more often used by failed European banks than by healthy US banks, likely because these loans are expensive relative to private market funds.

Model estimates show four main findings. Wireline speeds are often higher in markets with two or more wireline ISP's than with a single wireline ISP. Excluding the correction terms from the analysis understates this effect.

A modeling framework is developed for analyzing how alternative municipal water tariff designs affect these three criteria. It is then applied to a hypothetical community in which a municipal water utility provides metered, piped water, and wastewater services to 5,000 households. We analyze how the shift from a uniform volumetric tariff to different increasing block tariff (IBT) designs affects households' water use and water bills, and how these changes in turn affect measures of equity and economic efficiency for two different financial self-sufficiency targets. We calculate how changes in assumptions about (1) the correlation between household income and water use, and (2) households' response to average or marginal prices affect the tariffs' performance in terms of these three criteria. The results show that IBTs perform poorly in terms of targeting subsidies to low-income households regardless of the magnitude of financial subsidies that a utility receives from high-level government. When cost recovery is low, the distribution of subsidies under IBTs is even worse if the correlation between water use and household income is high. IBTs introduce price distortions that induce economic efficiency losses, but we show that these welfare losses are relatively small, especially when households respond to average prices.

The discussion begins with a simple generalization of a framework with credit constraints and concludes that the negative effects of exchange rate volatility on productivity growth are reduced the more financially integrated into the international capital flows a country is. Second, an empirical analysis of productivity growth provides thresholds and addresses potential endogeneity problems. Robust and significant results find that a high degree of financial openness can mitigate the negative effect of exchange rate flexibility on growth.","[Rodriguez, Cesar M.] Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97201 USA",Portland State University,"Rodriguez, CM (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Dept Econ, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",cesar.rodriguez@pdx.edu,,,,,,,64,12,16,0,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

We apply the new approach as well as conventional approaches to actual data and conduct prediction performance comparisons. The empirical results show that the new approach significantly improves prediction ability. The new approach is proven to have some potential merit as an alternative approach to improving prediction ability and can also be applied to various types of financial crisis events.","[Suh, Sangwon] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Suh, S (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",ssuh@cau.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2015S1A5A2A01009141],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"The author thanks Kyongwook Choi, Jinill Kim, Taehoon Lim, Alfred Mettler, Hail Park, Antonin Rusek, Chi-Young Song, and an anomynous referee for the extensive and insightful comments on earlier versions.

This paper studies whether domestic environmental policies affect the inward technology transfer of cleaner innovation from abroad. We focus specifically on the power sector, for its important role in the decarbonization process, by looking at zero-carbon (renewable) and carbon-saving (efficient fossil) technologies for energy production. Using data on cross-country patent applications, we provide evidence that environmental policy contributes to attracting foreign cleaner technology options to OECD markets but not to non-OECD markets. We show that this is due to the nature of the implemented policy instruments. Market-based approaches positively impact technology transfer to both OECD and non-OECD economies, while non-market based approaches have at best only a weak effect in OECD countries. Domestic environmental policies may provide too weak a signal for foreign innovators in countries off the technological frontier. This calls for a strengthening of policy incentives for technology transfer in light of pressing climate change objectives.","[Verdolini, Elena] FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Verdolini, Elena] Fdn CMCC, Ctr Euromediterranneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Bosetti, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Fondazione Mattei; Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici (CMCC); Bocconi University,"Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，FEEM, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.;Verdolini, E (通讯作者)，Fdn CMCC, Ctr Euromediterranneo Cambiamenti Climatici, Corso Magenta 63, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",elena.verdolini@feem.it,,,European Research Council under the European Community [336703],European Research Council under the European Community(European Research Council (ERC)),"The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Community's Programme Ideas-Call identifier: ERC-2013-StG/ERC Grant Agreement No 336703-Project RISICO RISk and uncertainty in developing and Implementing Climate change pOlicies.

We perform repeated choice experiments and fit an error model that allows us to discriminate between true violations of independence and those that can be attributed to errors. In order to investigate the role of event splitting effects, we present each choice problem not only in coalesced form (as in many previous studies) but also in split forms. It turns out previously reported violations of independence and splitting effects remain significant even when controlling for errors. However, splitting effects have a substantial influence on tests of independence conditions. When choices are presented in canonical split form, in which probabilities on corresponding probability-consequence ranked branches are equal, violations of the properties tested could be reduced to insignificance or even reversed.","[Birnbaum, Michael H.] Calif State Univ CSUF, Dept Psychol, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Schmidt, Ulrich; Schneider, Miriam D.] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany; [Schmidt, Ulrich] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Birnbaum, MH (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ CSUF, Dept Psychol, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA.;Schmidt, U (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.;Schmidt, U (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",mbirnbaum@Exchange.FULLERTON.EDU; Ulrich.Schmidt@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,74,12,12,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5646,1573-0476,,J RISK UNCERTAINTY,J.

This has led to the development of collaborative apps designed to enable activities like lift sharing. Such apps require new norms of behaviour to establish a user base and research has yet to address the socio-cultural barriers to both the use of this technology to organise travel and the sharing of personal space that collaborative travel entails. This paper reports the findings of a study which designed, built and tested a collaborative travel app in the tourism domain. Data derived from exploratory interviews, post-trial interviews and a questionnaire reveal that user age and extent of mobile engagement play a less significant role than expected, while other aspects of the social exchange, notably social tie strength, trust and obligations play a more marked role. A conceptual framework and discussion of strategies to address these barriers provides insight into appropriate contexts and routes for implementation of collaborative travel apps.

The empirical results indicate that policy outcomes create a virtuous cycle in the technological change system through market oppurntunity, learning-by-searching, and learning-by-doing. According to the results, the static impact of technology-push and tariff incentive policies are effective on invention, while renwables obligation and CO2 tax appear to encourage cost reduction in the technologies. When the dynamic impacts of policy are considered, tariff incentives appears to outperform a renewables obligation policy with very small margin.We also found that the dynamic impact of CO2 tax varies with the level of technological development maturity.","[Kim, Kyunam] KISDI, 18 Jeongtong Ro, Jincheon Gun 365841, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea; [Heo, Eunnyeong] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Coll Engn, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Yeonbae] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South Korea.",kimy1234@snu.ac.kr,,"Kim, Yeonbae/0000-0002-1124-1155",,,,,63,26,27,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

One of their marketing strategies is to increase the trust and loyalty of pilgrims to their travel companies. To increase customer trust and loyalty, travel companies use celebrity endorsement to help promote their products. In Aceh, many travel companies use celebrity endorsement to assist the promotion of their umrah packages. The people of Aceh are known as a society that implements Islamic shariah as the foundation of their life. Many Islamic Boarding School (pesantren) leaders, mosque imams, and influential public figures have become celebrity endorsements. They are believed to be able to make people believe to do umrah with travel companies that use them as celebrity endorsements. The purpose of this study was to examine important criteria in creating customers' loyalty. The relationship between celebrity endorsement and trust are investigated for this purpose. This study discussed how celebrity endorsement affected customer trust and its impact on customer loyalty umrah pilgrims in Aceh. A sample was drawn from umrah pilgrims in Aceh with 218 respondents. Primary data was used in this study in form of questionnaire with Likert scale. SPSS was used to analyze demographic characteristics of the respondents and descriptive analysis. AMOS 22 was adopted for the Structural Equation Modeling of the survey model for verified analysis using regression weight/loading factor. The findings of this study have shown significant relationships among the variables under investigation.

Some teachers use technology as a way of demonstrating a lesson in the classroom. Nowadays, technology has an important effect on the students' motivation and achievement toward learning English as a foreign language compared with traditional tools. The commonly used teaching tool in education was chalkboard. It is cheap and simple. It helps the teachers to provide visible support to words, and many other advantages. By the time, expensive and sophisticated technologies become main part in the teaching environment Using different methodologies in the classroom helps teachers to convey the content of lessons effectively, and also makes students concentrate on the lesson. Teachers need to be well-trained in using technology in classroom, and has the essential skills of good presentation. Power point presentation is one type of CALL by which the teacher can present images and texts with sound and simple animation. Like any teaching tool in TESOL classroom, 'power point presentation' has many advantages that will encourage EFL teachers to incorporate this technology in language teaching process in l'ESOL classroom. Another technology to be used in classroom is discussion board. It is an electronic communicative tool that used to share different kinds of messages such as comments, questions, answers, or announcements that could be accessible to the teacher and learners. The main advantage of discussion board is that participants can post their messages at any time. The most important benefit of using the Internet in TESOL classroom is that the availability of authentic documents to both teachers and learners. To sum up, technology in very important especially in TESOL classroom. Using Technology create live environment which motivate students to engage with the topic by dialogue, discussion.","[Alshahrani, Turkiah] Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland",University of Aberdeen,"Alshahrani, T (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,BC GRUP INC,CANKAYA,"MUSTAFA KEMAL MAH, 2134 SOK, DERELI APT.

To address this gap, this paper proposes the concept of Retail Mobility Environment (RME) and develops a methodological process for identifying and mapping RMEs, using the city of Zaragoza, Spain, as a case study. The concept of RME is developed through three methodological phases: (i) definition of non-motorised Accessibility Zones (AZs), using three indicators (walking accessibility, bicycling accessibility, betweenness); (ii) definition of Retail Zones (RZs), also using three indicators (retail density, retail diversity, retail contiguity); and (iii) definition of RMEs, where both retail activity and non-motorised indicators were weighted and combined using multi criteria analysis. In total, four RMEs were identified and mapped: short-distance environments, motorised environments, non-motorised environments, and long-distance environments. The paper concludes with a discussion on the need to unravel the relationships between retail activity and non-motorised accessibility, in order to reach sustainable planning goals, as well as the potential usefulness of RMEs for transport policy-making.

These effects are intensified by customers' financial distress, the level of relationship-specific investments, and the use of trade credit in customer-supplier relations.

J,"Castro, LT; Neves, MF; Akridge, JT",,,,"Castro, Luciano Thome; Neves, Marcos Fava; Akridge, Jay Taylor",,,A comparative analysis of channel incentive programs in Brazil and the USA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS,,,English,Article,,,,,,USA; Brazil; Power; Institutional theory; Distribution channels; Chemical industry,BUYER-SELLER RELATIONSHIPS; INFLUENCE STRATEGIES; MARKETING CHANNELS; EMERGING MARKETS; BEHAVIOR; POWER; COORDINATION; ENFORCEMENT; PERFORMANCE; COMMITMENT,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a channel incentive program conceptual framework. In order to do so, a consolidated theoretical effort was completed together with observations from two countries - Brazil and the USA - to build evidence toward the proposed framework. Design/methodology/approach - This paper first proposes a theoretical framework for understating marketing channel incentive programs, conceptualizing it as being composed by four dimensions being control, benefits, exclusiveness and formalization, mediated by power distribution between dealers and manufactures. Second, the developed framework was used for a cross-country analysis. Three multinational firms, global leaders in the crop protection industry, were selected in Brazil and the same three were selected in the USA. For completing each case report for the six companies in total, 16 people were interviewed, besides documental research over companies' documents. Findings - The framework helped describing and understanding the different group of incentives used per firm and country. Indeed, there are much more similarities within Brazil or the USA, than the same company in these two countries. The institutional environment and the network structure were fundamental to understand why the power center was different in these two countries that resulted in different channel incentive programs. In the USA, programs are very clear and straightforward in regard to a powerful dealer. If the dealer develops five or six output tasks, margins would increase considerably. In Brazil, however, dealers have a wider array of activities accompanying output measures. If they perform well they receive support, but fundamentally manufacturers strongly influence dealers' daily management decisions. Research limitations/implications - The incentive programs analyzed are mostly based on the set of standard documents manufacturers produced for dealers and on interviews for clarifying the content of the documents. Therefore, manufacturers probably set some relationship aspects aside since individual approaches to dealers might exist that were not captured in this study. Another limitation is the application to one sole industry that may per se present particularities that could be inducted too far the conceptual model that was built. Practical implications - The framework as suggested might first help to organize the thinking of first identifying the power distribution between manufacturer and dealers and understanding institutional and network underlying causes. The framework might then help to select the right performance measures, benefits while keeping exclusivity and formalization levels in mind. Several types of control measures and benefits are presented as examples that can be adapted to a particular situation. Special concerns should be considered when managing marketing channels with incentives in an emerging market, but mainly, one must recognize the need to identify resources limitations (financial, knowledge, or infrastructure). Second, institutions work quite inefficiently, which means that beyond legal enforcements, firms may rely heavily on additional coordination mechanisms such as incentives schemes and communication strategy to build a more social and bilateral control mechanism. Third, a manufacturer should recognize that even if they currently hold a less-dependent position to dealers, the dynamics of an emerging market may quickly change the dependence structure. Originality/value - The paper brings together a literature review and consolidation over the topic of channel incentive programs, proposes a framework to be used by researchers or practioners and dive in three pairs of companies in different countries to analyze why management practice should be adjusted. Differences in developing and developed countries are highlighted and the impact on channel incentives.","[Castro, Luciano Thome; Neves, Marcos Fava] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Business Adm, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil; [Akridge, Jay Taylor] Purdue Univ, Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Castro, LT (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Business Adm, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.",ltcastro@usp.br,"Akridge, Jay/L-6253-2019; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Neves, Marcos/J-8190-2012","Neves, Marcos/0000-0002-5693-7543",,,,,46,0,0,1,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

We use an ordered probit model for investigating changes in the probability of finding negative, positive, and insignificant impacts. The total data base consists of 912 observations from 42 studies conducted between 1995 and 2014. The meta-analytical results show that study characteristics do matter for the magnitude and sign of the variables concerned. We find that studies which employ data from the US are more likely to register a negative impact of public infrastructure on regional growth. We also find that type of infrastructure, research methodology, time span, type of infrastructure measure, and geographical scale affect the outcomes of the primary studies. Studies that take into account interregional, interstate and interprovincial relations have a higher chance of finding negative effects, which gives an idea about the spillover effects of these investments. In contrast, some characteristics like output measure and selection of a particular sector appear to have no effect on obtaining positive, negative or insignificant outcomes. The findings of this study offer new insights to policy makers on the variation in empirical results regarding the relationship between public investment infrastructure and regional growth.

The novelty of the study is emphasized by including in the analysis a variable which tests local fiscal discipline, more exactly, Fiscal Rule Strength Index for local level of government. Our findings suggest that prosperity of regions, measured in GDP growth depends on variables such as characteristics of decentralization undertaken by each country or local fiscal discipline, confirming our primary hypothesis. This supports the view that recently implemented reforms aiming to enforce fiscal discipline following-up the Fiscal Compact strengthened the local budgetary framework and restrained, therefore, the local discretionary power to act towards development.","[Gavriluta Vatamanu, Anca Florentina; Oprea, Florin] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Gavriluta, AF (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",gavriluta.anca@y.hoo.com; foprea@uaic.ro,"ANCA-FLORENTINA, VATAMANU/AAG-5880-2021","ANCA-FLORENTINA, VATAMANU/0000-0003-2324-1969",,,,,38,0,0,0,5,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",2392-8867,2393-2384,978-606-714-428-4,EURINT,,,2017,,,,,,,180,197,,,,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BK0YX,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000431393300010,0

The main goal was divided into partial goals: a) To find out the change average official land price /OLP/(economic indicator of agriculture soil quality) per cadastral areas and to verify statistical significance of impact of quantitative and qualitative agriculture land changes on land price rate. b) to identify the main reasons for the degradation of agricultural land. The research uses primary data from Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadastre (2008-2016), OLP per cadastral area in Decree of the Ministry of Finance on determining land prices (2009-2017) and secondary data from Ministry of Agriculture. The data were processed using comparison methods, regression and correlation analysis, and weighted means method, resulting in a proposal of quantitative degradation factor. There was OLP Index of updating cadastral areas in five regions in the interval (0. 99; 0. 54) between years 2009-2014. The main causes of the decline of cadastral OLP by more than 10 % (35.76 % of all negative changes in five analysed regions) were: Erosion processes with loss of fertility loess soils, economic activity on the slopes (42.9 % of cases), more detailed soil evaluation exploration (38.6 %), increasing the slope of agricultural land due to building modifications (8.6 %), inappropriate agro-technical practices and inadequate crops structure on the agricultural land in combination with land profile (7.1 %). It can be stated, that excessive decreases of quality agriculture land and loss of land quality due to anthropological processes in production important areas have a significant influence on the change of land quality. Based on the soil evaluation exploration results: There was a decrease of regional OLP (region OLP index < 1) in four regions in 2009-2014. During the period 2016 to 2017 the OLP declined already in nine regions.","[Gebeltova, Zdenka; Halova, Pavlina] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Gebeltová, Z (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",gebeltova@pef.czu.cz; halova@pef.czu.cz,"Gebeltová, Zdeňka/H-3072-2018; Halova, Pavlina/H-6831-2018","Gebeltová, Zdeňka/0000-0002-3276-967X; Halova, Pavlina/0000-0003-2236-3227",,,,,11,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,64,70,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400008,0

An institutional view is explored to demonstrate how informal institutions shape a firm's strategic decision making in the internationalization process. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model and accompanying research hypotheses are tested on data from a survey of 169 US and 110 Brazilian buyers. Structural equation modeling is used to test the hypotheses. Findings - Results suggest that the pattern of flows of communication on building trust and increasing strategic cooperation is based upon the governance of the individual's country of origin. Quality communication is found to have a greater impact on trust in the USA, while two-way communication is the factor with the greatest effect on trust in Brazil. Frequency of communication and socialization are also found to have indirect, but important distinct roles in the flows of communication in both countries. Trust is also found to be a strong predictor of strategic cooperation. Practical implications - Results provide insight into what patterns of communication flows are most influential in increasing a buyer's trust in a supplier, so that suppliers can better formulate strategies to enter overseas markets. Originality/value - This study extends the communication, trust, and cooperation literature to the context of buyer-supplier relationships in distinct county settings. Comparisons are made between one developed country characterized by rule-based governance, with a low-context style of communication and high country trust and one emerging market characterized by relation-based governance, with a high-context style of communication and low country trust.","[Graca, Sandra Simas] Eckerd Coll, Collegium Comparat Cultures, St Petersburg, FL 33733 USA; [Doney, Patricia M.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Barry, James M.] Nova Southeastern Univ, H Wayne Huizenga Sch Business & Entrepreneurship, Ft Lauderdale, FL USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Nova Southeastern University,"Graca, SS (通讯作者)，Eckerd Coll, Collegium Comparat Cultures, St Petersburg, FL 33733 USA.",gracass@eckerd.edu,"Barry, James/P-5886-2019",,,,,,43,10,10,1,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The aim of this research paper is to gain insight in the field of digitization and the digital economy, with a particular interest in business digitization. In the first part of the paper, we analyzed the Digital Economy and Society Index 2017 for Romania, which measures the progress of the EU states in terms of the evolution of the digital economy and society. The second part of the article is made up of a quantitative research, focusing on the business digitization in the Romanian economy and trying to answer several research questions: (1) Is business digitization relevant for Master's students? (2) Are Master's students interested in business digitization? (3) Do respondents have digital skills? (4) Are digital investments welcome in Romanian businesses or not? Through a questionnaire addressed to Master's students, the current study aims to reveal the respondents' perception on the impact of digital economy on Romanian businesses. This research identifies at the same time challenges and specific practices that certain firms use. The findings underline the increased awareness of respondents in business digitization, their high digital literacy as well the low digital investments that companies are ready to make. Another important aspect revealed by the research is that respondents perceived digital technologies as processes which add value in enterprises (95% of them) and they are unaware of the career opportunities within this field. What is important to be observed here is that women totally rejected this question, by answering particularly with strongly disagree and disagree (67% out 74.1%).

First, we use the fraction of fundamentalists estimated by the model of heterogeneous agents as an indicator of agents' predictions of stock market movements. When the expectations of fundamentalists are the only basis for interest rate policy decision making, our results in seven countries show that those with an overvalued stock price use tight monetary policy so than the price falls to the fundamental level, and countries with an undervalued stock price use expansionary monetary policy so the price increases to the fundamental level. Furthermore, the stock price in the next six months in these countries continues to show a negative reaction to expectations-based monetary policy. In addition, in countries not subject to the influence of monetary policy based on the expectations of fundamentalists, our survey results showed that within the next three months, in more than 33% of cases, stock prices reacted negatively to policy. In short, the effect of expectations-based interest rate policy on price stability is superior to adjustments in the policy rate by monetary policy committees. Our results remain robust following a series of additional tests.","[Hung, Kuo-Che; Ma, Tai] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, 70 Lienhai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Hung, KC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, 70 Lienhai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",kc.hungfinance@gmail.com; matai@finance.nsysu.edu.tw,"Ma, TAI/B-7034-2009","ma, tai/0000-0002-6681-3544",,,,,33,3,3,2,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1059-0560,1873-8036,,INT REV ECON FINANC,Int.

Organic agriculture in recent decades is actively developing in many countries all over the world and can become Russia's new niche and sphere of influence. This is due to a unique combination of some factors: low-tech methods of agricultural production; a relatively liberal situation in the land market, a significant but poor involvement of the domestic human and scientific potential in the agrarian sphere of economy. Large-scale intensive agricultural production is growing rapidly around urban agglomerations, but the predominant part of the peripheral rural areas survives because of small-scale and low profitable forms of farming. Therefore, the development of organic agriculture can become for such areas not just an option, but the only possible model for development. The article reveals the prerequisites for the formation of such model and the role of the state in this process, that is interested both in enhancing the sustainability of rural development, and in ensuring, on this basis, the food security and independence of the country, as well as creating a solid foundation for population social well-being. The need to develop a system of measures of state influence on organic agriculture development in the spheres of production, regulation, exchange and consumption is defined. Their efficiency will influence the further development of rural territories in Russia, the competitiveness of domestic products in the international market, ensuring food security, implementing the universal right to quality and safe food.","[Kovalenko, E.

The purpose of this paper is to identify several factors affecting Chinese migrant workers' adoption of online banking. Chinese migrant workers are BoP consumers that have migrated from rural China to work in China's expanding urban regions such as Shanghai. Design/methodology/approach - In collaboration with the Shanghai Survey Corps of the National Bureau of Statistics, the present research conducts structured interviews with more than 1,200 Chinese migrant workers. Findings - The results of a logit regression analysis suggest that Chinese migrant workers are more likely to adopt online banking when they have higher levels of economic, biological, and social resources. Practical implications - The results support habit adoption theory and provide managers with insight on how to increase BoP consumers' adoption of financial services. Social implications - Greater adoption of financial services among BoP consumers, including Chinese migrant workers, can improve the well-being of these historically marginalized consumers. Originality/value - The present research provides initial evidence that habit adoption theory and resource availability helps to explain Chinese migrant workers' adoption of online banking.","[Leonhardt, James M.] Univ Nevada, Dept Managerial Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Chu, Rongwei] Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Guoshun Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; Fudan University,"Chu, RW (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Management, Guoshun Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",rongweic@fudan.edu.cn,,,"Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation at the University of Nevada, Reno; National Social Science Foundation of China [13CSH071]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [15ZS003]","Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation at the University of Nevada, Reno; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission)","James M.

Furthermore, it analyses how and why actors use plural forms of coordination to support similar transactions. Based on the literature and an exploratory study carried out in the BPC, we propose a framework to analyse how price, volume, quality and resource allocation are coordinated in a transaction. This paper builds on transaction cost economics in two ways. First, it shows that to arrange a transaction, a buyer may set CMs in distinct positions within the market-hierarchy continuum. Second, it shows that actors use plural CMs with different counterparties in similar transactions. We found four explanations for plural governance: market fluctuations, bargaining power of suppliers, stricter coordination and quality, and the exchange context.","[Martins, Franco M.; Trienekens, Jacques; Omta, Onno] Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Dept, Management Studies Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [Martins, Franco M.] Brazilian Res Agr Corp EMBRAPA, BR 153,Km 110 POB 21, BR-89715899 Concordia, SC, Brazil",Wageningen University & Research,"Martins, FM (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Social Sci Dept, Management Studies Grp, Hollandseweg 1, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.;Martins, FM (通讯作者)，Brazilian Res Agr Corp EMBRAPA, BR 153,Km 110 POB 21, BR-89715899 Concordia, SC, Brazil.",franco.martins@embrapa.br,"trienekens, jacques/JFA-0126-2023",,,,,,39,15,17,2,11,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

CVaR is a risk measure, the expected loss exceeding Value-at-Risk and is also known as Mean Excess, Mean Shortfall, or Tail VaR. The link between credit risk and the current financial crisis accentuates the importance of measuring and predicting extreme credit risk. Conditional Value at Risk has become an increasingly popular method for measurement and optimization of extreme market risk. The use of model can regulate all positions in a portfolio of financial instruments in order to minimize CVaR subject to trading and return constraints at the same time. The credit risk distribution is created by Monte Carlo simulations and the optimization problem is solved effectively by linear programming. We apply these CVaR techniques to the optimization of credit risk on portfolio of selected bonds.","[Misankova, Maria; Spuchlakova, Erika] Univ ZIlina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Misankova, M (通讯作者)，Univ ZIlina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",maria.misankova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kovacova, Maria/O-8095-2015; Kovalova, Erika/O-8625-2015","Kovalova, Erika/0000-0002-3635-4332",[VEGA 1/0656/14],,The contribution is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0656/14- Research of Possibilities of Credit Default Models Application in Conditions of the SR as a Tool for Objective Quantification of Businesses Credit Risks.,,18,1,1,5,7,"SCIENCEPARK SCI, ORGANIZATION & COUNSELING LTD",KYRENIA,"13 SUBAT ST, NO 17, KYRENIA, 99030, CYPRUS",2547-8818,,,N TR ISS P HUM SOC S,,,2017,,,,,,,146,152,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BM4PU,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000463801800018,0

Specifically, this work focuses on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), given their relevance at the international level, for their contribution to GDP and employment creation. Particularly, because of their smaller size and low possession of tangible resources, they are vulnerable to the risks of the economic cycle. This forces them to develop capabilities to cope with these challenges and ensures their survival in the long term. In this sense, the development of an adaptive dynamic capability constitutes one of the alternatives to achieve this. Given that these capabilities are located within the intangible assets of the organization, this work proposes, their combination as variables of the Intellectus Model components in which are integrated to achieve the required organizational dynamization. Based on a review of the literature of the dynamic capabilities and intellectual capital approach, this research proposes the variables of the main components of intellectual related with adaptive capability of organization. This results in a model adapted to the specific conditions of the Colombian SMEs, allowing its dynamization and adaptation to highly changing environments.","[Murcia-Rivera, Cecilia] Univ EAFIT, Colciencias, Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia; [Bueno-Campos, Eduardo] Asociac Espanola Contabilidad & Adm Empresas AECA, Madrid, Spain; [Bueno-Campos, Eduardo] UDIMA, Madrid, Spain",Universidad EAFIT,"Murcia-Rivera, C (通讯作者)，Univ EAFIT, Colciencias, Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia.",cmurcia@eafit.edu.co; eduardojavier.bueno@udima.es,"Rivera, Cecilia Murcia/U-4419-2019","Murcia Rivera, Cecilia/0000-0002-5163-4754; Bueno Campos, Eduardo/0000-0002-9328-2734",,,,,42,1,1,0,1,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-911218-31-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2017,,,,,,,379,385,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI0KF,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000404891000046,0

The study utilises cross-sectional farm household level data collected from a randomly selected sample of 413 households. Results support the notion that self-selection occurs and that estimates that do not consider selection-bias would be biased. Different determinants are found to be significant in explaining the tea yields for adopters and non-adopters.

This research begins by identifying additional funding for working capital and investment purposes. The second stage identifies the driving forces and constraints of the business. The third stage is a business feasibility study and the design of funding schemes from formal financial institutions. The data were collected in Sidenreng Rappang and Pinrang districts on 60 sample farmers which were then proportionally allocated ie 30 samples for each district. The results showed that the age of respondent farmers in the study area is in the range 25 - 55 years and over. Most of the breeders are still at a productive age (25 - 55 years old), which is 55 farmers (91.66%) while the remaining 5 (8.33%) are over 55 years old. The age composition of respondent farmers, most of the productive age is a positive opportunity because productive age farmers have stronger and more open physical capabilities in accepting new innovations related to the livestock business development practices they manage. Similarly, in managing funds obtained from bank financial institutions. Some of the driving factors for livestock business development are land availability, production capability, government support, market growth, experience, and economic motivation. The inhibiting factors include price fluctuations, death risk, capital, farmer behavior and non-financial finance support.

Design/methodology/approach - Using Hofstede's (1980) cultural indices, the authors employ hierarchical linear modeling to examine the impact of economic growth (emerging markets), country, and culture on real earnings management (REM) for a sample of firms from 31 countries. Findings - The results reveal a negative association between REM and Hofstede's (1980) measures of individualism, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance, but a positive association with power distance. These results hold even after controlling for discretionary accruals. The results further reveal that measures of investor protection are subsumed by culture. Research limitations/implications - The findings are limited by the use of Hofstede's (1980) data. There is, however, a significant body of research that continues to rely on and support the use of Hofstede's model. Practical implications - The results should be of significant importance to investors who should consider cultural characteristics when assessing firm reported performance, and should prompt auditors and regulators to apply greater scrutiny to the financial reports in cultures characterized by high levels of power distance, especially given the apparent tradeoffs between accruals and REM. Social implications - The results reveal that status as an emerging market does not influence managers' use of REM, and that the strength of a country's investor protection mechanisms are subsumed by culture. Similarly, accounting systems (e.g. International Financial Reporting Standards), by themselves, do not bring about a convergence of managerial behavior. Rather, investors should consider culture when making decisions regarding capital allocation. Originality/value - The increasing trend toward economic globalization and accounting harmonization makes the understanding of differences in accounting practices, and the possible impact of national culture on manager's decisions, more important than ever. This research links REM to cultural values and tests for evidence that national culture, values, and structures of investor protection affect REM in the ways they affect managers' attitudes toward the management of earnings through accruals.","[Paredes, Angel Arturo Pacheco; Wheatley, Clark] Florida Int Univ, Sch Accounting, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Wheatley, C (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Sch Accounting, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",wheatley@fiu.edu,"Wheatley, Clark/AAS-6001-2021","Wheatley, Clark/0000-0003-1462-2946",,,,,45,31,33,1,34,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1746-8809,1746-8817,,INT J EMERG MARK,Int.

The aim of the paper is to assess how local inhabitants in the Czech Republic perceive the presence of BGS near their homes. We held quantitative survey that examined how pros and cons of the BGS are perceived by local inhabitants (on a scale from not perceived as very important positive - 1 point to perceived as very important positive - 4 points and from not perceive as negative at all - 1 point to fully perceive it as negative - 4 points). How often the negatives bother them (a scale from never - 1 point to permanently/daily - 5 points). The evaluation of the results was based on methods of descriptive statistics. For each positive or negative is calculated an average mark. We can conclude that the position of the local inhabitants towards the presence of the agricultural BGS can be characterized as neutral, as they do not perceive much advantages or disadvantages of the BGS. They acknowledge that BGS can have certain environmental benefits, but do not consider them strongly important. Mainly local inhabitants notice odour from the transportation of input/output materials or from operation of BGS. However, both drawbacks can be minimized by compliance with prescribed procedures. Hence, the social impact of the diversification measure of RDP on well-being of local inhabitants in the Czech Republic is not that significant. However, for example in Germany, consumers are willing to pay higher prices for renewable heating as they acknowledge features such as extra climate protection or the use of waste as a biogas substrate.","[Pechrova, Marie] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Pechrová, M (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Manesova 1453-75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic.",pechrova.marie@uzei.cz,"Pechrová, Marie Šimpachová/X-8982-2018",,IAEI [4107/2017]; [19/2017],IAEI;,"The paper was supported from the Thematic task no. 19/2017, IAEI no. 4107/2017.",,13,1,1,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2787-0,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2017,,,,,,,280,286,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BJ1CL,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000417392400037,0

A bank can improve its capital and liquidity ratios by lowering risk-weighted assets (assets structure channel), but with the negative impact on the interest profit (profitability channel). We therefore aim to test the functionality of these two channels in relation to capital and liquidity positions in the Czech banking sector. We document the effect of the assets structure channel in case of liquidity and capital positions and effect of the profitability channel for the large banks.

Second, although both small and larger farmers use STs, the strongest determinant of use of an ST is the interaction between having non-farm employment (thus, demand for substitution for own labour on the farm) and having a medium-sized commercial farm (thus, demand for skilled agronomic services). Farmers in mango cluster areas also tend to use STs. Finally, use of STs and participation in modernising markets spur farming intensification through the use of modern inputs.","[Qanti, Sara Ratna] Univ Padjadjaran, Kabupaten Sumedang, Jawa Barat, Indonesia; [Reardon, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Reardon, Thomas] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Iswariyadi, Arief] Indonesian Ctr Agr Socioecon & Policy Studies, Bogor, Indonesia",Universitas Padjadjaran; Michigan State University; University of Adelaide,"Qanti, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Padjadjaran, Kabupaten Sumedang, Jawa Barat, Indonesia.",,,"Iswariyadi, Arief/0009-0003-4733-0859; Qanti, Sara/0000-0003-1019-9140","US Agency for International Development, through the Assets and Market Access Innovation Lab; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), through the Indohort Project at the University of Adelaide","US Agency for International Development, through the Assets and Market Access Innovation Lab(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), through the Indohort Project at the University of Adelaide","The authors are grateful for the support of the US Agency for International Development, through the Assets and Market Access Innovation Lab, and for the support of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), through the Indohort Project at the University of Adelaide.

Authors found the initiative for this research in European rural development strategy for period 2014-2020, which highlighted the efforts to meet the wide range of economic, environmental, and social challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, authors investigate how it is possible to improve wellbeing in Serbian rural area. In the period of creation of paper policy makers faced with growing pressure to do something because many experts and reports confirmed that results of previously adopted policies are far from expected. Authors addressed the special need of improvement current policies and make them more efficient. The methodology used during the paper preparation process is in accordance with those used for similar social scientific research: descriptive, comparative, and content analysis. Financing rural development in the (post) recession period has completely different dimension from those in urban areas. Of course, authors are aware that this issue is very controversial in aspect of economic and social discourse, and therefore used a set of dimensions and indicators describing the condition and extent of rural inequality. Numerous experts highlighted pro poor growth and community based risk reduction policy as the most important issue in the approaching of welfare economy in rural area. The paper suggests a number of entry points for further research that could be uses to better align socio-economic inequalities. The paper shows how rural policy can be refined and targeted to tackle these multi-faceted problems in the most appropriate way for the benefit of rural community.","[Radovic, Vesela] Univ Belgrade, Inst Multidisciplinary Res, Belgrade, Serbia; [Cvijanovic, Drago] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Tourism & Hospitality, Kragujevac, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Kragujevac,"Radovic, V (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Inst Multidisciplinary Res, Belgrade, Serbia.",vesela.radovic@imsi.rs; drago.cvijanovic@kg.ac.rs,,,,,,,25,1,1,1,3,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2017,,,,,,,824,837,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BL7PJ,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000455302900052,0

The methodology of this empirical study, conducted among 629 customers staying at hotels in the city of Seville, is based on structural equation modeling (PLS). The results obtained demonstrate the applicability of the European model to the hotel sector, although not all the relationships from the original model have been proven. The main contributions are derived from a better understanding of the model's components, a variable not studied before having been incorporated: the importance of Corporate Responsibility (CR). Moreover, it means to contribute to the field of research on CR as, despite the growing interest in the subject, the effects of this construct are still poorly understood. (C) 2016 AEDEM.

Following the logic of the anticommons problem, the likelihood of project implementation is hypothesised to be inversely related to the number of government agencies which have the right to permit use. Our findings are consistent with the anticommons problem: a marginal increase in the number of government agencies, each exercising the right to grant permission to the applicant, reduces the likelihood that a proposed project would ultimately receive permission.","[Rodrigo, Chatura] Inst Policy Studies, Colombo, Sri Lanka; [Deaton, Brady] Univ Guelph, Dept Food Agr & Resource Econ, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Rodrigo, Chatura] LIRNEasia, 12 Balcombe Pl, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka",University of Guelph,"Rodrigo, C (通讯作者)，LIRNEasia, 12 Balcombe Pl, Colombo 00800, Sri Lanka.",chatura_rodrigo@yahoo.com,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In this case, customers will not worry to inform their network of friends and family members that their number has changed every time they switch. MNP became effective in Kuwait on June 16, 2013 to increase competitiveness among MSPs. Many past studies focused on reasons that push customers to switch to different technologies, including MSPs and Internet service providers. However, these studies suffer from one main limitation; they lack of rationale and rigor in the research methodology implementations. Accordingly, these studies focused on a subset of factors without providing the rationale for their choice. To fill in this gap, this study investigates the drivers and obstacles that influence the switch of customers to other MSPs in Kuwait using a qualitative study that involves two different samples: Students (86) and non-students (137). This study succeeded to show 16 switching factors that are considered as push or pull customer to switch / stay with their current MSP. It is expected that study results will advance our knowledge to understand this complex process, and orient toward future studies.","[Rouibah, Kamel] Kuwait Univ, Coll Business Adm, Kuwait, Kuwait",Kuwait University,"Rouibah, K (通讯作者)，Kuwait Univ, Coll Business Adm, Kuwait, Kuwait.",,"Rouibah, Kamel/P-3032-2019",,Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science [KFAS 2013-1110-0],Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science(Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)),"This research was funded by Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science, Research Grant KFAS 2013-1110-0",,20,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-405-7,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2017,37.0,,,,,,68,85,,,,,,18,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ9PC,,,,,2024-03-10,WOS:000429699600004,0

In this paper, we explore whether, and to what extent, paying a bribe, giving a gift, or doing a favour for a government official to obtain a document or service influences wellbeing. In addition, we test whether being at the receiving end of corrupt practices affects the individual's wellbeing. We find that experienced corruption undermines individual wellbeing for both bribe victims and recipients.","[Sulemana, Iddisah] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Sch Business, POB AH 50, Achimota, Accra, Ghana; [Iddrisu, Abdul Malik] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Kyoore, Jude E.] Univ Missouri, Dept Educ Leadership & Policy Anal, Columbia, MO USA",University of Ghana; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Sulemana, I (通讯作者)，Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Sch Business, POB AH 50, Achimota, Accra, Ghana.",is6d9@mail.missouri.edu,,,,,,,76,32,34,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.
